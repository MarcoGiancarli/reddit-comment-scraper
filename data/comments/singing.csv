When you listen to people demonstrating it on YouTube or whatever, these are people who have been practicing it for years, so don't worry if you can't quite produce the same sounds as them yet.  [Edit] And by the way, your singing sounds really good - With a bit more refinement and a better mic and/or room that would sound great!"
singing,3e6oaq,LordNode,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:37:44 2015 UTC,"Oh so that bridge part ""The pain of it all"" etc etc. was done in my PURE HEAD VOICE? Or would you call that a mixed voice?  Also I understand that people with those awesome voices have been practicing for years and with singing you gotta be patient and I get that too - but any idea what specifically is lacking in my head/mixed voice at the moment? What makes it sound so...for lack of a better word, ""shrill""(?) or ""weak""(?) as it as at the moment?  In fact, a better idea would be to ask, how would you describe that part of my voice as it is right now? I like to see what word people would use to describe this kind of tone.   For me it lacks the ""manly"", ""full"" character of my chest voice and that's my unhappiness about it haha."
singing,3e6njb,Pyroarcher99,2,Wed Jul 22 10:50:30 2015 UTC,"F2-E4 is a common chest voice range for baritones, and it's very similar to my chest voice range in fact. Just know that you can absolutely sing way higher than this without your voice breaking, straining, etc. It just requires good technique, and a lot of practice.  First, understand that when singing there are two main muscles used to change pitch: the thyroarytenoid (TA), which is mainly used for chest voice and vocal fry, and the cricothyroid (CT), which is mainly used for head voice and falsetto.  Now, when you currently sing your low notes you are probably using mostly your TA muscles, and if you try to sing above E4 you're probably doing falsetto, which is basically the opposite, and mostly uses your CT muscles. So the trick to singing past E4 is to make it so that you're using both muscles in balance when you reach this point, and gradually hand off control to your CT muscles.  My favorite exercise to practice this balance is just sirening up and down my range. At first I couldn't do it without breaking, and now I can't really break when doing it at all. However, even if you master sirens it will take a long time until you can translate it to actual singing, because in my case at least my brain kept reverting to my old full chest/TA mode causing me to break. In this situation I find it helps to take the phrases in the song one at a time using a siren, then gradually turn them into words. Good luck!"
singing,3e6njb,LordNode,2,Wed Jul 22 11:25:54 2015 UTC,Learning to access your head voice is the key to expanding your upper range. The crackly tone near the bottom of your range I imagine is vocal fry - it's perfectly normal.

When your teacher gives you an exercise, really go for it. When he/she models for you, don't go for an approximation of the sound, go for an impersonation of the sound. Always go for it."

This is due to the fact you usually hear your own voice through the vibrations of the bones from within as opposed to picking up only the sound waves trough the airspace. On a recording you may sound odd and kind of weird, but that is based on your 'normal' interpretation of what your voice should sound like. Never let your insecurities stop you, singing is always am on-going process and your audience can give you necessary feedback. Focus on exploring and getting outside of that comfort. It takes thousands of failures to get one success sometimes. Singing is no different. Do so within the spectrum of ""healthy"" use of the voice of course."

singing,3e2rfa,ethanjhayward,7,Tue Jul 21 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"The let-down is that the diaphragm is an involuntary muscle. It's a useful image when talking about getting a low inhale and controlling your exhale, but you can't actually control it.   I'm a little concerned when you say you push on every note. A healthy breath for singing should feel like a normal breath--the differences being the size of it, the consistency of its release, and probably how much you pay attention to it.   Best advice I can give you is think of each musical phrase as one long note, and stay connected to a constantly flowing exhale as you sing through that ""one note."""

singing,3e2rfa,keakealani,8,Tue Jul 21 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I think I have a few thoughts here.   One is that breath ""support"" does not mean ""pushing"" the breath. When I was younger, I always thought I wasn't supporting enough and needed to use more air, push it faster, etc. and then I would be surprised that I ran out of breath before the end of the phrase.   No, breath support is really breath control - using your air wisely and efficiently. It's important to sing on the breath with lots of connection, but it actually doesn't require a ton of air, just that it's controlled properly. Don't be tempted to push to get louder.   Another thought is not to get ahead of yourself. I'll admit, I'm a bit of an overachiever. And I really like singing rep that is challenging and difficult. Don't do that, at least not all the time. You can choose one or two stretch pieces, but balance it out with easier music. And just because something is easy musically doesn't mean it can't help you technically. Every piece can help you grow technically as a singer."

singing,3e2rfa,duhPheg,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Actually I've been singing since forever but when I hit the 12-13 years old voice change I got really terrible. From there it can only go uphill. At that point I probably had something like a F2-F4 full range, but the bottom isn't singing it's just me emitting low growls and the couple highest notes completely strained my voice.  The point where I really got a lot better is when I figured out how to access my head voice. By practicing it I got better at making the ""middle of my range"" notes because they're a mix of head and chest voice. So not only did my range skyrocket to a comfortable C-D5, the notes that I struggled to hit before were a lot easier on me.  It's hard to say without knowing how far you are in your own progress, but figuring your head voice is something I'd recommend you try and do early because once you understand what it is and how it feels it will open up the top of your range, adding a lot of notes to it and also making the high notes you struggle with much more comfortable to sing."

You don't really know what you sound like until you hear yourself.  When I first started singing (well... screaming/growling at first tbh, singing came later when the prog elements started stacking up) I had no idea how shitty I sounded.  We recorded a jam session where I sang a few of our pieces and I just sounded AWFUL.  So I started practicing, and recording my vocals more.  Since I'm self taught I just practice along to other band's songs, singing into a half-decent microphone (I use a Sterling Audio ST59) and recording my vocals alongside whatever I'm practicing to.  You can get plenty of people to tell you what to do to improve your voice, but you should rather have a clear idea of what you sound like, and thus what you're capable of, in your own mind.  I know exactly what my voice is capable of because I've practiced to so much disparate music.  My style has gone more towards clean singing than screaming now that I know I actually can sing, I just needed to train myself for it.  I still do the occasional brutal shit but I spend a looot more time singing, with maybe just a touch of heat to make it sound badass and still fit in the prog-metal elements of what my band does.  Took me 4 years of all this to get an overall 2 1/2-ish (on a good day) octave range with decent pitch control, and you bet your ass I use every fucking note I can reach."

When we correct our sound based on what we hear, we are actually making a correction based on a sound that has already happened. Any correction we try and make based on what our own ears are hearing is a correction made too late. Simply we make sound faster than we can hear it.   Singers have to learn to sing based on the  subtle vibratory sensation we feel while singing. Each phrase embodies the character and feel of the first note we sing. It is our mind that thinks new pitches. We don't have to hear where we are going, because we are able to imagine where we want to go.   Simply, the body is poised, open, and alert while the larynx is stabilized, then all that is necessary is to draw on the power of the breath from the core of the body and allow that energy and your imagination of the pitches to do the work. The larynx does not need to be exceptionally mobile to sing high or low pitches. When the breath is coordinated in an open and poised body all the notes will seem much closer to one another than ever before.   Of course. it is a great idea to make a real recording and listen to that after practicing. that will let you know the true sound that's coming out.

singing,3e59rm,tdub90,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:15 2015 UTC,"You're sounding good!  I honestly don't see anything wrong with your tone, for the style, and the transition into chest voice wasn't a distraction as a listener.  But I'll try to answer your question, and there's some terminology we'll have to sort through... Yes, this is falsetto, not head voice!  Head voice is a full, ringing, operatic tone.  Falsetto is when only the very edges of the vocal folds vibrate, creating a small, ""girly"" sound.  Also, by male ""bridge,"" do you mean ""passaggio"" or ""break?""  Have you heard others call it a bridge?  In any case, such a term is usually not used to distinguish between modal and falsetto registers.  To extend falsetto downward, practice slowly sliding from your highest falsetto note downwards without switching into modal voice.  You should hopefully be able to figure out how to manage singing an A3 in falsetto, and smooth over the transition.  You may feel tempted to switch before then, but try sliding to get used to how to bring it lower.  Also, try producing a breathier sound, like a whisper, to avoid adding tone.  However, breathiness is really not proper vocal technique... it's more of an effect to be used occasionally.  And using falsetto as the main register is reserved for only a few ""countertenor"" types.  If you're singing directly into a mic, with only a quiet guitar accompaniment, sure, falsetto sounds fine with any guy, but with anything more demanding, it's simply too weak.  Practice mostly in full chest and head voice!  Sing and perform mostly repertoire for your voice type, unless you want to completely limit yourself to very quiet songs.  I honestly haven't heard many pop songs sung entirely in falsetto... if you feel you can't do it in falsetto, bring the key down and do it in modal voice - even an octave lower.  Make it your own, rather than imitate another singer.  A good cover should always bring something new to a song, and everything you perform should feel comfortable and suited to your voice.  As for diction, your tone should never interfere or inhibit your ability to enunciate.  You should always strive for a feeling of freedom in your mouth.  Diction is performed by lips, tongue, and jaw - none of which create tone.  They simply put your mouth in a different shape to alter your tone.  Focus on putting those things in the proper posture for each vowel/consonant, but without tension, and listen to check that you are enunciating.    I'm guessing that your issue with producing tone is simply adding tension to your jaw and tongue.  Proper diction goes hand in hand with freely produced tone, so both aspects should align as you work on it.  Hope that was helpful.  The record sounded good, overall - your intonation is excellent, which is most important, and your guitar sounds like a solid instrument.  Let me know if you have any other questions, and keep singing!!!"

Anyways, the head voice starts to thin out as you go lower, it can't be extended completley. The thin cords can only vibrate so much. If your passaggio is at Bb3 or B3 like most baritones, that A's not gonna be in head voice, but more just a like  chest(even lower voices don't get much lower in head voice). You can incorporate some heady sounds, you can sing soft and breathy, but it's not going to sound exactly like head voice because it isn't. Although if you have a breathy tone, you continue this falsetto esque sound down through the and still sound sweet and gentle and blend that through your whole range, just you know, approach as a brathy chest voice, not a head voice, and I'll think you see how they connect."

It can be found by singing with a sharp, 'crying' tone that will allow you to bridge from your chest voice into the higher register. And it's not falsetto masked in a way to sound like full voice - it is full voice (it's connected to the chest voice without a break), the only anatomical difference between head voice and chest voice being that as you go higher into head voice, the vocal cords become thinner.  There is also a way to distort your falsetto so that it sounds more powerful (a la Brian Johnson) but I have a feeling that's not what you're referring to in this instance."

Instead, pick a specific passage to get just right. This may be a verse, chorus, or just one line you think sounds cool. Work that passage in detail. . . you will repeat the passage over and over and over, absorbing the lyrics, rhythms, pitches, and dynamics until you know it inside and out. Each time you listen and sing along be sure that (at first) you are listening more than singing. . .listen for details and try to find new details each time. ..  when do they breathe? did they say a word funny? is it in their head voice, chest voice, or some sort of mixture? Are they singing with vibrato or not? are they singing percussively or smooth? Recognizing these details are how you improve more areas of your singing and develop your overall musicianship.  . . but as you're doing this, keep the selection small. There are TONS of details in every word, and if you can nail the first phrase, the rest will fall into place. Remember, you're not just learning a song; you're utilizing a song to build your technical skills so that you can learn more songs.  Singing in Tune.  This is all about listening and breathing. Make sure you have a pitch reference like a piano, guitar, or recording. Even professional a cappella groups use pitch pipes to make sure they know what note they're starting from. Sound is waves moving through the air, and Pitch is the rate at which those waves move. When you sing the same pitch as your reference (guitar, piano, or whatever) it will sound nice and smooth. If you're off a little bit, the sound waves literally crash into each other like waves in the ocean, creating a warbly sound. That's called ""dissonance."" Once you recognize that warbly sound, you will have a basis for recognizing if what you're singing is working. When practicing this, keep it VERY simple. One note. Once you feel good, add another. Once you are comfortable with the way one note feels when you sing on pitch, adding more is considerably easier. . . but that first one is what it's all about. Stick to simplicity and nail it. It all builds on top of that.  I hope that's helpful!"

singing,3e1sep,keakealani,3,Wed Jul 22 08:13:14 2015 UTC,"Have you read the FAQ? In particular, I really recommend exercises like these to improve pitch and ear training.   Honestly, though, this is the perils of self-teaching. Because it's sort of a ""blind leading the blind"" situation, you probably aren't able to target specific issues as well, or figure out the best solutions for any problems you encounter. I respect that not everyone has the budget for lessons, but frankly, if you aren't seeking out resources for learning, you shouldn't be surprised when you struggle to learn. And I do believe lessons are more affordable than a lot of people think - taking irregular lessons is better than none at all.   In fact, I hadn't had a lesson in a couple months (I study through my university and we are on summer break) but had one yesterday and it was a significant improvement. Even though I may not be able to have another lesson for several weeks, I still noticed a lot of improvement and benefit. So even taking a couple lessons, weeks apart, can give you a lot of benefit and is not all that expensive in the long run."
singing,3e1sep,Phkn-Pharaoh,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"Hi there, this is also my first post here but I'll give it a whirl :D I don't really ""sing"" (I'm not good by any means and don't really try to) but I'm always working to improve my rather weak voice to get it to sound more clear so I'm not talking in a rather monotone voice all day. I've learned a LOT from ""Mark Baxter"" on youtube. Specifically I've learned that this stuff takes patience, time, and it's very easy to get ahead of yourself and ask too much of your voice especially when first starting out. He recommends ""untraining"" your voice because over time we get so used to ""compensating"" and are unaware of certain behaviors that could be holding you back in someway. Also his analogies are amazing. I'd recommend the whole video but what he says around 0:50 might pertain to you. GOOD LUCK and happy singing!  Edit: I used to think it was only for professionals but I also can't tell you how important warm ups are, and even a pre warmup routine goes a very long way. This especially helps me improve my voice as my neck tends to be very stiff and is the causal of most of my breathiness in my voice which hinders that nice clear sound that we all strive for. When I'm 'singing' along to things making use of my voice and just overall trying to maintain it, I find that if I don't do these things, I can't hit those pitches perfectly but if I do those warm ups it's almost as if the pitches are coming all by themselves and it's effortless. Took me a while to find all this out (especially when I'm not an avid singer like most in this sub) but it really works for me and I just want to share it with people :D"

singing,3e17hf,muhriah,6,Tue Jul 21 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, holy crap, that sounds like pretty serious vocal damage, from what you describe. I rarely say this, but I don't think a voice teacher would help - what you really need is a competent doctor, ASAP! I would really recommend trying another ENT and insisting that you get scoped (basically they shove a camera down your throat and take pictures of the vocal folds to evaluate damage). If they tell you they think it's allergies, tell them ""I don't care, I just want to get scoped to be sure"".   Also, be sure to tell them you're a singer (or at least want to be a singer). A lot of doctors will let a higher amount of damage go for non-singers if it doesn't really affect their speaking voice and stuff, but they'll understand if you want to be checked out more thoroughly because it can affect your singing voice.   I would also recommend asking local singers/voice teachers for specific recommendations on a doctor who works with singers. If you're in a larger city there are probably one or two that are used by the professional singers in the area. If at all possible, go to that doctor. Not all ENTs/Laryngologists are familiar with the unique demands of singing.   Also, DO NOT sing on a damaged voice. Ideally, I would really say to completely cut off any form of voice use (singing, speaking, whispering, humming), but that's pretty unrealistic so do your best. It should NOT be painful and fatiguing to speak or sing for a short period of time. It sounds like you have a lot of risk factors for serious vocal damage, and I think your best bet for recovery is to try your best not to exacerbate it.   Along these lines, I would also recommend seeking a speech therapist or speech pathologist. Especially if you can't see a doctor right away, speech therapy may also be able to help identify and address some of your issues. Unfortunately, it's possible that you may not be able to address your vocal issues by therapy alone, as they sound quite advanced. But speech therapy is extremely effective in a lot of situations so it's really worth a shot. If you can avoid surgery, I think that would be ideal.   I'm really sorry you've gone through all of this. It sounds like an absolute nightmare and I'm so frustrated on your behalf by the poor treatment you've received by your choir teacher, doctor, and others that have ignored/exacerbated your problem. I really hope for the best - it's possible that you may not have as much damage as it sounds, and the voice is surprisingly resilient when you're young so you may have hope for a good recovery. But just... I hope you are able to get the treatment you need and deserve."

If you continuously strain your voice you could end up scarring your vocal chords!"
singing,3e17hf,sleepyrats,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"You need to find an ENT that specializes in singers, other ENTs only care if it's a health problem like thyroid problem, cancer, etc. ... Make sure your ENT has the latest tech for checking your vocal chords. You will need the strobe version of the scope that goes through your mouth and makes a video not just pictures and not the one through your nose (these are imprecise). If you are in California or Utah, I could recommend you some good ones, if not you will need to search for one, good luck and don't keep singing on it until you see that doctor!"
singing,3e4ced,YouuCanSingANYTHING,8,Tue Jul 21 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"So I want to address some of this. First of all, I do find it kind of offensive that after a few days, you think everyone else who's put hours into this sub are ""stupid"" and ""dogmatic"" - I think I can speak for more than a few regulars who feel this is an unfair characterization. I'm not going to apologize for thinking less of you because of that sort of judgmental attitude.   However, I've also followed many of your posts. I've upvoted many and yes, I've downvoted many, too. But since there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding, I'd like to explain why I generally choose to downvote posts.   Per reddiquette and Reddit's rules, I did downvote several posts that appeared to be blogspam/linkspam. I realize this issue has been addressed, but I feel that it's unfair to complain about the downvotes you got, when many of them came about because you broke site and subreddit rules.   I also downvoted, per personal downvote policy (one that is shared by many users, afaik), posts that seemed to derail topics too far from the original purpose/question as well as posts that I did not feel add relevant content to the topic at hand. This is subjective, but I do feel many times there were simple questions being asked, and all of a sudden, multiple 5k+ character comments were bombarding a user who really didn't ask for that much information.   I'm sorry that you spent a lot of time on those comments, but I would encourage you to spend that time elsewhere. Posting a more expanded response on your personal blog is fine, as is starting a new topic to seek feedback or educate other users. But just because you spent your time does not mean you automatically get brownie points. I've spent lots of time on comments here and elsewhere that were not received well and turned out to be a waste of my time. I moved on, and I encourage you to do the same.   Finally, I feel that there is a misunderstanding about content posted here. I can only speak for myself, but as someone who's been frequenting this sub for a while, I think I have a pretty good read on the intentions and mindset of other regular posters.   Very few people here are particularly dogmatic about anything. In fact, easily the most common response given to many questions is ""there is no one correct answer"". Because all of us are experienced singers, teachers, coaches, and other enthusiasts, we actually are quite aware that there are no ""rules"" in singing and that the vast majority of what singing entails is individualized and based on the singer's needs, current progress, and goals.   If there is anything dogmatic in this sub, it is the fact that individualized instruction far surpasses self-teaching through online methods as a means of learning to sing, because those methods are cookie-cutter and impersonal. If there was any negative reaction to some of your posts, I think it was on this ground - many of your posts can be construed to encourage singers to self-teach using these cookie-cutter resources rather than seeking out personalized instruction that can react to their specific needs and goals. If this was not your intent, I would encourage you to reread some of your previous posts and try to understand why your posts sometimes come across this way. And if you disagree that personalized, flexible instruction is important for learning to sing, I would also encourage you to explain that reasoning more clearly in another post.   In addition, I feel there are some concerns about the tone that comes across in your post. I'm the first to admit that tone is conveyed poorly through text and it is prone to misinterpretation. (In fact, that just happened to me). However, if your posts are repeatedly being misinterpreted by many people (which is the only way you can received a significant number of downvotes), I think the common factor is the way your posts are phrased, and again, I think it's unfair to characterize other users as intolerant or dogmatic due to posts that can be easily read as inflammatory or combative.   I don't have any control over how you choose to phrase things in your blog or other websites, but part of the benefit (and drawback) or a forum like reddit is that individual users do have the ability to decide whether they think a post is helpful or unhelpful, through the voting mechanism. With that in mind, you have two options - post however you want, ignoring other people's feelings about your post (and therefore risk them feeling negative about it and downvoting it), or post in a way that responds to the attitudes and feelings of the potential audience. In a way, this is pandering, yes, but it is also how we interact in social situations. Even if you think someone is an ugly hag, social decorum dictates that we don't say that out loud in public. Reddit has rules of social decorum, too. We write posts knowing that their visibility is, to a certain extent, at the mercy of the reader. If you're uncomfortable with that model, there are hundreds of other websites you can go to and discuss singing without that model. But sorry, that's how Reddit works and many of us are here because we like that model.   Finally, I wanted to apologize if I ever did come across as overly inflammatory or offensive. Like you, I'm extremely passionate about singing and vocal pedagogy, and I have also spent a lot of my life building a community here, along with the other users. As you can probably see, I, too, have spent lots of time writing articles and posts to try to help out other users. And like every human, sometimes I have my off days and I let off steam and say something nasty on the internet. We've all done it.   However, I will not apologize for defending my beliefs and communicating information I, to the best of my ability, believe to be accurate and helpful. I do disagree with some of your methods, and that's fine (I've never been in a vocal pedagogy class or seminar where even half the participants agree on any given concept). But I don't think it's my job to convince you or anyone else that I'm not ""stupid"" or ""dogmatic"" or ""angry"". If that's the attitude you're coming in here with, I'm sorry, but I am not going to welcome you. I welcome anyone and everyone who posts here in good faith, but I don't feel that this attitude is good faith, and I'm not okay with this subreddit being bombarded with negativity, much less linkspam. So for my part, yes, I will continue to downvote things that I think do not belong within the culture and attitude we've built up here, and if that's a problem for you, you can take it up with the mods."

singing,3dzomf,OranReilly,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:31 2015 UTC,"So I was actually at my university's practice rooms today, and guess what? 30 air conditioned (which is nice, it's super hot where I live) practice rooms with pianos, and one person (me), until one of the other music majors showed up halfway through my practice session. It's summer break for universities in the US, which means most music majors are home for the summer.   So I don't know if you live near to a university or college with a music department (heck, even a larger high school with a music program), but I would really encourage you to look into this, especially during the summer. I really can't think of a better situation for practicing if it makes you anxious to practice at home.     That being said... yeah, it sucks to practice around relatives/roommates. I don't think it ever feels great to do it. But sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do. There are ways to compromise. First of all, try to be proactive about scheduling your practice sessions. Either figure out a time where most people in your house are out and about, or let them know when you plan to practice so they can either leave, turn on music in their own room, or otherwise occupy themselves. It's possible to make compromises, especially since doing even 30 minutes a day is plenty to make a lot of progress vocally. Most people are willing to watch a show, take a walk, run some errands, etc. for 30 minutes once a day if you give them some warning.   Beyond that, you just kind of have to overcome your mind. Frankly, if you're thinking about how other people might hear you, you're already not using that mental energy on your practice. Focus on what you're trying to accomplish, not who's listening or who's judging you. And realize that you are practicing a skill and a hobby that you love. Would it be any different if you were a runner and someone had to watch you panting up a hill covered in sweat? Or you took up knitting and someone saw all your failed first attempts at socks? Singing is just the same, and yeah, it's not always going to be pretty. But the only way to improve is to work through the not-pretty moments, and sometimes it won't be in a perfectly ideal situation.   Finally, remember that nobody cares as much as you do. I mean it. It sounds a little harsh, but seriously, most of your family/roommates won't remember what you sounded like yesterday or tomorrow. It's not going to permanently scar them for life to hear you sing a wrong note or crack your voice. You care about it, and that's really great. But they don't, and you can't let it get to you."

Three roommates and paper thin walls.  What I think is important is this. Never judge yourself while your singing. Singers need to be completely concentrated in the present. The only way we can perform is through our impulse and intention in the moment. We are, at our core story tellers.  If something is distracting us from telling our story, or our imagination of the phrase...  then we get into trouble. Julie Andrews is quoted as saying this   ""I used to have a certain dislike of the audience, not as individual people, but as a giant body who was judging me. Of course, it wasn't really them judging me. It was me judging me. Once I got past that fear, it freed me up, not just when I was performing but in other parts of my life.  In your case, and mine our roommates are functioning as our audiences.  Most certainly not the ideal scenario but it's what we've got. It's important for us as singers to view our opportunity to tell a story as a gift. Even if this is in our practice rooms. By viewing our practice and story telling as a gift we can work to eliminate self judgement.    Of course it's important to talk to your roommates about times you can all agree on as acceptable practice times.

Obviously there's Marvin and Al, as well as a million others but it's honestly going to be hard to do a lot of that with the range you have. I'd suggest working on extending your comfortable range, and if that's not possible, work on your head and mixed voices.

Really listen, not just on your car radio while you think about your to-do list for the day, but sit down and concentrate on what you hear. Listen to a wide variety of artists within the genre and other related genres. Listen to male and female singers. Keep a notebook handy and jot down the things you hear. How would you describe their tone colors/timbre? How are they approaching the notes? How do they pronounce the words. Can you understand them? What are the instrumentalists doing?   The way to learn any style is to immerse yourself in that style and really just know it front and back.

Through out your voice you have to be able to figure out where to support yourself as if your the big bad wolf (usually the lower end of the voice) and a bird, a stereotypical mouse squeaking noise, and even a monkey sound for the higher end of your voice. You also said ""most vowels"" are a problem In Falsetto for you. Try and figure out which kind are easier the closed and sometimes nasily vowels: ""ee"" ""e"" and constonants like ""ng"" or more open vowels like: ""o"" ""oo"" ""ah"" and constanant like ""zzz"". Whichever one, you can modify the vowel shape to make it sound like another one. Sing ""ah"" with a nice open mouth ,  opening by lowering the jaw, and then close it slitchtly while while elongating the shape from side to side to get the ""ee"" I don't have a very deep voice I'm still developing it but depending on the style some ""vocal fry"" wouldn't be too bad. You can look into also you're belting technique and see if your getting that slight falsetto tone in it which means your mixing a bit, this can help strengthen the lower end of falsetto. Speaking purily from experience and and what works for me meaning I am also pretty independent!!! Goodluck! Trial and error is something that can't be avoided but can improve yourself from it.

singing,3dz3m3,Mattpilf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"https://m.soundcloud.com/nilsoskar-1/no-woman-no-cry-in-a-version Here's a quick one. Unfortunately I'm playing guitar to my singing, which makes both worse. Didn't dare to do it at full power because of neighbours and local time ca 11pm.   Edit: I'm not sure about what you mean with the breathing thing."
singing,3dz3m3,keakealani,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the sample.  I like it, sounding good. I believe you may have some success if you work slowly and trying to understand what you are doing along the way.  Notice on this particular song, how you sing the higher notes, for example ""I remember"", and other points. Notice that the vowels you are using shade a bit towards IH and UH, the sound is rounding a bit.  This is one of the paths to go for a higher range, and from this recording probably what is more natural for you. One thing that you can do, is picking the songs you are having issues with the higher range, looking at the specific phrases where the problems appear, and replacing all vowels with IH and UH, singing it on your LOW range first (one octave bellow), aiming to lose and make all vowels as free and relaxed as you can.  So, lets say that the phrase is I Remember, it becomes, UH rIHmUHmBUH. Uh as in CUP, and IH as in SIT. The tongue should elevate a bit on the back and have its tip behind your lower front teeth. Drop your jaw and let it relax.  After the higher range is more adjusted, then you start to slowly walk back to a more natural articulation, but trying to keep the same freedom and without fighting against the quality.  Breathing is another aspect that is very important, Ive made a series of articles with a sort of step by step, nerdy primer:  http://thesingershub.com/2015/03/support-breathing-part1/  And two videos I made for a more practical approach:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE3Ry_DJuTc  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjxFxW3v6_M  Another aspect that you will need to control well, is forward placement/AP narrowing/twang.  The easiest way for you to find it and control alone is with your index and thumbs finger following your tongue bellow your chin, until you find a small bone. Bellow this bone you will have your Adam's Apple. Encircle your Adam's Apple with your fingers and on the sides you will feel a small gap between your larynx and the bone you found first.  I this picture, its the lateral part of what is described as ""ligamentous attachments to the hyoid bone""  http://www.highlands.edu/academics/divisions/scipe/biology/faculty/harnden/2122/images/larynx.jpg  Once you found it, keep your fingers feeling that area (but not pressing hard!), and do two coordinations, first yawn deeply. Then, quack like a very a annoying duck.  Notice the difference in sound it produces and the sensations you have when doing both.  For the mid high and high range, this space needs to close a bit and you need to get into a bit more annoying voice.  With your jaw and tongue relaxed, proper vowels, breath support and forward placement, your singing will become more free and you will probably have more useful range.  However, it may be very difficult to ballance all these things alone, and thats where a teacher comes in.  Felipe"

singing,3dz3m3,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone loses power as they reach near the bottom fifth of their range. If your lowest not before fry is F# 2, then there's note going to be much power below say probably Bb2 and gradual taper off,  heck it generally stars tapering off before that.  You often need  a microphone to project most of that range.  If you listen to an opera singer,  they tend don't come close to singing their lowest notes. Even a baritone  who sings a G#2 in opera does so with a soft orchestra,  same with a bass when they sing D2 or E2,  and so on.  So a baritone tends to have loud easy notes from say E3- E4, then a more difficult  and but also loud noise upto around an Ab4 or A4 give or take a some.  Below that E 3 or so you can hear q continual drop in power,  and these notes become more difficult  to project. Many baritones can even sing an E2 but it will be much much softer and won't carry.   Also when singing strong low notes,  ironically you don't want really want to sound dark and low.  You want to keep the placement somewhat high so you can be understand,  and the voice sound rich and strong.  Swallowing up the sound reducea a lot you your presence in the sound and makes it sound weaker. Most of what you have for low notes is already there,  you don't really add more oomph to the voice for men."

singing,3dyj7h,Tri_Sara_Tops,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"Male. Relatively new to clean singing as a whole, as well. My goal is to sing stuff like Iron Maiden or Seventh Wonder, if that helps."
singing,3dyj7h,Tri_Sara_Tops,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked is because the term head voice is typically used about the female voice. What we usually call ""head voice"" in a woman is ""falsetto"" for guys. Being familiar with power metal, though, I don't think you would be using much falsetto...but I'm guessing the mix you're talking about is the high shrieks that sound sort of in-between full voice and falsetto. The first step is to focus on your breathing (let me know if you want some specific exercises) and also keeping your throat and neck tension-free. I hear so much tightness/tension in a lot of power metal singers, especially in that high register!    Also, you mention having a lower voice...it's hard for us to assess without hearing you, but if something feels just too high for you, don't force it. It would be ideal if you could take even just a couple of lessons with a teacher to figure out your range.   Getting strong high notes isn't going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time and a lot of practice to get your breathing lined up and to get your body free of bad tension."
singing,3dxpim,H_A_S_T_E,5,Mon Jul 20 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"The basic notion is exactly what you are doing right now. There is good according to your own taste, and the rest. After you notice if its good or not, then the more analytical part comes in and that's the hard one. There is no simple answer, it varies depending on styles, preferences, etc.  Some usual points:   Homogeneity - The quality of your voice should remain constant as you articulate the words of the lyrics and vary pitch and intensity. Too much oscilation is not pleasant to listen to and, it places unnecessary stress in your voice. Clarity - Despite the necessicity for a homogenous quality, the words you are singing must be clear to the listener. If it sounds like you are mumbling it it MAY sound unpleasant (on some styles its ok, but in my opinion its best keep at least some clarity to it anyways); Precision with the musical content: One of the most common problems are attacks that begins bellow the note and ascend in pitch, I know this as ""scooping"", the attacks and phrasing should be precisely what you WANT to do. If you glide from bellow the note up to the pitch, two things will happen: the random lower note you come from will most likely not be part of the harmony and it will make you sound pitchy, and, the repetitive glide will make your whole interpretation sound boring very fast.

Some important things though:  2 - Noise from microphone handling will depend on the mic and how much gain is being used. Most stage microphones have shock mounts for the capsule to avoid noise, and a dynamic gate is also common (cutting the volume when there isnt singing going on).   3 - Depending on the level of training, and how well you choose your repertoire, this may very well become a problem to avoid on the other way around (being too perfect).  6 - Also depends on the level of training. While there is nothing wrong on using the resource and putting the mic away, there are better options. Eventually its not necessary to keep varying mic distance anymore."

singing,3dvmxj,questionsandporn,2,Sun Jul 19 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"You would need classical voice lessons. While her genre is not classical, she utilizes a lot of classical techniques. IMO she over-darkens like a lot of other popular classical-but-not-really-classical singers (Sarah Brightman, Andrea Bocelli), so if you're REALLY shooting for her tone, you'll need to over-extend the space in the back of your mouth by over raising the soft palate."
singing,3dvmxj,ghoti023,0,Sun Jul 19 23:48:39 2015 UTC,"Uhm. Dno how to break this one to ya but the soft palate is an involuntary muscle. It's been shown that many singers who STRONGLY believe they're raising the soft palate aren't actually moving it at all or are only doing so slightly.  Furthermore, soft palate positiong varies significantly from singer to singer, from fach to fach, and from note to note. There is no universal soft palate position so saying ""raise the soft palate"" as a general suggestion is incredibly vague and ineffective.  The ""soft palate lifting"" is less of an actual physical action and more of a sensation SOME people experience. But it's 100% subjective. You could say you raise your soft palate technique is essential to good singing, meanwhile you're not actually lifting it at all. Likewise, someone could say they don't raise their soft palate whatsoever and have it in a high position throughout their range. It's pretty much involuntary!  The voice isn't a series of parts which you can alter individually and freely; it's an entire unit. It's not about lifting the soft palate but by changing the ENTIRE resonance system using ALL of the articulators. Jaw, tongue, lips, etc.  The ""image"" of a lifted soft palate MIGHT help some people. But a more accurate, objective, and universal idea would be to suggest darker vowels.  Instead of singing ""I love you"" as ""AY-e-LAH-VAh-YEW"" sing ""Uh LOu-vEH- Y-Oo.""  This will be represented externally as the lips rounding (pop belters SPREAD) and the jaw going down and back (pop belters place it forward slightly.) The larynx, as a result, will also drop. Tongue position will also change significantly but it's too complex and, again, mostly involuntary so unless the tongue is an obvious issue it's not worth thinking about. The soft palate may or may not raise in combination with the previous articulator changes; it depends. And sensations of this experience will vary from singer to singer.  Personally, I feel as if more of the sound comes out of my mouth when I choose to sing darker vowels. I think this is a fairly common experience but again, you might not experience this. I almost never feel like my soft palate is raising although I'm fairly certain it is."
singing,3dvmxj,UCanSingANYTHING,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is not a fixed position, but a relative one. Just as the larynx must be relatively low (in classical singing), the soft palate must be relatively high, high enough to keep sound waves from resonating too much in the nose and creating a nasal sound. It can't be fully raised at all times without sounding weird, and it has to lower for nasal consonants m, n, and ng.  But I disagree with classifying the soft palate movement as purely involuntary. It can also be voluntary, and there is a way to prove that it is being raised on purpose.   Two sets of muscles above the soft palate raise it when we swallow liquid or food. That, along with the constricting muscles of the upper throat, keep food and liquids from traveling into our nasal passages when we swallow something. We're usually swallowing saliva all day too, so the soft palate is active pretty much all day.   But, like breathing, it's possible to take conscious control of it, and separate it from the full action of swallowing. If, with your tongue low (not touching the roof of your mouth) and your lips closed, you take a nose breath, then raise the soft palate while inhaling through your nose (as if you're just beginning to swallow, or just thinking about swallowing), that nose breath will get cut off by the rising soft palate. If you speak like this, you'll hear a clear difference between it and your regular speech, and you'll start to feel it, as well."

singing,3dw5np,UCanSingANYTHING,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with ghoti023. I've taken lessons at $100/h twice a week from an world-class opera singer (seriously, she has had parts in major operas written FOR her!) who lived down the street. I would bike to her house lol.  But... I would argue that they weren't worth it. Who knows, though.. they may have/turn out to be key elements to my success. But, really, she just wasn't the right teacher for me.  She had lots of cool images and I respected everything she said. But she told me one day ""you follow what I say WAY too accurately."" I was incredibly confused lol. I was lifting the soft palate, I was opening the jaw, I was holding my tongue in the way she said!! I was  following all of the rules!!!!  I was better off when I went back to my old teacher who charged around $45 an hour. He had a decent musical theatre career I believe. But I could TELL he was passionate about teaching; and that he was confident in his ideas. His entire shtick was that singing should feel easy; and that the ""rules"" were merely suggestions. He was an amazing teacher; he did a LOT of unorthodox things with me that really pushed me as a student into thinking about the voice in a whole new way.  Like he told me I needed to take a bath and to hum gently; to feel the sound moving through my entire body in the bathtub. It didn't really help me lol, but it was interesting! During a lesson once, he once had me walk around outside on a beautiful day for about 10 minutes. Showing me how to stand in such a way that ""opened my heart"" to the world. NOT the same as ""lift your chest as if it's held by chains"" which my opera teacher suggested! I liked this idea much better.  I had another teacher who gave me FREE lessons for a few weeks over the summer! He also had a successful musical theatre career. He had some silly ideas... like that the belly needed to be 100% protruded while singing. Never worked for me it just looked like he was fat as fuck. But he taught me how to let go and surrender to the music. Instead of focusing on technique; most of the time he would ask me what the music was about. Ask me how it related to my life. He was more like a psychologist than a teacher, really. But these were some of the most influential ideas I've ever heard!  I had a college professor when I was studying classical guitar who would just OBNOXIOUSLY parrot back the questions I asked him. It was seriously ANNOYING I was like why the fuck am I paying you to act like you're some sort of mystical all knowing guru? But again, super influential in my life. He taught me that I don't need to go outside of myself for every answer; that overthinking was foolish because often times you already knew what you wanted to learn.  In the end I just picked and chose what I liked from all of the teachers I went to. I spent lots of time inbetween teachers just figuring things out for myself too using hand-held recorders. Now I just have a list of ideas that work consistently well for me; my main tenant essentially being ""just shut the fuck up and sing.""  Anyway. The point is that singing lessons can be expensive... but at a certain point you're probably just getting overcharged. I think Robert Lunte charges like $100/h? And his ideas are complete shit. I wouldn't pay him $20.  What I would say, though, is to take lessons with several teachers! If you're taking from someone expensive don't worry about it; you'll move on when you need to. When you begin to stall/get bored with/get annoyed with one.. find another! Don't let money be an object if you're serious!!! I probably racked up over $5k+ in credit card debt getting singing lessons!!! Was it worth it?? Hell if I know!! I think so!!!!   I do know that, now that I'm teaching and understand how ""the process"" works.. that I don't NEED a teacher. I would like one soon! But not right now. You can do VERY well and sometimes BETTER just trusting your own opinions! Get a quality home studio setup for around $300-500 and just use that! Thats my opinion, at least.  I charge between $25-50 depending on the student's financial needs (I act as more of a friend/guide then a professional. The whole professional thing is intimidating and lame.) I'm not that interested in the money I just want to live comfortably and continue learning & performing. The information I have is no different then that of my teachers. I know when something is right and when it's wrong; hell, if you start recording yourself with good equipment YOU can tell if it's right or wrong. I'm very smart, I absorb information like a fucking sponge! I like to think that I give my students $200 worth of value per lesson for those paying $25  When I take lessons now I take them both as a teacher and as a student. What is this teacher's method? How are they trying to mold me? Are they being honest or are they telling me misinformation to guide me somewhere? Are they just plain wrong?? I've found that 99% of the time after about a months worth of lessons and the novelty of that teacher wears off, they just start throwing random ideas at you to see what sticks. When something randomly works they act proud like they did something! haha! ""hmm try lifting the soft palate... no? hmm.. try umm... here put this in your mouth and do it again!... hmm no?... umm.. try imitating a truck backing up in the middle winter!! THATS IT!! YES!!""  Anyway yeah. This post itself is worth like 5 bucks if you take it to heart lol. Not much information like this out there. Your path to mastery is a journey!! Embrace it! Do as one of my teachers said, let your heart lead you! Trust your gut about teachers. If you feel like they're yanking your chain and they're not very good; you're probably right!"

After living expenses (rent/utilities/transport costs etc) and going out once a week $70 was still too expensive :(  For the better part of a year I had this awesome and decently priced violin teacher but they finished studying and moved away a year ago too - And all the other teachers I managed to locate charged around about $70. Rabble rabble rabble.  So I'm moving somewhere cheaper at the end of the year where things are much more reasonably priced. Maybe you could do that? :)
singing,3dw5np,IrateGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:01 2015 UTC,Depends on your market. If it's a great teacher then 70/hr isn't so much. He/she has to make a living and pay off their student loans and have a place to live and a studio and food and... You get the idea.

It's obviously not a hard-and-fast rule, but yes, teachers do have lots of costs and still need to put food on the table and pay rent. $70/hr can initially sound very expensive and intimidating, but if you consider what's going into it, it's not quite as unreasonable."

However, if what you're asking is materials to teach yourself how to sing, I'm afraid you won't find much help here. Most of the users here don't really advocate only self-teaching, as it is dangerous for your voice and can lead to bad habits. In addition, the voice is an extremely complex and unique instrument that can't be taught by ""one-size-fits-all"" methods. Although books and other resources can be a good supplement for your lessons, the mainstay of your learning should be under the guidance of a qualified voice teacher. Here is a great article from the FAQ with tips on finding a good teacher, as well."

If I had the chance I would work with a teacher but I have a lot of other things that I can't just put to the side. Sometimes you can find local vocal seminars or events where teachers are sort of presenting their ""product"" in the form of a demo, like a try it and see if you like it to buy it. There are a lot of different styles and choosing what technique to follow is also very confusing because of the different ways teachers use terminology or don't try to use them at all. Nonetheless I find my voice to have improved a lot without a vocal teacher but I have had to have that extra precaution as to not hurt myself as well even though sometimes teachers are the ones who can be holding you back because they don't want to hurt you or they don't dont have a 100% idea of what they are doing. I have lost my voice 3 times, scary as hell and have learned from it and luckily can still sing. follow the basics and the rest is learned through trial and error. Instead of choosing a technique ,something that I'm not going to do (I'm a rebel!!!), I piece what works for me together. Well good luck!!!! Hope we both do great."

I've read a few pedagogical texts while getting my music education degree and this book is truly gold!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0198790163?vs=1  The other books I recommended if your serious about taking your singing to an extraordinary level are   http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Technique-Approach-Singing-Singers-ebook/dp/B0052UK7QK  http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597563242/?tag=mh0b-20&hvadid=3481781872&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=m&ref=pd_sl_28r3ats0x8_e  If your willing to be patient and work in the range that you are comfortable in for a while, the techniques presented and discussed in this book will absolutely improve your singing.   This book talks about technique from the perspective of a classical singers approach. Regardless of how you modify that technique in the future, it will give you the solid base you need."

singing,3dt7a4,TktsboCardiomyopathy,3,Sun Jul 19 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"Hi there, it's because as you go louder your vocal folds can't resist the increased breath pressure.  They need to become strong at resisting it which is what we call ""breath compression"".    What I recommend you do is train that light transition from chest to head and as you get more warmed up start to delay the point at which you ""transition"" and try to transition later.  You do this by simply going louder.  Working your ""call register"" which is a loud chest voice that resembles calling to someone about 10 feet away.  You need to strengthen that voice.    What you are asking requires a complete training system, you won't solve this with a ""tip"" or a ""trick"".  Building up high ranged full power singing requires many variables that are trained so that the voice ""holds together"".   A good place for you to start is spending 20 minutes transition lightly then spend another 20 minutes where you sing loudly and up to where your chest ""ends"".  This will train both coordinations.  At some point you will need to take that louder sound and learn to thin it out while still staying connected"

singing,3dt7a4,UCanSingANYTHING,-2,Sun Jul 19 09:19:43 2015 UTC,"Because when you sing quietly you can employ almost all head voice throughout your range. Head voice is quiet in the lower pitches.  When you're singing loudly you're using more chest voice because a head voice tone wouldn't sound balance. The higher you bring your chest the more difficult to transition.  That being said, unless you're a female studying opera/musical theatre, why are you practicing this? Is it because someone online said mixed voice is the key to good singing? Cause its not."
singing,3dt7a4,UCanSingANYTHING,2,Sun Jul 19 11:27:44 2015 UTC,I'm practicing it because how else am I supposed to transition between my chest and head to hit my high notes without losing the chesty sound and/or flipping into pure head?
singing,3dt7a4,UCanSingANYTHING,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:33:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people down vote my comments; ignore that.   Alright I'll be brief. Mixed voice doesn't exist. It's impossible to ""mix head and chest."" The high notes you're trying to sing are done EXCLUSIVELY in chest voice.  You can sing in EITHER head voice OR chest voice. There is no inbetween. If you want to get a higher chest voice belt then practice belting in chest voice."
singing,3dt8bx,chao50,2,Sun Jul 19 05:52:21 2015 UTC,"Actually I believe it's quite common for basses and baritones to have much more expansive falsetto ranges than tenors, due to the increased thickness of the vocal cords, and the fact that falsetto only uses the edges of them.

It doesn't mean they sound pretty,  it doesn't mean they are useful,  and it doesn't mean that you have to train your falsetto.  Baritones and Basses naturally have richer and stronger falsetto than tenors,  so it's not unusual.  Of you want to sing like Adam Levine,  or tiny Tim,  or be a counter tenor,  you can,  but I don't think you falsetto range is much of an indicator."

I LOVED his music quite a bit, so naturally, did the ""imitation is the highest form of flattery"" thing. My mom's side of the family is also fairly musical (my grandad got a degree in voice, and actually started the music fraternity at my undergrad). So I never really had a fear that my parents wouldn't support my musical endeavors.  I joined orchestra in the fourth grade, choir in the fifth. I got decently good at both, to the point where I had to choose between one or the other or I wouldn't have enough time in the week for everything I wanted to do. I chose choir, as the choir I was in at the time did tours to Europe, and I actually had friends in choir. The orchestra kids didn't like me so much - so this seemed like a pretty natural thing to do.   In the 8th grade, I did my first musical. I didn't get a lead (and to this day, have not had a lead in any musical/operatic endeavor. One day soon though! SOON.) I fell in love with being on stage and decided I wanted to be in musicals forever.  Well, my awkwardness in personality and size soon put a stop to the dream of being a lead in any musical ever basically (I'm quite tall, and not exactly barbie-thin). My two feet were so left that even socialists wouldn't want to deal with them, so dancing wasn't an option either. I started taking classical singing a bit more seriously. There was a senior in high school who I admired when I was a freshman - she was just so good. Sophomore year I started taking private voice lessons and going to solo/ensemble - and getting high success rates, so I auditioned for music colleges. I was also juggling the idea of going to school for journalism or the sciences, so that wasn't really an easy decision for me, and it almost didn't pay off. I was wait listed 3 times at the university I eventually got my undergraduate degree from, and straight up denied from another. After getting on the wait list a third time, I gave up and signed on the chemistry path - which lasted a whole week, as I then got a call from my then-voice teacher saying I got in to the school of music!

Finally thought we hit the jackpot when I found a few musicians who were good enough to make instrumental music that didn't need a crappy singer, but then that broke up when the guitarist left (I played bass).  Wanted to keep making music so I started another band with the drummer.  Eventually I switched back to guitar, we got another bassist and a guitarist, and now we're a 4 piece.  We start writing songs and pretty early on I decide I want to tell stories with the music.  So I just kinda started singing, with big influences from people like Michael Akerfeldt, Steven Wilson, the guys from Mastodon, Jon Anderson of Yes, and Cedric from Mars Volta... so my style is basically, lots of screaming, lots of super hot vocals, lots of falsetto and hitting the highest notes I can go after, and interspersed quiet, mumbly shoegazy parts with washed out reverb and delay.  Side note, I love guitar harmonies and I've been doing that for years, so the translation from writing guitar harmonies to vocal harmonies was pretty easy.

The trick to staying in tune without a reference is to know how each note relates to each other note, and being able to hear exactly how big each interval is.   A good way to practice is to sing a melody while droning tonic on the piano. You should constantly have that reference to fall back on, and then you can figure out where everything else is in relation to the tonic. As you get better, check pitch less and less frequently until you don't need it at all.   But yes, this is not an easy skill. I consider myself to have pretty good pitch, but I still get off (especially in certain keys - I cannot stay in tune in Eb major to save my life xD). Unless you actually have perfect pitch, you will have to resign yourself to a certain margin of error. But with practice you can definitely improve this skill."

singing,3dp5dw,LGBTLibrarian,3,Sat Jul 18 10:32:10 2015 UTC,"Solo piano and accompaniment piano are two very different things. You shouldn't be jumping all over the piano if you're singing with it.   For example, play octave chords on your left hand, use chord variations very much (7ths, suspended, dimimished, 9th) because they mix with your voice very nicely. You can also use small arpeges on your right hand (refer to Someone Like You for example) or maybe something simple like just alternating between the 5 and the 1.   If you wanna go crazy on the piano, do that in the intro or between verses/choruses. Not while you're singing because you will both mess up the vocals and because the vocals and piano will interfere."
singing,3dp5dw,11999590430420,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if you've been playing piano for that long, you surely know that the fastest, safest, and most efficient way to learn any instrument is by studying with a qualified teacher. Voice is no different - in fact, it's arguably more important because the mechanism involved is more delicate (the entire larynx is around the size of a walnut, which is minuscule compared to the large arm, shoulder, and back muscles that do the heavy lifting in piano) and you can't see or directly interact with most of the internal workings of the voice. So I would very much encourage you to start there - lessons are actually extremely helpful for musicians with other primary instruments, since you're ahead of the game in terms of reading and other skills. My husband, who has a master's degree in piano performance, recently started taking voice lessons to great success.   Beyond that - well, you should probably work on it more or less the same way as with piano. Isolate individual technical concerns, develop strategies to address the technique, and re-apply it to repertoire. In the same way that you might isolate out a tricky passage and adjust the rhythm to build up speed, you can isolate out a single vowel or movement between two pitches and work through it. Contrary to popular belief, singing is not so different from other instruments.   Anyway, it would be helpful to know if you have any more specific questions, but that would be my general advice (besides reading the FAQ and that sort of stuff)."

singing,3dn6j5,Girlprep,7,Fri Jul 17 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of issues involved with this. Sure, you may not have seen someone go from ground zero to a high level, but how many singers have you known throughout that process (e.g., met them before they started learning, and listened to them 10-15 years later after significant training)? Maybe a handful at best? Or if you're only thinking about professionals/famous people, you're talking about the very end of the training, once they already got pretty good. In the scheme of things, that's not an accurate way to judge the general population because it's so selective and not representative.   I'm still fairly young/inexperienced, but I have traced several colleagues and students from ""no training, joined basic choir"" to college or professional level. Still, it's a small sample size, but it says something - people who once struggled to stay on pitch now getting master's degrees in voice. (Of course, there is a bias here, too - singers who really struggled and hated to sing probably never make it to those levels.)   If you ask my older and more experienced teachers, they'll tell you that they've had many students come to them with little/no training and improved substantially over the course of lessons and practice.   And then there is the issue of noticing improvement. In the same way a pro athlete can easily critique someone's for even if they think they're pretty good, a professional or high level singer can likely hear differences most people can't really hear. Thus, for the lay person, Susan Boyle and Renée Fleming sound pretty much identical, although there are differences in their technique that are detectable to professional singers. So on the one hand, this probably means that being an excellent singer according to the tippy-top professionals is unreachable for most people, but it also means that being ""good enough"" to sound like a decent singer for your friends and family is very doable. (It also potentially means that you're judging some singers too harshly.)    All that being said, I think a caveat needs to be made. I really do believe, outside of a few rare physiological/neurological issues, anyone has the potential to be a good singer. Not best in the world, but even a solid mid-range professional. There's nothing very special about causing the vocal folds to vibrate together, opening your mouth to shape the sound, and stringing notes together.   However, it does require somewhat rare qualities: dedication, perseverance, good training, and practice. It's not like you can snap your fingers and be a good singer. You can take lessons from the top teacher in the world, but if you don't practice you will not improve. I think people who fail to become good singers mostly fail because of one of these characteristics. And we can argue about whether they are innate or not, but they are important to learning. Without the strong desire to learn and grow, you probably can't become a great singer (or anything else, for that matter).   It's definitely not easy to be a good singer, and sure, there may be a few people out there that just don't have the resources, or drive, or support structure for it. I mean, I can't deny that right now, especially in the U.S., professional music is still a diversion for the wealthy. It's not impossible, but it is difficult to get ahead if you lack financial or social resources. But I don't think that's a lack of actual potential, just an additional hurdle."

singing,3dn6j5,ghoti023,7,Fri Jul 17 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"Not everyone is built to be the next metropolitan opera star, or the next Mariah Carey - it's true. But that's all because those decisions are based upon a lot of factors beyond technical ability. (A singer's base-tone will be preferential to some people over others, your connections matter, ability to learn quickly and effectively, visual appearance, dancing ability, personality, who is in charge/do they like you etc etc...)  Elvis also never recorded anything from when he was a crummy singer, because recording was an incredibly expensive endeavor. It's not like it is now, where everyone with access to a smart phone or a laptop can make a (obviously not great) recording of themselves.  I was turned down from every university I auditioned to, and failed most voice competitions, and frankly, most of my performances were awful. I had a teacher once tell me that they almost had to leave the room because I was so shrill and so flat at one of my area performances. (real nice thing to say huh?) I couldn't even sing in tune until 2.5 years ago, after studying voice for over 10 years.  I'm going to grad school this fall on a full ride scholarship and a TA position because I've turned it around. Your limits are where you set them, and how flexible you are with the instrument you're given. I will - for example - never be a phenomenal metal/hard rock vocalist. My voice does not lend itself to those genres. If I wanted to go that route, I would find things rather challenging.  This improvement also takes YEARS. Multiple, frequently double digit, YEARS. It doesn't happen over the time of just high school, or an undergraduate college career. So I mean, how long have you been looking for people who went from shitty to awesome?   Improvement is always an option. There is always room to improve.  How much and in what direction you improve is all up to you.   I hate this ""well, I can only go so far"" attitude. The attitude is usually what hinders you more than anything else. It doesn't mean  there aren't realities you need to face - there will be limitations, (I for one, will never be a light coloratura soprano, or a deep chocolatey contralto. Those things are just not in the cards for me.) but the limitations make it a challenge to see how well you can work around them. Life would be boring if everything were easy. You have to define your own success, and if ""success"" is ""top hit radio star in five years making a million bucks a minute"" yeah - you might find yourself coming up short. But that doesn't mean you're not good. Again - SO MUCH MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE GOES INTO THE MAKING OF A CELEBRITY. Half the time, it's just the luck of the draw, where they met the right person, at the right time, and had also happened to have put a lot of time into their craft, so they got picked up."

""Good"" is extremely subjective, and here's a perfect opportunity to note that. Even if you think it was an exceptional child star, I'm sure that singer still has much to learn.   Not to mention this gets into the whole other issue of people mistakenly thinking that some overdarkening little kid actually sounds ""good"". In general, it's possible for children to imitate adult voices and generally make sounds a lay audience can't distinguish from actual good singing, but it's far from it - it's often extremely unhealthily produced and lacks depth or maturity (duh). That's not to say it's not still impressive for a kid to do it, but it's not ""good"", in my opinion - it's just a party trip with dubiously abusive effects."

I've looked around for examples of someone bad becoming brilliant and i can't find it. I think the most we can hope for is to train our voices to be free and sincere. You can definitely learn to hit the right notes at the right time, but whether or not you can learn to make the hair on the back of someones neck stand up is another question. I'm not sure you can.  When someone is really really bad at singing it's usually because they're trying to sound a certain way or because they're putting all these things in their voice that makes them sound terrible. I think practice for me is slowly removing all the stuff that makes a voice sound bad, not adding shit that makes it sound good. So it's like an excavation. You're finding your voice not making one. Maybe i'll finish finding my voice and find out it wasn't really worth finding. Who knows"

singing,3dn6j5,FelipeVoxCarvalho,2,Sat Jul 18 08:11:11 2015 UTC,"I started from ground zero and I train many singers who start there.  There are many vocal coaches who never give these types of people a chance ""if you can't match pitches then I can't train you"".  I started practically tone deaf and it's a passion of mine to teach people who start from that place also and see them overcome it.  You can read about my journey here  What counts most is the drive and the knowledge on how to overcome your struggles.  I also teach incredibly talented singers and have seen some of them completely throw in the towel and yet I'm also seeing guys who seemingly have ""nothing"" and they have the most powerful drive ever.   That drive is what will carry you to success because if you can keep that drive alive it will make you seek out the answers to overcome your obstacles.   Can anyone become the next Freddy Mercury or Whitney Houston or Brian McKnight?  Maybe or maybe not, who knows. More importantly, why do you have to be as good?  There are thousands of musicians who aren't at that level but are enjoying an incredible career.    Can you become DAMN GOOD at your craft, enough to leave behind a legacy?  YES.  But the question is not what CAN you do, the question is what WILL you do.  Too many times I see posts such as yours where singers seem to fixate on everyone else except themselves.  ""what about this singer that singer"" hang on...that doesn't matter...what about YOU.  Who cares if such and such started with talent and was good or not, what's that got to do with you?  By the way did you know that Michael Jackson practiced over 4 hours everyday when he was a kid, worked 20 something hours in the studio on Thriller and slept under the mixing desk, stayed back after hours to watch greats like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye when he was a child to learn what the ""standard"" was.  Forging a star is not accidental.  It is created.  It is honed.  Sometimes people are ""born with it"" but not always.  If you were to hang around rich successful people every day, their habits, traits, standards and mentality would rub off on you.  Likewise if you were to hang out with exceptional musicians day in an day out, you would soon see what was acceptable and what wasn't and they would rub off on you.  This is one of the reasons singers get better when they are taught by a capable teacher.  It's not just because of vocal technique, it's also the ear and mindset.  They learn what they need to pay attention to and they learn when something is good and when something isn't.  As I said, I've seen plenty of talented singers throw in the towel.  it's not about what they CAN do it's about what they WILL do.  I showed them all the things they needed to do not just vocal technique but composing songs, producing recording etc but they couldn't get themselves to get off their butt and actually TAKE ACTION.  TAKING ACTION is the utmost key to be successful in life.  I have achieved multiple dream jobs and see it as merely a formula now.  There is a formula to success, and it is paying attention to your daily rituals.  Your daily habits every day add up to creating the person you will be in the future.  You must learn to take control of your mind, body and spirit literally. Your thoughts can literally sabotage you or empower you.  Your thoughts become your actions down the line, they influence everything you do.  Even food - it affects your emotions, mood and ultimately thoughts which affects your actions.  I know these things because I overcame so many health challenges over the last 10 years I have complete contrast to be able to see, feel and know the difference.  I see singing as a path to self mastery because in order for me to hone my craft and artistry I have to expose my flaws and overcome them.  I have to defeat laziness, I Have to leran how to communicate with my audience better I have to learn how to stay in physical shape so that I can stay on point and I have to be able to be a positive influence on the singers I teach and people who listen to my music.  The question is not can you do it, but WILL you do it??"

Don't worry about that right now.   Any advice on loosening up the neck/larynx and increasing range?   For loosening neck/larynx: you can gently massage down both of your sternocleidomastoids (google image search it) to relax the neck. Also make sure your neck doesn't jut forward--you can sing easy scales while lying in the Alexander Technique ""semi supine"" position (google or youtube it for better explanations than I can give). These will both help keep the neck from gripping the larynx.  For increasing range, don't worry about it right now. Worry about singing the middle or ""easy"" notes with more freedom than ever before, and the upper range will come in.   Good exercises for a teenage voice that is still settling?   Most all good vocal exercises will be good for you. Try checking samples of ""Securing Baritone, Bass-Baritone, and Bass Voices"" or ""The Structure of Singing"" in Google Books. (Find at a library if you can.)   Any general wisdom from an older male singer who has experienced my issues?   Just keep singing and take the inevitable frustrations in stride.

I sang in multiple choirs, and I started taking voice lessons in high school. I didn't feel any progress until my fourth year of college. I toured with choirs to Europe and sang in fancy places like the Cathedral of Notre Dame - because the choir was good as a whole, but I - singularly - was not so much.  Also keep in mind that teenagers are little snots when it comes to things like talent. I was told for an incredibly long time that I should just shut up and that I would never be good. JOKE'S ON THEM. I'm going to grad school for voice this fall on a full tuition scholarship from the university.  Don't give up just because it's not working out right now. If you love to sing, keep at it and you'll get there. High school's rough, for a lot of reasons - but don't let it get you down."
singing,3dm9b6,keakealani,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, I do have a pretty large voice. Like I said before, I've been singing for a while, but ever since I hit puberty, my voice has been harder to control.   Thanks for your help and I wish you all the best for your future!"
singing,3dm9b6,philmoufarrege,3,Fri Jul 17 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I can relate. I am not a particularly large voiced gal (and as /u/ghoti023 points out, that can be a big burden when you're young), but man my voice was wonky when I was a teen.   High school sex ed/physiology classes often ""conveniently"" forget to mention that girls' voices go through changes during puberty. For most people it's not that noticeable (but if you think about it, your voice probably sounds more similar to your mom's now than when you were a little kid), but for singers, it's a BIG change. Those little changes are especially difficult in the middle, when some things have matured and others are still more immature.   So the long and short is, keep up with choirs, keep up with lessons, and don't lose heart. I really didn't start feeling like my solo voice was even remotely okay until I was around 21, and it's still a slow process (I'm now 25).   Also, try to focus less on details and more on the big picture. Even if every note isn't flawless, it's still possible to find good bones in your performance, whether it's good phrasing, diction, dynamic contrast, or whatever. I think it's really important to always come away with one positive thought. It's so easy to criticize yourself but it's harder to think positive. I'm sure you can find something to hold onto."
singing,3dm9b6,Tarantio,2,Sat Jul 18 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"Hi bon7bon2000, While we can talk about how vocal technique might help your situation I would like to instead talk about something else that is equally important:  STYLISTIC DELIVERY.  Honing the actual craft itself of singing, not just developing technique but trying to create and sculpt your unique sound that is tasteful and artistic is a process that not many know how to systematically develop.  Many times the ""s/he is just born with it"" comments you hear can be talking about the actual delivery not the technique itself.  The way you develop your delivery is by studying the singers who influence you and spending years composing and recording your own music.  Singing live is good to develop consistency but recording your own songs take by take phrase by phrase is how you develop the MICRO details in the voice, the nuances.    The way I study this and teach others to study this is by creating a cover of a song you love and trying to recreate authentically the same nuances the original artist is doing.  For example, how loud is s/he singing?  How bright or dark is the tone?  How wide are the vowels?  Is there vibrato?  is it thorughout the note or at the tail end of the note?  Does s/he fade in on notes, or swell in the middle of the note?    Trying to mimic these details is what develops the skills so that you can eventually throw it away and ""just sing"" and you will find your voice has these traits naturally coming in to them as you try to express the music.  This is also how you develop ""singing with emotion"".  You first fake it by copying the inflections other singers use when they ""sing with emotion"" and then eventually it happens naturally after many months of embedding it into your voice.  Now there are dangers to mimicking as well because you can create imbalances in your voice ,so I recommend mimicing the dynamics and inflections and textures more so than trying to literally morph your voice to sound like the originals voice.  Vocal technique most probably also plays a role in your situation however you have not provided any audio recording so all we can do is guess.  I talk more about the pros and cons of imitating singers and developing your own voice here  Stick at it and focus on the solutions not just the problems, you can succeed my friend!!"
singing,3dm2in,thepensivepoet,2,Fri Jul 17 11:02:28 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't be sore for an entire week after performing.  That's bad.  Like... really bad.  Sure, after an especially taxing performance you might be a little bit hoarse for a day or so but something that lingers for multiple days is a pretty major sign that you're doing something very wrong and should reevaluate your technique.  Make sure you're doing a good slow warmup before jumping into activities.  Be conscious of what you're doing with your voice.  Every time you go to shout just consider what's more important - the health of your voice or that one moment of shouting you're about to participate in.  Illnesses/lung infections are always going to mess you up.  Just take it easy, do what your doctor says, and gradually work your way back up to 100%.  Forcing your way from 80% to 100% is a really good way to find yourself back at 50% by the end of the day."

Florence Foster Jenkins got ridiculously famous for being a terrible singer, and yes - she's actually trying in that recording. She really is just that bad.  Other things that make me feel better is that everyone has off days. Consistency is a problem for 99.9999999999% of singers, and is far from unusual. It's the hardest thing to accomplish, and the most sought after skill. Pavarotti even said himself that he had maybe 3 perfect days of singing in all his life, and every single one of those days he was never scheduled to sing a concert. I've had some good days and I've had some bad days, and you just can't let the bad days get you down - it's a part of the process of improving. Learning how to sing and sound good on your bad days is what will make you an invaluable musician - but it's by far not easy.  Do you have a way to check up on your voice in a weekly way? Daily would be better, but weekly is good too. I've found that taking voice lessons every week has really helped keep me on track with consistency - as I have an outside pair of ears that can help me when I'm struggling. Choir has also been invaluable to me, especially in undergrad when it was a daily occurrence, sometimes twice a day. It gave me a structured way to practice daily, to rework things when I have a bad voice day.  You don't let yourself spiral into self hate for eternity when you have a bad hair day - don't do it for a bad voice day either."

Once you reach the chorus at 0.33, suddenly you find the right pitch and it sounds really good. The second verse and falsetto are also good.  Apart from that, I get the impression you need to loosen up more. You seem self-conscious, and that might disappear if you work on improving your tone and presence. Try to cultivate a vocal sound which is attractive. It sounds good now, but could do with more expression and sparkle. That means tweaking the character of your voice in a dozen ways until it does something more than just singing the note, and putting little expressive sounds into every note. You'll know it when you get it, and it will be a very personal thing."
singing,3dkeh5,trunketboi,3,Thu Jul 16 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"Re: shakiness - first figure out whether that's vibrato (not really a problem, it will get more even with time/technique), or some sort of tension/breath issue. High notes sometimes require more ""setting up"" so you might need to think more about support at that moment or change the vowel so you have a bit more space. Also, how are you warming up? Issues at the top may be related to not warming up enough.   Re: recording - hands down, Audacity is your best bet, if for no other reason than that it's free. But really, it's a very solid piece of software for basic recording needs and is compatible with a lot of different formats. You can even do some pretty significant editing, if you have the right plugins.   Re: playing bass & singing - Honestly, this is an incredibly hard skill and it might be unreasonable at the moment. What you really have to do is get to the point with one (or ideally both) instrument where it's completely autopilot - you could brush your teeth, read a book, and chat with a friend while playing/singing (assuming you had enough hands xD). The only way to get to that point is lots of practice and lots of familiarity with your instrument.   For specific tips, practice each thing separately. Then start practicing one thing while doing something really simple in the other instrument (e.g. sing while just playing open strings on bass). Then build up the complexity until you can do both together. Then practice that until you're totally comfortable with it."

singing,3dkeh5,funfsinn14,3,Fri Jul 17 10:06:20 2015 UTC,"I sporadically play bass and sing lead for a three piece band, nothing too big as far as shows go. Shakiness might just be a remnant of some nerves that messes with how you carry yourself. Pay attention to your posture, try and stay loose and comfortable on stage, and remember that the audience wants you to succeed and do good.   As far as learning to sing and play an instrument, bass might be one of the easier ones to develop your skills with. I play/sing on piano, acoustic/elective guitar, and bass. Bass can be the easiest, but you likely have to 'dumb' down some of the bass lines if you want to also sing through them. At least initially, give yourself a lower threshold for the skill level on bass you want to perform and work your way up. Concentrate on THEORY first! It's much easier to know and play through a pattern based on the root notes in a scale during a song+sing, rather than trying to precisely memorize tablature to get a song exactly how it sounds in a recording. You can definitely work your way up to pretty advanced bass performances. There are simply trade-offs you have to make because at least initially you cannot expect yourself to memorize a full song's bass line to perfection while also doing the same for vocals. It's okay to prioritize to make it work. To help with the process, I would check out the techniques of other bass/lead singers such as Jack Bruce of Cream or Geddy Lee of Rush.   I really like playing bass and singing because I feel it gets you to pay attention to the lower root notes that form the core of a song. In turn, I believe it really helps with pitch on vocals. Lastly, for working out the mechanics of timing your bass part and vocal part: start out slow, use a metronome, pay more attention to rhythm and timing your vocals instead of pitch, volume, or tone. Once those pieces fall into place, then concentrate more on the quality of the vocals.  *edit: This is just a personal preference that really helps me, but if it's available to you I would recommend trying a 5 string bass. I find that the extra lower string enables me to pay less attention to what my fret hand is doing as far as placement on the neck. With a four-string you have to move your hand up and down the neck a bit more to reach the notes/tone you want. On a five-string you can keep you hand in, say, the 5 fret position and play up and down that scale to reach mostly everything you need. Also, depending on the song it's significantly handy to have 5 open notes available to you instead of 4 (open as in playing the string open without pressing on a fret). Not to mention it's pretty sick to have much deeper and lower notes available to you on that 5th string."
singing,3dkeh5,MaxwellMrdr,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"To round out the advice about playing while singing, I recommend playing the song with a metronome and focusing on where the singing and bass fall on the same beats. While you ultimately want to be able to do both parts without thinking, this doesn't need to happen right away. The problem I find with learning one part until it's completely subconscious is that you would have to repeat this grueling process for every song you want to learn. On the other hand, if you start by focusing on where both parts fall with relation to the beat, I think you'll reach a passable version of the song much faster. And for future songs, this process will keep getting easier."
singing,3dk76h,adamsvette,4,Thu Jul 16 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"Hi Adam I'm a huge fan of early MEGADETH & METALLICA, met Marty Friedman and learned a lot from him and his process of making music.  I'm going to be putting out a cover of LUCRETIA soon on my YouTube channel.  You're starting in a good place.  When I teach metal singers I always get them starting clean first like you say you can already do.    There is an entire ""phase"" or protocol I get them to train in order to be able to ""lean in"" and add weight to the sound, which first develops power and then eventually leads to distortion and grit in a healthy way.  It's impossible to describe in text here but I will give you an overview of what you need to get good at doing:  In order to convincingly sing this stuff and do it safely, your vocal folds need to become strong enough to RESIST a lot of breath pressure.  This creates what is called breath compression.  THIS is the secret behind powerful singing, belting and distortion.  Excessive breathiness passign through the cords is what can cause vocal harm over time and distance.  The key is RESISTING the breath not blowing it out to achieve your tone.  Developing this is not done through a ""trick"" or ""special exercise"" but simply through very SPECIFIC training.  For example, the vowels themselves need to be ""tuned"" in a particular way in order to develop body connection and good support.  If you want to know what this looks like have a look at this video I recently made  As for teachers who I know can teach this effectively (I have tried ALL the singing vocal courses out there), here are my recommendations:   Ken Tamplin is good Jaime Vendera is good James Lugo is good Seth Riggs Singing for the stars is good and myself...I have my own singing program also   One last tip about distortion...for best results I recommend not ""chasing"" the grit.  Most people want to bite off more than they can chew.  Just take what you can get and accept it.  It seasons over time like a wine.  First thing you're going to do is go ""yay I got some grit but it doesn't sound as big as the original artiist!!"" Accept it for now and don't go further.  Your folds need to strengthen so they can resist more air, if you push further they will blast open and air will rush through which causes hoarseness.  I hope you find this helpful!"

singing,3dkq1s,wj2cho,2,Fri Jul 17 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really subjective, and it also relies a lot on context. ""Heavy"" (or more accurately, ""dramatic"") in an opera context means something different than the way people might describe voices in musical theatre or pop. It's not just what music they're singing, but how they're singing it - it's possible to ""mask"" you vocal weight with amplification or non-operatic technique, but it's generally apparent in opera contexts because of the specific demands on the voice.   I would start by saying that the dramatic -- light continuum is pretty comparable to the size (and makeup) of the orchestra that accompanies it. Not just numbers, but also technique and registration. A super light voice can project over a 50-piece strong section in pizzicato, but not necessarily arco. A dramatic voice is one that carries cleanly even over unmuted brass, a light one probably gets buried beyond winds, strings, and light brass.   As a secondary criterion, I would look toward flexibility (noting that light lyric and dramatic coloratura voices do exist). Light voices tend to be more flexible, but not always; dramatic voices tend to be a bit unwieldy at very fast coloratura, but not always. It's a possible characteristic but not reliable in all cases.   Third, I would look for overtone content/timbre. Light voices tend to be flutier and use more fundamental, while dramatic voices tend to be richer with more overtones. (Obviously all voices are pretty overtone-rich especially with vowel formats so this is a pretty subtle distinction). We can categorize voices on one side of chiaroscuro or the other, but that can get subjective and also relates to the type of resonance the singer is using. So again, it's a useful criterion but not without exception. This is the easiest one to ""mask"" through over darkening/brightening or other things.   What causes this? I really don't know. I'm not aware of any studies that can point to voice type from physiological factors, although maybe someone has done it. I think it may be too subjective to really study."
singing,3dkq1s,keakealani,2,Fri Jul 17 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"Hello. My name is Ghoti023 and I have a young dramatic voice.  I don't know any fully matured light tenors that are unable to sing above a G4. They are considered light baritones in the classical world, and would not be given tenor roles to sing. ""Fully matured"" being the operative term here. If the singer has been taking lessons for 10ish years, and is over the age of 25 and can't sing above a G4, they are not a tenor, no matter how light of a timbre they possess. There are light voiced baritones. They don't get very famous, but they exist.  The level of weight a voice has, has nothing to do with that singer's range. They are two separate pieces of the puzzle. Dramatic Coloratura Sopranos are basically the poster child of this concept (and I hate them with the passion of a thousand suns. It's really not fair.)  Heavier voices also take longer to mature into their full range, as it takes longer for them to get a handle on their voice. A ""heavier"" voice isn't fully matured until the singer's 30s, even for women. As such, in the earlier years, heavier voiced singers tend to sing in the lower and more mid-rangey areas of their voice - essentially singing as baritones and mezzos until their voices develop and the high notes come easier. Sure they can sing scales up and down the full extent of their range, but the high notes aren't performance ready until much later. (I'm a 23 y/o young dramatic soprano. I have a G6, but I'll be damned if anyone is going to hear it in public yet. The highest note I've performed is a D6.)  While I'm not entirely certain as I haven't done thorough research on it, I'm pretty sure that the thickness of the vocal folds helps determine how large a vocal instrument is.   Range also isn't the only thing that goes into determining a voice type. The most important thing to determining fach is actually where it's comfortable for you to sing. So sure, you may be able to sing lower than the guy in the video, but are you comfortable singing down there for all of an eternity? I doubt it."
singing,3dkq1s,ghoti023,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the answer to your question is, it depends.  Most of the time, timbre is a good indicator of range because heavier voices TEND to have lower ranges and lighter voices TEND to have highers ranges. Everyone is different however and a lot of factors come in when you create sound using the intricate instrument that not only your vocal cords, but a lot of parts of your body combined is."
singing,3dkq1s,xarahn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Vocal wieght is a complicated issue, and even more complicated is voice types.  I believe vocal wieght is mostly an issue of how much of your vocal cords are vibrating and often how thick they are. A naturally heavier voice tends to sound darker and richer, although using too much vocal wieght can cause problems in the opposite direction especially in the high end(but that's not that important). Anyways a  voice that sounds dark isn't always heavy and vice versa. More complicated is how the voice sounds when crooning. A microphone and a skilled singer can actually make a voice sound atypically dark and heavy down there.   Take for instance the singer liked to. Is he a bass-baritone or just a baritone who uses that airy and gravelly sound to deep?(especially since he didn't seem to have any sustain low notes below G2, also his voice seems to shift higher than a normal bass baritone, though IDK)  A low voice doesn't need to change like that to sound deep, and many baritones can sound even heftier down there. Like Matt Beringer widley considered just a baritone, who I've never heard anyone say was a Bass-Baritone, sounds heavier and deeper than that guy.  Versus like Thomas Quasthoff, Bing Crosby, Johnny Cash, Andy Bey, and others, I thinks it's a bit questionabale if the korean guy was a bass baritone.  Anyways, yeah vocal wieght is just moderatley coorelated with voice type. Where the voice trasnsitions and where the voice feels most expressable. Some singers are able to carry a lot more wieght in their voice, especially if you don't have to sing like an opera singer, while some artist will choose to sing with a very light voice compared to their voice type.  Event more confusing is some people will sing with wieght, but if they have an overly opened mouth or smile they can sound thin and bright, making darkness and brightness less an indicator of vocal wieght too, but it often gets confused, especially with microphones."
singing,3dkq1s,Mattpilf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"There are a number of factors, not only physiology, but also technique and affinity.  There are different forms to approach the high range, you don´t train a baritone to use his registration in the same form you train a soprano, for example.  And on the mic the singer has much more freedom to darken and brighten the tone, so its not so straight forward as ""hear depth"" = heavy."

Usually when teachers want you to bring music in for your lesson, it's just if there is a specific song you really want to sing. I'm sure your teacher is also prepared to suggest some stuff in your first lesson.   That said, there's a reason the Twenty Four Italian Songs and Arias book is often treated as a beginners' bible of classical singing - it's a really solid collection of songs for beginner and intermediate level singers and a good intro to Italian (don't stress about the language if you're not familiar with Italian - it's usually pretty easy to pick up for English speakers). It's also a pretty inexpensive book so worth getting a copy if you expect to sing from it regularly.   Also, shout out for folk songs. Although not strictly classical, folk songs are a good way for a beginner to start working on classical style singing, with a more familiar melody and, of course, actually being in English. Aaron Copland has several arrangements of American folk tunes, and Benjamin Britten has done a few UK tunes. Along similar lines, gospel/spiritual music can be a good choice if that appeals to you. Check out Moses Hogan or Rollo Dilworth for some popular arrangers.   I don't know as much about jazz, but I think any standard or ballad would be a good place to start."

singing,3dhmdq,mcasks,4,Thu Jul 16 10:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm forty-eight and have been singing for a very long time, so my experience may not be typical. Most of the mechanics are in muscle memory at this point, so my stance, breathing, tonal focus, and diction are pretty much autopilot.  For songs I've sung a brazillion times (The Lord's Prayer, Christmas songs, wedding music) I could make a shopping list while I'm singing. For songs I'm not as prepared for usually I spend the verse I'm singing desperately scraping my aging memory for the next verse. I'll caveat that statement with the anecdote that one time I totally blanked and forgot the words to the National Freakin' Anthem. Rule: Always have the music handy, no matter how well you know the song.  I still get the butterfly feeling when I step up to sing. I usually scan the crowd and make eye contact, smile as warmly as I can.  I will have usually practiced the song delivery enough to know what I'm planning for dynamics and emphasis. During rehearsals I'm usually more free with taking risks like stepping outside the written melody, vocal ornamentation, and performance movements. During the performance I dial that back a touch, but still allow the moment to lead me. Sometimes the crowd response will push me further than I'd otherwise go.  Magic happens when I get spontaneous applause or the crowd mouthing / singing along. I keep eye contact with particularly involved people to encourage the response. Some emotional songs have what I've always referred to as a ""Baptist Ending"", which means a nice forte high note. Selling that note with solid intonation and support can make up for a hundred prior mistakes.  Physically, I allow the lyrics to lead my movements. I generally hold a mic, so the off hand is free to reach, clutch, and point. I swap mic hands to face different parts of the crowd. I try to make eye contact with as many people as I can see.  Selling the song requires allowing my emotions to surface, which is always runs the risk I'll get all verklempt and choke up. If that happens and I'm working with an experienced accompanist, we slow the tempo to allow my throat time to open up, then keep going. Sometimes those emotional moments make a connection because the crowd sees you as involved as they are. Don't fake it, though, because most people have good bullshit detectors and it'll kill the moment entirely.  I don't know if this is what you were looking for, but I'll be happy to clarify if you have any questions."

Hold it hold it hold it don't break don't break don't break and BREATHE!'  That's my mind when I'm on stage. 100% of it.

I think concern with technique should take place when we are preparing and studying the song, not on stage. Makes the performance much more solid and will allow you to have more confidence. The more extreme the material, the more this becomes important.  In my humble opinion, on the whole process, from the training to song study and delivery, your mind should be around one simple concept: its about delivering a pleasant/fun result to your audience.

singing,3dfi31,schniepel89xx,6,Wed Jul 15 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to let you in on a bit of an open secret. I've been singing for around 15 years, lessons for 6 of those, and I'm about to give my junior recital as a vocal performance major at a medium-level university. I've placed in local competitions and won scholarships in voice. And I've never really felt what a passaggio feels like.   WHAT? No, but seriously. I've obviously felt places where I have a hard time balancing my registers, or places that just feel particularly awkward to navigate in a particular song, but I've actually never felt a consistent, specific place that could be defined as a passaggio. I've had teachers I respect tell me where they think they hear it, but I don't really hear it or feel it myself.   Even though yes, passaggi can be very important for some singers, they are only one of many tools to talk about singing, and not everyone feels the same thing (or, apparently, anything at all). We can debate about why some people feel or hear passaggi more than others, but in the end, it doesn't make you a worse singer if it's not a problem you have to worry about. In fact, I think a lot of singers would kill to not worry about their passaggi.   My point is, if you aren't experiencing some really clear symptom of a register break that is preventing you from doing something vocally, it probably doesn't matter exactly where your passaggi are, or if what you're experiencing is, in fact, a passaggio. I would just focus on the actual goal, whether that's blending a more pleasant timbre into that E4/D4 area or mixing more at G4, or something else entirely. Whether this is a symptom of a passaggio or just a regular imbalance in registration isn't all that relevant, imo. Just keep working through your whole voice and it will iron itself out."
singing,3dfi31,keakealani,0,Thu Jul 16 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"I've felt minor passaggios all over the place, but none that were permanent or telling. Bottom line is that they don't prove much, and even then if you simplify it and say ""oh well at this note my modal voice stops being dominant/drops out"" that feeling might be totally different for a higher or lower voice than your own. Pavarotti said he didn't like to go above C5, yet there are other tenors, who likely have some countertenor qualities, who've hit notes above that. It really depends on the voice."
singing,3dfi31,FelipeVoxCarvalho,4,Fri Jul 17 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"Sensations are very individual schniepel. The adjustments are mostly about resonance, and learning to control modal voice from that point on.  I would work first on support coordination to make sure you can deal with the energy necessary (its heavy work even when singing light), in special intercostal expansion, and then proceed slowly to make sure you dont overmodify the vowels or create tensions on the process.  Is your chest voice well adjusted? Legato line and focus defined? Without this it will be very hard to do a solid work.  Something that works well, is to practice varying intensity on your chest voice and keeping tonal consistency/support. The coordination you will have to do from the G4 and above is very similar to what happens when you sing softer on chest voice.  Not trying to discourage you, I would never have controled my voice from that point up without the help of a teacher, it was way too much for me. Maybe its not the same with you, but it may be a very good idea to seek some help, it isnt exactly the easiest thing in the world.  Good Luck!"
singing,3dfi31,lux514,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:39 2015 UTC,"Put your hand on your chest while ascending in range.  While in chest voice, you'll notice vibrations in the chest.  As you ascend through the range, you'll notice the vibrations diminish in the chest.  The moment it begins to diminish is your first break, entering the passaggio, or the mixed range of chest and head voice.  When vibrations in your chest disappear completely, you're completely in head voice, past your second break and above the passaggio.  By the way, pay less attention to roof of mouth/mask/nose.  Aim for an even feeling of vibration throughout the mouth and face.  Don't try to ""place"" the vibration; focus on free release of air, clear vowels, etc.  ""Placement"" is misleading for identifying proper vocal production.  It is likely that for a young, untrained tenor voice, G4 is at or above the second break.  Singing in full voice with good tone beyond that may take additional training.  Or, you might possible be a baritone who reaches the highest extent of his modal range at G4.  That's all I can tell from what you wrote so far, anyway.  Hope that helped.  Keep singing!"
singing,3dfi31,Mattpilf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"Your first and second passaggio  breaks  are supposed  to be a 4 that apart.  It's hard to guess on description  where you second passaggio  is.  I know when I started I'd tense up my neck a bit and raise the larynx to get high and I could get to an E 4, as supposed to now where my passaggio  is D4 and cracks there.  Anyways  when people sing they tend to need to bridge  bit before the passaggio, maybe by a whole below,  especially  since the note before your passaggio  Dan Crack easily.  Your upper passaggio  is supposed  to be the first note that breaks into falsetto,  or the first not that needs to switch gears.  So then your passaggio  ""could be""  G#4, which is a High tenor.  Of course even if your in head voice your voice can break into falsetto and Crack as well.  If you voice doesn't feel like a high tenor,  there a good chance you are describing  the the break and tradition need to reach very high notes.  Maybe a recording can help here.  For reference the average male voice has a first passaggio at say B3 and second at E4  Personally for me,  even after I've warmed up and have a ton of brightness in my voice,  there feels like a a shift in gears need to happen at D4 for me.  If not,  even when I try to sing with little wieght in a bright clean sound,  I might think I'm singing high,  and find out,  in still hovering at C#4 at the top and still close to cracking. Similarly if I'm not warmed up,  notes above G#3 can't access that without shouting.    So for me the A3-C#4 region is where my voice also wants to shout at. In this region  I tend to notice some very  strong resonance in the mouth and hard pallete.  D4 and above the resonance kind of spreads,  some in the back,  some more in the nasal area,  even less in the mouth."

singing,3ddi2u,ghoti023,16,Wed Jul 15 12:32:51 2015 UTC,"Entirely depends on the level of performance.  I've always been karaoke, choir, and campfire ready, even when I was bad. In these settings, no one really expects you to be good, so they're great places for people of all levels to practice performing and getting over nerves.  There are various levels of choir, but you'll find that the director will make the decision for you as to where you fit, so that's always nice, and can take a lot of stress off of you.  There are also various levels of stage readiness. While I'm certain I would do well at a community or small local theatre, I'm not Broadway material. I've been community theatre ready since high school, small local theatre ready for about a year and a half.  If you want to quantify ""performance ready"" as ""happy with your voice,"" I'd say iI've been pleased with my classical voice as it grows for the last three years (out of 14). I still have a lot of growing and a lot of work to do, but it is listenable as a solo instrument. My non-classical voice I've been happy with since my senior year of high school (six years), but that has also continued to improve as I improve, learn, and grow. I mean, I'm never 100% pleased, but that's the fun. There's always something else to work on.  Basically, you're always performance ready.

They're always trying to do something. They may not have accomplished that thing, but you can tell they're trying for it, and that it's a good idea that just needs refinement.

A suggestion to break away from the ""analytical"" mindset is picking a few of the recordings of your favorites singers, and just listening. Dont try point the specific things you like or you dont. Just decide, is it good? Hold into that feel. Listen to another. Is it good? And keep going, listen to quite some songs in this mindset, even stuff that you dont enjoy.   Then listen to your own, is it good? The idea is to reset your thinking from analysis back to your taste. Its also a good idea to use fresh ears, record yourself today and do the exercise tomorrow before you sing anything.  Of course, this will set the bar quite high, but its in my opinion your most solid reference. If you come close to good, that's probably enough already.

I think this isn't really a decision you should make for yourself, because we're always self-critical and there's always room for growth. I would bet even the top professionals sometimes feel that they are not performance ready.   Then again, I agree with others that there is a practical element about the level of expectation. While I was able to sing in a little studio recital in high school, I was definitely not ready for a major audition (in fact I neglected to make college audition recordings exactly because I was too scared to try). While I'm preparing for my first undergraduate recital now, I'm not ready to do YAPs with full roles.   I think that decision should be made with teachers, coaches, and prospective auditioners. If you aren't sure if you're ready for something, first consult your teacher and/or coach. If they give you the go ahead, try it out and see. If you're unsuccessful and there's a way to do so, solicit feedback about why you didn't succeed. Then continue using those elements to shape your goal, moving forward."

singing,3dgjw1,nightwingr,5,Thu Jul 16 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"Who told you to ""sing from the chest""? I really wouldn't start there - although some people do experience sympathetic vibrations in the chest while singing, it's a very subjective experience and not actually based on any sort of physiology. In reality, it's impossible to ""sing from the chest"" - first of all, the chest is mostly made of flesh and guts so it cannot possibly be a good resonating chamber which requires open space. And secondly, the chest is below the vocal mechanism (which resides in the larynx, or voicebox), so nothing that happens at that point in your body can be defined as singing, which requires the vibrations that happen in your vocal folds.   To more broadly answer your question, you really are asking something that takes most people years of lessons, dedication, and practice to accomplish. There simply is no easy answer, as it takes a lot of time to become fully acquainted with your own sensations and way of imagining things (and because so much of the vocal apparatus is internal and lacks direct nerve endings, we are forced to learn a lot about singing through visualization and secondary sensations).   Unfortunately, it's less about exercises and more about technique. Any exercise can both make the problem worse or help to fix the problem, depending on whether or not you're doing it correctly. And there's simply no good way to reliably figure out if you're doing it correctly without having a knowledgeable teacher to guide you, or at least a really good sense of what you're looking for in a recording.   I'm not here to lecture you about how you should get lessons if they don't fit in your budget, but I just want you to know that what you're asking is kind of unrealistic. We just can't give you generic advice that is even remotely on par with what an individualized voice lesson can accomplish. I can suggest reading the FAQ or browsing other threads here, but none of that can really help you deal with your voice and your particular vocal habits."

You haven't misunderstood anything, you're just a beginner (which we all were, at some point). It's just difficult because in today's self-teaching world, there really aren't the kinds of exercises you're looking for, the way it might be possible to teach oneself how to knit or program in python just by watching videos and reading tutorials online, and a lot of people don't really realize that about singing until they really sit and think about it."
singing,3dgjw1,Sparkiano,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:31 2015 UTC,"Lie down on your back. Bend your knees, feet on the floor. Place your arms on the floor like a cactus. Take a slow, deep breath. Your stomach should move towards the ceiling and the lower rib cage should expand. You should also feel your back expanding and pressing slightly into the floor.  When you go to sing/exhale, lift your feet off the floor. You need to find the right position for your knees feet to be elevated...too far away from your torso, and the tension in your core muscles will create strain. But bring the knees in too close to the chest and the abs are no longer engaged.  When you need to breath, put your feet on the floor and relax as you inhale and begin the process over again.   Lying on the floor, your spine is fully supported allowing the muscles in the neck and spine to relax. Placing your hands over your head is an old runner's trick that forces your breathing low into your body (you'll see runners do this at the end of a race). Lifting the knees/feet engages the abs.  This isn't a perfect exercise, and I second that a good teacher is invaluable to guide you in exploring your voice. But it is a good exercise that you can use as a starting point in exploring what's going on. If you aren't getting the results you're looking for, adjust what you're doing or try something else."

In this case, though, I would guess you just happened to hit a bit of a ""perfect storm"" of relaxation/technique - since you were just jamming and not worrying about singing, you might have just set yourself up for that note in a way you can't do intentionally.

singing,3devn5,enjarcher,4,Thu Jul 16 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"No, but seriously, the technique around high notes is concerned with getting rid of the strain. Don't 'reach' for the notes. Try to imagine that as you go higher, the note moves up from your chest through your mouth up to the top of your head. Don't change the position of your larynx or vowels to achieve this. Once mastered, this often enables people to increase their range by half an octave or more."
singing,3devn5,Mattpilf,3,Wed Jul 15 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Upward extensions are very  odd,  especially  if you are young and not well trained (pretty much all males aren't well trained at 20 anyways).  Some days the configuration, and relaxation is right and things go easier.  Other times it just some road block.  A teacher can help access these better on a bad day,  but overall it's still going to fluctuate  a good bit.   I bet tomorrow your voice will behave like most days.   Take note of the sensations you feel,  that way you can replicate it better.  In time things will develop  and change.  Overtime if you don't hurt yourself and try not to feel strained when singing,  you should get the upper end more stable. Granted your voice is changing and what is normal now might not be in a year or two from now,  but it's not like you voice takes a real substantial  shift in a week. Your technique though can change day to day."

singing,3ddeuk,jadenmaster10,3,Wed Jul 15 11:58:50 2015 UTC,"From a classical perspective, this is a bad habit. Your lips have a significant amount of power to shape your vowels, which in turn effect your overall sound. It's not that you sound bad necessarily with your lips to the side, but you'd sound better with them not.  If you're not singing classically (chances are, you aren't) the same concept can still apply, but you can make the decision as to which way you like better. Having your lips move to the side when singing a high note is also a sign of tension, which in some non-classical styles (depending on where the tension is) is not such a bad thing.  Play around with it. Technically, yes. It's a bad habit that you should want to get rid of.

Like /u/ghoti023 says, it's not ideal (and personally, I am trying to get rid of this habit) but it's not gonna kill your voice. There's also the purely aesthetic perspective - if your face gets all screwed up when you sing, it can distract people from your sound, even if you are an amazing singer (see: Cecilia Bartoli). It's up to you to decide if this is an aesthetic deal breaker.   What helps me, by the way, is thinking about the jaw as relaxing open rather than being forced downwards. I think a lot of my lip tension comes in when I try to micromanage my jaw movements, so letting go there helps me deal with extra lip tension. Not sure if that will help you but it's worth a try!"

Your teacher should be there to help you perfect your voice and express what you want to express, how you want to express it. It does sound rather strange the way your teacher's acting - voice placement is such a central element to any style of singing, and if you don't understand it and want to, your teacher should be able to discuss it with you openly. Are you sure there are no other teachers in your area?"
singing,3ddet6,enjarcher,3,Wed Jul 15 12:32:04 2015 UTC,"Weird- belcanto singing uses a lot of head voice, and a lot of what is called ""forward placement"" so it's extremely odd that your voice teacher wouldn't talk to you about those things. I'm glad you've figured something out that works for you to make those high notes easier! I also know some belcanto teachers that use falsetto and pure head voice to help lighten up the sound when a student is pushing too much, or to help with diminuendos or soft tones on high notes - so I'm not quite sure what your teacher is getting at. Sure, it definitely means no belting, but it sounds like your teacher isn't teaching you the things you want to learn. Not that I'm going to immediately jump and say ""YOUR TEACHER IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FIND ANOTHER ONE,"" as I have no idea if your teacher is actually bad, but it does sound like you want to learn things your teacher won't teach you - so it might not be a bad idea to shop around for other teachers in the area that might fit you better. Hard to tell. I'd have to hear you sing a few scales in order to tell you. You can definitely still sing in chest while utilizing ""forward placement."" From a technical standpoint, neither. Physiologically, you can't ""place"" the sound anywhere. It is a method of monitoring sympathetic vibrations to find when your sound is the easiest to make. But I love using placement to help me figure out what I'm doing to make me sound best, (even though it's technically not physiologically possible), but you're definitely singing TO that place, not from it. You should always be singing FROM the breath.    I really want to have fun with my voice and try everything but everything that is not bel-canto is prohibited because it’s unnatural and will damage my voice.   WOAH WOAH OKAY. THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. I'm one of the first people to jump on board with ""Classical singing is best singing"" (to summarize it really bluntly) but saying that anything outside of belcanto will hurt you is just blatantly false. Not only are there other styles of classical singing outside of belcanto, when done correctly, pop/rock/belting/even some screams will not do permanent damage to your voice. Dude - seriously.

About teachers. It's the only teacher in town where I study. I buy monthly ticket to get to my school, so going to my teacher in the same town is ""free"". I'm from small village and I don't have too much money. I can go to the bigger city which is 50 km from my village. There's a jazz singer: https://vimeo.com/113798923 and SLS teachers. I don't know if that jazz singer is still around, I think she moved to the UK but I'll try. If not, I can go to the SLS teacher but I've heard that SLS technique is dangerous so I'm a little bit afraid of that. And unfortunately SLS teacher or that jazz singer... it's quite expensive. And I'm saving my money because after holidays I'm going to that bigger city to meet with an actor. I want to be an actor so I have to prepare for exams. I have only 2 years. And that actor costs too. Because of him I wrote that topic. I felt like there was something wrong with my voice but I didn't know what. He was the one that told me that my voice is too low and too deep (I was talking in the same way as in ""when I listen to my teacher"" file) and I can't act with voice like that because I can't even shout. He said that I have to speak higher. I figured out how to do that in next day ;)   Thanks for that. Instead of singing I was holding myself because ""it will hurt""."
singing,3ddet6,ghoti023,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"I hesitate to say this, but honestly I would consider stopping seeing that teacher. You have a nice, round tone when you sing ""their"" way, but it doesn't sound comfortable. ""Your"" way doesn't sound too terribly comfortable either, but it does sound better. I'd be interested in hearing you sing things in a little higher of a register. Just because you have these super low notes doesn't mean that's where your voice naturally sits. Do you have a recording of your normal speaking voice? It's not that your voice is ""too deep,"" it's that it doesn't sound like it's comfortable for you to sit down there all the time. Basically, it doesn't sound like this teacher is doing you any favors."
singing,3ddet6,enjarcher,2,Fri Jul 17 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"But to answer your specific questions: Placement is all about finding a balance between forwards and backwards. Sing with a placement too far back and you'll be locked in chest voice, forcing you to strain and raise your larynx when go you higher. Sing too far forward, and your tone can become unpleasantly nasally and thin. It sounds like the singing from the top of your head description is helping you get your placement right though. Is the high voice you describe relatively quiet and breathy, or is it loud, clear, and connected to your lower register? If it is the latter, then you are singing in proper head voice and are headed in the right direction. If it is the former, you are in falsetto, which you need to add twang/nasal resonance/forward placement to in order to access head voice. You say you've just turned 18 and experienced a dramatic change in your speaking voice. It's quite possible that your voice is still breaking and this change has nothing to do with your singing lessons. Most voices don't truly settle till the mid twenties. Placement is really just where the sound resonates. Good breath support always entails 'singing from the stomach' so I would suggest that thinking of it as singing TO an area will be more helpful. Try singing a scale or siren that goes through your whole range, and imagine a ball of resonance that starts in your chest and rises as you go higher, eventually reaching the top of your head."

I had to figure how to calm down my abs.   When I said that my voice changed I meant that before singing lessons I sounded normal but when I started lessons I was speaking and singing in that way: https://soundcloud.com/lapwing7/imo-bad  I'll try siren ;)"
singing,3ddet6,keakealani,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"*3) What ""voice placement"" means? It means that I should sing FROM or sing TO that place? *  You realize this is the core of the issue, correct?  Placement means where you will FEEL sensations related to how you are producing your voice. These sensations in their turn, are related to the points in your vocal tract where a constriction happens, and sympathetic vibrations felt on the tissue of your vocal tract.  A great deal of this is related to the position that your tongue is inside your mouth, and, to what is going on on the small space above your vocal folds in the entrance of the larynx.  The sensations of high placement specifically, are directly related to the coordination of the tongue and soft palate. I suggest this experiment to see if it helps you:  Sit down on a chair, let your head hang backwards and drop your jaw, as if you fell asleep while sitting, let the jaw hang open and rotate a bit backwards.  Keeping the jaw in this position, place the tip of your tongue behind the low front teeth, and breath ONLY through your nose, making sure you don´t let your mouth close, keep the jaw loose and the mouth as open as you can. Experiment until you find a way to breath through the nose and keep everything relaxed, notice what the back of the tongue does when you are producing this. Do it in front of a mirror and make sure you do not close your jaw even one bit, and that the tip of your tongue is still behind the low front teeth when producing the nasal flow. This will force you to position your tongue properly.  Then add sound to this nasal flow, also relaxed. Think of singing inside your nose, keep everything relaxed, the movement should be the same as it was when you where just breathing, sing on that flow of air.  While doing this, it should feel easy and relaxed to go higher, you will feel buzzing inside your nose, as if your voice was coming from the nose itself. If you feel a grip/pressure on the larynx/throat when going higher and you break from your full voice, it probably means your jaw or tongue tensed. Go back, and focus on the position of the jaw and the nasal flow of air.  After you find this very nasal position, all you have to do is close the nasal passage a bit, think of drinking through a straw or a ""upper half yawn"", or a goofy voice, etc. Careful to not retract the tongue when you do so. If you manage to do it, this is the NG humming that is often used to help adjusting the higher range, although it is likely it will feel different to the habitual way you articulate NG.  If you feel it helps, practice this coordination for a small amount of time 2 or 3 times a day, like 5 or 10 minutes, until you feel you can easily elevate the back of the tongue and lift the soft palate while not tensing the jaw.  This higher placement is NOT efficient on the lower area of your voice, for the lower notes, the placement should be a bit lower in order to not lose power.  Unfortunately without the help of a teacher, you may find the sensations, but usually wont do much other than relaxing you a bit more. Your teacher should be the one you go for with doubts. If you can't speak with her about singing, perhaps you should ask yourself what is she doing for you...  Good Luck!"
singing,3dc2kc,theeverafterlife,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:41:14 2015 UTC,Do you mean the vocal distortion?
singing,3dc2kc,strongjoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:31:48 2015 UTC,"I think so. I don't really know how to identify the different techniques yet. I've looked up different vids on youtube but nobody sounds quite like him. Is it just vocal strength, the fact that he was an alcoholic or what? I can ""scream"" i guess, I breathe as much air as I can and just yell with as much compression as I can and it doesn't hurt, but I don't think I could finish a 30-minute set-list after. This seems to be the only way it sounds close to his tone. I'm just not sure if I'm going to hurt myself in the future."
singing,3dc2kc,strongjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:04:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm really no expert, but no-one else replied soo...   His distortion sounds quite controlled to me. I don't think he's just yelling with lots of air, you're right that just doing that would kill your voice.  From what I understand, and I can't even do this myself yet so don't hold me to it, you just need to have more air pressure than the compressed gap you've created. It's about the RATIO of air pressure to compression, not sheer amount of air.  Also, the singer has probably built up to this amount of distortion over many years. It would be better to try just adding a little distortion to a clean voice and feel comfortable with that before trying to add more. I'm guessing proper technique should be easy and not strain in any way.  Anyhow, that's my attempt to explain it, take how you will! haha"
singing,3d8g3y,SUKTIM,5,Tue Jul 14 09:11:34 2015 UTC,"It's just high singing with a bit of rasp. A lot of people call this 'belting' but that implies pushing up chest voice, which unless you have a particularly high voice you will not be able to do in that range anyway, not to mention the tiring and potentially damaging effect it has on the voice. To sing powerfully in that range you first need to learn to sing in mixed and head voice. This will allow you to extend your range upwards and enable you to sing many or all of the notes you can currently only hit in falsetto in a powerful full voice. The slight rasp that he uses is a light closure of the false folds  above your vocal cords. The false folds, if you don't know, are there normally there to prevent good from entering the windpipe, but are also used when you cough, growl, or make any sort of otherwise distorted sound. What you want to do is engage these slightly in a controlled manner and without putting too much pressure on your vocal cords. You can try to experience this by making an 'ank' sound like a buzzer, making sure it feels comfortable, then morphing it into a proper vowel. You should not feel like you are using a lot of air or push to do this: it should feel quite easy, and once refined, painless. Once you have achieved this, try and recreate that feeling whilst you are singing those higher notes. Hope I could help - it's quite a lot to explain and quite difficult over text."

If not, feel free to ignore me and move on =).  Hey man! First let me say that what you're wanting to do is totally possible! A lot of people will tell you that what you want to learn is ""bad for you."" It's not. However, what you're asking to learn is an advanced technique. You can do it; but just recognize that there is an increase risk of ""overdoing it"" and it's very easy to do wrong.  That being said, here are two resources.  1. Complete Vocal Technique.  One of CVT's main drawing points is that they teach distortion effects. They are probably the only institution that has done scientific research into how ""proper"" screaming is done. The video I linked is the founder of CVT teaching a masterclass in Europe (I believe.) Really awesome stuff!  They have a book that I LOVE but it's fairly advanced and doesn't offer any form of a substantial guide. It's also very expensive (like $80.) I love the book and highly recommend it, but it isn't necessary. More supplementary than anything. They have a lot of free information on their website; you don't NEED the book.  2. Melissa Cross's The Zen of Screaming.  More of a tutorial on how to scream than a technical guide like CVT.  http://www.amazon.com/The-Zen-Screaming-Vocal-Instruction/dp/0739046500  3. Just PRACTICE  Stop intellectualizing and just do the thing! It doesn't matter how much you KNOW! It's the same as singing anything else. If it hurts or ""tickles,"" you're doing it wrong!   Practice with mid ranged notes and for short periods of time; 5 minutes maybe. You can increase how much you practice when you feel like you're onto something.  If you've found what I've said helpful, I'm available online for free individualized advice. Not trying to sell you anything; just enjoy helping people grow.   I'm controversial on this forum; not everyone thinks you can scream without damaging your voice. I'll probably get argued with for even posting this! I understand where they're coming from, though. I'm posting a complete article I wrote on my blog of my view on ""bad"" singing styles. Keep in mind, my writing style is a bit forceful in order to make a point.  ""You Are DAMAGING Your Voice Singing Pop & Rock Music DEBUNKED""   ""Ever been told there was a singing style you weren’t allowed to sing? Maybe an old, conservative voice teacher told you that you were going to damage your voice belting out your favorite grungey-rock tune. Or maybe you watched some “how to sing” YouTube videos where you were told the way your favorite artists were singing is “wrong.”  The solution? Either to buy more lessons (I’ve spent as much as $100/h with teachers like these) or to buy their CD full of “special” one size fits all exercises! Absolute BULL!!!  There is NO singing secret or special vocal exercise. There are NO “special voice “techniques,” postures, or tricks that need to be SOLD to you. Don’t let yourself get scammed! THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DAMAGING OR “WRONG” VOCAL STYLE OR SOUND!  Have you heard of the 80/20 rule? 80% of outcome can be produced by 20% of the work. In the case of singing, that 20% is effective practicing. And guess what? Learning to practice effectively is FREE.""   Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!  Have fun man!"
singing,3d8g3y,wirwe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:55:24 2015 UTC,For trying it the first time it might help to clear your throat like this 'chrm' voice and singing at the same time. But actually it is not really healthy for a voice especially if not under supervision so I wouldn't do it too often.
singing,3d7ndn,BarneyLovesYou,6,Tue Jul 14 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yes! Ear training is exactly what you need - in particular, focus on learning harmonic dictation (being able to hear a chord progression and write it down). The key to good improvised harmony is to be able to predict the next chord before it happens, and the best way to do that is to begin learning how the voice leading and harmonic language of your chosen genre works (it's different for different styles, so keep that in mind when practicing). Spend some time listening to songs you like, focusing on writing down the harmony (ideally, you would be able to write down each part in music notation... but even just jotting down the chord names is a really good start).   From there, the next step is being able to recall what notes are within the chord, and be able to sing those when you know that chord is coming up. This takes a lot of practice (obviously), but once you ""get it"", it makes a lot of sense. There are usually only 3-4 notes that work with a given chord at any one time (barring ornamentation), so you have to figure out how to narrow it down compared to all the notes of the scale.     On the other hand, yeah, you can work from the technical side, too. I would say a good first start is knowing yourself in terms of your voice's natural qualities and your range. If I would guess, the reason you have an easier time harmonizing higher is because you have a higher voice (soprano or tenor, for example). It's much easier to harmonize with the comfortable part of your voice, so don't try to force yourself to sing outside of your comfort range. If you do want to sing a lower harmony, choose a song with a higher melody (so the lower stuff isn't that low), or transpose to a higher key (up one octave is usually the easiest, for this purpose)."
singing,3d7ndn,keakealani,3,Tue Jul 14 05:11:44 2015 UTC,woah sounds like a lot of work... but I'll try! I've been trying to identify the chords used in a song but not much success so far ): are there any tricks to this? I listen to the bass notes and i try to figure out the chord progression but I'm kinda always wrong. ):
singing,3d7ndn,keakealani,3,Tue Jul 14 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"Haha, it does take practice, but I promise, it's possible! :) Starting with the bass notes is exactly the right step. The next step should probably be outlining the main melody (or at least downbeats if it's a really ornamented song). From there, decide if the chord is major/minor/whatever and try to fill in the rest of the blanks.   It might also help to know the difference between diatonic chords (all the notes are within the key) and chromatic chords (one or more notes are outside of the key). I usually think of them as ""boring"" chords and ""funky"" chords, myself (totally objective criteria), but it helps you to mentally separate them out so you can figure out what notes make up each chord.   Also I realized I mentioned voice leading but forgot to elaborate. In some genres (but unfortunately, not all), there is a standard way some notes ""want"" to lead to the next note. I'll use a classical example because I'm a classical musician, but it works for other styles too. In general, the leading tone (half step below the tonic) ""wants"" to resolve upward to tonic. (Like B -> C in C major). So if you hear a leading tone, you already know where it wants to go, and you can guess at the chord and also sing a note that is very likely to be the right harmony for the next chord. Usually, voice leading relies on stepwise motion (from one letter to the next letter in either direction, e.g., A -> B or F -> E), so if you just sing scales that actually often works (although it gets boring so you'll probably want to spice it up).   Anyway, don't worry about being right 100% of the time. But this is a good way to get some goalposts down and not feel horribly lost with harmony. A lot of it boils down to practice and learning the ""feel"" of harmony. But, I didn't want to post just to tell you to practice and ""feel it more"" because that's not helpful! So hopefully this helps you somewhat :)"

singing,3d7ndn,FelipeVoxCarvalho,2,Tue Jul 14 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"There is a ""trick"" I like to get people started and used to the feel, takes ear training of course, but in a different manner. The first thing is to get used to the interval jumps, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd and a perfect 5th are specially important for pop. Train until you can pick any note, imagine it, and then also imagine how these intervals would sound like based on it.  Then a  melody line, imagine the first note, and jump one of these intevals. Then proceed on intonating the same melody with the interval of choice of difference.  If you can, record yourself singing the main melody, then, do the relative melody with the interval difference while hearing what you recorded. This probably will get in your way on the first attempts, but its also a matter of getting used to ( you need to hear the main melody to keep well synced with it).  Another way to do it is, instead of memorizing how each interval type sounds, to memorize a simple half step sound (a minor second). And just count as many semitones up or down you want.  It may look strange, but once you try to memorize how these sounds are like you will see its quite straight forward. There are some ear training android applications that could help you in this regard."
singing,3d6uza,Throwamay_,3,Mon Jul 13 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Fortunately for you, our FAQ has already addressed part of your question: You Can Sing!  As for the other stuff. Anxiety about singing is normal. It's the only instrument where the sound is 100% created by your own body, which means singing often brings along lots of self-esteem baggage, even for people without anxiety disorders. Don't beat yourself up about that, because it's pretty much always going to be a factor.   But, I can at least talk about what I feel as far as performing on stage.   I'm a pretty introverted person, for the record - I don't do big social gatherings or public speaking. So that's to say, you can be a successful singer (well, at least as successful as I am) without being the most socially graceful person ever.   For me, a big part of confidence on stage is about preparation off stage. Everyone would get nervous doing something they've never done before, on stage or off. But, if you've nailed something tens of times in the practice room, it shouldn't be different on stage. I am always most confident when I know my music, have rehearsed thoroughly with my pianist, and know my staging. Leave as little up to chance as possible and you will be fine.  Part of this is practicing performing, not just practicing your music. Knowing how to take a good bow, or how you'll move on stage, makes a big difference in how comfortable you feel on stage. Remember that singing is a narrative - you're telling some kind of story or conveying some emotion. Just like telling a story to a friend, the details aren't as important as getting the point across. Always figure out what your point is, and focus on that. The rest is gravy.   Another aspect is remembering that we are all our harshest critics. Even my voice teachers usually don't pick up on every mistake I make - most things are too small to be caught by even a very attentive listener. So try not to get caught up in little mistakes, but look at the overall performance as one big unit. You don't need to be perfect - if people wanted to hear perfect they would buy a studio polished recording. The whole point of live music is to experience a unique performance, which includes messing up little things or changing it up on the spot.   Finally, it only gets better the more you do it. Not singing is the only way to guarantee that you won't improve. Take as many opportunities to perform as possible, and use them as practice. You will learn to find your own tricks to deal with nerves and anxiety. (Actually, here's an article that has some of my strategies for performance nerves, if that helps you.)"
singing,3d6uza,keakealani,2,Tue Jul 14 00:22:51 2015 UTC,"I had anxiety AND a huge mental block about singing for the longest time.  I didn't think I could sing, and was really shy about singing in front of anyone.  One day I decided I wanted to sing, and I was tired of letting fear of failure stop me.  So I made myself let go of the outcome.  I decided I would just start singing and not worry about what people were thinking or whether I sounded great.  That was a VERY necessary first step to overcome the anxiety.  Later, I was able to pick up some singing tips, and to figure out a lot on my own.  The rest is just practice.  Now I'm lead singer in two bands, and I don't even think about being scared or self-conscious.  Good luck--you can do it!  It might take a few years to completely overcome the fear, but it is very possible!"
singing,3d6uza,doublevisionary,2,Tue Jul 14 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! To aid in this, I suggest people go out and sing somewhere unfamiliar, that you would never go to again (like an open mic in a venue a town over). That way, no matter what happens, you'll probably never run into any of those people again, and it wouldn't matter what happened. You're right that, at least to start, it's really important to just let go of ""worst-case scenarios"" and just sing. Once you get over that hurdle, it's a lot easier to continue."
singing,3d6uza,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:13:48 2015 UTC,"Start with speaking.  Work your way towards public speaking or reciting poetry - even among friends.  Perhaps even a community play.  No need to take a leap from where you are towards singing.  I bet after simply using your voice more in any way will lead to feeling comfortable singing.  Speak to your therapist about it!  As a voice teacher, I have realized that many students have psychological things holding them back from singing.  So keep up your treatment, and find ways to use your voice!"
singing,3d6uza,lux514,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:07 2015 UTC,I used to be afraid to sing in front of people because I was uncertain how it would sound when I opened my mouth.

Those electrical ones, as chance would have it, are live recordings from her farewell gala at Covent Garden!  Here's the Willow song and Ave Maria from Otello.  Here's ""Donde lieta uscì"" and some of Act III from La bohème.  That is absolutely divine singing from someone who's 65. Listen to the chest voice, the vowel clarity throughout the entire range, the firmness of the pitch, and the strength and evenness of the vibrato. And overall it is a bigger and more penetrating sound than might be expected from a soprano leggiero.  EDIT OH, I forgot there were also electrical studio recordings from around the same time.   ""Dite alla giovine"" with John Brownlee and ""Clair de lune""."

singing,3d7s3e,pm-me-your-schmidts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:27:29 2015 UTC,"Have you read this article yet?   So, every area is a little different in terms of what teachers are available. Some places are very studio-driven, while others are more individual private teachers. It sounds like your area has more studios, which is normal for some areas (particularly high population density cities, where individual space is expensive and competition is high).  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ""assessment"", so it's hard to say if it's normal. What is normal (at least in my experience in a few different US states) is for teachers to give you a free lesson or interview to figure out where you are, before starting lessons. This usually involves things like singing a few scales/exercises with the teacher and maybe bringing in a song you like (even a simple patriotic song or Happy Birthday is usually fine for this kind of thing). They might also ask you some questions about your background, like whether or not you've taken other instruments or sung in a choir before, or what your goals are for voice lessons. This is all for the teacher to get to know you and your voice, and for both of you to start deciding if it's a good fit (sometimes, there are great teachers that just don't work for certain students because their personalities don't match, so it's often more about finding the right teacher).   So anyway, that kind of preliminary evaluation is pretty normal in my experience. It's not high pressure and it's as much for you as it is for the studio/teacher - if you get bad vibes from the studio, you're usually free to say ""thank, but no thanks"" without any additional payment/commitment.   If there's some sort of more serious audition, that's probably abnormal for any place that caters to beginners (obviously). Some higher-end institutions may have auditions because they cater to more advanced students (but honestly, this is mostly in the realm of actual college-level music, not independent studios). Also, in some areas studios are just really selective for competitive reasons or just being elitist. Some studios make their names submitting a lot of students to competitions and stuff, so I guess they would want to screen out students that aren't good for their competitive style. Personally, I think that's kind of BS but it does happen.  I would say to give those studios a call and just ask them what their assessment entails, and make your decision from there.   Also, just because it bears repeating, universities and music schools are a really good starting point for finding teachers. If I recall there's a pretty big university in/near Adelaide - if that's nearby, definitely contact them as they can probably point you in the direction of current/former students or faculty."
singing,3d7s3e,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:22:58 2015 UTC,"Just to add a couple thoughts onto /u/keakealani's article:  The studios may be OK (I don't know those particular ones so I can't say). I would say that in my experience, though, studios are often overpriced for what you get. In a larger city, overhead is significant, so know that if you're going to a nice studio with many different rooms and several instructors, part of your lesson fee is going toward paying for the reception area and any other amenities. (This may not apply to any individual studio, of course.)  Another thing to consider is that since voice teaching is so word-of-mouth based, many of the best teachers do zero marketing in the traditional sense (though there are exceptions of course). This makes seeking out vocalists and asking about their teachers that much more important. A good course of action is to get involved with the local singing community of whatever style, or other people attempting to learn to sing, see whose voices you admire, and ask about their teachers.

singing,3d7s3e,mwb2,2,Tue Jul 14 12:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, studios definitely offer things like convenience that are built into the price. Since studios tend to be the ones with the resources (and business style) to focus on drawing in people through traditional marketing, they're the easiest to find, but not necessarily the best (although there are some ""gem"" studios or individual teachers that work with studios, but YMMV.) In my experience, studios are really hit and miss, and probably best if you know what you're doing (which unfortunately is not actually their target consumer group). Some studios are awesome, have fairly strict hiring policies to ensure consistently good teachers, and have great resources for students, like performance spaces/opportunities, quality instruments/spaces, and ease of payment. Some studios are less selective and hire people with dubious credentials, don't invest in good spaces/instruments, and tack on lots of hidden fees and other shady crap. And everything in between. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be difficult to weed them out before actually committing to some lessons, and I've found that in general studios are less flexible about letting you drop if you decide you're not interested."
singing,3d7lyi,0beatbryce,6,Tue Jul 14 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"You have to sing the same notes if you want it to sound like the same melody, unless you're singing the harmony part.  If the song is too high pitched for you, transpose the entire song down. I don't recommend changing notes randomly within the original key of the song."
singing,3d7lyi,y4my4m,2,Tue Jul 14 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"A ""key"" of a song is the scale it is based around. Generally, songs will stay ""on-key"", i.e. all notes will be on the scale. (For a C Major scale, the notes would be C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.) However, in certain songs, a note might be played that isn't on the scale. This could signify a key change, or it could be an ""accidental"" - a note that doesn't fall on the chosen scale but is played anyway.     To answer your question, singing notes in the same key (but not the same note that is being sung by the artist) will range from ""good"" to ""meh"". This is where you get into intervals and harmony. For instance, singing a G when the artist is singing a C and in the key of C Major would sound pretty good. Singing a D or B would sound less good. This is due to the way the note frequencies interact with each other - closer frequencies/notes tend to ""mash together"" and sound dissonant or grating, even if the notes are up or down an octave.     If you feel like an artist is singing too high/too low for you, there is nothing wrong with dropping/raising the notes by a specific interval. (This has the effect of changing the key, called ""transposing"".) To get the best sound, (especially when singing along to the original track), you should stay transposed to that new key the whole time. If the artist sings, C--->B--->A--->C, and you raise the song by a 5th, you would sing G--->F--->E--->G, for example.     Any other questions, feel free to reply or PM me. :)"
singing,3d7lyi,Fallbourn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:46:48 2015 UTC,That's not what I'm asking. My singing teacher is saying that I can start the song on any note when I sing. Meaning of the original singer starts on C I can start on A# as long as I'm still in the key of song.  For example original is C D C D in the key of C. My teacher is saying I can start on A# and go A# B #A B
singing,3d7lyi,keakealani,4,Tue Jul 14 04:07:17 2015 UTC,"I think what your teacher is trying to tell you is to transpose the song. What that means is singing the same sequence of notes, but moving all of them up or down by the same interval. The melody will sound more or less the same, but higher or lower.   However, be cautious that you cannot use recordings or standard sheet music if you sing in a key other than the one that is recorded/printed. Transposing a song involves both the singer transposing and whatever instrumentals/accompaniment also transposing to the same key. Some websites like musicnotes.com sell sheet music with automatic transposition functions, and some karaoke tracks also have ways to transpose. But just be careful with it, because automatic transposition is prone to error."
singing,3d7lyi,Hammerfist_Pucconi,2,Tue Jul 14 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"That...doesnt make sense. If you're trying to sing the same melody, you have to sing the same notes.

singing,3d7lyi,Hammerfist_Pucconi,2,Tue Jul 14 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're doing the song in the same key, you'll have to start on the same note if you want to sing it like the original singer. I would ask your teacher for further clarification about what he or she means."
singing,3d7lyi,Sparkiano,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:57:20 2015 UTC,"I did ask, she said because I'm still singing notes in the key of C and following the same pattern of whole steps it doesn't matter which note I start on as long as I don't sing a sharp or flat"
singing,3d7lyi,terrycotta,3,Tue Jul 14 05:00:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's just not true. If you sing the same pattern of half or whole steps but start on a different note, you'd be singing in a different key. If you sing the same pattern of notes but adjust the steps to keep all the notes in the key, you have a different melody all together."
singing,3d2819,trunketboi,7,Sun Jul 12 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Here is one article that talks specifically about handling performance nerves. But of course, that's a big part of confidence on stage so I think it's relevant here. I would also say that a big part of confidence comes in the form of skill - if you know your skills are solid, you can be confident that you will sing well. If you don't have strong skills, it's harder (and probably less warranted) to be confident on stage.   Which brings me to your other question. Your friend is completely wrong. First of all, they are suffering from a huge amount of selection bias - we only ever hear the ""successes"" of untrained singers, but never the hundreds, maybe thousands of other people who tried to do the same thing but never became well-known or famous. Using one person as an example is an obvious sign that your friend doesn't know what they're talking about (particularly when it sounds like they also can't come up with any examples of the contrary position).   People who study with good voice teachers and coaches (and btw, it's important to distinguish between a teacher and a coach) don't ""sound like everyone else"" - the primary philosophy in teaching singing right now, across genres and styles, is building strong foundational technique so that each singer's voice is fully utilized and not a cookie-cutter mold. Actually, I think you'd find that more untrained singers sound a lot more alike than trained singers, as most untrained singers nowadays just try to learn to sing by imitating their favorite recordings, rather than actually developing skill in singing.   In addition, quite frankly, you have more control over the quality of your voice when you know what you're doing. If you are not a skillful singer, you probably can't do much to change the timbre of your voice or best use diction to communicate subtle details. A well-trained singer spends a lot of times building those skills so that their voice is flexible and capable of finesse. This actually leads to more opportunities for uniqueness than the random chance that you are capable of some sort of interesting sound as an untrained singer.   Plus, of course, there is the benefit that a good teacher will focus on building healthy and sustainable singing so that you don't thrash your career by singing unhealthily and damaging your voice, as well as the fact that teachers are a really good way to break into the music industry and take advantage of people ""in the know"".   Obviously, it's everyone's individual choice, but especially if we make the assumption that your friend is not a top-rate professional singer, I don't really see much point in taking their ignorant advice."

singing,3d2819,FelipeVoxCarvalho,3,Sun Jul 12 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"The way that I started becoming more confident with my singing was by writing songs. I started probably 5 or 6 years ago and recorded them as rough takes, not really to release them but more to just get them down and out of my system. Up until even last year I didn't have a very good voice at all, yet it definitely was getting there  The one thing I'm grateful for is having the ability to look back on my past creations and reflect on how far I've come. So I would say record yourself singing and find the things you dislike about your own voice, then work on improving in those areas.   I remember my sophomore year of high school I played the talent show and did sublimes version of rivers of Babylon. I had never so much sung in front of my parents, nonetheless an auditorium full of people. I remember the tremble as I got to that mic, the uncertainty if I was even able to sing into a mic and that moment that defined the rest of my life to this day was when I opened my mouth and let go of whatever judgement, anxiety and fear and JUST FUCKING DID IT.   Another thing is don't get down on yourself if you sucks, the important thing to realize is that ANYONE can become a good singer, the difference is if you want it bad enough. Hell, when I first started singing I was looking up to Kurt Cobain as my vocal coach..so technique and proper singing form was important to learn in reverse. Starting to listen to the beatles was a good way to hear more subtle and formal melodies.   So I guess I will say that yeah, the world does have the Kurt cobains and ozzys and the like, but there's a reason you hear a lot more ""formally trained"" sounding singers than those unicorns is because it's really easy to sound shitty if you don't have some basis for how to sing. Do scales on your bass and sing along in a different octave until your voice can sing by ear. And most importantly just do it, no matter what you sound like, you won't improve as a singer if you don't fake confidence and let yourself freely express yourself. Most importantly have FUN!!!(:"

At many times, its the untrained singers that will sound all alike, due to elevating the larynx past the necessary point, lack of musicianship and losing vowel quality due to tensions.  Ozzy Osbourne is great indeed. However, its not a very healthy way to proceed. We are not Ozzy. We will not be Ozzy, training or not. If you don't train, besides not being Ozzy, you also risk hurting yourself...  Sure, if you are already a great singer, people love your voice for what it is, and you have a carreer going, I understand the concern about losing the edge by training. But if not, its a win/win situation.  About confidence, if you never sang before and you dont even know if you can sing, in my opinion its perfectly fine to not be confident... I mean, it would be really arrogant to be any other way don't you think so? Try it out on the rehearsal and see how it goes like, check what the band mates think, how you feel when doing it, etc.  Just keep in mind, its like any other instrument. There is a possiblility that you have natural affinity and just breeze through it... But its not likely. And if you have a hard time, no problem, just a matter of studying.  Good Luck!"

OTC or prescription drugs are likely to be the most helpful. When I have dry mouth issues from nerves I use a prescription dry-mouth medication that fixed my issues immediately.

Personally, I would never entrust my voice to a program, books and CDs can not evaluate what I am doing and look into my personal needs. I have quite some experience on technique, singing and teaching, and still, when it comes to my own voice, I just go to my teacher.   My teacher in his turn, does the same about his own voice, and the guy studies singing for nearly as long as I have been alive :).  So the figure of the teacher is, in my opinion, of huge importance. But said teacher must be competent.  I would advice the following: focus on singing songs in the most comfortable manner you can, sing everyday, record yourself and improve small little things, so that you start to get a hang for the craft and slowly improve.  Meanwhile, start searching for a teacher that has good background (find out who are his/her teachers), that sings in a manner that you would want for yourself and that has students that also have nice/pleasant results on their voices. Even doing so, there will still be quite some luck involved... But you will be on a better position.  Also remember that studying singing is similar to studying a martial art, you will be learning to control your own body, a slow work towards precision and control, its long term work.

Mixed voice has been studied exhaustively; it doesn't exist! Yet there are products which cost hundreds of dollars and are based around the idea that learning ""special"" mixed voice exercises will make you a better singer!  I go into a little more detail in a recent blog article:   Ever been told there was a singing style you weren’t allowed to sing? Maybe an old, conservative voice teacher told you that you were going to damage your voice belting out your favorite grungey-rock tune. Or maybe you watched some “how to sing” YouTube videos where you were told the way your favorite artists were singing is “wrong.”  The solution? Either to buy more lessons (I’ve spent as much as $100/h with teachers like these) or to buy their CD full of “special” one size fits all exercises! Absolute BULL!!!   There is NO singing secret or special vocal exercise. There are NO “special voice “techniques,” postures, or tricks that need to be SOLD to you. Don’t let yourself get scammed! THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DAMAGING OR “WRONG” VOCAL STYLE OR SOUND!  Have you heard of the 80/20 rule? 80% of outcome can be produced by 20% of the work. In the case of singing, that 20% is effective practice routines. And guess what? Learning to practice effectively is FREE.

I teach lessons in my area but I'm not pushing anything via my blog but honest, objective information (and some classical technique bashing ;))  Establish STRONG practice habits for a few weeks. It doesn't matter that much how you practice; just practice! Practice what makes you happy and practice what you want to learn! This sets you up for success with a teacher without wasting money or setting you up to be discouraged by a grumpy old conservative teacher (like many of them are!)  You can play around with ideas from different blogs, youtube channels, etc. Find what works for you because singing is subjective. Just remember that no one is right but everyone (including myself) will present themselves as having the answer. Don't be fooled!   Above all else, trust yourself! Other people will love telling you you're wrong or that they have the answer. When it comes to music, no one has a fucking clue! Think of all the different styles & techniques. Think of all the amazing musicians out there who taught themselves! I still think you should eventually find a teacher; but the fact that outliers will always exist means that no one really has the ""right"" answer.

The CT and TA muscles both control pitch, and their contraction is very dynamic in nature. They basicly do what they need to in order to produce what you want. You can have ""falsetto"" with higher TA contraction than on ""mix"", for example, depending mostly on the pitch and mechanical register used.  The different qualities associated with registers are a result of the level of closure/intensity you are using, mixed is ""middle"" level of intensity.  Three things are very important when setting it, what is going on above your larynx, support, and the vowel used.  If you have the necessary amount of twang, if the airflow is adequate and if you are using a vowel that allows enough space for the sound to be properly coupled to the open air, ""mix"" will happen.  *there are other details related to habitual tensions and the extrinsic laryngeal muscles that are also necessary for a perfect execution, but these three are the main aspects."

Part 1: Mixed Voice and The Italian School Bias  http://www.youcansinganything.com/blog-1/2015/7/12/mixed-voice-reddit-conversation  This article is in response to the question: ""I'm genuinely curious - if mixed voice ""doesn't exist"", what do you call the middle balance between cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid action in vocal phonation?""  I believe the concept your referring to has been dis-proven; particularly in studies since early 2000s. The idea of ""mix"" being, in terms even I can understand, that the vocal cords participate in a ""zipping"" function to produce mixed voice. It’s a myth that’s been floating around for centuries (similar to just about every aspect of “singing technique” being taught today.)  The myth stems from the ""classics"" of voice pedagogy. For example, Richard Miller's ""The Structure of Singing."" A book which, unfortunately, tended to support his own existing opinions and bias in favor of the Italian school of vocal technique. Vernnard's ""Singing: The Mechanism and Technique"" had a similar bias.  For example, in Richard Miller's ""National Schools of Singing: English, French, German, and Italian Techniques Revisited"" he states   “Less attention is directed toward conscious breath management in the French school than any other.”   Ok! This is fine! I think most pedagogues would agree with this, including the French. And, in fact, it’s also in line with a lot of modern pedagogy research (early 2000s – present) that the support process is a much more unconscious than was widely believed in Miller’s time. There are some amazing French singers who follow this line of thinking! For example: Roberto Alanga, one of my absolute favorite operatic tenors. His hair is cool, too!   Asked about his (Mr. Alanga's) technique for breath control, he is quick to reply, ""It's not difficult. It's only professors who make it seem difficult. It's something instinctive -- a child knows how to do it. You need only to analyze how you breathe ... find the position where your vocal emission is optimal, and when you find this position, just maintain the tension. It is not necessary to force. Find the balance between tension and relaxation."" Source: http://www.operanews.com/operanews/_archive/596/Alagna.596.html   ""Roberto ALAGNA - Ah! Lève-toi, soleil! - Roméo et Juliette""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWHNfzW9x8  Miller continues..   “Pedagogical perils abound in ignoring the breath process” Citation?  “Singers trained in the French school often demonstrate a shallow breath…” Citation? Does Alanga breathe shallowly?? Is there a study on french singers that I'm not aware of?? Or is this un-scientific opinion being peddled as fact so blatently?? Surely, we should expect more from someone who is  one of the most referenced and mainstream voice, often regarded as one of the most influential pedagogues of the century ( which he is, but that doesn't mean he's right about everything.)  “The energization of sound in the French school is at a lower level” Citation? ""Energization""?? What is he talking about?? Is that even a pedagogical term??   He then goes on to praise the Italian “Appogio” method, using scientific and anatomical examples. His writing on the Italian method is roughly 3x longer than the French method. Why the disparity? Why the inherent bias in his approach?? He does the same when referencing mixed voice. With, of course, little to no evidence to support his conclusion.   “According to Miller's description of the Italian vocal pedagogy tradition (1977; 1986, pp. 115-149), the primo passaggio was the passage from chest register to middle register and the secondo passaggio was the passage from middle to head register.”   Part 2 will discuss modern research on the ""mixed voice.""  Unfortunately, my posts get so many down-votes It will take a few minutes to post part 2. Back soon!"
singing,3d1s3v,YouCanSingAnything,-3,Mon Jul 13 02:53:09 2015 UTC,"""[In part 1] I discussed the biases in favor of the Italian school & techniques of singing in mainstream American voice pedagogy. These biased included un-sourced claims, unscientific terminology, & personal opinions being touted as fact; spoken from a position of authority.  Now, let's explore the topic of mixed voice. A popular Italian idea supported by many of the big names pedagogy. Does mixed voice exist just because they say so? Let's explore. Let's continue with a quote on Richard Miller's opinion on the existence of a ""mixed voice.""  “According to Miller's description of the Italian vocal pedagogy tradition (1977; 1986, pp. 115-149), the primo passaggio was the passage from chest register to middle register and the secondo passaggio was the passage from middle to head register.”  Voice scientists today are almost all universally in agreement that there are only 4 registers, which they call M1-M4.   M1 - vocal fry  M2 - chest  M3 - head  M4 – whistle  Lets just start with some research!   ""Voix Mixte” register is not produced in an intermediate laryngeal mechanism, but is either produced in laryngeal mechanism M1 (mx1 voix mixte), or in laryngeal mechanism M2 (mx2 voix mixte).""  ""Most research dealing with « middle, medium » registers that we reported in 2004 [1] lack objective documentation identifying with certainty the vibratory mechanism involved, or do not pertain to the mixing proper.  ""The analyses presented here confirm the conclusions of our previous study [1]. Singers produce voix mixte either in mechanism 1 or in mechanism 2. This is in keeping with the singers' own intuition concerning the laryngeal mechanism that they use""   Source: http://www.lam.jussieu.fr/Membres/Lamesch/ICA07_Castellengo_et_al.pdf  This is just one study, though! (A big issue with voice pedagogy in general is that there aren’t enough damn studies!) However, there are enough on mixed voice for us to say that, most likely, the register doesn’t exist as a laryngeal function. Let’s continue.   ""While vibratory sensations definitely occur they were not considered to be defining characteristics of registers. Defining characteristics are the physical and acoustic events that give rise to the sensations. While the committee agreed that the sensations may be helpful in the education of singers and speakers, they could not accept them as scientific evidence for defining registers.”   Source: http://www.leonthurman.com/PDF/PAS2%20Registers%20Paper%202004.pdf  So just because something FEELS like a mixture of head and chest doesn’t mean that it is. It’s an obvious conclusion, yet so many aspects of modern voice pedagogy and singing technique are based on subjective “feeling.”  Enrico Caruso notoriously participated in a study on the function of the soft palate in singing. He was convinced he raised his soft palate; the study proved otherwise. Enraged, Caruso demanded his name was removed from the study.  But more on mixed voice. If evidence of it’s existence has never been proven and, in fact, there are several studies disproving it then why is it so widely believed?   ""At the time of the 1982 CoMeT Voice Registers Committee report (previously described), no measurable evidence for a middle register had been found (Register #2A) and the committee did not support its certain existence.   hmm.. go on...   Singing teacher committee members strongly argued that a middle register exists. They indicated that middle register (#2A) is thought to result from“mixtures” of the laryngeal coordinations that are related to chest (#2 or lower) and head (#3 or upper) registers. The centuries-old concepts of voce mista (voix mixte) and the zoni di passage were cited as evidence for the existence of this register.”   okay...   “Based on information from the tradition of singing pedagogy, a possible middle register between #2 and #3 was added and designated #2A (e.g., Hollien &Schoenhard, 1983a,b). No scientific evidence for the existence of this register was found by the committee at that time.”   Source: http://www.leonthurman.com/PDF/PAS2%20Registers%20Paper%202004.pdf  Oh, so because some teachers thought it existed because the idea has been around since blood-letting… therefore it MUST be scientifically valid! In any other field these people would have been laughed out of the room! So because we have believed for centuries that God created the Earth as the center of the universe; it must be true, right? According to traditional chinese medicine, mental illnesses we're caused by demons. The remedy was to beat the demon out of the mentally ill person. Maybe someone needed to beat the demons out of Richard Miller.  http://www.leonthurman.com/PDF/PAS2%20Registers%20Paper%202004.pdf   “Likewise, no studies have characterized the laryngeal behavior of the CCM mix voice. Several studies of the classical “voix mixte” (Castellengo et al., 2004; Lamesch et al., 2007) have suggested that it can be produced either in M1 or in M2 laryngeal mechanism but never in an intermediary mechanism. Instead singers slightly modify their vocal effort and vocal tract adjustment so that the resulting sound is similar to the usual quality of the other laryngeal mechanism. Sundberg et al.(1993) found in a single female subject that mix demonstrated features of both classical and belt singing: voice energy was enhanced in high frequencies and first and second formants were measured at higher frequencies, similar to belt production. On the other hand, subglottal pressure and SPL were measured at moderate values closer to operatic singing.   Source: http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/reprints/TracyMaeva.pdf  How much more proof is needed? Maybe there are a couple of old studies which ~some~ pedagogues created theories from in order to support their preexisting assumptions. But 30-70 years ago, we didn't have laryngoscopes! Today, we have cameras so advanced we can easily observe and record laryngeal movements. Things have changed!!! Mainstream singing technique is still stuck in pre-scientific and, frankly, made up nonsense!  ""The three singers who were able to demonstrate mix quality used different glottal and vocal tract strategies to produce a sound that was “in between” belt and legit. Because we have only measured a small sample of singers, these results can only be regarded as indicative.”  Source: http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/reprints/TracyMaeva.pdf  Yes, I included the part about the small sample size. These studies aren't without limitation. But there are many more out there aside from the maybe 5 or so that have been referenced. I'm not saying that mixed voice doesn't exist, I'm saying there is no proof that it exists. And, that the evidence to date isn't very promising for the future of the ""mixed voice."""""
singing,3d1s3v,YouCanSingAnything,5,Mon Jul 13 03:04:01 2015 UTC,"Your threads here seem to keep going missing, so here's my reply to it:  I only skimmed the articles, but they seem to be based on some straw man argument that everyone referring to mixed voice is necessarily talking about some discrete vocal mode that is separate from chest and head, which I don't think is the case.  For example, the basis of your first article is the quote:   I'm genuinely curious - if mixed voice ""doesn't exist"", what do you call the middle balance between cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid action in vocal phonation?   You then go off on some tangent about zipping cords up, there not being a mixed register, etc, etc, but I don't think that poster had or ever has referred to a mixed voice as some extra register, which both of your articles seem to be attacking.  You even say:   So just because something FEELS like a mixture of head and chest doesn’t mean that it is.   Which I think is what everyone here is talking about when they talk about mix. For example, when I began singing I could only sing in M2 up to a certain point before flipping into M3, but with more practice I can now seamlessly go from M2 to M3, and the sensation is different. This different sensation is what I and probably many others describe as a mixed voice, or mixed registration, or a balance of CT/TA muscles. Just because at one point in history some people mistakenly claimed mix was something grounded in science to be a distinct vocal register doesn't mean that what we now call is a mix is that very same thing, and that we are claiming it causes vocal cords to zip up or whatever they claimed at the time."
singing,3d1s3v,LordNode,2,Mon Jul 13 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This is exactly what I was getting at. Although laryngeal function is an important means to differentiate vocal ""registers"", it is not the only tool we use for educational or performance purposes. This sensational experience, whether or not it represents a discrete change in vocal mechanic (it doesn't, we now know), is important to a lot of singers across genres, and it is important to talk about. Whether we call it ""mix"" or ""balance"" or ""middle"", simply grousing about the fact that it exists in a different paradigm that laryngeal-function-based register terminology doesn't teach anyone anything or help anyone sing."
singing,3d1s3v,keakealani,-4,Mon Jul 13 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"The question becomes as follows: If mixed voice is EITHER M2 (chest) or M3 (head) then what purpose does it serve?   It's NOT a mix of head and chest as is often claimed! The idea that you're training your chest voice and thereby your belt range is simply wrong!  Just sharing my knowledge so that people don't waste their time practicing techniques that don't benefit them. If you want to learn how to belt, then belt. If you want to learn how to ""mix,"" then mix!  The idea that learning one style is necessarily going to translate into the other is wrong!! As is the idea that mixing is a safe alternative to belting, but that's another story for another day."
singing,3d1s3v,YouCanSingAnything,4,Mon Jul 13 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"As I said, it serves the purpose of giving a name to the sensations or actions of this coordination, much like many other words commonly used in singing circles."
singing,3d1s3v,LordNode,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:54 2015 UTC,"/u/LordNode pretty much said what I would have said, but just to clarify, are you asserting that there is no point in modal vocal phonation where the TA and CT muscles work in opposition?   I'm definitely not implying that there is some discrete mixed register in terms of laryngeal function, but I never said that and the vast majority of current pedagogues, as you state, disagree. That isn't what I was asking, though. I'm asking what you call the sensation of singing with a relatively even balance between TA and CT action."
singing,3d1s3v,keakealani,6,Mon Jul 13 17:12:43 2015 UTC,"THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DAMAGING OR “WRONG” VOCAL STYLE OR SOUND!   This is very dangerous advice. There are a variety of vocal styles, such as pop rock belting, which can be extremely damaging to the voice without proper training. This kind of logic can lead to vocal nodes.    Mixed voice has been studied exhaustively; it doesn't exist!   Mixed voice is very real, and one of the most important parts of a healthy singing voice. I have been taught that mixed voice is head voice, and it lies in between chest voice and falsetto. With proper training, you can have a seamless transition from chest voice to falsetto. This technique is employed most commonly in classical settings, but can be used in all genres to protect the voice.   Techniques like this is why classically trained singers can sing their entire lives, whereas practicioners of an unhealthy ""belt"" lose their voices much younger."

There are a variety of vocal styles, such as pop rock belting, which can be extremely damaging to the voice without proper training. This kind of logic can lead to vocal nodes.   Instead of arguing with subjective opinion, let me refer you to facts.  *Compared with operatic singers musical theatre singers  a) use somewhat higher subglottal pressure,   b) produce higher maximum flow declination rate,  c) produce higher sound pressure levels,  d) have higher closed quotient   e) have higher peak‐to‐peak flow glottogram pulse amplitude, and  f) have a less dominating voice source fundamental.*  Source: http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/3003.pdf  None of these characteristics are inherently dangerous. They're just different. CAN they be dangerous if done incorrectly & excessively? Sure! But so can classical technique; as I will discuss later.   Mixed voice is very real, and one of the most important parts of a healthy singing voice.    This is unequivocally false. Not only that but your terms are wrong. I outline exactly why the mixed voice register doesn't exist in this blog post; complete with modern scientific sources. The Mythology of the Mixed Voice  There are 4 PROVEN registers as defined by the vast majority of the vocal science community.  M1 - vocal fry  M2 - chest  M3 - head (falsetto)  M4 – whistle  Note: Mixed voice isn't one of them. [Source ](Source: http://www.lam.jussieu.fr/Membres/Lamesch/ICA07_Castellengo_et_al.pdf)  More importantly, can you prove evidence proving the existence of mixed voice an exclusive laryngeal function (register?)   I have been taught that mixed voice is head voice, and it lies in between chest voice and falsetto.    Yes, you have been ""taught."" Taught incorrectly. This is why I STRESS learning from someone who knows what they're talking about!!!   Falsetto isn't a vocal register. Falsetto is a vocal timbre produced (we believe) by insufficient vocal cord closure. That is, a lack of vocal cord closure or glottal pressure.   And ""head voice"" certainly doesn't lie between chest and a non-existent ""falsetto"" register.    With proper training, you can have a seamless transition from chest voice to falsetto.    I assume when you say ""falsetto"" what you really mean is head voice. If so, then sure! Absolutely! This technique is used regularly in rock music and by women in musical theatre. Women also employ this technique in opera.  However, rarely do men use a ""mixed voice"" in opera unless they are counter-tenors. It's used more frequently in musical theatre and pop.  For example: Sam Smith singing the chorus & bridge of ""I'm Not The Only One"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkpzqqog4k   This technique is employed most commonly in classical settings, but can be used in all genres to protect the voice.    Again, I agree. Used in classical setting by women.   Techniques like this is why classically trained singers can sing their entire lives, whereas practitioners of an unhealthy ""belt"" lose their voices much younger.   Can you link me objective data proving this? Or are you just making it up? Even if this IS true (which I doubt) there are way too many variables to consider to make any sort of definitive statement.  If classical singing is so healthy, why is it that Rolando Villazon, world famous operatic tenor, had to undergo vocal surgery recently?   Just when he was emerging as one of the star tenors of his generation, Rolando Villazón's career crashed in a very public way. Now, following delicate throat surgery, he is learning how to do everything all over again.    Source: Rollando Villazón's recovery from a vocal crisis.  The TRUTH is that any style can be sung healthily. Classical singers can get nodes, musical theatre singers can get nodes, and rock singers can get nodes. There are potentially some styles that are more prone to injury; for example, a death metal screamer.  However, there are healthy ways to produce every sound. But they are very difficult! They are advanced techniques that take YEARS to master!  Source: ""Vocal effects in singing: a study of intentional distortion"""

singing,3d1s3v,Zenabel,3,Sun Jul 12 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"The truth is that in the voice world, terminology is stupid. What he calls a chest belt (or taking your voice above the second passaggio without covering) is called mixed voice by other people. probably because it kind of feels like mixing the voices. this causes everyone to argue over semantics. in my opinion It doesn't feel very like falsetto other than that it's floaty and feels too easy to be ""chest voice"", but I can see why people would want to call it a mix between falsetto and chest. That said, this dude is way overselling his knowledge of singing pedagogy all over this subreddit in the last week, and many of the regular commenters who have been here for longer would be better sources of singing advice in my opinion.  He does know a fair amount about music theatre ped, but that's it. certainly not ""all the answers to singing ever!!!!!!"" as he seems to claim. He's also the only person I've ever heard say ""mixed voice"" isn't real, and my last professor was a straight up rock god with that shit.  that said I wouldn't be surprised if he's actually right about that particular fact. I do know he knows jack shit about classical technique and certainly not enough to know that it's ""bad"" lol. tl;dr terminology is stupid"
singing,3d1s3v,accidentaldouche,-2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"The concepts behind mixed voice are potentially helpful! It's useful as a mass marketing tool which will make people perceive faster progress. Perceived progress increases motivation which increases practice time which increases singing ability. There's also a reduced risk of injury from the ""mixed voice"" method.  However, at a certain point the singer will stop progressing. They'll be dumbfounded as to why, while they've improved since beginning a mixed voice program, their voice sounds so ""light"" compared to their favorite singers.   That's because mixed voice is just head voice (falsetto.) Advocates of ""mixed voice"" say that you're ""mixing head and chest."" Which is physically impossible; you can't ""mix"" registers; you're either singing in one or the other.  Improving your head voice (mixing) has no effect on improving your chest voice belts, which is what 99.9% of contemporary singers are wanting to do.   So why not just belt to begin with??? Belting is difficult. Progress is slow. Slow progress is discouraging to beginning singers. Also, If someone isn't educated and diligent they can injure their voices. This requires A LOT of reading & practice.  The idea that becoming a good singer requires dedication, passion, commitment, and an investment of many years before they even begin to sound like their favorite artists isn't very sexy. Its not marketable; but it's the truth.   People are looking for a magic pill that doesn't exist. However, no matter how good your teacher is, how accurate their technique, or how much they cost... 80% of the work will be determined by YOU. How focused your practice is, how dedicated you are, and how willing you are to be vulnerable.  Hope my rants are helpful! Upvote me! My ideas are controversial (but true) so people tend to troll me =p.  P.s. Some teachers use the word ""mix"" to mean a balanced belted tone (as opposed to a belty sounding head voice tone.) Their argument being that the definition of a register is what something sounds like vs. vocal cord function. I guess this is fine.. but it's also confusing and unneccisary."
singing,3d1s3v,YouCanSingAnything,5,Sun Jul 12 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"I've been studying classical voice with a teacher for about 1.5 years and he uses the term mix voice all the time. I think he uses the word ""mixed"" to mean balanced resonance, rather than literally a mix of registers. I can see your points from the marketing point of view, and how mix is physically not possible. A lot of singing is difficult to convey, because you can't see your instrument, so a lot of teachers rely on what sensations are felt by the student to try to achieve a goal. And yes, lack of immediate results definitely is demotivating! Most people don't realize it's a muscle that needs training, as all muscles, and that takes time and persistence."

Basically In kargyraa, you are like intentionally trying to choke/stop off your throat using the muscles you use while holding your breath, the feeling is more intense than just holding your breath, but that moves your vestibular folds close together and changes the tract shape, and that lets you sing low notes that aren't just vocal fry."

Put sufficient energy into moving your mouth to form each syllable.  Listen to each vowel as you sing it and make sure it's distinct,  not just ""uh uh uh.""  This helps with tone and breath energy,  too.  If the words sound articulate and the tone is simply pleasant and in tune, people will enjoy listening.   Practice singing like an opera singer.   Sing legato scales and exercises.  Just open up the voice and go for it.   Listen for vibrato: not shaking or wobbling,  but clear,  pleasant, vibrant tone.

Feel free to check out 7 Essential Tips to Learn How to Sing for more detail!!   Learning to sing doesn't have to be complicated! You don't need an expensive teacher or a list of ""rules"" to abide by. Singing technique varies widely depending on every individual; there is no ""right way.""  Recording your practice sessions is ESSENTIAL! You NEED to know what you sound like; not what someone else says you sound like or what you THINK you sound like. Be objective!"

singing,3d1cwn,Nerdiplier,2,Mon Jul 13 02:22:05 2015 UTC,"Hi toxiferious, Your vocal struggles can be happening due to several different things.  If you post an audio clip I will be able to tell you what is causing the issue.  Here are a few things that can pop up: - most rock/metal singers spread their vowels to create space, the danger of this is that if you haven't first learned how to stay connected from bottom to top WITHOUT spreading then what can tend to happen is you lose the ""focus"" of the resonance ""down the centre"" (really hard to explain in text).  What this means is as you guy higher you will tend to splat out wide and it can make you flip or crack.  I recommend first learning how to sing from bottom to top with your mouth in an OO position singign all vowels through it.  if you can do this (it will be light but try to keep it connected) then you can experiment with adding back the smile or spread into the tone to get the desired rock/metal sound.  Someone here said ""darkening vowels"" I'm saying the same thing but I prefer to describe it as narrowing the vowels or shading them to make them ""smaller"".    AH > AW > UH  I usually move to AW around the F4, then Uh at A4.  When I reach about E5 I narrow it even further resembling an OO almost.  It sounds like AH the whole time though! these are subtle. AA > AW > UH - same thing as the AH EE > EH > EE I usually move to EH around F4 then close back to EE at A4.  The EE has to open up because it gets tight but then it needs to close back down to thin out for the A4,  I take that all the way up whether that's F5 or whatever. OO > OH > OO  this behaves like the EE, open it up on F4 then close back down on A4.    Your voice will be different you may have to modify earlier or later depends.  There is so much more to this for example, the real reason we are modifying is to induce the ""lift"" in the soft palate and get the resonance to shift up to the head or ""mix"".  it needs to be subtle and create a release.  It can also act as a ""counter weight"" to the sound to prevent your voice thinning too early and adding stability.  The EE and OO gets most people, you need to open up the space in the middle part of the range and then close it back down as you go higher.  Some people do this stuff naturally and won't even notice or relate to what I'm saying here and that's cool, others need to train this in specifically and as you get better you can ""relax it"".  Your vowels should sound like the vowel you are singing at all times though.   cord closure - you may have great ""diaphragmatic support"" but if your cords cannot handle the breath pressure you're throwing at them then they will flip open.   warming up.  warming up for a good 40-60 mins before trying to sing demanding heavy stuff leaning into your mix.  it takes me a good 40-60 mins to be able to sing dream theatre, led zeppelin, brian mcknight, michael jackson marvin gaye stuff, leaning into high ranged singing around A4-D5 areas without feeling like you are straining or going to crack.  Warming up is a very very important key, and a warmup is NOT a 5 minute lip bubble.  You want to start off getting your chest to head connection very smooth even on a light level then slowly build up the weight.  do it on all vowels.   lastly, nothing I said here replaces proper guidance with a good coach or good program so if you are still lost I recommend seeking that option out.  best regards!"
singing,3d1cwn,philmoufarrege,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"Darkening vowels as you get higher (tending towards ah/oh) will help with register blending, which in turn should allow you to go up in pitch without cracking. Be careful not to 'reach up' for the note or spread the vowell, making it wider. Doing this will cause additional strain and prevent you from blending into your head register."
singing,3d1cwn,enjarcher,-2,Mon Jul 13 10:26:46 2015 UTC,"There are none. Exercises are useless in my opinion; they're essentially pointless marketing tools. How exactly you're supposed to practically apply singing ""Nay Nay Nay"" is beyond me. If there's a song you want to learn practice singing that song. If you want to sing higher practice singing higher. I like the ""Uh"" vowel because it discourages shrill, squeezed sounds typical of beginners trying to sing high.  Exercises: Just pick an easy scale and increase by a half step upon completion. Example: Sing ""Do Re Me Fa Sol."" Increase pitch by a half step. Repeat.  Sing octaves. Follow steps above.  Call ""HEY!"" (EH vowel) as if you're trying to call to a friend across a busy street. Increase in pitch. As pitch increases, increase volume slightly. As you get better, begin sustaining the ""Eh"" and add vibrato.  I'm also a fan of Ingo Titze's (singer/vocal scientist) straw warm-up exercise because it's evidence based.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asDg7T-WT-0  That's about all you need. Record these ""exercises."" Afterward listen to your recording and see what needs improvement. Be objective.  In my opinion recording yourself and analyzing yourself is one of the most effective ways to improve as a vocalist."

singing,3d1cwn,HeavenlyBrie,-2,Sun Jul 12 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"They're not really exercises. Just basic scales on an ""Uh"" vowel. Nothing special. That's really the extent of the exercises I teach.  The only real exercise is the ""hey"" exercise. And it's less of a ""technical singing exercise"" and more of a means of recruiting the voice to function in a way we already know how to do.  We forget that our voice is already capable of doing amazing things. Have you ever accidentally vocalized a high note while just being excited? Or while calling ""hey"" to a friend?   Exercises which turn singing into something which requires authority to succeed in are inherently flawed. Singing is becoming more and more individualized; the standard of what is ""good"" is changing rapidly. ""Unique"" and ""expressive"" are the new ""good."" Pop & musical theater singing are becoming increasingly speech based. Ex: Ed Sheeran and Norbert Leo Butz.  It's why there are so many amazing sounding singers who have never studied technique in their lives! They simply expressed. Technique and thought get in the way of our natural expression. Technique separates the body from the mind.  So yeah. He asked for exercises so I pulled some out of my ass. The ""hey"" thing could probably be categorized as an exercise, but I don't like to think of it that way.   I think of exercises as the books my opera teacher (world famous) used to have me sing from. They included: exercises which isolated the tongue, putting chopsticks in my mouth to prevent jaw tension (????), weird belly squeezing exercises to ""engage my support."" And a number of impracticalities.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0O4hbBQZxg  nd sure, my teacher had some talented students! I respect a lot of what I learned from them; but most of what I remember are the images and not the rigid exercises. For many, this top down approach works. But for others such as myself and opera singer Roberto Alanga, these things only get in the way of natural expression.   ""Asked about his technique for breath control, he (Roberto Alanga) is quick to reply, ""It's not difficult. It's only professors who make it seem difficult. It's something instinctive -- a child knows how to do it. You need only to analyze how you breathe ... find the position where your vocal emission is optimal, and when you find this position, just maintain the tension. It is not necessary to force. Find the balance between tension and relaxation."" http://www.operanews.com/operanews/_archive/596/Alagna.596.html   It wasn't until I stepped away from rigid, traditional ideas and began following my gut that I began to make progress."

singing,3czwmb,jediah556,3,Sun Jul 12 08:17:06 2015 UTC,"So the biggest thing to point out is that your voice is still very young by singing terms - most male voices don't finish changing and settling until the late 20s or so. This means that your voice's eventual range is completely up in the air - almost every male singer I know experienced a significant change in range and tessitura through the 20s.   The second thing to point out is that range is not built in isolation, but rather as a product of technique. As a musician, you should already know that technique is the foundation upon which you build skill sets in any instrument, and the voice is no different. You don't mention lessons, but it really is important to study voice with the guidance of a qualified voice teacher. I think a lot of instruments falsely (and rather offensively) assume that singing doesn't require skill or training, but it does. You're not trained as a singer so you should not expect to necessarily succeed as a singer without training.   Finally, keep in mind that ""power"" and ""belting"" are not necessarily the way to project your voice. Actually, the way most people perceive it, they want to sound good to themselves (through bone and muscle conductivity, not through the air), which actually restricts the voice and makes it relatively difficult to project out in the space. It's possible to belt healthily, of course, but I generally advise that young students aim for freedom of the voice rather than something like ""projection"" which is a natural byproduct of balanced singing."
singing,3czwmb,keakealani,0,Sun Jul 12 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"What you want to learn is Bel Canto technique. I guarantee they you could sing any operatic Tenor role.   First is bridging your chest voice to your head voice. Now, falsetto is a type of head voice, but it doesn't really sound like your normal chest voice. Their are actually two types of voice, modal and falsetto. You have a falsetto head voice and a falsetto chest voice, as well as a modal head voice and chest voice. Modal is the voice most singers use for everything, while falsetto is mostly used for voice acting or screams.   Now, you may already have mastered modal head voice, and may have just been used to calling it falsetto, because that is the more well known term for high pitched singing. A true falsetto sounds scratchy and a gender, while a baritone male head voice should sound something like an operatic alto. If your voice sounds more like the former, you will want to learn to bring out your head voice. It can take a while, but basically, you need to start in chest voice, and his your throat in a yawning position, and attempt to enter what feels like a falsetto, without needing to stop making sound. Once you make a high singing that sounds like a alto, you have done it. It will feel a little more powerful in your head than falsetto, but the muscle movement will feel the same.   To bridge this voice, the best way to begin is with a breathy chest sound. Attempt to raise it into your head voice without cracking, and then bring it back down, without cracking. This may take a long time. Try singing Adam Levine songs, though his Tenor might be high for you on some parts. Your modal head voice has a few notes less than your falsetto, so once this is done, you can expect to have an effective range up to a D5 or so. However, this will not be the most powerful voice in the world. If you want power, you need vocal cord closure. If you don't know what vocal cord closure is, it's basically the voice you make if you are holding in your breath, or like you are sitting on the toilet. The idea is to prevent air from leaving your lungs, which gives you better pressure(more power), and the ability to sustain longer notes. This alone can gain you 3 or 4 notes, combined with a belt like chesty approach. However, this isn't good for your cords, and should be used sparingly. The real trick is connecting a closed chest voice to a closed head voice. Once you accomplish this, your range will be seemingly infinite. To do this, you must practice going up and down scales, on each individual note, attempt to switch from a closed head to a closed chest, and vice versa. Out well take a long time, but you will eventually build muscle memory to the point that it is unconsciously done, and your full range can be utilized.   If starting without knowledge or skill in any of these techniques, expect it to take up to 2 years or more to get to the point where your voice glides effortlessly.  Hopefully this is helpful, and I would like to hear your singing, so don't be afraid to pm me with vocaroos or questions."

singing,3czwmb,keakealani,0,Sun Jul 12 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"Hi, You'll need to learn how to stay in your full voice and thin out the sound without leaving your real voice.  Some call this ""mixed voice"", I just wrote a big article and video on it, have a look here: http://www.grow-the-voice.com/free-singing-tips/  I'll summarize a little here for you... Each vocal register needs to be strengthened to stand alone by itself.  Your chest voice needs to firstly be strengthened so that there is something to stabilize the mix.  Your falsetto needs to be strengthened so that the chest has something to mix with.  The pharyngeal resonance needs to be developed because it acts as the connector between the chest and head.  It is what “mixes” the two resonances into one strong register – full voice.  It is a full on process to build the range, not a single exercise or ""trick"".  it takes step by step training on building certain skills and then when they are put together the voice is able to ""hold on"" and stay connected."

The voice doesn't even fully mature until the late 20s for most people, so it's hard to learn much before the late teens/early 20s anyway.   Secondly, I really do stand by this article in the FAQ. I think it's quite clear. If you have a specific question, feel free to ask!  Thirdly, if you are male (which I assume from your mention of falsetto - female falsetto doesn't really exist), you have no business trying to sing G5 - that's near the top of the soprano range and not at all within the range of the vast majority of male singers. Do not try to sing things outside of your range - that's the #1 best way to hurt yourself.   I'm not really sure what your question exactly is about keys and music theory, as you only seem to be talking about single pitches. If you could clarify your question that would be great.

Autistic people have difficulty reading social queues, part of which is a lack of linguistic processing. Vocal pitch is a communicative tool which allows us to unconsciously interpret the spoken word.  That being said, practice very slowly and deliberately. You can overcome this! Play a note on the keyboard and try to match it with your voice. Record yourself as you do it. Listen to the recordings. Are you sharp or flat? Repeat.  It's probably a G4 you're talking about. G5 is the top of a woman's belt range! This will take years to accomplish and is impossible to do if you're male. Just practice singing high notes thats all there is to it. Record yourself."

singing,3cwvw9,mezzolini,3,Sat Jul 11 15:11:35 2015 UTC,The advice I keep hearing about going out of your comfort zone is set yourself up to do something that would be a whole lot more hassle to get out of doing.
singing,3cyw5b,keakealani,4,Sun Jul 12 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"You do not need to know you voice type for a school choir. Also, if you read this article from the FAQ, you might notice that range is only one part of the puzzle for determining voice type. Tessitura, timbre, and weight are also important factors when it comes to determining voice type.   Also, I would like to point out that you do not include auxiliary registers like vocal fry, falsetto, or whistle tone when determining range. Since A6 is extremely high, I am going to assume that you either accidentally included auxiliary registers, or you displaced the octave - most professional sopranos do not have A6 in modal voice! (A6 is the space above 4 ledger lines above the treble clef, for reference.)"
singing,3cyw5b,mezzolini,2,Sun Jul 12 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, the choir director should be testing your range. Make sure to read about tessitura.  One note about vocal weight: Especially in school choirs, you might be more comfortable singing in a higher range, but if you have a ""bigger"" sound, it may not blend well with the other sopranos, and you might end up being placed in the alto section. This is for the director to decide, though!"
singing,3cyw5b,keakealani,2,Sun Jul 12 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"Very true. Choir voicing has very different priorities than solo vocal classifications, so it's really not worth the effort to try to predict what a specific choir director wants. Also, things like reading ability and aural skills can influence choir voice placement, especially in younger/less experienced choirs where not all the singers are comfortable with reading."
singing,3cyw5b,FelipeVoxCarvalho,2,Sun Jul 12 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"Just sing the parts that you can do comfortably and with quality. You will not be able to accurately classify your voice until you are trained and know how to use it properly, reckless classification will only hinder your progress.  Felipe"
singing,3cyw5b,YouCanSingAnything,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"If you're young (around 16) you can't have your voice accurately classified anyway. The more you practice and age the better idea of what your ""type"" is.  But, just for reference, most women are mezzo-sopranos. Altos are rare and non-existent in young people.   However, voice type in choir is completely different than voice type in classical or pop.  Hope this helps."
singing,3cxp17,DrPaprika0192,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"It would actually really help to know what you are looking for. It sounds like you're looking for classical music, but even then, there is a lot of variety in that genre. What is your level of experience? In what context would you sing these pieces? What is your experience level with the major singing languages? Where are you, technique-wise? What is the skill of your pianist?   In addition, I want to point out with the exception of most operatic literature, range/tessitura are comparably less important features for determining repertoire, compared to fach/voice type, timbre, and technique. Since most art songs are easily transposable, it's not really important to think about range when you can just transpose to an appropriate key. It's more about choosing music that is appropriate for you, which is really something that should be done with your teacher, not with random people on the internet.   Also, I'd like to point out that Romantic/20th century music is not considered ""old"" by any measure in the classical world - keep in mind that solo vocal music originated from at least the Renaissance as we know it, and of course older music from the Medieval and Greco-Roman eras also exist, some centuries earlier."
singing,3cxp17,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"In response to questions about my experience, I've been singing in choir for about 4 years, but have begun taking singing seriously by taking lessons the past two years. I'm currently in high school. I've sung solos in concerts and for judges, but also have received superior ratings at FVA State Solo & Ensemble for trios and ensembles. I primarily sing as a hobby; I won't be seeking music as a career, but it is a major part of my life. Regarding technique, I've only taken voice lessons for two years, so although I'm comfortable with my voice in the areas of projection, resonance, tone, and vibrato, I'm still not vocally prepared for very difficult pieces, such as those with great deals of fast movement, or with difficult melodies. Having worked in the choir, I have a lot of experience with Latin and Spanish, but not much with German, French, or Italian. My pianist is almost always my choir teacher, who is quite proficient.   Being new to the subreddit, I wasn't quite sure what types of  responses I would get, so I used the (quite broad) term ""old,"" because I didn't want to receive suggestions for more recent songs, such as pop songs or anything like that. So, having cleared that up, I would probably prefer something in the Romantic period, with a slower, emotional feel to it.   Also, thank you so much for the thorough introduction and advice! You were very helpful and informative. I appreciate your willingness to give the best guidance possible"
singing,3cxp17,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"No worries. There are a variety of genres hanging around here so if you're specific you'll usually get what you need :)   What is the context you'll be singing in (for school, just for lessons, for a competition or audition, etc.?) Unfortunately, most romantic lit is in Italian, French and German, although there are a couple of Spanish composers worth checking out. Obradors is one composer that pops to mind, and I think de Falla also wrote some art songs. Italian also shouldn't be too hard if you have some Latin experience, since standard sing Latin is based on Italian. I'm sure your teacher could also help you if you get confused. So some Italian composers to look into are Bellini, Donizetti, Pizzetti, Respighi, or Cimara.   Unfortunately I have a really different voice type so I might not be as helpful finding specific pieces, but hopefully these composers give you a good place to start out!  Oh, I also forgot to mention good ole English. Vaughan Williams is really nice for lower voices, as is Finzi. Britten or Barber might also have something nice for you.   Happy searching :)"

singing,3cwxh4,ImBadAtNamingStuff,2,Sat Jul 11 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"Really, the best advice is to find some sort of lesson situation. What you're describing sounds more like a lack of experience and knowledge than anything else, and I can't really imagine how you would obtain that knowledge without some training and guidance. How much have you actually looked into lessons (beyond discounting them as ""too expensive)? Many teachers are willing to give lessons on a barter system or for reduced rates for financially-needy students, and in addition there are external scholarships available for impoverished students needing assistance. And truly, many teens and young adults were willing to pick up an additional summer job to afford lessons - if it's something that's important to you, it's worth a little elbow grease.   With that in mind, obviously I would start with the FAQ, if you haven't read through it already. I would also start by addressing some of your preconceptions - you should not be evaluating your range based on ""straining"" (actually, you should not be straining at all when you sing), but on pitches within your consistent, healthy range. This, of course, also raises the point that range is a pretty much useless measure for anything in singing, and preoccupation with range is just likely to cause you to hurt yourself and not learn how to sing well.   I would also note that technique is best learned through exercises and carefully-chosen repertoire, not by just singing everything your favorite band sings. It doesn't sound like you're engaging in good technique work, which is really requisite to becoming a good singer, so I would start there. I would also caution you to avoid the temptation to imitate other singers (something which is particularly common if you try to sing from recordings by other singers) - this is another good way to limit yourself vocally and potentially hurt yourself. I strongly recommend that beginners attempt to learn music straight from the score whenever possible, as it limits the temptation to imitate another singer's timbre or interpretation, while also developing stronger reading and musicianship skills.   As far as vibrato, keep in mind that healthy vibrato isn't really ""applied"" like an external factor, but is a facet of your phonological production and overall technique. Vibrato occurs naturally in balanced, supported singing, and adjusting vibrato has to come from that general foundation. I would focus more on developing solid technique than on vibrato, since it's fairly fruitless and it's possible that you could accidentally develop a false tremor or other habit that will just take more time and effort to undo later."

I noticed they would often tuck their pelvis under, to put the guitar in a better position. I told them to stop doing that!  If they are sitting while playing, I tell them to use a foot rest, so they are not hunched over in that position.  Also--the biggest thing--is that they do these things in order to see the guitar. You have to get used to playing by feel and keeping your head up, or else your vocal sound will not be free.   One cool thing about playing guitar while singing is that you can use the feel of the guitar against your abdomen to make sure you're actually expanding during inhalation (if that's the technique you use)."

singing,3cw0v5,YouCanSingAnything,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:54:45 2015 UTC,"Hm...then I'd say you need to figure out what specific things about your movement throw you off. Videotape yourself in full performance mode, and analyze your movement and your sound. How much are you moving right before each phrase? Do you initiate movement in the middle of a phrase? Pop singers often lip-synch when they're performing complex dance moves, or they only really dance during an instrumental section. You can also watch some of your favorite live performers (the ones that always sound good) and see how they manage movement, playing, and singing well."

In the meantime, check out my most recent blog post ""5 BAD POSTURE HABITS THAT ARE AFFECTING YOUR SINGING!""   Here an excerpt: ""Rule #4: Don't raise your shoulders. Tense breathing during singing comes from the idea that there is a CORRECT way to breathe when you sing. It’s a popular cultural idea (ex: yoga) that we habitually breathe incorrectly. This is false for the vast majority of the population and simply creates anxiety,  resulting in more poor breathing! It’s a never ending, self-perpetuating cycle!  Practice breathing normally!

singing,3ct6dv,terrycotta,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"in many styles of singing a comfortably low larynx is actually very helpful (although more relevant for men).  A lot of guys let their larynx ride up and create a lot of tension (see: necktie tenors). obviously an artificially depressed larynx is bad, but it should sit fairly low for 90% of notes, nearer 95-98% in more classical singing. it's a warmer, clearer, and more relaxed tone, and also tends to come hand in hand with a wide, relaxed throat. by low I mean where it naturally settles after the end of a yawn. it should stay about there (for men in particular) until near the top of the range, and even then shouldn't shoot through the roof unless going for something very high and mixed.   Also, yes you don't want to be tense when you breathe, and there are two main ways to support which people disagree on sometimes, but lowering the diaphragm and expanding out does indeed help you sing. a lot. proper singing breath means that I can create more dynamic contrast, sing longer phrases, and most importantly, sing with less tension. I often have to sing 4-5 hours a day, if I did ""normal"" breathing id start to hurt myself after two. sure if you sing short phrases into a mic, anything relaxed is fine, but I'd take a good deep breath in through the mouth with a low diaphragm and some abdominal expansion over it any day of the week, and so would every single other professional I've ever meet.  that's the choir/music theatre/opera circuit folks anyways. I'm just saying that those concepts in general are not  ""misinformation"", I have no idea on the merits or lack thereof of anyone posting lessons on YouTube. this particular guy might be teaching them in a way that's not any good.   your teacher should be a good singer, but that doesn't mean they have any idea at all how to teach singing."

singing,3ct6dv,terrycotta,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:45:15 2015 UTC,"While I don't have near as many years of professional experience as you, I can say that when I was 18-19 If I had, say, a long series of pitches around G4 (back when I was still learning to cover) my larynx would start to rise up very drastically, and after about 6-7 seconds around my passaggio it would be so high it was creating a lot of tension. My voice also lost a lot of warmth. I also used to shoot it straight up when I went for high notes.  learning to keep it relaxed and in a generally low position (it's a ""set it and forget it"" type thing, not forcing it down) was a huge step for me.  Really, by comfortably low I just mean where the larynx would normally sit in a relaxed person's neck, as opposed to artificially tensed up and raised. sure, it gradually and smoothly goes up if I'm singing above my passaggio, but a larynx that jerks all over the place with a lot of tension (like mine was) or sits high when singing in the middle/lower end of the range is no good at all. That's what most of the voice professors I've met mean when they say to keep it low. I do know one guy (bass-baritone with a doctoral degree in voice) who teaches to force it down which is very obviously terrible, but in my personal experience I had to actively focus on it beyond just relaxing/expanding my throat, and this made me a much better singer (and yes I am a professional as well, although I'm much younger).   Perhaps you've just always kept your larynx fairly relaxed/well positioned so it was never a problem for you, or if you had this issue it was fixed by learning to relax the throat in general, but I don't think actively addressing specific sources of tension/bad technique is a bad thing, which is all I'm advocating. if a person has a relaxed throat, chances are their larynx is already sitting in the ""comfortably low"" place anyways.  My undergrad teacher was no pedagogy slouch (grad degrees from Eastman and IU in opera as well as a solid performing career) and he helped me a lot in as a young tenor by addressing this directly. It's a teaching tool like any other, it works for some and not everyone. Helped me tho."

I value the ideas of people who are MUCH better than me over those who are maybe a year down the line; maybe better in one area or style but inferior in others. I don't suggest anyone take my advice unless they feel in their heart and experience that I am right.  Only learn from the best. If you're not impressed by me then ignore and move on. Or, feel free to continue talking shit and increase my amusement ;). I'm only interested in attracting the self-driven, motivated, alpha-type leaders who demand transparency from authority. See my mission statement for more detail:   ""I, like many contemporary singing teachers, don’t believe in “rules” governing proper singing. I am the anarchist of singing teachers, if you will. The rebel. I question everything regardless of the source unless it’s objective evidence.   There is no such thing as an ideal singing singing posture. There is no such thing as proper breathing technique. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD SINGING HABIT.  I’m tired of “woo-woo” technique and ridiculous exercises that accomplish little more than making a distracted fool out of you as the teacher pulls money from your unsuspecting pocket. If you want to learn how to sing a your favorite songs, THEN JUST PRACTICE SINGING THE SONGS!  These people are either intentionally malicious or unknowingly uneducated. Classically trained singers are often times the culprits of the ladder category.  Beginners, particularly those who use the internet to learn to sing, are often too shy or anxious to find a singing teacher in real life. I was! They’re preyed upon by unknowledable teachers. I’m here to provide people with accurate knowledge and the ability to learn on their own.""   Stay tuned for updates to my recording as I progress through the month! I'm confident I can trump Arceneaux's vocal abilities. Find me a substantial recording of him singing live (not-produced)... if it even exists!  This is just the beginning, my friend.

Think of it this way - your voice is an instrument, like a piano or guitar or a bagpipe. Just how instruments play notes that sound different from one another and create a melodies your voice can also ""play"" those same melodies by matching the pitch of each word when you breathe out. That's what separates singing from talking -- at its most basic.  Try this warm-up exercise--find a piano and play a middle C. Then hum so that the note buzzes in the front of your mouth and listen to the sound it makes. Adjust your vocal chords until the note in your mouth sounds the same as on the piano. Then play through the rest of the Cmaj scale matching each note with your voice.   Do this with different scales, then work on doing it without the piano. Should make you think more in terms of melody when singing."

singing,3cu6hh,LordNode,2,Sat Jul 11 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"See, you're confusing voice type with vocal range, which is more to do with technique, and has little bearing in the contemporary styles you showcase in your clips. Let's say you're a tenor, can you sing along to Vitas without changing the key? If you're a baritone, can you sing along with Jeff Scott Soto without changing the key? In both cases I highly doubt it, and the same would go for many people that are of these voice types.  If you want to improve your range then you need to improve your technique, and these professional singers probably have technique that far eclipses yours, and so their range is also much better, even if they have a similar voice type.  Once you improve your technique and learn to bridge the coordination and resonance shifts you'll find that range was never the issue."
singing,3cu6hh,YouCanSingAnything,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"I was referring to not having songs that I can sing in my comfortable range. A lot of times I can hit the notes from tenor or baritone singers' songs, it's just that they are singing it in a different part of their range than me. A tenor and an alto could sing the same song, but they wouldn't really be using the same part of their range. The tenor would be leaning towards his higher range and the alto would be leaning towards her lower range - to different effect. Singing along to energetic songs from male singers, I often find that I can match their energy only if I were to change the key - and that's okay, but just not always practical (for me at least)."

Work on the very basics of singing - scales, intonation, free release of breath, enunciation, legato, etc.  Stay in a comfortable range for performance, but challenge your range in practice while maintaining healthy production.  Also, there are only like four notes in that song... post something of you singing scales up and down through your range and I may be willing to venture a guess at your range/voice type.  But if someone asks, say ""mezzo,"" since you don't seem to sing high ever, but I wouldn't doubt that you could if you trained.  And if you decide to sing more in head voice, you can always switch to calling yourself soprano.  People decide to switch quite frequently, especially as they age or train more.  Intonation and legato are the biggest concerns I'd have for you... but you seem to have confidence and a good sense for rock style.

Both of you have really nice voices that can make someone lean in and want to listen carefully. I am no vocal coach but maybe you can try and improve on singing through the notes on the ""a"" vowel. In some instances I felt like the tone was kind of swallowed. like on the first recording like for example in the words ""want"" or '""began"" Aimee resonates the note a little more forward but not too forward that it sounds pingy. Its a small note and you could keep it the same way you sang it for stylistic purposes but other than that I think you shouldn't use recordings that have this sound quality because it could deter you from seeing what you can improve on. Sometime when I dont have a good recording device hands on I cup my ears and bend them forward so that in this way I can hear what perhaps others in the room hear. that helps me in picking out things that I dont like or want to improve upon more accurately. you sound nice :) and nice piano playing skills!!!"

You have a nice voice, with good intonation.  But with these songs, you're basically just peeping out a few notes in a limited range.  You don't seem to have a sense of flow or connecting the breath between notes, and this rep won't challenge you with that.    Are you Irish?  German?  Swedish?  Learn some folk songs from your heritage, or American ones, of course.  Songs like those are more melodic, with longer lines.  You can then try art songs like Schubert, Quilter, Vaughan Williams, etc.  Basically, train to be an opera singer.  Think along those lines, then when you sing anything, even songs like this, you'll sound so much more in control and expressive.  Keep singing!!!!!!"

singing,3cqm0h,lux514,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:45:48 2015 UTC,"Good singing!  If I may suggest some ways to get your confidence up: sing songs that are lower (lower the key, or just find different songs).  Not many people can keep up with male pop singers, who are mostly high tenors.  You sound like you might be a tenor, too, but it sounds a bit strained.  Simply singing in a more comfortable range could make singing feel much easier.  Learn simpler songs.  If you're self taught and aren't very confident, don't try to take one giant step to sound like a successful, charismatic pop singer.  Learn some simple folk songs and spirituals, without a wide range or pop-y embellishments.  Sing those songs in front of friends/family to get confidence - some easy victories.  But I don't doubt you can quickly succeed, and eventually rock out some local karaoke joints or join/start a band.  I also always suggest learning piano/keyboard if you haven't, to learn key signatures, scales, and reading music.  That can allow you to practice more effectively and become a competent, and thus confident musician."

But I'll post my notes here as well per your struggles with staying loose while singing.  ""Be careful with this as you can really damage your cords. It's perfectly fine to sing softer, you don't need to replicate the volume of a stage performance and keep in mind that volume is EQ'd by the sound team, same with in studio in pre/post-pro. So trying to match things like volume in a personal no flair attached recording can do harm. Search for some warmups that assist with loosening you up. I routinely roll my head around while warming up, also making sure that my tongue is completely relaxed, it should just fall flat against your lower mouth, almost lifeless. Don't lift your head for high notes, I think I can hear you doing this. Don't reach for the notes with your body, if you feel you need to do this tilt your head down instead, or use your arms. (hard to do while playing guitar)."""

Quick question: Do you know if there's any reason I can't seem to remotely hit my pitches without being really loud like this recording? I try and try to sing softly, but it ends up horrible. Being so loud does wear me out, but it's so disheartening to miss pitches. I routinely get discouraged when I try to sing ""normally"" and it's trash."

I think it would sound much better with eg. an electric guitar and a deep bass to balance out your voice, which is full of high-frequency overtones.  I like your style and what it could become, and I think you just need to keep improving. The notes are mostly, more or less in tune, but being pushed out by small amounts, by the force of your voice. Try to exercise more control over the tuning, while keeping the same style - particularly when you slow down for the interlude."

singing,3cqm0h,temporarysteve,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:50 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, on 2nd thoughts - it might be the recording making your voice sound higher than it is. A voice is made up of a lot of related notes from low to high, and that contributes to its timbre, or  character. So while you are singing one note, there are a dozen other notes coming out. Most male voices have a slightly boomy, low undertone, which - at least in this recording - is only barely audible. Your shouty, hoarse style, in the high range you sing this, seems to nearly eliminate that undertone, leaving you with rough overtones. Eg. compare the full, deep sound of a car's engine with the higher-pitched, crunchy sound of the tyres on a gravel drive. Often you hear both together, or one or the other.  So, the thing about good musical arrangements is that you don't usually want two instruments in the same range (unless you are deliberately combining them for effect). So a voice with high frequencies / overtones needs other instruments below it, and they can go as low as you like, to fill out the sound.  If you find a bigger room with softer furnishings and a large area of carpet, and hit the bass strings harder, you'll get an immediate improvement. (The hard surfaces of a small room reflect the high notes more).  I think you are hitting the pitches fine, in principle. But the force of shouting pushes them out slightly. If you hold back just a little, and focus slightly more on staying bang in tune, it will sound better. A lot of pop singers who sound as if they are shouting themselves hoarse, are actually holding back slightly, to improve the technical delivery.  Eg. ""Angel"" is fine because you are obviously straining, and being slightly flat is permitted! Better to split the note down the middle, but then you might lose the forced emotion of the song. At 0:51 slightly flat again because your high range is already weakening. But further along, 1:44 ""and each"" is out because there is slightly too much force in your delivery, and you ease off and pull it back in quickly. From 1:54 in the slower interlude, all is slightly too strong and unstable. ""Just leave"" has the same error and you ease off and pull it in.  Note also what the other said about causing damage. A lot of hoarse shouting may leave you unable to sing a pure tone, due to scar tissue, etc. Maybe that is what you are after, but you can get it without the damage."

singing,3cqm0h,lux514,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the PM.  I listened to the recording.  As is often the case with singing, intonation is the central issue.  Don't worry about belting, tone, style, sound, etc... sing in tune and enunciate clearly, and you'll be 90% of the way there and people will think you're a great singer.  But again, there's no direct path you can take.  It first requires some good technique to establish a free-flowing production of sound.  I'd recommend working on your voice apart from simply trying to sing pop songs.  Practice scales and vocal exercises, paying close attention to establishing a legato line.  Learn some simple folk songs without fancy embellishments so you can hone in on intonation.  Next time you post, just sing a scale up and down, with some other vocal exercises - smoothly (legato), and in tune.  Get a piano/electric keyboard and learn to play.  And I mean learn to play scales in all keys and read music.  Then you can sing along to songs and solfedge scales to practice intonation.  Join a choir that does serious classical repertoire.  Picture where you want to be in 3-5 years and start something slow and steady to get there.  Then you'll have a great skill for the rest of your life.  Also, you sound more like a tenor at this point.  Your voice may still lower, but it still sounds mostly in head voice.  Baritones sing most comfortably in chest voice, where you can feel your chest rumble, but you seem to bottom out at that range.  I could be wrong, and many voices are not classified until 25-30 years old.  Keep singing!!!!!"

singing,3cqm0h,lux514,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:58:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, I think your singing mostly lacks a sense of flow between notes.  It often feels like there's barely enough breath underneath each note, without the breath connecting every note.  Practice singing smoothly (legato) on ""ah"" or ""oo,"" making a phrase or vocal exercise feel like it's one note, with even release of breath.  Try to carry that feeling over into the songs.  Try singing the songs slowly, in a very technical way before adding all the embellishments and stylings, and don't add them if they interrupt the flow.  Your intonation is fine, but it's hard to judge a capella - it's often harder to match the pitch of a band/backup track.  Keep singing!!!"

You could use a teacher to get started, as there are plenty of things to work on. Eg. breathe deeper (from the belly), sing louder, and run the words on longer.  But most importantly, find out where the tune goes, note by note. At the moment you are ""hunting"" for each note, and hardly any of them are accurate. Each note should be like a step, mostly flat and even from start to finish, with a sharp change to the next step/note, which should also be flat and even, mostly. No hunting, no scoops.

Enunciation is sloppy in places, eg. 0:45 - 0:57 with ""bough you flai-ers"" instead of ""boughT you floW-ers"", and the rest of that 12 seconds is similar. I wonder if you have a mild speech defect, which you've mostly overcome. But in places it shows, and spoils the awesome singing.  Tuning is slightly out in places. It goes out a lot during the runs at 2:30-2:44, and then at 2:50 here and there until the end.  I also listened to your cover ""All I Want"", and tuning is very noticeable throughout that, eg. 0:57 ""if"" and 1:06 ""body"", 1:21 ""body"".  The way you flip into falsetto is very nice.

singing,3cqm0h,temporarysteve,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"You have a funny, but charming approach to tuning (this is a compliment). Because you put so much expression into it, your tuning bends this way and that all the time, and it's great.  Some of the tuning is not quite right where you are belting the high notes. It would be better if you gain more control over the high range. But what you're doing is passable because of your expressive style, and you just about make those part of the song.  But the points where is does actually go wrong, are the points I've noted - especially the runs after 2.30, due to lack of skill, or so it sounds. You need to slow that right down and hammer it out, then speed it up again.  That, and the enunciation when belting, are really the sticking points. I would work on those, a lot, because what you offer - when they come right (might take a while) - is wonderful."

It will make it easier to understand what people are talking about, at least in theory. 2) search YouTube for ""laryngoscopy singing."" You can take a look at someone's voice box when they sing. 3) rather than trying to sing ""right,"" work on experimenting. If you read somewhere that you should open the throat when you sing, try singing something with the throat open as much as you can, and then with it closed. Try to find points in between with the goal of learning what it feels like. 4) record yourself singing and listen back frequently. What it sounds like in your head is never the same as what other people hear. You can use the record feature on your phone...you don't need a studio. Just some external feedback. 5) practice. A lot.

Watch great singers in your genre and really analyze what they're doing--how much strain can you see in their faces? in their necks? Do they stick their heads forward or do they look natural? Do as much as you can to look how they look. (Note: many successful singers have poor technique; if you're not sure if a singer in your genre is technically ""good"" or not, ask. If you're still not sure, just watch Whitney Houston.) Lie on the floor in the Alexander Technique ""semi-supine"" position and sing scales or simple melodies. Do this first only in the middle and lower part of your voice--nothing should feel difficult. Gradually work up to slightly higher pitches, but not too high for now. Eventually, you can practice singing whole songs in this position, but again, for several weeks I'd only do songs that are comfortably within your range."

Many teachers are willing to teach on the barter system or give you reduced rates due to financial hardship - nobody should be denied the opportunity to learn just because of money alone. If you can spare an afternoon to walk someone's dogs or care for their garden in exchange for weekly lessons, do that.   Also, consider looking into scholarships for lessons. I've never personally pursued this avenue, but I understand there are scholarships available from organizations like NATS to get students with financial need appropriate training. Same goes for most colleges/universities.   The fact of the matter is, you're experiencing exactly what happens when you try to self-teach - you're more likely to hurt yourself and not see consistent progress, because you don't know what you're doing. I fully second joining a choir or any other avenue where you can get out there and sing in a structured environment, but it does really sound like you would benefit from some lessons and I really hope you can find a way to make that work in your budget."

First thing I like to record myself to see how I sound and if I improved. It's not enough to hear your own voice while your singing. Sing along with the person you like. It's weird but singing over my favorite singers (singing with them I guess) I learned from them how their voice sounds. Youtube vids. Some of them are really helpful and free. Obtain a singing method. I use ""Mastering Mix"", not sure if I'm allowed but you can get it using the internet. >_> Something like that is great even on an iPod or something.   Most important thing is to learn how to use your instrument correctly by whatever means necessary from other people and stuff, do certain exercises to help, and most important that I keep forgetting to do myself, BREATHING. BREATH CORRECTLY.  Here's an exersize: Inhale deeply. Then, as slow as possible exhale all the air. It will make a huge difference.  EDIT: I also want to say having a sore throat is bad. Don't damage your chords/throat. D:  TL'DR I learned the MOST from practicing the shit about of everything. That is the best way.

singing,3cmr77,Pleasant4118,4,Thu Jul 9 02:54:20 2015 UTC,"It would be irresponsible for me as a voice teacher to encourage you to imitate the tone and range of the belting of another singer.  Even if it's possible for you (and most people just won't be able to sing like her), trying to take a direct path to achieving her tone and range is inadvisable.   To explain her technique,  belting is basically tightening the vocal folds somewhat and raising the larynx higher.   Free,  vibrant tone has less tension in the larynx.    I recommend learning a more vibrant, healthy, ""classical"" technique.  Then if you want to belt,  try to keep it as close to the free and healthy technique as possible,  while singing in a comfortable range and allowing your tone to sound unique to yourself,  without comparing it to another singer.   This does not mean I am against belting.  Belting is basically a loud straight tone.  I use straight tone in ensemble singing,  which is my favorite kind of music.  You just have to use it in a more limited range,  and the voice gets tired faster.  But in my training,  I use only classical technique.  I feel that it gives you the fullest skill set to sing in any style, maximizing your versatility and endurance.   But hey,  if you can sound like Elsa just by trying,  good for you.  I don't want to limit you,  just trying to give you the best advice I can."
singing,3cmr77,lux514,3,Thu Jul 9 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yes to this. Also, just to add on...most of the pop singers get a significant portion of their sound from the studio. It is incredibly difficult to hold pitch as steady as we hear on the radio from Pop singers, and the muscle tension it takes is hard on the vocal cords. Auto-tune allows producers to remove vibrato and correct pitch drift. Also, if the singer sounds like they straining, you can compensate with reverb and some other tricks.   So trying to emulate a pop singer on the radio without the proper technology is just as futile as trying to do it without proper technique."

singing,3cmr77,ImaginaryHearts,2,Thu Jul 9 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes....maybe.  But it's a long commitment. And don't imitate her - tone matching is a voice killer and if, as you say, you're a baritone, you'll never get close to matching it anyway. Just work on getting stronger and higher. You're young enough that you should be able to get to A5 via belting eventually. Getting there consistently will take even longer. And to be clear, we're talking years here. A5 is high as hell. Most males can't hit it, regardless of their voice type, let alone do anything reasonable with it. Hell most females can't either.  Rule 1 though: Don't over do it.  Also, highs are overrated. Control is far more important than range imo.  Edit: Important thing about belting that high as a baritone. Control is insanely finicky. You are going to feel like the note is hanging just beyond your control. You have to relax. You're going to want to push harder. Don't. You'll lose it completely and potentially hurt yourself."

singing,3cmjce,Masklin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:46:36 2015 UTC,"First of all, we have a wonderful FAQ that has a bunch of great tips for learning how to sing. I'd also like to point you toward this article which has some general tips for handling performance nerves.   To get more specific... well, the first thing is, unhelpful as it sounds, you need to get over that fear. You need to find strategies that work for you, and everyone's different so there's no real one-size-fits-all trick that will make you feel better about being on stage. But, know that there's a difference between being nervous and being a complete wreck - everyone gets nervous, but what's important is that you overcome your fears (at least on the outside) and put on a good show.   As for how to do that, I think practice really does make perfect in this case. The more you get out there and perform, the better you get at it. Not just at the actual skill of singing or playing, but in terms of the whole performance. You learn how to feed off of audience energy and how to channel your nervous energy into a vivid performance. I think just doing it is really the only way to get good at that.   Also, I understand that being blind can feel like a disadvantage at times, but I promise you, I don't think it is. I actually generally perform without my glasses - while I'm not completely blind without them, I certainly can't see individual faces beyond a general wash of color in the audience. And, if I can help it, I usually have the lights turned up so I can't see the audience at all. I actually think it's an advantage not to see the audience - then you can't let them psych you out. And frankly, it shouldn't matter what their facial expressions are. In the end, you are performing to put on the best show you can, audience be damned. While of course it's nice if they enjoy themselves, I think most people enjoy seeing someone having a good time, not someone desperately trying to please them. Think of it like you interact with your friends. They probably like you better when you act like yourself and generally have fun, more than if you try to predict what they want and do everything you think they would like. Audiences are really the same way. If they don't like what you have to offer, that's not your fault and it's their loss.   So all that being said, get out there and sing! I personally find it easier to sing for complete strangers, so things like open mics are a great way to practice performing without the additional pressure of it being your closest friends or family members. But whatever works for you. The more you do it, the better you'll be. Promise."

Practice for years, listen intently as you sing, and make notes. The art of singing involves hard-wiring many different skills that are almost subconscious during a performance. It might help your intonation to feel down the road to the next note as you're singing the current note. Sing from center to center. Stretch out your feelings, Luke.

Without knowing what is wrong with your technique, we can't even begin to find solutions. You can try generic things like addressing breath support or changing your onset/phonatory cycle, but that probably won't get to the heart of the problem.   Also, I want to point out that skype teachers and coaches do exist (and in this case, I would definitely recommend a teacher over a coach, so do look for teachers in your area as well). Although it's always ideal to study with someone in person, I think skype lessons are a lot better than no lessons at all, so if it's just a matter of distance, I would really recommend looking into that."

I don't think any of them sang higher than a very rare F4 for all of them. Ton more too,  but that's a good start.   For more rock style, Johnny Cash, Brad Roberts, Matt Beringer, Darius Rucker, are all baritones and most stay down in that range. There's a lot more baritones in rock,  but a good bit of them just straight up shout some high notes and are not that good for karaoke.   Soul(ish) , you've got Lou Rawls, Isaac Hayes, Barry white(he might be too low). Soul music isn't my favorite so I don't know many, but I'm sure they exist. Many are baritones who shout or sing in falsetto on the high notes. Would not recommend shouting much, but using a falsetto on a few notes can work well in soul."

Red flag. You're correct--if you feel engaged muscles, you are constricting your throat, even if it feels like they're ""opening."" A properly opened throat feels like nothing. It's kind of like if you've ever done yoga, Alexander technique, or similar, when an instructor tells you to relax a body part, so you do, but then the instructor actually manipulates it for you, and you feel it release much more--feeling the open throat is more like this ""surprising"" extra release, where you're getting more relaxed than you previously thought you could. (That's kind of a murky description but I hope it makes sense.)  A constricted throat can impact vibrato, so it could well be a factor in your having little vibrato."

It's just too bad I can't just have my instructor manipulate my throat to properly relax it.  That being said, would laying on my back and singing scales help guide me in feeling what this ""extra release"" should feel like? I've done this a couple times before early in my training to help with my breathing technique, so I'd imagine if more of my neck muscles are disengaged (from otherwise holding my head up), I'd have a better grasp on how I should be relaxing. In your opinion, would this be a good place to start?"

Look up Alexander technique videos to find the best way to lie on your back (knees bent and feet flat on floor, maybe a book under your head to keep spine in line). Many people find singing this way very difficult at first, and it's exactly because you need to rely on breath and core muscles much more and neck muscles much less--and most people have been doing the opposite."

singing,3cl4xp,Sparkiano,2,Thu Jul 9 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Many people lower their larynges by simply shoving down with the base of the tongue, which is disastrous. If you're teaching yourself, it is very likely that you'll do this.   I'd work on the floor singing for now. For one, it might help reduce the movement in your larynx. Beyond that, I'd just focus on the neck feeling free and open, especially the muscles at the base of the neck in the front (right above the clavicles). If you can keep these (especially the sternocleidomastoid) relaxed (use gentle massage if you must), you'll already be several steps toward a freer larynx."
singing,3cl4xp,mezzolini,2,Thu Jul 9 14:04:27 2015 UTC,Not exactly. I've heard naturally high tenors still overcompress by lowering their larynx without enough head support.
singing,3cl4xp,mezzolini,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"If you habitually raise your larynx when you sing, then the muscles that raise the larynx are probably strong and habituated to rise. That means that any lowering of the larynx is going to start feeling unnatural and require muscle effort to counter the habit. I'd suggest alternating between raising and lowering the larynx, alternating between opening and closing the throat.   Sometimes, rather than pursuing that one perfect spot, it's more helpful to explore the range of what is possible...what all spots on the continuum feel like, before trying to settle in to that place of relaxation."
singing,3cl4xp,mwb2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"I do naturally sing with a relatively high larynx (rock, pop), probably because I wasn't classically trained to lower it.  What you're saying definitely makes sense. Having played the piano for most of my life, I know too well how bad muscle habits can be hard to break. It took me about a year of my piano teacher constantly correcting my hand posture until I naturally held a relaxed curve in my hands. Side effect of this was that now when my hands are relaxed, my fingers naturally curl into a loose fist.   I'll definitely try practicing lowering my larynx for a while and see if that helps with naturally opening up and relaxing my throat. If it worked for my hands, I imagine it should work for my throat."

singing,3cktms,frjy,6,Wed Jul 8 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"Not at all. The voice really doesn't develop until puberty, so there's not very much that can be done with young children, plus, there's a very high chance that their delicate little voices can get damaged from overuse too early.   But don't fear, there are great options for younger kids. Children's choirs are very common nowadays and are great for getting your child to sing with less pressure on each individual voice. A good choir will also focus on building general musicianship skills like note reading and solfège, which would really help later in the child's musical development.   Piano lessons or another instrument are also really helpful. In particular, piano and voice are really interconnected because so many songs are accompanied by piano. Frankly, every singer I know (myself included) wishes we had better piano skills so it is something that would get your child ahead of the game. Plus again it can really help with musicianship skills.   General music or movement classes are also increasingly available. Look for Orff or Kodály certified instructors - both methods are designed to expose young children to music and movement in age-appropriate and varied ways. Kindermusic is another program widely available.   I love that there are so many young children who love to sing, but in order to care for the voice and give the child the best skills, I really advocate for age-appropriate music learning. I think 14-15 is the ideal age to start private voice lessons, and maybe 12-13 for group lessons. Any younger and it's a waste of everyone's time and more dangerous."

I don't see there being a problem with it as long as it's something for which your child has shown interest and natural talent.   I grew up in church and was in choir before I was in 1st grade. We had a pretty serious rehearsal and performance schedule (and I loved it more than anything in the World). I'm still a singer/songwriter to this day. Use your best judgement.
singing,3cktms,terrycotta,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"I saw this a few days ago and am just now getting to it. I teach kids as young as 6, so here's my advice: if you can find the right teacher and your child really wants voice lessons, go for it!   What's the right teacher, though? If your child is not already taking piano lessons or some other instrument, the voice teacher has to be comfortable teaching the student how to read music. Find someone who's comfortable teaching combination voice & piano lessons.   What a teacher can accomplish (what I myself do) at that age is to make sure the student sings with his/her own sound, not imitating adults. A teacher or coach who doesn't correct a student when she is making too heavy of a sound for her instrument can make things much more difficult down the road.  I make sure the student learns to read notes, and if they aren't in other lessons, I teach them to play piano up to at least Level 1 in Faber & Faber, and major and minor scales. They typically end up learning to accompany themselves by playing basic chords. Once they can play a little piano, I start to teach sight-singing.   If you have a teacher in mind, find out when they hold recitals, and attend. (Alternately, ask if you can observe a couple of lessons--more than one, and hopefully not just the best students.) If you hear most of the students singing with an overly mature sound, and their voices crack, and it sounds like they're just yelling, steer clear. If their voices sound clear and healthy and they can easily sing higher songs, not just low ones, that's probably a good teacher. Make sure to ask the teacher about the curriculum, and practice requirements.  I have seen a lot of things that pass for 'teaching voice'--not requiring kids to practice, not giving vocal exercises in addition to songs, not teaching any kind of vocal technique, not teaching any kind of musical rudiments at all--kids end up not knowing how to do anything but imitate a recording.  If you don't find any good private teachers who take kids, just get piano lessons and try to find a children's choir. Because of the personal nature of the voice, I feel that no lessons are better than bad lessons. Kids' voices (even girls') end up changing in puberty, so as long as you make sure they develop musicianship, they can start actual voice lessons in their teens.  However, I have observed that many of my students know from an early age that they want to sing. They don't want to play piano any more than they have to, so voice lessons end up being a carrot to get them to learn more musical skills.   About the potential student: if they are interested in being able to sing better, and learning about music, then lessons are for them. If they just want to sing for fun, they may not like being asked to do as much work as lessons would require.  I hope this is helpful!"
singing,3cktms,mezzolini,0,Sun Jul 12 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a beginner myself but I think for someone that young a coach would be a good start, to gauge her dedication to the practice. That way, she can bring songs she enjoys and already understands the tune to. The coach can help her work on those songs rather than going really deeply into technique, they will also help with some grounded basics such as breath control, and how to use the voice properly as to not injure it."

A teacher is one thing (although as I mentioned I don't really think that's appropriate either), but there is absolutely nothing a coach could possibly provide for a six-year-old. Obviously they will not have developed technique, and the majority of stylistic concerns coaches typically deal with are well beyond the developmental reach of a young child. They're barely at the point of reading, much less developing character or worrying about diction. I honestly can't imagine how this could ever sound like a good idea.   Plus, the concept of ""dedication to the craft"" makes very little sense from a pedagogical perspective. The truth is, children at this age are not at a developmental stage where they can or should be tasked with ""dedication"" - it's just not a concept that young children can execute reliably, and numerous studies back that up. I think it's important to begin reading the cues children provide as far as their likes and dislikes, but the responsibility of deciding on one's craft is just unfeasible in younger students."

singing,3cktms,mwb2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, even so, ""coach"" implies on some level a person tasked with addressing higher-level performance concepts and repertoire, not something that matters for a beginner.   I also don't think the word ""dedication"" is terribly ambiguous. It implies some sort of long-term commitment or approach, which simply is beyond the vast majority of 6-year-olds. Obviously, it's possible to start studying piano or any number of other skills at that age (and I think the physiological concerns of young voices are by far the most relevant issue here), but they cannot be dedicated to it, at least beyond the most extraordinary of prodigies (which is really not a fair assumption for statistical reasons alone). I also don't think said dedication would be revealed from coachings or even lessons - children that young generally don't have the attention span for lessons and practice sessions, much less the self-motivation to do those things without some external motivation, i.e., not ""dedication"".  Of course, we can agree to disagree, but I stand by my original point that for many reasons, I don't feel a coach is at all useful for the average 6-year-old, and would be a giant waste of everyone's time, effort, and money."

I don't see why a child couldn't have, for example, an acting coach, or someone who helped them think about musicality in general.

It implies some sort of long-term commitment or approach, which simply is beyond the vast majority of 6-year-olds.   I just don't think that's true, as my personal experience (and that of the majority of instrumentalists I know, to say nothing of dancers and some athletes) belies this.    children that young generally don't have the attention span for lessons and practice sessions   Not true. They often can handle appropriately paced lessons and practice sessions. Thousands of young musicians, dancers, athletes, etc. were already somewhat accomplished by the age of 6.    much less the self-motivation to do those things without some external motivation, i.e., not ""dedication"".   OP said ""gauge her dedication"" - a 6-year-old won't show dedication in the same way as an adult, but can still be dedicated in an appropriate way. You seem to be defining ""dedication"" far more narrowly than a dictionary.   You're welcome to your own opinion, of course, but I wanted the OP to hear another perspective, since I disagree strongly."

I would suggest finding a teacher that teaches much more classical or Bel Canto-rooted technique, as it will ultimately be better for your voice in the long run and will enable you to sing stuff that isn't 'speech-level'. You should work on developing your head voice, which should make singing B4s and C5s quite achievable (especially as you say you can already get up near the 6th octave in falsetto), even in a Chris Cornell-style belt."

singing,3cipbp,grandtheftsam,3,Wed Jul 8 05:34:24 2015 UTC,"I would say to start with your score. Drill your part with a piano (or whatever instrument) and then wean yourself off the piano. Ideally, you'd also try to sing your part while playing another part (although this takes some coordination so don't worry if you can't do it at the beginning). The goal is to be really secure knowing your part in context, so you aren't thrown off when you hear another part.   Another thing to do is analyze your part for goalposts. There are usually spots where you either come into unison/octaves with another part, or at least a really recognizable chord or cadence. Use those to guide you - even if you get off on another part, you should be able to find your own part at those spots.   Thirdly, work it out in solfège (or whatever system you're most comfortable with). Again, the goal is basically damage control - even if you get lost, you should be able to find your notes based on the solfège.   Also, think about text wherever possible. Unless it's a really repetitive text, it can be a good memory aid for you to figure out where you are, especially in conjunction with the previous strategies. If you know a certain word is also going to be a nice, consonant chord, you can anticipate that and work from there. It's also helpful for remembering rhythm, which is half the battle.   Ultimately, though, memorization is a combination of a lot of different factors. Technically, there's no other way than ""brute memorization"" - you're asking your brain to do a pretty unnatural thing by remembering words and notes and rhythms, so on a certain level it's going to boil down to straight practice and repetition. But, you have to set your brain up for success by providing it with patterns and signs to get situated. In most cases, you are not singing completely random notes and rhythms, so it's just about figuring out the patterns and motives and getting them stuck in your brain."

singing,3cipbp,keakealani,2,Wed Jul 8 06:24:44 2015 UTC,"Well, it couldn't hurt to start working on some basic skills in piano, but even if you just do it vocally, it should help to sit with the music and make sure you're actually singing the right notes. I think it's probably easier with an instrument to check pitches, but whatever works for you!"
singing,3cipbp,kylepierce11,2,Wed Jul 8 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"Before I knew how to play piano,  I'd either record the group practicing the song on my phone,  or ask the accompanist to play your part while you record.

singing,3chwem,Ajv2324,2,Wed Jul 8 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"It might help if you could post a recording - I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ""choked up"".   That being said, yes, approaching consonants in the high part of your range is difficult! So you're not alone - it's really more of a physiological and acoustical problem.   One thing you can do is try to place the consonant in the same space as the vowel. As you probably know, the higher you sing, the more space you need for the vowel. This principle is also true for consonants, in a sense - although by definition consonants involve closing off the space, you should try to do so in such a way that it minimizes the time spent articulating the consonant, and get back to the vowel space ASAP. What this really means is some very flexible tongue action and other mouth movements so you can articulate as quickly and cleanly as possible and with as little movement as possible.   For example, many consonants are articulated with the front of the tongue coming in contact with the teeth, lips, or alveolar ridge. You can articulate those consonants by shoving a big section of your tongue against that part of the mouth, but you can also do it by just touching the tip of the tongue to that part. In this case, the ""just the tip"" method is going to be more precise and leave you more room for the vowel, which is ideal for high notes (really for all notes, but it's a lot easier to fudge in the middle and bottom of your range).   You can also actually modify some consonants. There is a point, for example, where voiced and unvoiced pairs are not that noticeable, so if you end a word that should have a ""d"" at the end but you use a ""t"", it won't really be noticeable. This should be used with caution since it works better in some words than others, but it's an option since voicing consonants can get really tricky at the top of your range.   And then frankly, there are some consonants that just get thrown away. At the really high end of any range, intelligibility is going to be an issue regardless, so if it's going to really compromise your technique, just don't worry about it and hope it's not a really important word. But I didn't tell you that XD"

singing,3ci9ae,Robbybrar,2,Wed Jul 8 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"Mathilde Marchesi has a book that contains a number of exercises. I own it, but actually I don't use it that frequently so I can't vouch for every single exercise. I will say that it's pretty advanced - most of the exercises are appropriate for about college level or thereabouts, but probably not beginners.   I know Richard Miller includes exercises and vocalises in many of his books, but I actually don't know which of them is best for that as I think they're mostly interspersed in broader books.   As far as strictly learning piano, Hanon is an option, but I do want to point out that there is a great potential for learning bad technique by playing Hanon without the guidance of a good piano teacher. They are not designed as standalone exercises that teach you anything by themselves, but rather drills to practice technical skills you would learn in a piano lesson setting. Just as improperly doing vocal exercises can potentially damage your voice and lead to unhealthy technique, so too can Hanon exercises do that for piano.   By the way, as a general rule you should not only warm up in one key. Not only is this kind of ridiculous on its face - you will by definition only be touching 7 of the 12 chromatic pitches and you will probably not be addressing the full extent of your range, but it's just unnecessarily limiting. Normally, exercises are done ascending or descending chromatically (by half step), so you might start an exercise in C major, then in C# major, then D major, and so forth. This is probably the easiest way to ensure that you learn how to tackle any technical issues at any part of your range and in a variety of contexts. Plus it's way less boring =P"

The third section goes into scales, arpeggios, and chord progressions. The rest of the book is a pretty mechanical approach to building piano technique. Vary the rhythms and subdivisions to your pleasure to get more out of this method. I like starting slow and speeding up by subdivision rather than by explicitly changing tempo.

The real solution here is to get a free app like Vocal Ease or just download an mp3 file of a basic piano scale and sing along to that in your car on the way to band practice.  In-car time is your best warmup time.  It's not perfect because you're sitting and your singing posture will be different but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing.  If that's not an option just get to practice 30 minutes early and warm up there.  If the guys in your band give you a hard time or make fun of you for warming up you tell them to shut the fuck up while adults are working.

(ever notice how everyone is sick after finals?) It's not that you suddenly got really sick, it's that you've been sick for a while, but your body was going into overdrive to suppress it, and now that you're giving it a chance to rest, that's what it's going to do. It's the ""it'll get worse before it gets better"" kind of thing. I have no idea if that's what's actually going on with you, but it's not outside of the realm of possibility.

singing,3cgbrj,ghoti023,0,Wed Jul 8 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"I think the majority of singers here (especially the males) are trying to sing contemporary/pop styles, not classical. And truly high-level classical disallows certain things that pop styles admit. I would say they are radically different and diametrically opposed. So whatever you might hear from males successfully singing through and above the passaggio in contemporary styles is point-blank wrong in classical, and almost nothing they say or demonstrate about their singing technique will in any way help you sing classical.  [EDITED to remove harmless but apparently incendiary remarks written too flippantly to accurately explain the history and evolution of the tenor voice.]  However if you're a baritone, there is not even a similar divergent path for the voice unless all you want to do is sing small character roles (comprimario). To be able to sing any serious baritone literature, you must learn to sing in a strongly chest-voice-dominated sound over the entire range of 2+ octaves, and this is done not by lightening the voice or by lip trills or ""twang"" or by doing any of the little tricks that contemporary styles are constantly offering. It is done primarily by being unafraid to sing very vigorously, mastering the correct breathing coordination, by removing all constrictive tensions of the throat/jaw/face/mouth (and they are legion), and by altering the timbre of your voice—that is, retaining core/""chest voice"" to form very clear vowels while simultaneously deepening and darkening the vowel quality as you ascend in pitch. This is true for serious tenors, as well.  This is very, very difficult. In fact, I'd say that for every generation, only a handful of guys ever achieve it and master it to a very high degree."

singing,3cgbrj,ghoti023,0,Tue Jul 7 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Now if you're a tenor, the business lets you do all kinds of crazy throaty, nasal, constricted shit and call yourself a ""Rossini tenor"" (Florez, Brownlee, and their ilk), but that way of singing cannot negotiate the demands of any of the major literature of grand opera—Verdi and beyond. The so-called ""Rossini tenor"" is not the kind of voice most people want because it's small, limited, and too specialized (which is to say, underdeveloped).   I would like to point out that it is physically impossible to be both throaty and nasal at the same time, as both are extreme opposites in terms of placing the sound too forward or too backwards. (removal credit to /u/mwb2)""Underdeveloped"" is also just not true. It sounds more like you just don't like the sound of Rossini tenors (entirely fair), but that does not mean their technique is poor. In fact, they wouldn't be able to have long-standing careers if it was. I don't like Maria Callas, but you don't see me going about bashing her technique as though she were an inexperienced teenager. Also, just because you're a tenor does not mean you are suited for Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and the like. Much like how you would never have a coloratura soprano sing Tosca and expect it to sound good, you'll never hear a Rossini tenor sing Verdi. It's not because they can't, it's because Verdi/Puccini/Wagner is all too big for their voice. They could sing it, it would just be a bad career move. Every voice type in classical literature has that same limitation. Rossini tenors sing Mozart far better than any of the Verdi tenors, and if Mozart is ""limited"" (being that he and Rossini are two of the most performed operatic composers of all time. I do believe that they even count as ""major literature of grand opera."") then frankly, we just won't and can't see eye to eye. Rossini tenors have everything from 1800 and before to sing (which is quite a few centuries), and there are plenty of Romantic composers (Brahms, Schubert, Johann Strauss) that don't require such a large sound, and a PLETHORA of modern composers. ""Limited"" is just so factually wrong, I can't wrap my head around it."

Without joining the general argument in this branch of the thread, I have to disagree with this.  First, ""placement"" doesn't really mean a whole lot. Scientifically speaking, you cannot ""place"" sound--a sound wave fills all open space in the vicinity.   ""Nasal,"" technically, just means sound comes out the nose because the soft palate isn't totally blocking the nasopharynx. This is independent of what happens in the throat.  ""Throaty"" can mean a lot of things, but if what /u/TotoCotogni means is either tongue tension or constriction of the larynx, both are possible without full closure of the nasopharynx--hence, both throaty and nasal at the same time."

The only thing that differentiates singers of different styles is how familiar they are with the style, and training. So start by listening to gospel singers - don't imitate, just analyze what they're doing and understand the idioms. How do they ornament (ornamentation is big in gospel music so that's important)? What's the diction like? How do they handle dynamics and phrasing? What's the general timbre/tone color like?   From there, seek out a good coach in that style and work from there. A coach can help you perfect those little style elements that might have escaped your notice, and also suggest new repertoire to try and things like that."
singing,3cbg52,Awenna,6,Mon Jul 6 16:37:43 2015 UTC,I have this exact same problem. I'll be watching this thread closely.
singing,3cbg52,jakeinator21,3,Mon Jul 6 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't have one already, you should find yourself a teacher.  They are going give you exercises and use language that specifically works for you.  We're just randos on the internet.   My favorite exercise for this is similar to what MalevolentMuse mentioned. It's really just a more controlled and exacted siren.  On a pure vowel sound, go up on the triad to the octave, but hit every note in the scale on the way down.  (1-3-5-1'-7-6-5-4-3-2-1).  Raise a half-step and repeat. I personally prefer doing it all legato.  Be sure to do it with all the various vowel sounds, so you can learn about vowel modification at the top end of your range.  Alternatively, you can add a bit more time at the top of the octave.   Instead go 1-3-5-1'-7-1'-2'-1'-7-6-5-4-3-2-1.  Doing that around and above your break is going to help you learn to smooth everything out and add some strength and control to your top end."
singing,3cbg52,Bothan_Spy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"I don't believe cord closure is actually the root issue here. What you've described sounds like a classic case of pushing the chest voice function up too far, and pressing the cords together too much, which makes it impossible to access the stretched cords needed to go gradually into your mix. That's why you suddenly break to a weak falsetto over middle C.  The ""goog"" or ""gug"" patterns that people advocate can sometimes work, because both the G consonant and the ""oo"" (as in ""book"" or ""food""--either works) release the back of the tongue and can help release the larynx (as long as you make sure you're truly singing those vowels, and not sliding more towards ""AW"")."
singing,3cbg52,mwb2,2,Tue Jul 7 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like this could be the case. I'll definitely do more of the ""gugs"". Though, what should I do when I reach the break? It's going to flip, so just let it happen and proceed as what feels most natural? Or try to put an effort to make a less jumpy switch between the registers?"
singing,3cbg52,enjarcher,2,Tue Jul 7 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"Sirens on lip rolls (look them up) are a good exercise to find mixed/head voice. It's sounds like what you're calling 'head voice' is really just falsetto/reinforced falsetto. Is it quite loud? Can you feel some breath pressure in your chest when you do it? If the answer to these is no, you probably haven't found head voice yet.  Another way to find it is by sure bing on a sharp, loud, slightly nasal (but easy) 'eh' sound. You need to have adequate nasal resonance and cord closure ('non-breathiness') in order to mix and find head voice. Also try sirening on a hum - but not a quiet, soft hum. Done correctly, it will feel really quite loud and you should be able to feel some degree of vibration in  your nose/face. But in all of these examples, the volume and clarity comes not from increased effort and airflow- rather, you should focus on making your sound 'sharper' which will make it use less air, project more, and mix much better."
singing,3cbg52,enjarcher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I don't quite know if it's headvoice or falsetto. I can do a really loud and strong sound with barely any excess breath, but with little to no vibration on chest. If I do sing in a way that makes my chest vibrate slightly, the sound becomes breathy, quieter and weaker. Maybe just a very strong falsetto then? Thank you for the excellent tip though, these ones are really helpful =)"
singing,3cbg52,fender315,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"It's not vibration of the chest that you're looking for. If your chest is vibrating, you're singing in chest voice (or a mix). Complete head voice will cause no more chest vibration than falsetto. What I mean is that head voice will feel supported. The air will pass out slowly, almost as if you're holding your breath. And it will be much louder than falsetto."

singing,3cbg52,Najarin8D,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, you can't sing ANYTHING at all from where your voice breaks a few notes above middle C (say F?) until your falsetto kicks in at C5?"

The original recording from 1973 should be in the original key, if you're looking to find a version that matches your sheet music.

I am sure I am reading this wrong (have been trying to learn to read sheet music for 20 years and still can't do it!).

singing,3cb00h,keakealani,5,Mon Jul 6 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"I see! I get it!  That's not an F4. It looks like an F4, but when you see a treble clef in men's vocal literature, you actually take it an octave down, so you would sing an F3. It appears you are listening to the original key'd version of C Maj (it's early for me, I should have been able to figure that out). Sorry - my bad.  Normally, the treble clef would look something like this, which indicates that you are to sing it an octave lower than written. It's a notation that's going out of style, but I promise - no one expects you to sing Piano Man starting on an F4.  So yes, if you want sheet music to match your recording, you'd want it in Cmaj.

There are nuances of pronunciation that stick out like a sore thumb to oneself, but that other people don't hear or care about.  Anyway, I think you need to keep a more consistent tone throughout the song.  When you emphasize words, your tone becomes more full and (unnaturally?) dark.  It doesn't really work well with the lighter breathier tone you're using for other parts, which I think suits the song better.  And, it sounds a little forced.

It's perfectly fine to sing softer, you don't need to replicate the volume of a stage performance and keep in mind that volume is EQ'd by the sound team, same with in studio in pre/post-pro. So trying to match things like volume in a personal no flair attached recording can do harm. Search for some warmups that assist with loosening you up. I routinely roll my head around while warming up, also making sure that my tongue is completely relaxed, it should just fall flat against your lower mouth, almost lifeless. Don't lift your head for high notes, I think I can hear you doing this. Don't reach for the notes with your body, if you feel you need to do this tilt your head down instead, or use your arms.

Wordreference is pretty good for most French and Italian (though it won't tell you the open/closed vowels in Italian verb conjugated forms). For German, I use dict.leo.org, but it doesn't have IPA. It does have lots of audio files, though, and I'm able to transcribe the IPA based on that, so if you're already solid with German IPA and just need to know which vowels are open/closed and that sort of thing, it should be good enough. Otherwise, there's also a wordreference.com dictionary for German."

singing,3cbove,mwb2,3,Tue Jul 7 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"If you just need a general reference, any good modern English-Whatever dictionary should have IPA.  The caveat is that if you're using them for classical music, they're often missing some of the more literary or out-of-date words.  To get those, you should use Florio's 1611 Italian-English dictionary (online) and Cotgrave's 1611 French-English dictionary (also online). (There's no equivalent German resource that I know of.)  I should mention that Wiktionary often has decent IPA. Finally, the most authoritative pronunciation guide for German is Theodor Siebs's German Pronunciation Dictionary, but there's no English in it. For Italian (including all verb conjucations), it's the Lo Nuovo Zingarelli dictionary, 1982 printing (you can get it on ebay).  To do classical translations and IPA well, you need to use several resources."

singing,3cad1t,st-iman,4,Mon Jul 6 10:17:17 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are. I was there for a long time. I have started taking serious singing classes for about 6 months now. I found that practicing at least 20 minutes per day helps a lot with consistency of your voice and range. I might be off on this but i'm speaking out of personal experience. Drink enough water. Also very important is to listen to your body and NOT your voice. Listening to your voice will only distract you from listening to your body. Your body tells you what feels right and wrong but sometimes we can't make that connection. If you can afford a singing coach, get one. It might be expensive but it is something that you will have for the rest of your life. Once you understand how you can listen to your body, you can move on to listening to your voice etc. But for the most part articulation and breath support are the most important i would say."
singing,3cad1t,cruzz903,3,Mon Jul 6 14:06:31 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling you're trying to sing stuff outside your vocal range when it sounds bad...?

singing,3cad1t,keakealani,3,Tue Jul 7 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! First of all, I'm so glad you're interested in singing. Don't lose that - your love and interest in singing is what will get you through the learning period, which can be tough.   I first want to address your experiences with lack of control and consistency. First and foremost, this is because you're right in the middle of puberty (actually, in vocal terms, you're on the very early end of it, really). Contrary to popular belief, girls' voices change during puberty. Yes, you don't drop an octave like your male counterpart, but many girls go through a significant change in the voice during the teens and twenties, and this can absolutely affect how your voice feels and sounds on any given day.   For myself, I experienced a long period where it was a lot like you describe - my voice would ""behave"" some days, and other days it just sounded awful. This is very common. Just like boys may experience cracking or other not-so-pretty sounds, girls can definitely have the same issues. In both cases, your vocal folds are growing and maturing, and this process isn't always even or predictable, leading to days, weeks, or months where your voice doesn't do what you want it to. Plus, you have to relearn the muscle memory for making it work, because the actual muscles are different in the mature voice than in the prepubescent voice.   That being said, the other big reason you may experience difficulty is because you are not trained (yet). Just like athletes must practice basic skills before playing on the varsity team, or you had to learn to add before you could start algebra, you have to train basic skills in your voice before you can sing really well. For whatever reason, a lot of people think they should be able to sing out of the womb, but this is not true! Almost everyone starts from a pretty terrible place, but through practice and dedication, you build skills.     All this being said, I strongly encourage you to start studying with a teacher. It can be very dangerous business, especially when you're young and your voice is still developing, to try to teach yourself to sing. And, quite frankly, it's almost never successful. Self-teaching usually just sets you up for lots of bad habits that you'll have to spend ages breaking, rather than actually building on sustainable skills. You are at a really good age to begin lessons (actually, you're on the young side - I didn't start until I was 16 and that felt early compared to many of my peers). Do yourself a favor and set up a good foundation first. If you don't want to sing professionally or whatever later, that's fine (most of my studio-mates in high school did not go on to sing in college or professionally). But if you end up wanting to pursue singing further, you'll be much better off by having a solid foundation rather than a bunch of bad habits that can potentially damage your voice."
singing,3cad1t,SevenSixtyOne,2,Tue Jul 7 21:31:01 2015 UTC,What a lovely post.  Most singers aren't very good when they start out.   Same for any professional musician.  When they first picked up their instrument they were horrible at it.  Practice and lessons are the only ways to go.
singing,3c9dbe,Entershakira,7,Mon Jul 6 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Most voices are going to fall into the middle categories, regardless of gender. Most males are natural baritones, as opposed to true basses or true tenors.  Most women are going to be somewhere in the middle of the soprano range, if not mezzo sopranos (due in large part to how female voices are categorized- I'm using the German fach system). Fewer women will be in the higher soprano type, and the rarest are true contraltos.  Edit: some clarification."
singing,3c9dbe,SirButthat,2,Mon Jul 6 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"Very good point. The fach system and a lot of other systems is not really balanced - it places a lot of voice types in the overarching ""soprano"" category, from very high voices to the higher end of mid (especially if you count tessitura more than range). So it kind of depends on how you count it.   Edit: And as a side note, do you happen to know why this is? I've always kind of wondered why soprano is such a huge category."
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,2,Mon Jul 6 06:43:58 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the prevalence of different types of opera roles that operagoers want to watch. Tenors and sopranos are the lead roles of many operas, with a growing interest in the baritone voice, so most of the focus is going to be on those roles."
singing,3c9dbe,SirButthat,2,Mon Jul 6 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. I'm a coloratura, and I feel like we're a dime a dozen while I've only met maybe two young people who are going to be true contraltos."
singing,3c9dbe,Tri_Sara_Tops,4,Mon Jul 6 10:06:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your are talking about when you soprano and alto and Tenors.   Tenors  in the operatic tradition are more common than the true bass,  but less common than the baritone,  which has grown to encompass slightly  lower to middle voice type.  The female equivalents are soprano,  mezzo soprano,  contra  alto.  Sopranos are more common than contra Altos  and  less common than mezzo Sopranos.  In total I'd say less than 10% of people are Contra Altos  and true Basses in the operatic tradition.   You notice that I didn't say alto, because female voice types aren't called alto,  yet this is the part they sing.  Your average alto section in a choir is mostly Mezzo-soprano,  just like your average bass section are actually  baritones.  Choirs tend to have more people able to sing the bass parts and soprano parts,  but this doesn't mean that there are less people suited for the alto part vs soprano.  It's unclear if the  voice parts are not evenly split or there's a bias in who tends to join Choirs and the training  involved. There is often a bias in the parts people want to sing,  so there easily could be a bias in who joins.   Ohhh and true tenors aren't that rare,  it's just most men have almost zero singing skills and are unable to sing High enough that it sounds like a tenor,  or they are afraid  to sing because they will be perceived as feminine. While they aren't the norm,  I think more than 10% of men have a tenor type of voice.  I've also heard sopranos might be more common than tenors,  but that's unclear to me."
singing,3c9dbe,Mattpilf,5,Mon Jul 6 03:13:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen a study published by a great university in my country and according to it, the higher voices are more common and the lower are the rarest here, so we have lots of tenors and sopranos (not US). Also, I remember reading (but this Inger I can't remember where I read it) that in Russia tenors were harder to find. It might also depend on where you are from."
singing,3c9dbe,Loooooooollipop,2,Mon Jul 6 06:17:59 2015 UTC,"I would love to see this study, if you could post a citation! I'm always interested in things like this, and I also wonder if country/region affects the spread of voice types. I think much of it has to do with which voice types are most ""sought after"", as most of the time it's impossible to accurately measure the voice type of the general untrained population.   Russian singing is a good example. Because they have such a large culture of low bass singing, I think basses are much more likely to sing in Russian than in, say, the US. So it may not be that they have more basses (or comparably fewer tenors), but that tenors are less likely to try to sing, while basses are more likely.   Similarly, in the US and many other countries, tenor voices are highly encouraged in the pop scene, leading to an overrepresentation of tenors overall (since pop is one of the most widely-exposed genres)."
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,3,Mon Jul 6 06:37:40 2015 UTC,"Is there an effect here of self-selection? Women with low voices / tessituras might be put off by there not being many solos and the choral parts being harder (not the tune, more concentration required). It's easy to be a soprano. It's more likely that a woman with a high voice will want to be a singer, full stop.   The opposite could be true for men, leading to more basses/baritone than tenors, but tenors tend to get good parts so something else is probably at play there. Are low notes more enjoyable for male singers?   It could well be that the ranges are normally distributed but how people make choices about singing is not."
singing,3c9dbe,Eskoala,5,Mon Jul 6 07:31:12 2015 UTC,"Most women are Mezzo-Sopranos(In between Soprano and Contralto)  Alto is a vocal range or choir part. Contralto is the low female voice. Lots of lower Mezzo-Sopranos sing Alto, but lots of Mezzo-Sopranos think Soprano is ""prettier"" and more ""feminine"" and will strive to sing that part."
singing,3c9dbe,MalevolentMuse,3,Mon Jul 6 03:06:26 2015 UTC,What? The vast majority of women are sopranos. Sopranos and baritones are a dime a dozen.
singing,3c9dbe,ioannium,2,Mon Jul 6 05:55:33 2015 UTC,"Not really. The reason sopranos seem to be dime a dozen is because a) they have the majority of opera leads and b) most mezzos can comfortably sing choral soprano. Thus making it seem like there are a lot more sopranos than there actually are. In addition, the timbre of a mezzo comes in more fully with significant training, meaning that a lot of untrained singers who ""sound like sopranos"" are really natural mezzos who haven't really spent enough time developing that color. In most Western regions, pop and folk styles encourage brightness in the voice that can ""mask"" a mezzo color.   Statistically, in both sexes, most voices are middle voices, if for no other reason than the bell curve. But, there are biases that cause it to seem otherwise because of a variety of factors."
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,5,Mon Jul 6 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"Really? In my experience, most women are sopranos. I don't think there's been a big study, but you see it all the time at auditions, pay-to-sings, and any music department of decent size. There's always more sopranos than anything else. Maybe it's just skewed because of the age. If anything, there's more women in choirs singing in the alto section that are there because they don't have the training to extend their range to a full soprano.   There are so few contraltos. I think they're rarer than basses and counters."
singing,3c9dbe,elerico,2,Mon Jul 6 07:52:28 2015 UTC,"I think there's a selection bias. More sopranos choose to go into singing because there are more roles, it seems more glamorous, whatever. Also perhaps age is a factor. In my experience in the community chorus world, though, I hear more middle voices.   Also someone else mentioned that the fach system is a bit unbalanced since it includes a large number of different voice types in the category of soprano, so that's a factor, too."
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,3,Mon Jul 6 20:19:17 2015 UTC,totally agree. a soprano without vowel mods could easily be a mezzo.
singing,3c9dbe,Tri_Sara_Tops,2,Mon Jul 6 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"I find this really interesting...how can you tell, then, if a singer is actually a mezzo who has been ""masking"" her voice? Does it have to do more with timbre or range? (I know mezzos with crazy upper extensions/whistles so I find that part very confusing.)"
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,2,Mon Jul 6 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's how the singer is trained. I'm operating from the assumption that there is a ""natural"" voice and the possibility of affectation due to genre/style. Which might or might not be a completely fair assumption. But I think there aren't really that many people with a true soprano tessitura, although they have that whistle/extension."
singing,3c9dbe,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with your description text and the other texts. I find that in normal life, I run into way way many more tenors than baritones. low voices seem to be a lot more uncommon. however i think most of these people who are tenors don't know how to sing and don't realize what their voice class is. I live in the u.s. btw for geographical reference.  as far as voice classes for women go, i've never really heard a common pattern comparing alto and soprano, they seem about even to me. and i've heard a ton of contraltos contrary to other opinions.  in my 7 years of singing, i've found that none of these voice 'occurances' estimates are remotely accurate."
singing,3c9dbe,keakealani,3,Mon Jul 6 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"I've been singing in choirs as a tenor for 27 years. In that time tenors have always been underrepresented. In many choirs baritones are forced to sing tenor because there aren't enough. The only choirs I've been a part of that had an equal number of tenors were auditioned choirs that had more applicants than spots. Now all that is anecdotal, but the statistics back me up.  Baritones, without doubt, outnumber all other male parts. Tenor is next, followed last by true bases (rarest of all voices, period)."
singing,3c9dbe,AegnorWildcat,2,Mon Jul 6 05:18:21 2015 UTC,"This is consistent with my experience, too. I don't have as many years (although I've been an active choral singer for about 15 years, albeit a few of those were in the children's chorus world where this is not a relevant discussion).  Another point about choral singing is that in my experience, larger-voiced sopranos and tenors get shoved down to alto/bass respectively because it's difficult for them to blend in their prime tessitura. But, this almost never happens the other way around (although I've definitely seen baritones be forced to sing tenor to balance the numbers). So if we're also going by choral measurements, there's a chance that a ""real"" soprano or tenor is simply singing a lower part to avoid blending issues - this happens a lot in college choirs where the singers are at the point in their training where they don't want to compromise their newly-formed technique for the sake of blend. (I have opinions about this practice, but it's not relevant here XD)"
singing,3c9dbe,MalevolentMuse,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:09:38 2015 UTC,"At any rate, it comes down to your definition. I've heard bari-tenors and lyric baritones be classified as bass-baritones in opera. Anything can happen really.  But in terms of kind of voice a true baritone has, they are very uncommon. You are most likely confusing a bari-tenor with a baritone.  Also.... i'm sure male sopranos are more rare than basses. I’ve only ever heard one male soprano, he was a japanese man."

Here's a Bass talking about Oktavists and this technique. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EapGp2CzB5k"

singing,3c6bxx,MalevolentMuse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"No problem! It's hard though. Another bass told me it took him a very long time to develop the extension and then just as long to try to connect it to his chest voice. I think it was like 2 years total, but I'm not sure. It's something to work on if you want. Being a Bananatone I mostly just work on connecting my high range extension, so I can't help you too much."

singing,3c6bxx,Mattpilf,2,Mon Jul 6 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"Hi The real question  is what do you want to sound like. Fry is considered unnatural  because your voice lack power, projection,  clarity,  personality(the all kind of sound the same),  and flexibility when used.  Record yourself from just a few meters singing some phrases and you'll see what I'm talking about. Fry is also considered unhealthy  because in excess it can be harmful to the voice.  There are  vocal disorders that cause damage from singing too low for too long. If you are specifically looking to train your lower range a bunch or sing in vocal fry these become serious concerns.   If you want to sound like a bass guitar when processed  through a microphone, fry works. If you want to sound like Kurt Moll,  vocal fry won't help.  Or if you want to sound like a Russian oktavist,  who some say you have to train your upper range for your low range to fully develop. Ask yourself what you want and what's possible and why you want this.    You can't train your voice to be much deeper or richer in the low end,  but you can train your voice to be resonant in the upper end and allow your rich voice to come through. Most men have a sufficient  low range that doesn't require extensive training.  Even when you find someone who through training  and genetics manages to hit really deep notes for their voice type,  they rarely  sound good or are useful.  The often can use them sparingly,  and they lack a lot of color and projection."

At one point I could pull off a good D1, and that's impressive given that I'm only a bari-tenor, although I rarely use fry anymore.  Not sure why people say fry would be unhealthy, because it's not. But kargyraa can be unhealthy due to the intense manipulation of the vestibular folds."
singing,3c6bxx,MalevolentMuse,-1,Sun Jul 5 07:31:45 2015 UTC,Fry is unhealthy. You're probably a baritone and not a real bass. Don't practice fry. Develop your chest and head voice.

I could barely hit notes when I first started, but now I'm taking serious lessons and practice every day. I'm still not that great, but I'm wayyyy better than where I started, and that makes me happy since I enjoy it.  Definitely record yourself singing and practice some basic scales to get started. I'm sure someone has posted something on here for beginners.  I wouldn't quit your job any time soon though. Try some open-mic events if you feel up for it.

singing,3c4aay,MalevolentMuse,3,Sat Jul 4 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I was so nervous I kept shaking. The lessons started out as a few months of just getting used to my voice, singing, and singing in front of someone else. It also helped me start to build up a regular practice schedule and to start recording my progress. I sounded quite bad when I started, but I had a cheap grad student as my teacher who kept messing up the piano part every few seconds anyway... I then took a few months off to practice on my own because she couldn't help me access my high range because of her inexperience. Last month I started take lessons with a very good teacher, but I have to pay 100 dollars a month and take the bus down to the music shop where he teaches. Well worth it though!"
singing,3c4aay,keakealani,6,Sat Jul 4 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"I think there are two different things at play. You're depressed, which is a psychoneurological condition, leading to irrational thoughts and behaviors, overgeneralizations, and self-esteem issues. There could be lots of reasons for this, but I would encourage you to see a trained mental health professional about that, because I doubt we can help you much.   The other thing is misconceptions about singing. For many reasons, a lot of people have the mistaken impression that you are born with ""talent"" to sing (or a number of other skills). For the most part, this isn't true. Barring rare physical complications, everyone has the ability to sing and sound pretty good. But, you actually have to learn how to sing, just like you have to build skills to be a great athlete or a heart surgeon. Nobody is born with those skills.   It doesn't sound like you've had much serious vocal training, which means you shouldn't expect to suddenly have strong skills in singing. That's a little like expecting to be an Olympic athlete without and coaching or training. So if you seriously want to learn how to sing, nothing is stopping you - go learn. Just don't expect it to fall in your lap without hard work and dedication."

Ever since then I've done it for myself.  I'm not great by any stretch of the imagination but I'm good.  I can hit notes.  I can sound decent.  And I didn't get there from worrying about what I sounded like.  I've never taken lessons and I really want to; I've only been singing for about 2 years.  But I'm going to continue to improve because I know that I can.    Sometimes I really want to record music but don't because I feel like whatever I make will be dumb or sound bad.  It really gets me depressed sometimes but I know that I'm a lot better than I ever was when I started.  Don't ever give up, and make recordings.

He uploaded a song and he was great. He wasn't hitting every note, but he had his own voice. I'm kinda hoping for that.  My mom never really cared at all about my music. But I remember the day when she asked how I was doingafter I moved. For the first time she'd payed interest in it and I knew it ment something.  I was recording and I've got some gear. Maybe I shoud get back to it. My hope was that I might make some electronica/radiohead style thing with alot of effects on my voice. Kinda hiding everthing behind layers of effects."

That's the thing isn't it? Sing it ""pround""! That's the problem I'm facing. I can't scream from the top of my lungs in my flat. Windows would brake...

It might have been the rejection that got me to start seeing a vocal coach but singing has now become a big part of my life. It is fun, I feel empowered, I can summon a power in my voice that lets me be heard infront of a crowd or in a meeting and of course I dare sing with an audience.     Still the fear is holding me back. I miss a note, I lose my support and it takes a second to regain it - something I'm currently working on to overcome. I've realized and my vocal coach keeps telling me that it's alright to miss a note, people forget about it. But if you lose your support and confidence they will notice and remember.

I'd recommend taking lessons and recording yourself practice every day. It's a good way to help pick things you want to work on and also a good way to actually notice the progress you're making.  If your neighbors think you're a loser for practicing something you want to get better at then they're probably not very cool people anyways.   On a final note don't let your age stop you from learning or make you feel ashamed. I'm 27 started taking voice lessons about a year ago, because I liked to write poetry and wanted to translate it into writing songs and lyrics. Guess what? A year later I still have A LOT to learn but I can see a huge improvement from last year.  Just remember it's not that you can't sing it's that you don't know how yet."

I won't pretend to have a fix for your nervousness other than just doing it and always reminding yourself, ""what do YOU care what other people think?""  It is worth it though, and you'll find people are much more positive than you'll let yourself believe. Trust me, I feel like I do pretty well and I still struggle to take a compliment without saying, ""oh but my timing was off here, and my notes were flat here, and I forgot this word...""  Like a good friend of mine told me when we performed Messiah as amateurs in an even more amateur choir: ""it might not be the best version they've ever heard, but it's ours.""

singing,3c5ffu,Dageenius,7,Sat Jul 4 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"Welcome to retraining your body from sports to singing! I will be your guide. I spent 10 years as a gymnast, 5 years as a dancer, and currently a weightlifter and runner.   This is something that you will have to fight for time and time again over the years if you want to seriously study voice. This is not for the faint of heart.   First and foremost, you have to give up extraordinary control over your abdominal wall. Don't know what sport you played, but I'm guessing that your abs are used to being flexed one way: hard as fuck. Relaxing your abdominal wall takes time. It's simple, but not easy to keep it flexible. At the beginning, I never want you to feel like you're pushing air, just that you're letting it fall out.   Next, you're going to have to disassociate your upper ribs expanding with getting a ""big breath."" Your new ""big breath"" is low. It stretches your obliques, your lower back into your floating ribs, and your abdominal wall.   When you exhale, your goal is to keep the expansion up around your last few true ribs, maybe 2 inches below your sternum. It's common for voice teaches to put a rope around that area. Not to synch it, but as a reminder. If you let that expansion go, the rope will fall. Another way to accomplish the same thing is to moderately press an object (fist, cup, whatever) just below your sternum. You have to press against it while you sing.  If you want exercises, the Farenelli maneuver is ubiquitous among singing teachers. I still use it and variations on it, and I've graduated from undergrad.  I'm glad that you see this as important. My journey started in musical theater after gymnastics, and that just enforced the same bad habits in me. (Not that there's anything wrong with MT, it was just not good for my voice at that time). If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask, here or PM."
singing,3c5ffu,elerico,2,Sun Jul 5 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"The two responses here so far are great. Depending on who is reading it though, those answers may seem complex. The first step might just be to find any other way to breathe that isn't a ""chest breath"".  Try this: Lie down and put a book on your tummy. When you breathe, try to make the book rise and fall with your breath. If you're used to ""chest breathing"" obviously the book won't move since it is your chest that is rising and falling. Once you get the hang of directing where the air goes and what body parts move to make room for the breath, then give those other answers a closer read over. A little note: air obviously isn't going into your belly. That's where your intestines are. But you can pretend you are filling your belly up with airif that helps. What is actually happening is that your diaphragm flattens out and goes down on the inhale. This pushes your guts out! haha. So this will be hard to do if you can't relax your ab muscles which I imagine is common for athletes."
singing,3c5ffu,TheHighestHigh,2,Sun Jul 5 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"Another note. We can call what I wrote a ""belly breath"". A step up from a ""chest breath"". But the ""rib breath"" is best in my opinion and that seems to be what the other answers will help get you to achieve."
singing,3c5ffu,TheHighestHigh,2,Sun Jul 5 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"Breathing through your diaphragm mean next to nothing physiologically, since you can't actually feel where your diaphragm is (no proprioceptive nerve endings). You can infer where it is by using your kinaesthetic sense of what your abdominal wall, lower back extensors, and hip flexors are doing, and this is the key to abdominal breathing. People who teach ""diaphragmatic"" breathing I find to be charlatans, because in truth, all breathing is accomplished with the diaphragm. ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"" and in singing this is more true than usual.  Find an accomplished teacher to show the ropes, and know that nothing valuable comes cheap. Best of luck"
singing,3c5ffu,Deepblueish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"In singing, it means a very specific thing physiologically: breathing in such a way as to ensure 1) maximum descent of the diaphragm; followed by 2) delayed ascent of the diaphragm.   Neither of these things is easy to control. I keep seeing people say ""all breathing is done with the diaphragm"" here. True, but that's like saying ""all piano playing is done with the fingers."" Some of us use our fingers better than others. Yes, you can't feel it, but yes, you need to influence its movement. ""Abdominal breathing"" IS diaphragmatic breathing (though I dislike the term ""abdominal breathing"" more, but that's just me).  At the same time, it is definitely true that the phrase ""diaphragmatic breathing"" gets misused a LOT; but that doesn't mean it's bunk."

singing,3c3faj,nuferasgurd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"Range is not the primary determiner of what your voice type is. There's an old opera tale of Leonard Warren (world-renowned American baritone) peeking his head into the dressing room of the tenor, who was trying to warm up to his high C, blasting it out, and saying ""is that the note you're looking for?""  What does determine what kinds of roles you will get is your tessitura, which is the average of all the notes you will sing in a song, a set, or a career. Some songs go really high, but only for a moment, and those may be approachable by a lower voice, whereas a song which doesn't go as absolutely high, but stays higher in general, will slaughter your throat. Lots of experimentation and good guidance from a trusted, in-the-room-with-you teacher are key. As far as the singers you mentioned, they both have well-developed squilo, or ""bite"" in their tone, which is what makes the upper extension ring out so clearly. This has less to do with where the voice is focussed (right under the nose and behind the cheeks), and a lot more to do with excellent air support. Some people have it intrinsically, and some have to learn it with lots of time and effort, but the fact is, you will never support your upper range healthily without a breathing pattern that takes every moving part of your body (the instrument) into account. As the Tao Te Ching states, ""the wise man breathes with his heels."" Best of luck"

Baritones usually have a much better and richer lower range and their higher notes are more gritty and earth shattering.  Tenors sound very sweet, piercing, consistently high (even if singing lower notes), and they dont usually have very much strength in their lower range and it's not as usable.  Where-as I would say a Baritone naturally has good strength in their upper and lower register.  Of course there's all different types of baritones and tenors and etc etc etc.  What really matters most is the singer's comfort with the material and comfort with their voice.  I'd rather listen to an excellent baritone than a second rate tenor.   All voice types have their place."

singing,3c1sqr,UnityKinkaid1,3,Fri Jul 3 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"There's a few things to address here...  First, it is impossible to consciously flex the diaphragm.  The diaphragm is located across the center of your thorax; there is no way to command or sense what is happening there.  Besides, the diaphragm assists in inhaling, not singing.  I assume you are attempting to constrict the abdominal muscles, but that will put high pressure on the air - to sing well, strive to lower the pressure in your lungs, while releasing the air freely without pushing or resisting the flow.  By whisper singing, I assume you mean a very breathy tone, or do you mean falsetto?  Either way, it seems the notes are out of your comfortable tessitura.  Overall, you shouldn't try to sing like Anthony Green.  You should sing like you.  Train to sing well, simply, with your own voice.  You may admire other good singers, but never imitate their vocal sound or vocal range.  That will always give you problems with tension and endurance.  It probably won't sound good, either.  If you're male, you are probably a baritone, not a high tenor that he sounds to be.  You should sing songs in your comfortable range.  Unfortunately, pop music seldom features baritones - tenors sound better on the radio and on any kind of amplification, and high, lighter voices reach their peak at a younger age, lending to their sex appeal, which is necessary to become a successful pop singer.  Keep singing, but expand your appreciation and find some music you're passionate about that fits your voice, or simply lower the key of your favorite singers so that it's feasible to sing."

singing,3c0bn1,ceol_mor,5,Fri Jul 3 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Repertoire hunting is one of my least favorite things to do, and is basically impossible for a younger large-voiced classical singer. UGH.  I'm a young dramatic/Wagnerian soprano. When I grow up, I'll have the biggest voice in town. Isn't that nice?  Well, it will be, WHEN I CAN ACTUALLY SING THE REP I'M BUILT FOR.  /u/keakealani sums up the ""how"" pretty well, so let me give you some ""why.""  1. You can't lift that much. Much like how weight lifters have to train for years in order to reach their maximum potential/weight, you have to train to get to those heavier sounds. The voice is much too fragile to just do it. Unfortunately, the vocal folds themselves don't have nerve endings, so you really only know if you're pushing yourself too hard from other symptoms of tire, at which point you've already gone too far.  2. It's heavy because it's louder and longer. Phrases are longer, so it takes more breath manipulation. The music is physically louder (more brass in the orchestra, louder written dynamics to fill enormous concert/opera halls. Being heard over the orchestra is fucking hard.) Whereas Mozart has orchestras of mostly strings/harpsichord/basso continuo, Wagner by contrast uses horns, woodwinds, loud percussion. It is physically harder to sing over those things. Good piano reductions mimic the orchestra, so even if you can sing it with the piano, it'll be harder than usual. They're also longer. You train to run a 5k or a triathlon, you must train to have that kind of endurance.  3. You aren't flexible enough. Unless you're an unnatural freak, exceedingly complicated coloratura passages will create trouble, even for naturally flexible voices. That, and the tessituras for these extremely complex passages generally all sit super high, or go from super high to super low and back, which requires a great deal of smoothing out between passaggios. Much like how a ballerina must train for years for that kind of flexibility, so must we.  4. It's too high/too low. If it's not in a comfortable area in your tessitura, it'd be like walking on your tiptoes with your arms stretched as high above your head as possible for as long as possible, or walking while squatting frog style. As you can imagine, that would be pretty uncomfortable to do day in and day out. You have to choose something that's at a comfortable range for you, so you can gracefully walk through each room.  5. Put all of those together, and that's why you can't sing that opera role yet. Every role has it's challenges, and every role will take specific training to master. If you don't even have the basics down yet, you may be able to survive one or two of these, but eventually....  6. If you continue stabbing yourself and letting it heal, you still will have a decreased amount of muscle stamina/youth. That's basically what you do whenever you sing something you're not ready for. It may do well enough the first couple time's around, but eventually it'll wear on you, and your voice will age faster than it should, eventually becoming useless and knocking 20-40 years off of your career.  How do you know you're ready though?  It's not easy. You have to know where your tessitura is, how high/low your voice can comfortably go, how long you can sing super loudly, how long you can sing super quietly, what your natural middle is, how hard you need to work to get heard, how long the phrases are, how long the piece is, how long you can sing before you need a break, what vowels work best for you, what language treats your resonators the best, how to compensate if it's not a ""best"" language for you, what time period works best in your voice based on instrumentation and favorite tessituras of the time, what intervals are easy for you, which ones are hard, the whole shebang.  And then on top of that, trial and error. Sometimes you don't know just by looking at something, and you have to take it into the practice room and sing it for a week to see if it fits. You'll know if it fits by how it feels. Does it feel good to sing? If it doesn't feel good to sing, it does not fit you. That doesn't mean it will never fit you, and you will have different levels of ""fit,"" and you'll just need to be able to feel your way around of what your acceptable levels are between what's too much not good, and what's just enough to stretch you to challenge our levels.  Finding these pieces is all a matter of experience and library-grinding. You have to be able to translate what things look like on the page and what they'll possibly sound like. That's really easy to do, if you have a teacher who's already done all of that research for you in order to be a qualified teacher."
singing,3c0bn1,ghoti023,4,Fri Jul 3 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ooh, this is a really juicy question. And don't worry, it's far from elementary - it's actually something I think most singers struggle with up until the professional level and even at the professional level. (I belong to another community made up of mostly professional classical singers, and I still see a lot of debate about this sort of thing.)  So I think the two basic backbones are having experience, and having a teacher you trust. And frankly, for someone who probably isn't aiming to become a professional classical singer, I would lean much more heavily on the good teacher part, because that experience is probably unrealistic unless you really immerse yourself in the classical singing world.   But, I can talk about a couple of factors that are important.   First of all, you have to know your own voice. You have to know, in pretty good detail, whether your voice is heavy or light (or medium), flexible or not, where your tessitura lies, etc. This is the beginning of how fach classifications work, and even if you don't use the fach system (I don't really - I think it's limited in use), you should have a general sense of what your voice's strengths and weaknesses are.   From there, you can start trying to find other singers with similar voices, and see what they're singing (this is honestly my very first step for choosing most repertoire). And, since no two singers are identical, you have to listen to those similar singers and figure out where you might be different than them. (Maybe their voice is a little less flexible, but yours is lighter).   The other way to go about this is to think about what you have sung successfully, and how that felt. And, perhaps more importantly, what were the ""failed experiments"" that you would really like not to put your voice through again. (Don't worry, everyone has them.)  I'll give a personal example, here. Over the last semester, I sang two very different German lieder, Schubert's ""Der Lindenbaum"" and Brahms' ""Meine Lieder"". This gave me a pretty stark contrast in how I felt - Schubert was tiring and difficult for me, Brahms was easy. An obvious difference is length - the Brahms is quite a bit shorter and had a lot fewer words to memorize. But the biggest difference was tessitura. Even though both were high voice transpositions with roughly the same range, the Schubert stays in the low and mid-low area a lot, while Brahms stays more on the upper-mid area. From that experience, I learned that my voice gets very tired and taxed from singing in the mid/low part of my range, while I get much less fatigued staying a bit higher.   So the moral of this story is, if I hadn't been thinking about how these pieces affected my voice, I might have just chosen another piece like Lindenbaum (sadly, it's one of my favorite pieces from one of my favorite cycles) and basically set myself up for disaster. Instead, I can use the Brahms as a guideline for pieces I will probably also be successful at. (Which, of course, is also the tricky part of analyzing music well enough to know what they have in common - range, texture, accompaniment, length, flexibility, etc. are all relevant characteristics.)  Ultimately, though, you have to just keep listening to new music, keep browsing new scores, and just keep your ears and eyes peeled for music that works for your voice.     So like I said, the other option is working with your teacher. The main reason is that your teacher (hopefully) has gone through this experience and knows your voice well enough to make an educated guess. This doesn't necessarily mean letting your teacher choose every single piece, but by working with your teacher, it could be things like ""hey, this piece sucked for me when I sang it, what about it can I avoid in the future?"" or ""I want to sing something faster and more upbeat in Italian, do you have any recommendations?"" It could also mean ""I found this piece on the internet because <singer with similar voice> performed it in 2005. Do you think it could work for me?""   A good teacher should be able to guide you through this process, exactly because they have more experience and training than you do. And if you keep an open conversation about it, you can still learn and acquire this experience and knowledge. There is nothing wrong with asking your teacher why they assigned you a piece or what they expect to get out of it. And if you disagree, say so (politely). Sometimes teachers are wrong, too. But you have to be willing to have the conversation in the first place.     Final note: (I promise, I know this is a giant essay).   In opera, there are pretty well-established traditions about certain pieces and fachs being off-limits to young/underdeveloped singers. The main reasons are stamina and carrying power - these are usually the pieces that have a thick, loud orchestra behind them and are in very intense, tiring roles. The general consensus, built on tradition, is that younger voices simply do not do those pieces because they're so likely to push themselves too hard and get hurt, even if the voice will clearly ""grow into"" those pieces. (Ask /u/ghoti023 about this - she has gone through this a lot more than I have because she has a larger voice.) This category includes most Wagner, a lot of Puccini (like Turandot and Tosca), some Verdi, and a few other roles/operas.   Even this is a matter of intense debate - different singers think different roles belong in that ""off limits"" category, and also some singers advocate training big voices in big music rather than trying to fit them into smaller fachs just because they are young, while others believe that their youth defines their fach to the point that they should be singing smaller/lighter rep. Different regions and cultures have different standards for how they like singers to sound - some, with smaller orchestras, prefer lighter voices than would be considered standard for that role in another region, for example.   So with opera especially, you're butting up against centuries of tradition that has limited what people think they should do. Some of it is with good reason - I should never ever sing Turandot because it would absolutely kill me. But some is actually just superstition and tradition more than anything else. People think they won't get hired by bucking the trends (which is probably true, tbh), but sometimes miracles happen."
singing,3c0bn1,keakealani,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the fantastic replies, I'm not really sure my response can do them justice though...  Looks like I have a lot more to learn then, I don't really have much idea about my vocal flexibility or weight. By corollary, it's going to take a while before I can compare myself to other singers closely.  As a rule of thumb, I know people usually recommend things like Mozart (in general) to begin with; what else should I stick with in the beginning? Other than that I'll do what my teacher recommends.  Talking of teachers, how crucial is it that they have had a professional career themselves?   Also: while i'm not doing classical singing professionally, I am likely to be a professional ""popular"" musician, I already get a fair few gigs and things are looking set to get more busy and continue. So yeah, more reasons why I don't want to screw this up. But yeah it's too fun & interesting not to do :D  Thanks again to you both."
singing,3c0bn1,ghoti023,2,Sat Jul 4 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"I actually know voices that aren't good for Mozart when they first start out. (Mine included.) He isn't as large of a ""one size fits all"" as many would try to tell you. Same thing goes with all ""beginner"" repertoire. What fits one beginning singer won't fit another, for all of the reasons I listed above. Even at the beginning level all of those considerations need to be heeded in order to promote the fastest, healthiest growth. So, without hearing you, or knowing what your teacher usually assigns you, I can't really recommend anything. (Which is totally useful information. I get that.)  As for a teacher's career: I don't really take that with too high of a stake. I've had lessons with a handful of metropolitan singers who had criticism as useful as my undergraduate peer, and I've had teachers who have unlocked magic with me, and haven't stepped foot on a stage in 20 years. While teaching and performing are two skills that inform each other, they are not the same skill.  When looking at teachers, I find student testimonials and how their students sound to be the most useful tools to figure out how good a teacher is aside from their resumé and what they've told you. The students don't have to sound good. They're students. In fact, the beginners will still probably sound pretty poor. You have to listen for the beginnings of their techniques, and whether or not they sound free and supported - which obviously, can be a pretty hard thing to detect if it's not something you're used to doing. But in general, if all of their students sound the same, it's a bad sign."
singing,3c0bn1,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"You're asking some really good questions. I agree with /u/ghoti023 that one-size-fits-all is a myth. I think the most important thing to do as a more beginning singer is to experiment safely and healthily. Unfortunately there's no easy way to find good repertoire besides that.   So for teacher careers, I definitely think being a good teacher and being a good singer are different skills, so just because someone has a successful singing career doesn't mean they're necessarily a good teacher. On the other hand, you have to at least more or less know how to sing in order to teach it, so a teacher that is completely awful is probably not a great choice, either. But yes, students are a good metric for judging teachers, as well as trial lessons. I think having a teacher that ""clicks"" with you is more important than how successful their career is."

Is the result of your singing the way YOU personaly want. Cause that is your voice or your sound, our voices are capable of million diffrent sounds all belonging to our voice. The key is training sounds you like and become better at using said sounds. Our voice does not have an innate own sound it's all a product of our enviroment.  But back to the question, how do i sing a song not sounding like the original artist it's quite simple, use diffrent sounds then what that artist is doing. If you are looking for your own ""true"" sound nature intended for you, you are just looking for hippie mumbojumbo.

Once I learned how to do things more correctly with less strain and with more balance between my registers I found that if I tried putting the old amount of power in, that I would just slip back into my old bad habits.

singing,3bxz84,LordNode,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:26:37 2015 UTC,"I will try to check out your recordings later, but I'm not able to do so right now.   But I kind of want to address your larger point about ""getting worse"". I think /u/LordNode kind of hit on it too. When you're working on a skill like singing, especially if you sang a lot before taking lessons, you often have to start by undoing bad habits. Almost everyone picks up bad habits over the years, and it can take a really long time to break those habits. As a result, it may not feel like you're moving forward if you're only at the stage of undoing (and yes, that can take months or even years!) In the mean time, try to approach things by understanding that healthy technique doesn't necessarily immediately translate to better sounds, but it gives you a better foundation to make good sounds more easily.   Also, ""bad voice days"" do exist (actually, I'm there right now - I overused my voice and I'm paying for it now). Sometimes, for reasons entirely out of your control, your voice just doesn't cooperate. Things like allergies, fatigue, diet, or even the weather can just put your voice out of whack. So that also may be part of the issue - you might want to try recording again just to see if it needs a fresh day and a fresh perspective.   Finally, I recommend talking to your teacher about this (I guess it's hard when you're working with different folks, but at least talk with your current teacher). Although teachers should listen and critique you, they can't read your mind. If you have a concern, talk with them about it. They may have a good explanation - not working on that thing right now to focus on something else. Or they may just not think it's a problem for your stage of vocal development. Or something else. But having an open conversation is a good way to figure out if there are ways to find a ""happy medium"" where you can be satisfied with your sound and still develop the technique your teacher is working on.   Also, just as a side note - harder songs aren't necessarily better for developing technique. In fact, you may be struggling with the song so much that it's holding back what you can learn in terms of basics. So don't feel bad about doing something straightforward and ""easy"" - there are usually still lots of ways to learn and grow with easy music. (This is a lesson I'm learning myself, too.)"
singing,3bwa5r,Lizardfishking,5,Thu Jul 2 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the British (RP) ""r"" sound [ɾ]/[r] or the American rhotic ""r"" sound [ɹ], or something else?   There are different strategies for dealing with these sounds, but it's important to know what you're going for.   In British English, you have two options. As /u/Deepblueish mentions, it is possible to replace it with a vowel, but I strongly disagree that the vowel should be [a] or [ɑ], which is inappropriate in almost every dialect and would sound very uncharacteristic. However, you can replace it with the mid-neutral vowel [ə] or [ɜ] (depending on stress placement), noting that the neutral vowel should be closer in character to the one in French or German, which has a quality closer to [œ] with less dramatic rounding. Do not open the vowel any more widely or it will sound very strange and affected.   You can also replace normally trilled ""r""s [r] with the flipped ""r"" [ɾ] in almost all contexts, as long as your mouth is comfortable with that articulation (I'll admit that I cannot flip an r in a consonant cluster, as a native monolingual American English speaker, so your mileage may vary with this strategy).   In rhotic dialects, you should primarily be using r-colored vowels such as [ɚ] and [ɝ] in place of syllablized [ɹ̩] whenever possible. In non-neutral vowels, the [ɹ] may follow quickly, minimizing voicing on the consonant whenever possible. (By the way, the same rules apply to syllablized ""l"" if that is a problem for you, too.) There's no great way to explain this other than practice, but you just want to aim for a short, crisp consonant whenever possible.   I hope this helps!"
singing,3bwa5r,keakealani,3,Thu Jul 2 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"You skip over the sound entirely, substituting a British-sounding ""ah,"" and the audience never notices anything. You can also flip the R in certain situations without sounding too affected."
singing,3bucx8,rjbrown85,7,Thu Jul 2 05:45:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is, imagery doesn't work for everyone. I have a few things that work for me, but for the most part I'm the type of learner where I'd rather hear the specific physiological thing and go from there. So if you don't find that imagery exercises work, then don't do them. That's totally a valid learning style.   Some things I do use, though...   I definitely like to think about opposition and balance a lot. This is physiological - most muscle groups work in antagonism with other groups. So for example, I think of breath support as a balance between both inhaling and exhaling at the same time, just a little tipped toward exhalation to let the air escape. I also think of high pitches as needing more foundation and ""grounding"", so I'll do downward physical motions like bending my knees as I go up in range to remind me of that foundation.   I also sometimes use the analogy of a ""beam of light"" to think about placement - the idea that the sound needs to be focused like a flashlight rather than diffuse like a lantern. This is usually coupled with other things like thinking about my vowel shapes.   There are many other visualizations that different singers/teachers use, so the sky's the limit there, but those are some things I find helpful. You might just want to try different things and see what works."
singing,3bucx8,keakealani,5,Thu Jul 2 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"I have a few things that I use: * I tell my students to ""Seek the effortless effort."" * I imagine a string running taught from the crown of my head to the bottom of my sternum. The focal point of resonance shifts up that string as I go higher and lower, but I'm always resonating along the whole string. * Sometimes, I think of the lungs like a balloon being held by the spine and then the walls of the abdomen. If the abs go slack, there's no support/direction for the balloon.  Generally, I try to only use analogies and visualizations in conjunction with explanations of the anatomy, with physical exercises that force the desired behavior. Singing can get awfully mystic and cryptic when teachers tell you ""Sing from your toes!"" I had no idea what that meant, and that's the danger of analogy and visualization alone."

singing,3btnc4,Ajv2324,3,Thu Jul 2 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"I would encourage you to check out the International Phonetic Alphabet. It's a system designed by linguists to attach a unique symbol to every different sound in every different language (more or less). The great part is that all the sounds are also defined in terms of how they're pronounced - where the tongue is placed, what kind of movement produces the sound, etc.   So with that in mind, I personally find it really helpful to start with the way each sound is made, and carefully practicing them (this is how I learn new languages, too). This way, you can train your mouth/jaw/tongue muscles to go exactly where you need them to go.   The fact is, even for people who don't really mumble, most of us get pretty lazy when we talk. Our body naturally finds ways to do the least amount of work while still making more or less understandable sounds. In singing, we have to undo that habit and make sure we're getting to each and every sound accurately, not taking shortcuts. There's no easy way to do it other than practice, but it's important to do.  As far as practical solutions, sing a simple scale (like a five-tone) with a different vowel/consonant pattern: bo bo bo, nu nu nu, ha ha ha, etc. Practice making each syllable in different parts of your range (it will feel different when you get high compared to in your low range). Even if you're focusing on vowels, I recommend using a consonant at least for the first note, because it helps get the air going and also most words have consonants so you need to know how that feels.   Hope that helps! :)"

singing,3bshb6,cbcfan,14,Wed Jul 1 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, the voice doesn't fully develop until the mid-late 20s for most people, and sometimes later for some voice types. So by that measure, you're actually early - many singers don't start seriously training until the late teens or twenties and even then you won't know the full extent of your instrument.   Don't compare yourself to instrumentalists. Physiologically, the parts of the body used to play most instruments are developed enough to start training by the time you're in elementary or middle school. The voice, like I mentioned, takes WAY longer to develop. So even if you did start at 5 like many piano students, you would be working with such a different instrument that anything you learned would be practically pointless as an adult.   In addition, the vocal folds are really delicate and easily damaged. It's pretty much the only instrument where if you mess it up, you can't buy a new one or get it fixed (except for invasive and risky surgeries). And, you physically can't sing for as long as an instrumentalist can play, or you risk damaging your vocal cords.   Anyway, all this is to say that you're not too late, and you can sing. Go for it and don't worry about others."

At 15, you're going through puberty (obv) so that's one aspect of it, but another is your level of training. Fully grown men in their late 20s that start taking lessons then will find themselves going through voice changes too, as they discover what their trained voice can do. Just like how you don't know how much you can lift or how fast you can run without training, there's no telling what your voice can or can't do without being exercised too.  So yeah, it's entirely possible. It's also entirely possible that you won't transition into tenor. There's no telling. Keep in mind that the ""end of puberty"" for male voices is the mid to late 20s, sometimes early 30s. You've got a good 10 more years.

Mixing gives you the freedom to sing at any dynamic across your range.

However, even undergraduate voice students are typically required to take a vocal pedagogy (the study of teaching singing) class and have been probably taking lessons for several years, so they can still be very helpful for a beginner.   If you are concerned about a lack of experience/skill in teaching, I would also recommend looking into studying with grad students. Obviously, they will have more schooling and lessons, and often grad students (especially at the doctoral level) are more or less professional singers who are just seeking more degrees and experience. You're unlikely to find many voice teachers ""out in the field"" with more than a master's, anyway, until you get into really high-level work (which is unnecessary for a beginner). So the average grad student is probably just as credentialed as the average professional music teacher, but may be more affordable as they are usually younger and less established."

Having watched a lot of his other performances in operas, concerts, stage shows etc... as well as some of his masterclasses and talks + notes + interviews and such.  After seeing all that and then trying to understand what he does, and how he does it, with such perfection and control time after time, along with being a fantastic musician and teacher, really after seeing all that can you appreciate how good fucking amazing he was."

The way I'd compare the two is by saying that Pavarotti is like a Ferrari; he's a technical masterpiece, powerful and exciting.  Domingo is like a luxury Rolls Royce, that can glide over speed bumps without you feeling a thing.  Check out Domingo's E Lucevan Le Stelle, it's a hell of a song."

singing,3bj0xa,Mumrama,5,Mon Jun 29 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely hard question to answer for me. For female singers, I would have to go with Sissel Kyrkjebø. There are many female singers out there who can belt higher, cover more range, etc but I have never heard anyone come close to having a more pure voice then her. Her voice is literally flawless and is the type of voice that instantly just gives you goosebumps all over.   For my favorite male singer this question is just torture. Haha I mean Freddie Mercury was amazing, Paul McCartney was an inspiration to me since I was little, David Phelps is incredible, Pavarotti was remarkable, Andrea Bochelli is awesome but for me, nobody holds a candle to Josh Groban. And this is coming from a GUY. Once again, tons of male singers can sing higher/lower then him, belt/scream, have really unique voices but I Josh Groban has the most perfectly polished and unique voice that I have ever heard. The first time I heard him sing I remember my jaw literally hit the floor. Its all because of his vibrato. Normally, when a person does vibrato while singing, they fluctuate their voice between 6 and 8 times a second to give the characteristic vocal warbling sound and that is about as fast as a normal singer can do vibrato without using improper technique. Josh Groban on the other hand usually manages about 12-14 vocal fluctuations per second, making his vibrato almost twice as fast as the average singers and it is just AMAZING. Seriously if you haven't heard him sing a song listen to him right now and tell me his voice isn't literally almost perfect. Remember this is just my opinion and I am sure there are many other/better singers out there that are slipping my mind or I am simply not aware of. Don't take what I say too seriously! Have a good day everyone!"

If technical skill is what you mean, i'd honestly have to say I'm likely not familiar with the best singer of all time, as they were probably involved in opera or classical music and that's a genre i'm not too familiar with.

To this date, I don't know a single singer that fulfills all of those criteria. Even if I took out the ""flexible in genres"" aspect, and wanted to talk about singular singers in each genre, I still wouldn't be able to pick out one that rises above them all (not to mention that comparing singers from different genres is pretty futile, and practically impossible. Apples and oranges.) It's also prudent to mention that the only singers getting mentioned in this thread are from the last 50 years or so, neglecting centuries of other singers. Granted, those other centuries didn't have recording technology, but it goes to show how much of a living art music is, so solidifying the Monarch of All Voices is pretty much impossible, as time is constantly moving. New voices are getting heard every day.  I have a lot of favorite singers. I find a lot to be extremely, and almost excessively talented. But everyone has their Achilles Heel, and where one singer falters a little, another excels.  And I love it that way.  I love that there isn't a ""greatest singer of all time."" It keeps on making sure that there's a goal we all work towards. It means that there are peaks we haven't reached yet, and on top of it all - variety is the spice of life. Everyone's voice has different strengths, weaknesses, timbres, etc. I love that there's that much variety to express a countless number of emotions and thoughts.  So not only do I not think there is one singer that can claim the title of ""greatest of all time,"" I don't want there to be one."

singing,3bkxdk,keakealani,5,Tue Jun 30 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"No, this is a great question!   The answer partially depends on what your goals are and what style you're singing in. If you're trying to sound authentically you, then you should use your natural accent. This is good for character songs, original songs, and anything that makes sense in your region/community.   On the other hand, if you want to sing a character that originates from a very different location, you will probably need to change up your accent. If you sing country from the US South, a posh British accent just won't work. (But then again, a Southerner will have just as hard a time singing a British character, so it all evens out).   There are also a number of so-called ""neutral"" accents that are used in singing because they're easy to understand for the majority of English speakers (same goes for other languages, too). One that I think you should consider is the ""Mid Atlantic"" accent. It was originally created to be halfway between British and American standard dialects, so it contains some features of both. The vowels are generally closer to tall British vowels, but tends to be a little more rhotic than RP (but less rhotic than General American). There are some other changes, but generally, if you just think ""sort of Brit, sort of Yank"", you'd get a pretty good approximation, especially since it's not a ""real"" dialect and nobody can really tell you what is right or wrong.   Anyway, dialect/accent is definitely a choice you have to make as a singer, and there are lots of different factors that go into that choice. In my opinion, unless you have a really good reason not to be understood, the most important choice is being understood by the audience. If you're singing in the UK, this probably means a British accent, and in the US it probably means an American accent. Otherwise, the other stuff is somewhat a matter of interpretation."
singing,3bkxdk,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"I am in no way an experienced singer yet as I have only been learning for less then a year but from what I have learned so far, I would 100% say that you should sing in your natural accent until you are completely comfortable with the songs you are trying to learn and you understand them inside out. First, I guarantee you that if you relax and don't think about your accent too much then it won't even come off sounding really strong in your singing. I'm guessing that is your main concern here, that your afraid your accent is really noticeable in your singing? I've had a bunch of foreign friends who were singers, including a few with English/African/Indian accents, AKA a wide range of different accents and 90% of the time I almost completely forget they have an accent whenever they are singing because it really isn't that noticeable and the other 10% of the time when I do notice, I think it adds to the song because I love hearing songs sung in a different way then normal. So I bet if I listened to you sing, even if I was really trying to pick out parts where you accent was strong, I would end up barely noticing it at all and just appreciating your version for your unique take on it! But since that doesn't really seem to be what you want to hear, my suggestion if you are set on trying to change your accent while singing would be learn it 100% with your hands tied behind your back in your natural accent, then work on speaking (not singing the song) in the accent that you are going for until you can do the accent to your satisfaction. THEN you can start to try to change your singing voice to accommodate the new accent sounds. It will take a little while but you'll be able to sing in any accent with decent practice and mainly, listening to other people fluent in that accent sing songs so you really hear what syllables/vowls/accents/diction sets that accent apart from yours and work on bringing those out. I'd imagine its sort of like learning a song in a different language which I have done but at the same time, It seems more complicated because your still singing in your native language, just a different pronunciation and delivery of it. Its a really unique challenge and I'm sure you will do great! I'm sorry if my advice isn't top notch, this is only my second post on Reddit and my first year singing but now I am really interested in hearing something you've done man! You post yourself singing anywhere? I would love to have a listen. Either way good luck man, it was nice talking to you, and have a very pleasant afternoon!"
singing,3bk5qu,heyyouyeahyou55,7,Mon Jun 29 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"The honest-to-goodness advice is that you must start studying with a quality classical voice teacher. For many styles, there are lots of different ways to learn how to sing, but opera is not one of them. It's a very specialized, competitive genre and you will simply not be successful (and probably hurt yourself) without good guidance by a trained teacher. You cannot learn to sing opera just by listening to other singers, and you are in real danger of hurting your voice if you try.  In addition, go get yourself actually exposed to actual opera, if that's what you want to do. Opera is full of very specific idioms and stylistic considerations, and you'll make it much more difficult for yourself if you don't know what you're trying to accomplish. Also, this is probably a good time to evaluate whether you actually do want to go into opera, or you'd like to study some other kind of classical singing (or just some other genre entirely).   In addition, if you're not already pretty strong in at least 2-3 of the major singing languages (French, Italian, German, and English), I would strongly recommend getting started on that. Language learning is, in my opinion, a big hurdle to get over before being successful in the opera world, especially since much of professional opera does occur in Europe where being multilingual is extremely handy. Plus, you'll get more out of opera when you understand the language - even supertitles don't necessarily capture all the nuance of the language.   From a singing perspective, I would strongly recommend starting with art song rather than actual opera repertory. Opera is a very physically and emotionally demanding genre and it's something you need to work up to. Since it sounds like you don't have any classical training at all, it's especially important that you learn the basics of classical singing before trying to tackle those hefty arias. This is also a good place to get those language skills if you aren't already great there - the language demands of art songs are typically more doable than opera, so you can get a feel for it without being too overwhelmed.   Finally, I would advise you not to get to attached to a specific voice type. In classical singing (especially opera), voice type and fach apply to a much wider range of characteristics than just range. In fact, most opera singers have more or less the same usable range (give or take a few notes), but are mostly distinguished by their voice's tone color/timbre, weight, and tessitura. Since all of these things are evaluated primarily in trained singers, it's not necessary to try to fit your voice into a fach as an untrained singer - in addition, attempting to sing against your voice's natural inclination can be harmful to your technique and ultimately compromise your voice's ability to function in the opera world."
singing,3bk5qu,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"thanks so much for that in-depth response!  I actually did take singing lessons for awhile, but it was fairly basic and short lived and we mostly touched upon scale warmups.   , go get yourself actually exposed to actual opera,   any recommendations?"
singing,3bk5qu,keakealani,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Great! Well, definitely continue with lessons. It's also a good way to break into the business, if you want to do that - a lot of the classical music world functions on word-of-mouth, so it's really helpful to start building connections through your teacher and studio.   As far as recommendations... I have a lot, but I'm not exactly sure what you'd be most interested in. /r/opera also probably has some good ideas, since I'm not actually the most well-versed in opera (I'm more of an art song and oratorio person, myself).   I would suggest, though, finding out if there are any opera houses in your area. You'd be surprised how many small regional houses are cropping up. And opera is really best live, since you can see all the acting, staging, and music together.   As another option, several opera houses now do HD broadcasts. The most famous is the Met in HD program, but I think there are a few others. This is another really great way to get the whole performance experience. Arguably, some of it is actually better than live since you get to see everything up close and there are usually some fun backstage interviews and whatnot. At the very least, it's a great way to see some really high-quality opera.   That's one way to decide what to see, too - just go and start exploring what's available in your area right now and run with it. Ultimately opera has so many different sub-genres and styles that it's more about just hearing it and understanding what is going on than it is to know certain specific shows."
singing,3bk5qu,YourFavoriteBaritone,2,Tue Jun 30 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"As /u/keakealani mentioned, for opera, you MUST have a well rounded classical voice teacher. Opera and classical singing are pretty much the equivalent of ballet to dance. They are the foundation for a healthy, sustainable, and enjoyable technique.  You definitely shouldn't be trying to sing opera from the get-go. Your teacher will more than likely start you out with art songs and the like, building up your technique to where you can really perform an operatic piece. The reason for this is that not only would it be very difficult to jump right into an opera, but you could and almost definitely would hurt yourself if you did not build up your technique and become very comfortable in your (current- how old are you? This is super important as well, and your teacher might start you later or earlier depending on your age) fach.  Again, like /u/keakealani mentioned, languages are a MUST! I would add that Latin is also an important language to learn for any classical singer, but you're more likely to see that in religious music. Obviously, you won't be learning all of these languages fluently (any time soon, anyway), so you should focus on proper vowel shapes and other language-specific annunciations while you're starting out. For example: -cht in German. God, that's a hard one, hahahaha.  Please, please, please keep in mind that Opera is VERY demanding, more than just physically. While you're training, make sure you keep a healthy mind and a healthy body. The big things you're going to want to watch out for are your stress level, getting enough sleep, drinking enough liquid, eating a healthy (enough) diet, not smoking (depending on who you ask, but most people will say do NOT), and keeping yourself fit for your body size. Basically don't lose weight just for singing, unless it's impeding you as extra weight may actually help you sing better.  I'm a beginner myself, so please keep that in mind haha. You might see things here that you or your teacher disagree with, and you should probably always take your teacher's word over anyone else's, except a more qualified instructor. Fact-checking is healthy. :)"

It sounds like either singing while playing the guitar, or playing the guitar while singing messed you up a few times. I'd be interested to hear you re-record without the guitar and singing a bit louder, that should give you more top end support."
singing,3bi2nq,Bagodonuts10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with the previous person. Falsetto needs to be more consistent and you sound a bit timid, or maybe struggling to play and sing together. But your tone is fantastic man. Perfect for this kind of music. I'd also add that your falsetto sounds almost exactly like damien rice's. Keep it up."

singing,3bi2nq,birdizdaword,2,Tue Jun 30 23:14:21 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed listening to the arctic monkeys cover. A couple things though. Your top end sounded a bit strained a couple times (on the ""why"" in the chorus) and I think not enough support is the culprit. you have time right before to take a good low placed breath to support that series of notes that are up there. Second thing is totally subjective, but it's something that could help. When you sing ""call"" in the chorus, I would try making that vowel sound a little more pure. So instead of singing ""key-all"" and sliding into the vowel sound, try singing something closer to ""cahl"" if that makes any sense"

The main thing I noticed is you kept your mouth too closed for most phrases, which may sound okay at these volumes, but if you sing louder you'll find it really muffles the resonance you could be using.

I know I can't sing well, which is why I'm trying to learn. I started singing lessons two weeks ago and have just basically practiced scales in them.   Here are two pieces that I'd like critiqued. I recorded these partially because I really want help, but also because I want to have evidence of just how badly I sucked at the beginning.   I will go ahead and apologize for the agony your ears will be exposed to. No matter what I do, I can't make my head voice sound any better, and I have a terribly difficult time hitting the notes. I think it's because I generally listen and sing along to male vocalists and just picked up the habit of singing in my chest voice. I'm not saying my chest voice is any better, but I do use it more. Do I sound nasally? Do I go off key a lot?   Anyway, I'd really appreciate any and all feedback. Really, anything you think that might help me would be great.  https://soundcloud.com/earningoing/sets/first-day-recordings"
singing,3bi2nq,laughinwhale,2,Tue Jun 30 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well, you should be alright listening to and singing songs that were originally done by men. I do the same thing every now and then (mostly for pop music) with songs sang by women originally. You generally have to transpose this music into your range. Work on your breath control, tonal qualities, pacing/rhythm, and volume. Make sure your teacher is helping you with breath control. If you are really serious about it, I'd contact a vocal instructor, not a coach, to make sure you have a solid base in theory and the fundamentals down."
singing,3bi2nq,SmilesAllTheWay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I am taking lessons with a vocal instructor. I played piano and was in band growing up, so I have a good sense of theory.  Getting a little more specific, is there anything in particular that you can tell I should be doing that I'm not, or vise versa? My teacher says I shouldn't be tightening my abs, I should open up the back of my throat, keep my tongue forward, and breathe evenly throughout the notes.   I agree that I obviously need to work on my tonal qualities too. Can you give me an example of what to do or where to look? When I'm singing along with someone, I feel like I'm trying to embellish the notes like they do, but it just doesn't come out that way. I also want to develop a deeper, richer tone.  Did I sing on key for the most part? Listening back, it sounds so awful to me that I'm not even sure if my problems are mainly pitch related, tone related, or just both. Think there's any hope for me?  edit - If anyone else can offer some constructive criticism with improvement suggestions, I'd be very grateful."
singing,3bi2nq,Ajv2324,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"If you can't afford an instructor/want to improve a bit before seeing one, YouTube has a lot of really good resources. Just practice, practice, practice. No one has ever gotten worse at something from practicing. Learn breath support, practice scales to help develop your ear, and record yourself often to see how you really sound (sometimes you may sound worse or better in your head than you do in reality).  A good YouTube channel for singing exercises and advice is New York Vocal Coaching, the dude is great and isn't one of the types out there that is gonna hide his ""great secrets"" for money, he just puts out videos to help.  Another good one is Marnell Sample, who doesn't have a lot of videos but the ones he does have are helpful. There are countless others, but I'd say start looking for breath support exercises and advice first, it'll help quite a bit."

But if not, there is nothing stopping you from singing another genre.   If I had to guess, you may be more familiar with country, or you may just have better vocal models in country than in other genres, leading to your voice naturally settling into good habits in that genre. If that's the case, all you really need to do is find models in another genre that can help you settle into that genre, as well.   Other than that, yeah, I really agree with /u/Hraklea that you can always benefit from variety and just generally good singing. The basics of controlling your voice and being sensitive to its needs are pretty much the same across the genre spectrum, so I would start there and then branch out in whatever style you want to sing."

singing,3bg8hn,ChthonicDreamer,2,Sun Jun 28 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"i would look up this dvd called the breathing gym. the basis of all singing is breath control but to sing like those power metal guys, that's where they get their sound from. think opera, yodeling, anything where the voice box has to be super open. it sounds like the kamelot guy is doing a lot but it's more about what he's not doing. he's just very relaxed. blind guardian is a great example. that guy is just a pipe on a pipe organ just pushing air. the good thing about power metal is it's more dependent on how strong the tone is, and not how dirty it is. being able to hold notes out loud and long and relaxed will help with this style more than adding grit and stuff by far.  PS: WARNING. the thing that really killed a lot of my friends with metal vocals was Dio. i feel like i should mention this anecdotal observation because of the genre we're talking about. don't try to sing like that. he's one of the greatest metal singers to do it. if you try and sing like that, you're gonna hurt yourself and focus on the wrong areas. the basics are what separates the best from the rest. the stuff you learn in your first lesson is the foundation of which you build your house."
singing,3bf55k,bandsinger1234,3,Sun Jun 28 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"Given a lot of dedication and proper guidance, yeah you could probably develop a band-worthy voice in 3 months. That being said, most good singers I know have been singing all their lives, so it may not be come thing that comes quickly or easily. We also don't know where exactly you're at in terms of skill. Beginners range from people who have never done anything musical, to ones who can already sing to some extent. This is a tough question to ask. I'd recommend you focus on the singing part, because it sounds like you want to be a frontman more than a singer."
singing,3bf55k,Sharkbite116,3,Sun Jun 28 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"I would say to stay away from trying to imitate other singers. In the first place, it's a good way to potentially hurt yourself by trying to make your voice do something that it can't naturally do. But it also really limits your actual trajectory for growth as a singer - you'll just build in the habits of one imitated way of singing rather than learning to actually control your own voice and make it do what you need it to do for every situation.   Anyway, I think with lessons and dedication, you can learn quite a bit in a fairly short period of time (although as /u/Sharkbite116 aptly points out, it depends a lot on where you're starting from), but I don't know that successfully auditioning for a band is a realistic goal, especially depending on what other skills you bring to the table.   I think it's better to focus on learning to sing, and then evaluate yourself periodically for things like whether or not you could give a successful audition. You won't know your own learning trajectory until you really do it."
singing,3bf55k,keakealani,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Auditioning won't matter as I'm forming it with two friends who just want a bit of fun. Unfortunately I don't think I could get hold of the money for lessons. Just another quick question. When people say try and develop your own voice, how do you know singers start singing a particular genre. For example, if a person develops their own voice and it's classical, how do they develop a rock voice without imitation."
singing,3bf55k,keakealani,3,Sun Jun 28 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Well, that's not exactly how it works :) Nobody's voice is inherently ""classical"" or ""rock"" or ""jazz"". It's just a voice. What makes a voice fit a style is just little changes in how you use your voice, like how much vibrato you use, how you balance resonance, diction, etc. So you won't really be changing the core of your personal vocal sound, you'd just change some stylistic things to fit in with a particular genre.   I mean, yes, to a certain extent you would be imitating the characteristics of a genre in general, so in that sense, it's not 100% natural. But it's not the same as imitating a specific person's voice, which may or may not be similar to your natural voice.  It's kind of like having the same picture with a bunch of different instagram filters (forgive this shitty analogy). The basic photo is still the same, but it can have a different vibe based on what filter is being used. So yes, you might use the same filter as someone else to get the same style, but you won't change the actual content of the picture just to fit that style."

singing,3begn8,GranddukeGediminas,2,Sun Jun 28 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"In my exp the best way to make immediate progress on anything voice/sound related is to make recordings (eg use an app on your phone) and then critique. I find it's best to be specific when I listen back so the focus is on problem solving (as opposed to dissatisfaction).  For example, when listening back you might look for: how to deliver the rhythm effectively, are there certain words (or sound/syllable clusters) you have trouble with, are you putting enough emphasis on articulating each part of the word, is it too monotone, too tonally colorful, how are your dynamics? Is your inflection/emotion appropriate to what is being expressed by the text? This will help you to be more aware of these elements as you practice and help you form good habits in your delivery.  In short, yes, all of the things you listed are things you should strive to be aware of, and I think recitation/storytelling are a performance art just like singing, so they require a similar type of preparation. Does that help at all?"

Occasionally nasalised too.   I guess next stage is working out how to accurately classify problems and fix them?

It can't hurt, of course, but I think you would be better off working with a speech therapist or speech coach for help specific to public speaking.   That being said, I agree completely with /u/AtomicHoudini that it isn't very effective to say things like ""my voice is awful"" - that means absolutely nothing and is impossible to fix. Instead, if you can pinpoint what is currently wrong with your speaking voice, you can work on those specific things. If, at that point, you notice a problem you think we can help with as singers, you're more than welcome to post a question. But nobody can really fix a broad problem like ""sounding awful"", because we don't know what that even means."

One thing I can say that improved my confidence as a speaker (and ultimately a singer) is to concentrate on your lip + tongue movement. Too much will cause tension, but too little will form impediments. A relaxed, but heightened awareness of tongue and lip placement has made huge changes in my speaking ability."

A big issue I had was tightening the back of my tongue when I speak, and as a result, barely moving my lips or jaw. Many people might suggest that adequate posture and diaphragmatic breathing could help subconsciously remove some of that tension.

singing,3bdk0t,TotoCotogni,7,Sun Jun 28 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"Something important to remember is that starting around high E flat,  you will not be able to hear/feel the components of the vowel all together inside your head/body the same way that you hear them on the lower pitches. This is where the sung vowel truly leaves the realm of speech. But eventually you have to learn not to ""over-form"" the vowel and just trust that the sound you're emitting will be heard and understood outside—by the audience—as the written vowel. It is a paradox, but it is also axiomatic.  It's very difficult to explain here, but essentially you will be  inserting the true vowel into an acoustic shape that properly resonates the fundamental. The firm core of AH is sung into a throat shape of UH (jaw fully dropped, lips totally out of action [though it may be that your teeth are showing; that's fine and natural]), no spreading the mouth horizontally). You will not hear pure AH inside your head; you will only be concentrating on the small but intense core and be vaguely aware of the pharynx being very wide and verrrrry long/deep/dark. It will probably feel as if the sound beams are spraying upward and outward like a fan (which, frankly, they are... except spraying everywhere concentrically). And don't try to sing these notes softly or hold them straight. They should be sung vigorously and with plenty of vibrato (more than you'd think; almost like you're trilling across two pitches).  And the same is true for the OH vowel. The chest voice core of the OH is sung into a deep OO throat. Inside your head, you will hear something very undefined like an UH, but the outside listener will hear the correct OH.  Here are a couple examples so you can start to form a concept of what ""covering"" is: Leonard Warren singing ""Eri tu"". At 3:25, he sings the phrase ""Sul mio seno brillava,"" but listen to that -lava on high G and F. They're not totally blatant AAAAH; it's just intense core sung into a deep UH shape, with the tongue basically in the position for AH. It even kinda sounds like UH.  Cornell MacNeil singing ""Nulla, silenzio!"". The phrase here is ""La pace è nella morte"". Notice that he doesn't over-form the open O of ""morte."" It is intense core, with the tongue in the position for open O, sung into a deep and wide UH throat."

singing,3bdk0t,ViktorClay,2,Sun Jun 28 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Vowel modification is such a complex topic. I am not a guy so I'll speak more from a female perspective (things are slightly different, but I think they still apply).   One way I like to think about vowel modification is instead of changing from one vowel to another, I think about adding the quality of one vowel to another. So I'll add a little ""uh"" or ""ah"" to a more closed vowel to give it enough resonating space to function at higher pitches. The original vowel still exists (at least until I get really high), but it gets gradually transformed into another vowel as I move up in my range. I find it helpful to practice this by singing small scales (like a five-tone ascending scale or even three-tone), moving up by half steps, focusing on making these little adjustments.   Also, it might help you to familiarize yourself with basic phonology - that is, how language sounds are produced and how they work. For example, it might help to think about how each vowel is produced in terms of the shape of the mouth and vocal tract - the idea that some vowels are ""higher"" or ""lower"" in the mouth, as well as further toward the front or back of the mouth. So when you think of a vowel, you're thinking of a specific shape of the mouth and tongue associated with that vowel, not just a general array of shapes. Everyone relates to this a little differently, though, since everyone's mouth is shaped a bit differently. So it's more about experimenting with the exact spot that feels right for you."
singing,3bchx2,judeswarmgun94,4,Sat Jun 27 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Do you know how to mark? Marking is when you sing with good technique/breath support, but you just sing softer than normal. For high voices, it can also include taking your part down the octave.   Marking is very important for rehearsal to preserve your voice, especially if you're working mostly on non-vocal stuff (dancing, stage movement, cues, etc.) You should let the music director and other cast members know when you're going to mark, but it's usually okay if you do so occasionally.   In addition, make sure you're not over warming up. It's tempting to think that you should warm up super well to get through a long rehearsal, but you could actually be tiring your voice out if your warmup is too intense. Just lightly touch the top and bottom of your range, do a couple of exercises in the middle, and maybe one or two technique things. You will also continue to warm up as you sing throughout the rehearsal, so don't worry about being super duper warm right at the beginning. Just warm enough that you won't hurt yourself.   Ultimately, stamina is both something you build up slowly (through experiences like this) and something you can't force beyond its natural extent. If you're pretty sure you're not doing anything dangerous or unhealthy with your voice, it's probably more about just being careful and not overdoing it.   Also, keep in close contact with your teacher (or consider studying one if you're not doing so right now), as they can also help you figure out ways to minimize vocal stress during a show."

singing,3bchx2,AsterismAlex,3,Mon Jun 29 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations on the role! I am a big musical theatre fan myself, so I'm a bit curious about what show you guys are doing. Is this for a high school performance or a college theatre program? Have you done many shows before? Is performing your choice of a future career? That sort of thing.  Before I can give you advice, I think it's a bit appropriate to give a brief overview about how your voice works. This is a diagram of the pharynx-- what we commonly refer to as the throat. Notice the three shaded areas in the back. The larynx, or voice box (small disc near the purple shaded area) makes vibrations, which travel from your vocal chords through the laryngo and oropharynx and out your mouth. How close the chords vibrate determines pitch, diaphragm gives you air to make the sound with, yadda yadda yadda.  Let's focus on the voice box. Here's a picture of your larynx (WARNING: it's gross). Do you notice the light pink, bottle-opener-shaped muscle with a 3 on it? That's your epiglottis. It's what the vibrations from your vocal chords (1) bounce off of before they exit the larynx. Notice how it faces upwards. This is how it is supposed to look when you talk or sing. When you swallow, the epiglottis flaps downwards to cover your vocal chords and prevent food or water from leaving the esophagus and travelling there accidentally. (Ever had water ""go down the wrong pipe""?)  When singers have trouble hitting a particular high note, they sometimes tell the epiglottis to close a tiny little bit to force the vocal chords to vibrate more closely. If done too frequently it can permanently scar your singing voice AND the upper muscles of the esophagus, causing anything from a raspy voice and some soreness, to inflammation of the larynx, acid reflux, the lowering of the voice and even muteness.   Once I started to do shows, I had a very similar problem with a tight, sore throat after rehearsals. Thankfully, my vocal director noticed and educated me on my situation. She gave me a warm-up technique to prevent this sort of thing that I have incorporated into my daily routine, and since then have noticed fantastic results.  Place your thumb on the bottom of your chin and gently move it towards the front of your neck. It should be right underneath where your tongue sits in your mouth, like so. Make sure you are relaxed when you do this. Do not press your thumb against your neck. Gently rest it there. Take a quick swallow. Notice how the muscles in your throat moved your thumb closer to your chin. Now practice a quick scale or two. Notice how your thumb stays in place flat against your neck. This is how it is supposed to feel when you sing high.  Now sing a quick 7 note scale as you normally would. It should feel he same as the exercise before. Repeat this a few times, but take a quick rest before reaching the highest note in the scale. If your swallowing muscles stay relaxed, great! Continue what you are doing. If not, try to incorporate more of your head voice into the sound you are making.   Hopefully this helps a tiny bit. I know it's difficult to think about the larynx when singing harmonies and  simultaneously doing choreography, but just try to be mindful of this when you practise. Coupled with u/keakealani's advise, some vocal rest when necessary and copious amounts of warm tea and cough drops (I use Ricolas, Hal's has a vapour I don't care for) you should be fine.  Best of luck and break a leg!"
singing,3bchx2,keakealani,2,Sun Jun 28 02:09:59 2015 UTC,I only want to add here - be careful with Ricola and other cough drops/throat drops that contain menthol. Menthol is highly drying and can irritate the vocal folds. I personally prefer to use throat drops with Pectin as the active ingredient (Hall's Breezers is one brand I've used a lot) because it's less drying.
singing,3bchx2,AsterismAlex,3,Sun Jun 28 04:09:03 2015 UTC,"Imagine that, I have been told that Hall's breezers are highly drying and can irritate the vocal folds. Didn't know about menthol in Ricolas though! I guess you learn something new everyday.  Thanks for the heads up. :)"
singing,3bchx2,keakealani,3,Sun Jun 28 08:48:06 2015 UTC,Huh. It could be a matter of opinion and how each body reacts to things. Just good to be aware of active ingredients so you can make good decisions :)
singing,3bcwht,gypsygrifter,3,Sun Jun 28 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"One of the things you can do is practice in front of a mirror and see exactly where your jaw is falling. One of the things I had to realize is that when I drop my jaw, it needs to go back slightly as well.  Imagine you are sitting propped up on a pillow and you've fallen asleep. As your neck falls back, your jaw falls open and slightly inward, toward your throat, kind of like a yawn that stays open.   Now, you should never tilt your head back like that because of hyperextension, but your jaw should feel like that when it is open properly.   Your tongue should stay directly behind your lower teeth without pushing at them or falling back. The sides of the tongue may rise to meet your upper molars as you modify your vowels.  Does that make sense at all? It's hard to explain this in text, and much easier to see in person. Ask your teacher to demonstrate an open, relaxed jaw and walk around so you can see it at all angles. I didn't ""get"" proper jaw placement until I saw it in profile at the proper angle. It may take that for you, too."
singing,3bcwht,azurefishnets,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for replying! I figure my jaw probably needs to go down and back as well as it kind of normally juts forward, so I've been working with that a little bit!  Most of your comment definitely makes sense, but I don't really know what you mean by the sides of my tongue meeting my molars, that seems a little strange to me.  Thanks for the helps though!"
singing,3bcwht,azurefishnets,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a hard touch, nor will you ever press it.Your tongue should just stay in the bottom of your mouth and roll up slightly at the edges, kind of like a chute. You don't want the central portion to rise much at all, ever. I'm not saying to press down, either, though. Just let your tongue rest behind your lower teeth."
singing,3bcwht,keakealani,2,Sun Jun 28 12:39:37 2015 UTC,"You might want to try modifying the vowel up in the top. For example, when the word has an [i] vowel (like ""feel""), try modifying it closer to [ɪ] (like ""bit""). Most of the time, it will still come out as the correct vowel, but gives you a little more space in your mouth.   Another thing you can do is think about more soft palate lift and pharyngeal space. Even for closed vowels, you should still have enough back space to fully resonate. It might also just help to think about a different part of the body - I know for me, if I concentrate too much on ""getting rid of tension"" it just makes me more tense to think about it so much.   Another exercise I like to do, just to really feel extreme realization, is to sing with a completely slack jaw, like you just went to the dentist and got your whole jaw numbed. Obviously you won't be able to properly pronounce the words, but it can help you find the more relaxed feeling and then you can put back the words and articulation.   Finally, I just want to give a word of encouragement. It's totally normal to feel like you hit ""walls"" as you study singing, particularly when you're starting out. Often times it will feel like nothing is really happening from week to week. But if you actually listen back to how you sound after a few months, you realize you actually did improve a lot. And sometimes it takes a while to really ""get"" a technique and be able sing that way reliably. So even if all you're doing is making your technique more consistent, that's still a big improvement and something to be happy about!"
singing,3bcwht,Poulenc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed a while ago that on ee and ooh vowels especially I tend to have a problem with keeping my soft palate raised, but on those vowels keeping pharyngeal resonance (assuming that's what you mean) isn't really a problem. But I definitely get the tension thing! Everytime I try to actively relieve any tension, I just get ten times tighter than I was before, so maybe I'll try focusing on something else to help with that a little.  Also, I'll definitely try the slack jaw thing, that might be a neat exercise to do, I love the suggestion, thank you!

singing,3bcwht,Sparkiano,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think the challenge y'all are discussing, ( tension not releasing even when you've become aware of it and at times becoming worse) stems from a lack of conscious awareness about the way the body is constructed and wants to move. I recently read a book called ""What Every Singer Needs to Know About The Body"" by Melissa Malde. It discusses the concept of ""body maps."" The basic idea is that the body wants to lengthen, gather, and release in certain specific ways. It is our mental image of our own bodies that inform how the body performs it's tasks.   If our concepts about our bodies construction are flawed, then no matter how aware we are of our tension, we will never quite understand the way our bodies  want to balance in order to relieve that tension.   I've found that in my own quest of becoming aware of tension and releasing it. It has been very helpful studying physiologically accurate skeletons and musculature and imagining these structures on myself. I've also devoted a good bit of my daily gym time to yoga. I know this is a bit of a commitment but it helped me a lot."

singing,3bcwht,Poulenc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"I work with a lot of students with tongue and jaw tension. There's a principle I borrow from physical therapy called muscle fatigue. Take any basic vocal exercise you'd like, practice singing it with the tongue sticking out to one side, then the other side. Keep alternating the tongue back and forth really stretching it out. Don't let the tongue relax back into the mouth. After about 10-20 reps on each side, your jaw muscles will start to feel fatigued, maybe even a little sore. That's good news! Once you've got that feeling, try the vocal passage you are struggling with again."

Divinités du Styx - Gluck (double whammy, also singing this for an audition this fall for grad school) To This We've Come - Menotti Zueignung - Strauss Von Ewiger Liebe - Brahms Beau Soir - Debussy Invito Alla Danza - Respighi Possibly Somewhere over the Rainbow as an encore piece. (Cheesy, and wonderful, since I'm going to grad school in Kansas.)   The general idea is that I want to present what I used to audition for grad schools, as no one heard any of that material other than school faculty (Which is the Hoiby, Strauss, Debussy, Respighi) and paint a short story of my time in my hometown too. I've sung a couple of these things at a recital here in town before, but it was a year and a half ago, and I love them, so I don't think I care that they're not new. Thoughts?"
singing,3bbam5,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"I like it! Lots of variety, shows off your big voice, but still shows a sense of finesse (which I know is something you've been working on).   Personally, I'm a fan of programming recitals as themes/narratives, but I don't know all the pieces well enough to actually figure out what the narrative is.   I definitely think the Brahms and Debussy would pair well together, and the Respighi might work there too. This would make a nice ""farewell"" set to finish with, although the lighter Bernstein/Hoiby would also be a nice closer.   Flip side, you could start with the Berstein/Hoiby and do the ""serious music"" in the middle, finishing with Somewhere Over the Rainbow as a crowd-pleaser.   Or, yanno, you could just sing it in reverse alphabetical order by third letter. That always works. Haha."
singing,3bbam5,ghoti023,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a theme. All of these songs have a significant role in my history in the city I live in to me for one reason or another. It's specifically a ""thanks and goodbye"" recital to my hometown. I grew up here, I got my undergrad degree here. I've done 14 musical seasons here, so I picked music that would help represent that. This is why my program notes are actually going to be really important. The theme is an abbreviated version of my musical journey thus far.  I'm thinking of splitting up the Bernsteins, even though they're from the same song cycle. Starting with ""I hate music"" and closing with ""I'm a person too"" (With Somewhere over the Rainbow as an encore piece, not listed.) I think they'd make nice end-caps. It's kind of cheesy, but I feel like those two songs make a nice round-up of my musical journey thus far. Sure, the song cycle is about a 10 year old going through self-discovery, but I didn't figure out that ""I'm a Person Too"" until just recently, and I think it could make for a sweetness at the end. I know I want the Gluck right before intermission, and the Menotti right after, or the vice versa.  So, maybe -    I hate music. (1:15)   Verbal introduction and welcome, but not a full break   Strauss (2:00) Debussy (3:00) Respighi (2:30) Hoiby (5:00)   Those four basically feel like one in the same set to me now, as that was my audition set. So I kind of do want to keep them together. I got into all 7 schools I auditioned for, which is pretty ridiculous, so I want to highlight that. And that's the order I sang them in. This is omitting ""Ah fuggi il traditor"" - which I sometimes led with, but then would nix the Respighi, and was not really asked for the Strauss. But I don't really want another aria (no matter how short) in this recital.   Gluck. (5:30) This is also the first aria (in addition to the Mozart) that I sang that really fit me when I went to my first summer program. It's the first aria that I really started getting my breath under me and I've performed it significantly less than the Mozart, so that's why I'm choosing this one.   Intermission - total sung time so far: 20ish minutes   Brahms. (5:00) Menotti (8:30)   These two pieces are what made my senior recital a year and a half ago, and are what have stuck with me the most. I think I do actually want to keep them in that order, because that's the order they were in at my recital then.   I'm a Person Too (2:00) Somewhere over the Rainbow (3:00)   2nd half - about 20ish minutes. Total time - roughly 40 sung minutes. PERFECT.  It looks like the second half is super short, but that Menotti is so damned long that it's really not.  How does that look to you with a little bit more of an explanation set up with it?"

Although I'm not familiar with every piece, it seems like a good variety and I think it all makes sense in the order you mentioned in your last comment to /u/keakealani. I don't see any problem with them not being ""new,"" and I think the theme is very appropriate, especially like the nod to your future with Rainbow... seems to me a ""Going-Away Recital"" should consist of the music you love that you feel suits your voice the best and I think you've got it nailed.

singing,3bbam5,keakealani,2,Tue Jun 30 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh, you guys. I'm seriously struggling right now. I jumped from singing a conductor's workshop (4 hours a day of choral sight reading for 5 days straight) to a semi-pro choir gig (3-4 hours of rehearsal Saturday and Sunday for 3 weeks) in addition to taking a full load of summer classes. Oh yeah, and I also have a recital in October.   So not only am I not finding much time to practice regularly, but my voice is tired and when I have time, my voice gives me fatigue symptoms quickly. And I recorded myself the other day for an unrelated project and holy hell...too much subglottic pressure, intonation issues, vibrato all over the place, not to mention French diction is my Achilles' heel!   I dunno, I guess I just needed to vent a little bit about how discouraged I feel about my voice right now. I can't wait until my teacher (oh yeah, I'm also switching teachers) gets back from Europe so I can get a lesson, but at the same time I feel like I'm struggling so much I don't even want to have a lesson because it would just be a disaster anyway. :("

October is forever away right now for you, and if you practice poorly, you're just going to have to re-do it all anyway. Take a break. Score study if you can't stop yourself from doing anything, but start vocalizing as little as possible and give your body a rest. Don't worry about the lesson when your teacher gets back. Take it, and it'll actually probably be awesome because you'll have let yourself rest up a bit. We aren't pianists/violinists, we can't be the energizer bunny from dawn til dusk, our instrument will diminish.  Take it eaaaaaasy."

Definitely agree with /u/ghoti023 -- for the sake of your vocal (not to mention mental) health, if there's any way you can scale back or at least make time for some vocal rest days (a massage or something wouldn't be a bad idea either), I think it will do you a lot of good. Focusing on the short term goals and putting future commitments on the back burner for a while would also help. It's good to practice and be busy but not to the point where it causes harm to your voice. You've worked so hard, you deserve to take a break! In fact, it's often been my experience that I come back after a few days off to do a lot better than when I'd practiced every single day. It all comes down to you knowing what's best for yourself, just be sure you don't over-exert and remember to have fun, and I'm sure you'll come through it all just fine."
singing,3bbam5,nemesmith,2,Tue Jun 30 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"Well, June was an eventful month. I just finally performed my long-awaited German recital which was extremely difficult, but so super fun. Here's the whole thing in case anyone's interested. Started with a set of R. Strauss, then Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder, then a few arias to end. Plenty of things went wrong, tons things I wish I'd done differently, but still pretty stinkin' proud of how it all turned out. This was just for my own personal enjoyment so I did what I wanted to do and just had a blast.   Also, been helping my mentor with some of his students, learning from his teaching techniques, and also working on some duets with him and his students which I'm super psyched about. So pretty excited about where things are at and are headed so far. Looking forward to my next recital... looking like it will be a variety of French chansons which I LOVE."
singing,3bbm7n,oliverismyname,3,Sat Jun 27 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"In general, I'm always a tiny bit wary of people who use fancy-sounding ""techniques"" for teaching, just because it sounds more like marketing than actual skills.   However, I think the terminology used to describe a teacher is less important than the actual product - are they a good teacher, and are their students good singers? Ultimately, I think that's a much more helpful way of evaluating a teacher than any sort of specific teaching technique.   No label can guarantee a good teacher (or a bad one, for that matter). There are people with advanced degrees in vocal performance who are not good teachers, and there are people with very little written record who are great teachers. You should always use your own judgement and the judgement of musicians you respect as the final arbiter when choosing a teacher.   And also, it's possible that a good teacher is a bad fit for you. If your learning style and goals don't mesh with a teacher, they can be the most highly qualified, skillful teacher and they won't necessarily help you improve your singing."
singing,3bbm7n,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:47:14 2015 UTC,cvt isn't going to tell you good or bad things alone but what i look for in a teacher is one who is naturally bad at singing. those jerks that are just good at it often aren't aware of everything they're doing because it comes natural to them. my vocal coach is naturally a horrible singer and he can literally sing anything he wants. seriously any style or genre because he trained having control of his voice that much. he can tell me every little tiny thing im doing wrong right when i start doing it. he's a great teacher because he's conscious of almost everything you can mess up on. in regards to cvt: it's a lot to take in and a lot of those things are good to read through the book to supplement what you already know but the basis for all schools of voice and all genres and sound in general is breathing. there is no way around that. breathing is singing.

To be fair, much of the science they repackage is presented more or less correctly. But to take well-known (in the voice science world) phenomena and ""rebrand"" them with your own terms (""metal,"" ""twang,"" and whatever else) borders on disrespectful or even disingenuous--it makes it sound like the creators invented something.  Jeanette LoVetri, on the other hand, is an example of a contemporary commercial music (CCM) voice teacher who has built a brand around lots of original research into voice science. I'm not super familiar with her method myself, but know some other classical teachers whom I highly respect who've said they were more than impressed by her live workshops."

As far as personal experiences with CVT goes;  I am not a natural singer, and no other vocal teachings have even been close to working well for me (in fact, most of them gave me bad habits that I had a hard time breaking). CVT however is quite adaptive, and have many approaches for you to ""get"" how the different vocal modes etc work. Not to mention it all makes anatomical sense. The only problem I have with it is that it's almost too broad. There are no in-depth exercises etc for you to learn how to sing in a specific style (or at least there wasn't last time I checked a couple of years ago).  Oh, and you are incorrect in CVT not having done original research."

Lots of people in choirs have the same fear of singing by themselves (though there's always those members that like to show how cool they are all the time). Choir is a safe place to learn to get comfortable if the choir is a nice community. From there, I started taking lessons with teachers my choir director suggested/my choir teacher. It's not as scary as singing alone, and most of the people there are probably in the same boat and at the same level of talent."

I started by singing in the car. It was great because it was the only place I could be alone and really project myself. That's when I noticed that there's a difference between singing softly and really projecting yourself. I slowly became aware of my voice and comfortable with its range. But I was still self-conscious; I could sing fine in the car but the moment I had to sing in front of my family, I went back to my old ways of mumbling, not opening my mouth and not singing openly. So one day while I was driving, I decided to sing with my windows rolled down (it was hot that day). My thought process was that these are all random people on the road and I'd likely never see them again...so whatever, who cares if they see me and who cares what they think. There were always a few the laugh and chuckle, but most folks didn't even care. A few months of singing like this and I became more confident, but more importantly, I stopped looking at people for reassurance. Fast forward to now: I've got myself a great vocal teacher and can sing in front of family and friends. I wouldn't say I'm completely confident now, but as I've said earlier, it's much easier to live with that nervousness and shyness. Hope that helps!"

It's totally ok to not be sure of your voice right now, time will work in your favor, you just need to find a good teacher to pick you up where you are. If your first lesson in learning how to sing is to learn how to get over your fear of singing, so be it. This will be a long road, it is for everyone and it doesn't matter where you start, because you won't be able to get around this anyway. You can only get past it by getting through it, there's no other way.      You want to learn how to sing, but singing is so much more than just producing sound and it seems that you've hit your first barrier. There will be a lot more but conquering them will take you further and further on.  So, to (finally ;P) answer your question: I went there, died a little inside because I was so scared, did it anyway and the next time I went there, I died a little less until I didn't care anymore.

But, for me, I just remember and remind myself regularly that most people are not born with it, most have to learn it like any other skill.

Ultimately the only way past nerves is through them, but if you squint your brain anxiety can be nervous energy, and nervous energy can make you do things you didn't know you were capable of if you let it happen. Breathe.  It's normal to sound bad at first. You're untrained and it takes time. Listen to yourself recorded. Do you sound bad? That means you can tell the difference between good and bad. Your voice will improve as you practice, and you'll learn to avoid the rough spots everyone has in their voice.   Good luck, and we all look forward to hearing you."

But there's this other band I really like and there lead singer can stay for an entire bridge or chorus at E4-A4 and it's so frustrating lol

singing,3b9h4i,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:32:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are taught to raise their eyebrows to encourage soft palate lift - is that maybe a factor for you?   Also, eyes and eyebrows are some of the more expressive parts of your face for singing, especially since you can't move your mouth a whole lot while you try to sing.   Then again, you may just be one of those people whose eyebrows have a mind of their own. One of my friends and colleagues has exceptionally expressive eyebrows, to the point where they can almost become a bit distracting when he sings. (Fortunately he's just a very expressive singer in general so it works with his overall stage presence.) At that point, I would just say to try to harness those facial movements in a positive way rather than trying not to do it."
singing,3b9fv2,InternalDiscord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Since nobody has replied yet, I'll take a stab at this, though I'm not very well qualified to do so. To start, click the ""the singing basics"" link in the sidebar --> thataway. One thing I'd definitely recommend is working on your pitch, you're off key/not singing the right notes (probably due to improper breath support, sounds like a few notes are cut short) for most of the song. If you have a guitar or piano, this should be easy, just play a note that is easy for you to sing, hum the note, play one note, two, a simple tune etc. Also, don't be afraid to be loud (but don't purposefully try to be loud), just sing notes the best you can without straining. Edit: upon further listening, it seems you're hitting a note, stopping, and then hitting another note. Try to connect them"

Honestly, that's where I'd start if I were you. Singing along to recordings of other people isn't the best way to get your real sound out, which is what you want - especially when a majority of pop music is against you. Those songs are great - but most of them you would need to transpose down, and if you don't have practice with that sort of thing, it can be really frustrating to do by yourself.  I'd also encourage you to check out this thread. I have a feeling that a lot of people are overlooking this thread because that one was posted only shortly before this one.

However if you are a baritone or bass, mix voice can sound exactly like chest voice. For a low voice, it's important for them to be able to feel the difference between say, overcompressing in chest, mixing, and mixing with eh vowel modification, as they can all sound similar. However, overcompressing shouldn't cause voice damage normally, usually some other muscle functions fails/drops out instead. But it can also cause bad habits if you push too much."

If you pay attention, you'll notice that most of the time, the overtones are very weak. It sounds like a scream because it is loud, high, strong, fast, and has a bit of drive - but the drive is just a small part of it.  The same is worth for this Leftover Crack song. It sounds like a scream more due the context than the overdrives. The parts where he's actually screaming, you can notice that his voice changes a little (like at the 14 secs), because he's using a ""safe scream"".  To sum it up: don't worry, your punk career is fine. Pay close attention to how hard they are actually singing and you'll see that they are not screaming as it seems. =)"
singing,3b393o,dylstew,2,Thu Jun 25 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"Is there actually any way to get the distorted punk shouting without hurting your voice?   It's a form a pitch screaming which actually emphasizes the overtone (not trying to contradict /u/hraklea, but this is from my side of the fence).  In short, it's very similar to singing in your ""mixed"" voice (head and chest voice combined). You project the flow of air slightly in front of where you nasal cavities enter the back of the throat. It takes a lot of breath support to maintain.  Mike Hranca from The Devil Wears Prada uses a really bad version of this technique, but it's similar to the technique used by Keith Buckley (he actually does it correct, and hasn't destroyed his voice)."

I don't usually comment critiques anymore but your control and tone are great. Your parents have influenced your voice very well (and I suddenly want o hear them sing, haha).

You don't do this as soon as there's a consonant at the beginning of the words and (just in my opinion) it sounds way better without the excessive air. It's a great effect and it surely has its use and charm but somehow it got a little distracting (to me) after a while.   But, honestly, way to set the bar. Great voice!

This is a song I just came up with Sunday and recorded just to get the ideas down and practice recording with my new setup (totally new to recording).   From a singing perspective, I'm working on singing from my diaphragm as I've historically been breathing from my chest and therefore had a more stuffed up sound, so I'm curious as to how I'm doing on that front. It's also leading to some pitchiness as I'm directing all my energy and focus to rib expansion and breathing from the right places. So I don't focus as much on pitch, which normally is fine for songs I know we'll, but since I haven't practiced this or even nailed down the melody for good, it has some shaky moments. So cleaning that up is an obvious to-do, but I'm particularly curious about feedback on tone, vocal musicality, and then the words in the chorus that don't have a true pitch (all he ever wanted, was to be with her that night). I feel like what I'm doing isn't working, but its what I feel like is right for the song.   Angel In The Sky- First Demo by me! https://soundcloud.com/scott-thompson-45/angel-in-the-sky-first-demo"

I can hear what you mean about the lack of diaphragm support, eg at 3.01, and generally all through. Try taking deeper breaths, filling up your whole body, as that will force you to control the air as you breathe it out. Notice how the sound becomes thinner when the air runs out."

singing,3b4v61,temporarysteve,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"It sounds very good once you get into it, singing more gently and smoothly. If you are recording, try to iron out a few hiccups first... eg. the opening note is out of tune until you pull it in. Practice that 10, 20, 50 times until you reliably get it. Also try to get straight into the full, smooth tone, without waiting half a verse for it to settle. With this kind of singing, a lot of the character comes from how you feel, and how the gentleness and light humour is projected. So you need to be in the right mood before you start."

singing,3b5no2,Grass025,2,Fri Jun 26 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"There are actually a lot!   So as to not recreate the wheel, I'll point you first to this recommended reading article from the FAQ. Another vocal pedagogy/anatomy book that isn't mentioned in that article is Barbara M. Doscher's The Functional Unity of the Singing Voice. It's a little more prone to errors than a couple of the other texts, but it is really good with pictures (helpful!) and has a lot of good information in an accessible text.  In addition, I would recommend picking up a good diction resource such as David Adams' A Handbook of Diction for Singers or Joan Wall's Diction for Singers. There are also other more specialized references, so if you plan on specializing in a specific language (especially outside of the Big Four of German, French, Italian, and English), you should also consider grabbing those more specific resources. Along similar lines, Pierre Bernac's The Interpretation of French Songs is worth mentioning. Unfortunately other languages don't have as concise a resource available afaik, but if you're interested in French songs, definitely pick that one up.   You may also find it useful to grab a sight singing book. Sol Berkowitz's New Approach to Sight Singing is used commonly and I think it's pretty good. But really, they're mostly pretty similar so any book will do.   It's not directly singing-related, but I think it's helpful to learn some basic piano. Obviously ideally you would take lessons, but you can pick up some of the basics by yourself (I wouldn't recommend this if you eventually want to take piano more seriously - undoing self-teaching is a bitch). Any beginning piano method would be a good way to start. Faber has both an Older Beginners series and an adult all-in-one text; Alfred has an all-in-one as well. I would stay away from Bastien even though they can be good methods, as they are more reliant on having a good teacher to supplement and otherwise move pretty fast.   Similarly, you may find it helpful to pick up some music theory books. This post over in /r/musictheory has a good overview of the texts available, and you can also check out their FAQ. Musictheory.net is a great website, although you mention not having regular internet access. They also have an app for a couple bucks that you might find helpful if you have an app-capable device.   Anyway, that should be plenty to get you started! Some of these texts are definitely on the more advanced side, though, so start slow. I think honestly most of these texts are only really useful if you have some experience to apply them to, so definitely start with some regular ole voice lessons and getting familiar with singing before diving too deep into the technical stuff. Your teacher should also be able to recommend resources."

That's pretty strange - I have absolutely no other evidence, but I agree with your assessment that the extra pressure (and just the fact that you're using that area a lot) could lead to more risk. Honestly, I would probably get it checked out by a doctor just in case. I'm kind of a hypochondriac, but you also read about those stories where people ignored random aches and pains for a while and it turned out to be a big tumor or something. So even if it's not a hernia, maybe it's something else?  On the other hand, if it just seems like sporadic pains, you could've just slept funny or something like that. I don't think I've ever heard of someone talking about singing as being a risk factor, but then again, operatic/classical singing is still enough of a niche career that maybe nobody has studied it?"

Help him find songs that fit his voice (it doesn't matter what his voice type is, just find something that sounds good), that fits choir's audition requirements. Let the choir teacher decide where to stick him.  Choir voice types are also extremely different from solo voice types. I'm a soprano, but sing exclusively alto in choral settings, because I'm really, really loud, and I can't float high notes the way that flutier and lighter sopranos can.  Your brother may be a tenor, he may be a bass, he's probably a baritone right now but there's no telling for sure.  Just help him find something that sounds good in his voice now, and don't worry about the technicalities right this second."
singing,3b3h0e,ghoti023,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"If you're talking US ages, it's likely your brother is in the cambiata stage - the first stage of male voice development where the range starts to drop, but retains some of the high range and qualities of a boy treble voice. This is very common in the 13-15 year age range which is usually 8th-10th grade in the US.   If this is the case, it's completely irrelevant what his range is today, because it won't be the same tomorrow or next week, much less next year. It's definitely more helpful to think about how he relates to his voice (learning to associate sensations with sounds) and just singing where it is comfortable. Any good choir teacher at that age level will know how to deal with changing voices and be able to adjust as your brother's voice settles.   If you want to help him out with musical stuff, I would work on just that - comfort with singing and just generally getting to know his new voice. I would also work on reading - in my experience, reading is a problem in a lot of high school level choirs (in the US, at least) so having strong reading skills would definitely help your brother get ahead and feel confident in choir."

singing,3b3h0e,keakealani,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, piano is always helpful. In general you won't be expected to read perfectly in a high school choir, but it does help to at least be familiar with music notation and comfortable with things like rhythm and key signatures.   And yep, any sorts of exercises could be helpful. Even singing a familiar song like Happy Birthday or My Country 'Tis of Thee in a variety of keys is a good way of just navigating the voice without stressing out about knowing the song. And make sure to be supportive if his voice isn't behaving. Cracking and loss of range are common in that age group, and giggling about it can be a real downer to self-esteem and joy of singing. Not that I think you'd do that, but it bears repeating :)"

I use this to see if I really am dropping my jaw enough, because what feels like enough may not actually be enough.  It might feel uncomfortable and exaggerated at first, but it becomes more normal the more you practice.  For volume, breathe is essential.  The more air you take in, the louder and stronger you can sing, especially for higher notes.  Strong breathing requires good (or at least decent) posture, as well as muscle control.  Shoulders back, spine and neck straight, head up, all that good stuff.  Singing breathing is a little different than regular breathing.  Compare your normal breathing to when you breath lying on your back.  When you lie on your back, you can see your stomach (diaphragm) move up and down as you breath.  Use that muscle to fill your lungs.  Sorry if this is too much information, but I hope at least some of it can help!"
singing,3b338z,TibblesTheGekkota,3,Thu Jun 25 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well, lots of things.   Diction would be the first step. Mumbling often (but not always) includes poor articulation and diction skills. You need to be clear and fully articulate all phonemes, focusing both on crisp pronunciation of consonants and pure formation of vowels. This means reducing unnecessary diphthongs/vowel ""mixing"" and not interfering with articulation.   In addition, you probably want to work on resonance. Resonance is basically how the sound waves bounce around once they've been initially produced in your vocal folds. From there, they have to travel out your throat, through your pharynx and oral cavity, and finally out of your mouth into the air. At any point before the sound escapes, you have the opportunity to mold how it travels by changing the size and shape of the vocal tract (that whole tube from throat to mouth).   In classical singing, we call the balanced resonance chiaroscuro, literally meaning ""light-dark"". We aim for a good balance between brightness, clarity, and lightness, with a healthy does of dark, rich sounds. These sounds work together to create an overall pleasing tone.   Even if you are not a classical singer, the concept still applies. You need to figure out what types of resonance are used in your style, and balance them to create a mix between tone colors. This gives you a pleasant sound that's not too anything, but just right. Of course, this is easier said than done - I know I'm personally still working on it, even though I've been taking voice lessons for ~6 years and singing in general for twice that time.   This also helps you create volume, because you can learn to emphasize overtones that carry well, and make your voice project more efficiently (although I don't like using the word ""project because some people perceive it as meaning screaming or shouting to be heard). It's hard to explain, but essentially you make your voice louder by reducing acoustic interference and maximizing acoustic efficiency, not by actually forcing your vocal folds to work significantly harder.   With this in mind, posture is also a major issue, especially if you're playing guitar. It is possible to have good singer's posture while playing, but it can be difficult depending on how you play. In general, it's best to stand and sing, and if you remain seated, you need to always be in an upright position with a naturally curved spine, never hunched over the instrument.   Finally, I would encourage you to record yourself. For many reasons, you cannot hear yourself accurately when you sing (it's physiologically impossible), and you definitely can't hear balance from behind. So set up a reliable recording device a few feet away from where you're singing/playing from, and evaluate that way to tweak balance."

I was that way until my late twenties or early thirties when I woke up to do my early morning warm ups and suddenly everything was easier. Easier to sustain, easier to support, and better sounding. keep on practicing and training the right technique, but just know that, as a young singer, you will have days where your voice doesn't sound as good or you can't hit certain notes, and that is just nature. Just do not stop practicing."

I would say that strictly speaking, although everyone's voice continues to change as they age, the voice changes that occur beyond the late 30s should not be treated as the same as the changes that occur during puberty, as they are much more gradual and often have more to do with the development of technique than on a physical change in the structure of the voice."

The results you produce will heavily outweigh any degrees or certifications you have- though a bachelor's degree in music shows that you're classically trained rather than self taught. Network and build your name. Develop a curriculum for your chosen age group, and start either marketing toward that demographic or make friends with people that will refer clients your way.  I would heavily suggest you learn to accompany on your own, unless you want to be bound to books that supply accompaniment tracks or hiring on an accompanist for all kinds of stuff. If you're planning on working with grade school age students, this shouldn't be much of a problem, but more advanced works will usually leave performance and interpretation mostly up to the performers.  It sounds like you've got the musical side of things down- time to work on the business side. I highly suggest The Private Studio Handbook by Joan Frey Boytim if you haven't already read through it.

I wouldn't mind being a ""voice teacher"", but it isn't as much a passion of mine.   Stylistically, I would like to be comfortable teaching any style. Currently, I have students who sing Taylor Swift, Adele, alongside Rossini arias and Strauss art songs."
singing,3b1bks,ghoti023,2,Thu Jun 25 13:49:03 2015 UTC,"Hi! I think this is awesome. I have some similar interests so I'd like to throw in my two cents about what I've considered pursuing.   If your piano chops are up to it, I would strongly recommend getting a degree in collaborative piano (perhaps instead of advanced degrees in voice, but definitely in addition). It seems like a lot of collab piano programs are actually ""coach training"". As /u/SirButthat points out, most coaches need to be at a level where they can accompany their students - otherwise you need to spend a lot of money on a pianist or you focus more on the collaboration aspects than on the student.   I also think it's important to have a coaching specialty beyond ""singing well"". If your only strength is vocalism, well then, you're just a voice teacher. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I can't foresee people seeing a coach in addition to their regular teacher just for voice-specific things. The only exception is if you specialize in a very specific type of performance practice such as Baroque/early music or new music. But I just don't think people will go to a separate coach to get performance tips on romantic art song or something like that - it's just not that different from the expertise they can get from any qualified voice teacher.   Other options... diction coaches are very popular and useful. If you have a really strong background (ideally native or at least fluent) in a singing language, that's a really good place to be. Acting/stage coaches are also very common, especially for opera. There are probably some other niches you can find, but the point is to specialize and make a name for yourself as providing a specific skillset, not just ""being a coach"".   As for commercial music, that I really know nothing about so I'll let someone else chime in. I will say, from my experience here, many people interested in singing CCM are very suspicious of anyone with classical training, even if they also do some pop as well. So you'll have to market yourself very differently and be sure you have enough commercial credentials, as classical credentials are either ignored or treated with suspicion by commercial singers.   Ultimately, though, go for your dreams! It sounds like you've got the right trajectory, so keep going. I think to be realistic, you won't build up a full coaching studio in 5 years (especially since most coaches travel more than being based out of a single area, which means the expense of traveling has to be covered by your coaching income), but there's no harm in dreaming big!"

singing,3b1gql,terrycotta,2,Thu Jun 25 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"How familiar are you with the rules of counterpoint? In general, I think almost all styles benefit from good counterpoint (obviously applying the rules to the harmonic language in question), so if you are not super strong on your counterpoint, now's a great time to start!   In general:   Melodies should be mostly stepwise, with some skips and leaps for interest. Leaps should not be greater than an octave except for extreme effect, and should be resolved in the opposite direction by stepwise motion. Do not leap into a dissonance.  Harmony on strong beats should be consonant unless you are using a suspension/appoggiatura. (Consonance does not exclude ""tension"" harmonies like dominant functions.) Text stress should be observed wherever possible on both the word and phrasal level. Word stresses should appear on strong beats and/or longer durations. If you are using syncopation, the accented/lengthened note functions as the strong beat on a micro scale. On a phrasal level, nouns and action verbs should gain primary stress; adjectives, adverbs, and other helping words should gain secondary stress; and articles, conjunctions, and grammar markers should gain tertiary stress. A possible experience is the word ""but"" because it indicates a shift in tone/character.  Optionally, text meaning and interpretation may be evident from melodic writing - you can use idiomatically-appropriate mechanisms to emphasize certain text or musically describe the text.      So imo those are generally a good place to start for any sort of melodic writing, adapted as necessary for your style (what I considered dissonance and consonance might be different than for you)."

I guess it's in part because of the prog elements, we're all very good musicians but not the greatest singers so we have to spend more time doing that in order to fine tune it.  This is gonna sound weird, but there's a scene in Saving Mr. Banks, that movie about how Disney made Marry Poppins, where the musicians are sitting behind the piano, and they're talking not just about the song, but about what the song means--something along the line of, when they sing the word 'down', they pitch upwards, because Poppins is just strange and unexpected like that.  That whole dialogue is like what we do, we sit there with the music for hours on end, playing with, should the melody go up, or down here?  How should the harmony be?  Thirds or open fifths?  How does it fit with the story in the song?  Should there be one, powerful voice, representing a specific character, or should it be a chorus representing an idea or a group?  The specifics vary, and I'm sure you're not trying to be as much like Disney, vocally speaking, as we are, but the ideas are there.  Sit down with your friend and work out the vocals with him, workshopping ideas, so long as you leave your egos at the door, will always prove better than just gunning it.  If you have a strong voice, utilize that as well--I have a 2 1/2 octave range and you damn well know I use every note I've got."

singing,3b1at8,SirButthat,2,Thu Jun 25 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think I understand what you're asking. Staccato is about duration, not volume. Singing staccato notes means you just touch on the note and kind of bounce it.   Vibrato also isn't necessarily just about pitch variance, either. If your vibrato isn't spot on, it may lead to changes in perceived volume.  Higher frequencies tend to sound 'louder' than lower ones even at the same amplitude, which is the intensity analog of a waveform. Example. You'll notice that as the frequency rises, so does the perceived volume, even though the amplitude (intensity) stays exactly the same the whole time."

Much of the advice on that website and others is fine for most people, but it does not replace actual lessons.   Beyond that, if you are taking lessons, be careful not to get too distracted from what your teacher is working on with you. Sometimes, teachers deliberately focus on certain issues and avoid other ones because too much stuff all at once is confusing and difficult. If your teacher is telling you to set aside some concepts for later, don't just go on a bunch of websites and try to teach yourself those things when you should be working on something else. It might just mess with the thing you actually need to be working on right now.   But yes, there are good websites out there and imo this is generally one of them.

singing,3azyde,ketch00,4,Wed Jun 24 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a pretty complex issue and many issues could be involved.   The first thing I'd mention is seeing if you have any allergies. Overabundant mucus is often the result of allergies, and you may not be aware of an allergy, particularly if it is seasonal. If you do have an allergy, the best thing to do is tackle that with an allergist - this might involve over-the-counter antihistamines, nasal sprays or rinses, immunotherapy, or other treatments.   You might find it helpful to keep track of days where you notice irritation/mucus and cross check it with your area's allergen report (most weather forecast services have a section on common allergens). You can also see an allergist to get a skin or blood test for common allergens.   Secondly, you should check that you aren't contracting a mild cold or other illness. If you work with children a lot or in a high population environment, you may just be picking up whatever random bugs. Some people have good enough immune systems not to come down with a serious cold, but can still feel slightly congested and ill.   GERD and other digestive issues are a real concern. That's something you have to address with a gastro-intestinal specialist, really, but yes, GERD is a very real problem for some singers and can definitely cause mucus and other irritation in the throat.   Hydration is important, so definitely keep drinking water. Even most people who think they are good about drinking water still drink less than is ideal. I think for most people you're supposed to get about 12 cups of water between food and drink (which usually translates to 8 cups of actual drinking water).   Beyond that, I would recommend seeing an ENT (ear-nose-throat) specialist if you have continued issues with throat irritation. There could be lots of other issues hiding in your body and it's pretty hard to figure that out. I won't claim to know all the possible medical issues, so you really do have to see a doctor for that."
singing,3azyde,keakealani,2,Wed Jun 24 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"Keakealani hit on the complex sides of the issue, though if you're looking for quick fix on how to alleviate mucus, there are generally four solutions.     Avoid dairy like the plague.  It, in all its forms, causes an increase in phlegm. Any drink (the warmer the better) mixed with honey and lemon will have the dual function of both cutting through phlegm with citric acidity while soothing the throat with a coating of smooth honey if it is irritated.  This is usually a short term fix for singing, but a hot lemon tea sweetened with honey is a good drink to have daily if you need it that way. the old saltwater trick is an effective one. Take a spoonful of salt and a small quantity of warm water.  Stir the two together, gargle the water and spit it back out.   Avoid darkly colored drinks.  Something about whatever it is that gives them that color can cause throat sensitivity.  Something like Sprite or even Mountain Dew are fine.  I think Tea and coffee are fine.  Wouldn't know about coffee since I don't drink it, just don't mix it with any dairy. (this is a more subtle thing for singing and is more for preventing vocal cracking.)     Hope all that helps."
singing,3azyde,TimberTaft,2,Wed Jun 24 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, dairy has been shown not to increase mucus production. Some sources note that dairy can thicken mucus, but with adequate hydration it shouldn't be a big problem.   I also really can't see a way the color of a drink can affect mucus production in a meaningful way, although I know personally I'm sensitive to sugary drinks in general (regardless of color). Tea and coffee are also somewhat acidic which can cause irritation in the throat. But I think color is probably largely incidental."

singing,3ay52r,MorDon1,13,Wed Jun 24 13:06:36 2015 UTC,"All singing, even breathing, is done with the diaphragm. Terms like ""support"" and ""diaphragmatic breathing"" are (in my opinion) confusing umbrella terms for the concerted action of the muscles of the trunk of the body, from collarbone to pelvis. Pectorals, lats, obliques, abdominal muscles, glutes, quadratus lumborum (lower back), intercostal muscles, these all work together in a highly sophisticated manner to control a small, but pressurized, stream of air for singing. You should never simply squeeze your core which is what some people do when attempting to sing ""using the diaphragm."" This concerted action of all these muscles comes from years of training, and should never be forced by conscious effort. You can seriously hurt your voice this way.   If you want to achieve the muscle action that is sometimes referred to as ""diaphragmatic singing,"" be athletic. Work out. Make sure you are in good shape. Once the muscles in the trunk of the body are strong enough to hold back the air pressure required for healthy singing, the muscles (not all of them) above and around the larynx will let go, allowing you to sing with a free larynx, more open resonators, and using an airflow controlled by your torso. And remember, getting the muscles around and above the larynx to let go, effectively giving control to the muscles of your torso, is a process that takes a very long time. Practice every day, make sure you are not overly tensing your neck, jaw, or tongue, and over time, your larynx will have no choice but to rely on the muscles of the body to control its airflow.  EDIT:   Ghoti123 hit the nail on the head. Many people who don't fit the conventional image of being physically fit, i.e. not lean or toned/muscular, can actually have very strong core muscles. Look at opera singers who are more on the overweight side, yet still have perfect posture. Keeping that extra amount of weight raised and in alignment takes a great deal of core muscle strength. I say ""be athletic"" to ensure that, regardless of how you look or your size, you have a very strong torso and your breathing capacity is increased. I also forgot to mention I am speaking from an opera perspective. To get a resonant, highly complex sound that cuts over an orchestra requires a lot of muscle involvement. If the core muscles aren't strong enough, the larynx will completely overblow, or call in neck and tongue muscles to hold back air pressure. The same principle applies to non-classical singing, but since that requires singing at a smaller volume, its less core muscle work. However, in ALL types of singing you want the core to be holding back the air coming out, which requires both coordination and strength."

I used to not be. #collegelife  You don't have to look physically fit to have a strong core, and if you've been singing well a lot, you'll wind up naturally building that level of support that's good for your body. The extra weight on the core also helps with engaging the breath. You'll find the same thing with pregnant women. (Renée Fleming addresses this in her autobiography.) The weight does a lot of the engaging of your breath for you, so in a sense, it takes less effort to get your air moving."

Do you have to be in good shape to sing well? Emphatically no. The empirical evidence of this is overwhelming.

It's easy feeling and natural, so you aren't in danger of forcing your stomach out in order to take lower breaths (which is what a lot of young/beginning singers do when teachers tell them to breathe ""diaphragmatically"").

But, braces definitely do affect articulation and diction.   I don't have much specific advice besides just getting more used to your braces, but I do advise you to practice diction slowly and deliberately. For example, speak your text in rhythm at half tempo, focusing on exactly how your tongue, lips, teeth, etc. interact with each other. At this point, you can notice where you need to adjust - for example, if you can't make contact with your teeth because of braces, figure out an alternative nearby place of articulation that sounds similar. If your lips get caught around the outside of your braces, try using a different position that involves less movement there or loosening the lips to fit around the braces.   It's not easy - you probably never thought about diction before in your life, so it feels really weird to have to relearn the way you articulate certain sounds. But it's possible to deal with it in a way that minimally affects your sound."

singing,3awfz5,adidas558492,2,Wed Jun 24 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Well, it is complicated, so there could be lots of things that can help you.   First of all, I would like to address some of the things you do mention, though. Yes, ""diaphragmatic"" breathing (or more physiologically correctly, supported breathing - all breathing is technically diaphragmatic) and resonance are some of the main ways you can control the loudness of your voice. Registration balance is also a big one. But those things aren't exactly simple ""on/off"" switches that you can easily perfect in a short period of time.  I'll also throw out the fact that in terms of being understood, diction is very important. And actually, good diction can improve overall resonance by creating clearer vowel spaces that allow for a more advantageous resonating pattern for the vowel. But mostly, diction is highly important for being understood by people, whatever the dynamic level.   With that in mind, the reason you won't find someone detailing out a step-by-step approach is because it's just not that simple. I could even tell you exactly what I do (I'm a pretty analytical singer, myself), but it's unlikely that it would be very helpful for you because my voice is not your voice and my feelings are not your feelings.   This is why it is so important to work with a qualified teacher when addressing complex issues of technique. A teacher doesn't have to lay it out step-by-step, but instead can react to what you are doing in your lessons and try new things to get you closer to the goal. A teacher can make sure what you're doing is within the realm of health and not something dangerous, even if you're experimenting with delicate muscle groups in your voice."
singing,3awfz5,keakealani,2,Wed Jun 24 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"I know that for myself my singing power and ""loudness"" was increased DRASTICALLY after I learned the proper way to raise my soft pallette (took plenty of voice lessons over the years). Do this the next time you're practicing and it will help your projection IMMENSELY.   Posture is a HUGE part of making sure that you project properly and have good tone.   First, stand against a wall with your back against the wall and your head straight forward, not up, not down - straight forward (we want the neck relaxed).  Next Take your thumb (it doesn't matter which one) and place the face of it directly behind your two front teeth and push forward (as if to create an overbite). This will help raise your soft pallette. Once the soft pallette is raised it allows more air through and you're able to project more using your diaphragm as the vehicle and your voice as the driver (that's probably the best analogy I can think of). You want the air to carry your voice, not your vocal chords - that will strain them. This also will give you a better tone if done properly. Feel free to PM me with more questions..."

At any rate, it's all about having an efficient mix voice, which allows you to sustain good adduction, which is interpreted as using more power.  There is some projection improvement to be gleamed from proper technique, but your voice doesn't like... Stretch itself out, it's rather just the sustained mix function.  I can back this up with experience, as I only started off with one octave of range, the only fix is learning the mix voice properly; which those quick tips you hear about, fail to address."

And the distortion, when created healthily, usually comes from bringing the false cords together above the vocal cords and causing them to vibrate, 'distorting' the sound. Achieving this is a fine balance of placement and diaphragmatic pressure. Usually you want to feel the grit in the soft palate whilst adding just enough breath pressure to create the desired sound.  Note that distortion is probably harder for him to keep from coming into his voice at these extreme pitches than at others, so what he does may not be entirely deliberate (or healthy). Distortion done healthily is always layered on top of a clean note."

singing,3asnxg,Visti,6,Sun Jul 5 12:22:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously, everyone is different so nobody can tell you exactly what will or will not affect you. But here are some general things that can affect smokers.    irritation, obviously. The heat can pretty severely irritate various parts of the larynx, as well as particles like tar and ash.  coughing. This is more just a specific type of irritation people forget about. Coughing slams your vocal folds together pretty violently (it's like equivalent to 80mph but a really short distance), and that can do long term damage to the folds.  dehydration. Again, due to heat and stuff, you can dry things out in your throat. This often thickens mucus, which is one of the main things that protects the vocal folds. If you sing with overly thick mucus that can also do long term damage to the folds.  lungs & breath capacity. Tiny particles, inflamed bronchi, and other issues can create breath issues, potentially leaving you short of breath or with reduced capacity to intake air.    Whether or not these things affect you is part luck, part physiology and probably a bunch of other factors, but those are some base lines to think about. In particular I would really be worried about long term damage to the vocal folds. If it gets to the point of nodes/polyps it can be a pretty big deal."

singing,3arqv5,yall_,3,Mon Jun 22 23:50:25 2015 UTC,"The tongue is a huge chunk of the muscle tissue of your lower jaw. Pay attention to how you hold your jaw while singing- is it jutting forward slightly or relaxed in its place? Are you possibly opening your mouth too tall? If you feel the stretch in your jaw muscles, your vowel is likely too tall. 'Reaching' (tilting the head and neck upward) for notes is a common problem- don't do it, it pulls things out of proper alignment.  The thing is that you can't try to consciously control these muscles without introducing extra tension in the process. You can't try to do the thing, you just have to do the thing. It sounds counterintuitive and slightly esoteric, but you really just have to relax your face and let it go. Higher frequencies are all about how you use your breath and the vowel you pick.  What helps me with high notes is thinking downward. Imagine that as you ascend in pitch, the notes are coming from deeper within yourself. (The opposite works for low notes)."
singing,3arqv5,SirButthat,2,Tue Jun 23 00:45:36 2015 UTC,'Reaching' (tilting the head and neck upward)   This so much. There's a little trick my college vocal teacher taught me and this will help with that specifically. Take your thumb and place the face of it against your two front teeth and push forward (as if to create an overbite). This will help raise your soft palate. Raising the soft palate will allow more air flow through and better intonation. It should also help alleve your tongue pain.
singing,3arqv5,sageritz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"The ""muscles under your jaw"" could actually just be your tongue root.  The root of the tongue can be tense even while the part of your tongue that's in your mouth is relaxed, and even without the tongue pulling back from the position you describe.  Sometimes the tongue root gets recruited as a laryngeal depressor, if the other elements of technique aren't in place for keeping the larynx low.  Sometimes singers engage the tongue root in order to darken their sound artificially.  Google around, there are some good guides and videos out there.  It can be useful to familiarize yourself with the sensation of your tongue root, if only for the ability to diagnose when it's tense.  When it is very tense it actually a similar feeling to gagging.  It could be something else though.  Oh and the other commenter is right that concentrating on it during singing will only trip you up.  In singing I ""monitor"" for tension, but in practicing or performing it doesn't do any good to try and let go of tension in a specific place.  I just have to re-center myself and focus on support or having good and gentle diction."
singing,3arqv5,annoying_breathing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:12:52 2015 UTC,"The muscles fibers under the jaw and in the front and core of the neck have fascial continuity with the muscles in the abdomen, which in your case are trying to ""squeeze out"" your high notes, and transferring that effort ""up the line"" to your neck. The most likely cause for this is air being improperly managed by a) only using the muscles of the front plane instead of also activating the sides and back of the core, and b) over-activating all muscles during the inhalation phase, which doesn't allow the body to achieve spontaneous and complete resonance. These are big issues, vital to singing healthily, which are hard if not impossible to learn by reading something on the Internet."
singing,3arqv5,Deepblueish,0,Tue Jun 23 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"no, it's not because of the tongue. Jaw tension is usually related to how much weight your voice is pulling up. since i went from a baritone up to a light spinto tenor, jaw tension was something I had like 98% of the time, until i finally reached my correct tessitura."
singing,3aq6vm,stratosfear_liar,5,Mon Jun 22 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"We call it an onset: the beginning or attack of the first note.  Achieving a proper onset takes lots of training.   You don't want it to be forced,  but not unenergized or breathy,  either.    Try saying ""bee bee bee"" and ""zee zee zee"" normally,  but with a full sound.   Speaking this should let you feel what a proper onset is like.   It should feel normal and unforced,  but with a clear sound that instantly appears and fills the room.  Try to replicate that in your singing.  It may not be easy,  however.   Some students need lots of training before being able to do onsets well.   That's about all I can say...  If you post an audio clip I may be able to hear what's going on better.  But fundamental technique like that probably can't be solved easily."
singing,3aq6vm,lux514,7,Mon Jun 22 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"This is a good answer. It sounds like OP is stuck with glottal attack, or breathy onset when air escapes before the note.  The hardest sounds to start with are vowels. Things like consonants are easier, especially ""b"" and ""p."""

singing,3aq6vm,TheopholosWhenntooda,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"Fricatives are consonants produced by creating friction with the air rather than a stop of air (or other oddballs like approximants but that's not relevant). So like ""f"", ""v"", ""s"", ""z"", ""th"" etc. I think they help the airflow move better because the hazard with stops is that too much air pressure builds up causing a hard glottal onset, or the air gets wasted and the onset is weak or incomplete.   It's obviously a matter of opinion, I was just curious. Even if you don't have a strong preference, I'm still curious if you have a reason for mentioning those specific consonants. If not no worries, I was just curious :)"
singing,3aq6vm,keakealani,3,Tue Jun 23 08:56:51 2015 UTC,"I have found that breathing in the shape of the vowel you're about to sing is one thing that helps with onset.

Here are some samples This is a Big Sean remix that I have been working on https://clyp.it/c0vxy00q This is my 'Hard' voice which I do not like at all. This is very up front and clear but I find its way to compressed and Stiff https://clyp.it/ltezybxc This is my 'Soft' voice which i'm more consistent with, however its pretty mellow to my ears and lacks the bite. https://clyp.it/vqloty2k Do you think my voice would be usable if I put the time into it? My singing teach kept drilling a bunch of wise ideas into my head during my time with him, one of them I only just started to get was that he claimed that HE only became a singer once he realised what his natural vocal strengths were, and started to harness that power, rather than trying constantly try to sing out of his range.  edit: When I sing it feel like I'm always brushing up against the highest notes that I can do,  I don't really have a relaxed key/octave position to sing in, If i try to sing lower it does not sound good to my ears, perhaps thats because I'm not training this area?

singing,3aqv5e,HenrySinatra,6,Mon Jun 22 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Drink plenty of water. Avoid caffeine, it dries you out more than the drink is going to hydrate you, I think. Either way, water is going to be better.   No dairy or spicy stuff. As much as I love both of those things, both make phlegm, and phlegm makes wonky singing sounds and ugly throat-clearing noises.  Stretch beforehand, it helps make sure your body is awake. Power poses are great to do too, if you can find the time.   If you get nervous while singing and you start shaking, it's just fine to make an appropriate gesture. It helps you focus your muscles on one action and reduce that annoying even-more-nerve-wracking shaking.  As for practice, by this point you should really be done fixing things up and deciding what to do and when, so just work on making your best performance every go around. If you've already 'piqued' on your performance for this exam, go over your music and stay very focused on it. Usually once a musician piques on a song, they start getting lazy and making careless mistakes. It's just a part of being properly prepared, so you've gotta be attentive and keep your head completely in the game!  Warm up at home or in your room or in a practice room WELL before the exam! If you have to rush doing this, it's just going to add stress and make you more likely to mess up.   Lastly, don't psych yourself out of doing a good job. Just keep in mind that a perfect performance is always a stretch-goal and that a good performance is always attainable.   Good luck, hope you make an awesome grade! :)"

singing,3aqv5e,keakealani,4,Mon Jun 22 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"/u/YourFavoriteBaritone covers most of it, but I'll just add a few extra thoughts.   Here's a thread I made a while ago discussing performance nerves. I'm not sure if this is a problem for you, but in case it is, those are some strategies to consider for dealing with nerves.   Plan out your performance as much as possible. Think about the little things - will you need to bow? Acknowledge a pianist? It sounds silly, but actually go through these motions. Practice giving a fluid bow, gesturing appropriately toward your pianist, and your smile when you finish. Those little things can trip you up and take your focus away from the actual performance. Plus it just feels more polished and professional, which is always nice.   Definitely know your music cold. I learned the hard way never to cram memorization at the last minute (honestly I still do it way more than I should and it's fucked me over a couple times...) If you need to, write down your words over and over again until you can recite them perfectly. Check your music for funny entrances/cutoffs/breaths you have to remember. Just know what to do so that muscle memory can take over for 90% of it, leaving you room to feed off of the audience and give a good performance.   Don't overpractice, though! Warm up thoroughly, but don't fatigue your voice before you even start. And don't stress yourself out by running your song until you start nitpicking little things you won't be able to address in time. Trust that you know your music and let it just come out naturally.   Good luck!"

singing,3an7jk,Tsupaero,4,Mon Jun 22 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, autotune is bad but Melodyne is essential.  Having worked a lot with known vocalists in and out, I never released a track without having melodyned it to a certain amount. Nor have I ever worked with a studio that's leaving a vocal stem unmelodyned. It's mostly about an off-vibrato, the timing or slightly unclean syllables. It does straighten and process in a way you wouldn't be able without. Not sure if that's related to your actual autotune-rant, but tuning vocals (and especially the nuances) is often an absolutely must, no matter the quality of a singer."

I'm talking about modern productions with digital synths and an overall very tight tonal range, hefty compression and a lot of focus on a single layered vocal. Sheeran, for example, has a fantastic studio voice and requires very little post, however nuances count there as much as in every other, if not even more. Still, very far away from the actual autotune topic.  In the end, it's often easier to just correct a little offset than repeating a take for the twentieth time. Well done it's close to unhearable for anyone not seeing the actual melodyning process."

I feel like you used to hear anecdotes about whatever band hanging out in the studio for weeks (and doing 20 takes)--is this less common now?   On the one side, yes, studio time is extremely expensive at the moment, on the other side, major labels pay whatever they're asked so it doesn't matter for the artist. It does matter, however, when you're bothered with this one syllable or vibrato and either the artist isn't able to correct it him/herself or he isn't aware of the fine difference so he/she's not even capable of doing it differently. Sometimes they also say ""it's my style"", although it's just off and I correct it anyways. Later they don't mind, ever. They mind if something is ""flattering"", or ""not brilliant"" or ""strong"" enough - and changing nothing but correcting the pitch and expression makes them happy. It's literally all about the things you hardly can control as human when singing, as an artist. I had singers in the cabin, studied studio vocalists, who are quite different when it comes to timbre and drifts - they really do it intentionally with the amount of detail you'd otherwise had to bring in afterwards."

Autotune and quantization actively remove and flatten expression and intonation, stiffening the voice into a sorry excuse for poor musicianship!  T-pain good, Chris Brown bad. T-pain is an excellent R n' B singer when he isn't using his vocorder, and he uses the vocorder to extend his voice. Chris Brown is mediocre at best and uses autotune to make up for lack of practice and skill."

singing,3an7jk,TheChurchofHelix,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"Uninspired performance and poor execution of the songs he sings in. For example - take ""Look At Me Now"". I'm sure you know the song. Brown contributes his verse, then quickly gives up the mic to Busta, who's a damn fine rapper, and whose verse makes the song a good one. For another example, ""Talk Dirty to Me"". Same unispired Brown verses, and the whole thing relys on a kickass sax lick taken from an Israeli dancefolk fusion band. (different artist, my b)  This is a very, very common theme in Brown's songs - at least, the ones that are relevant. He does his bit, then has a guest artist or a sample or something that makes the song good for him. Never mind that he uses pitch correction like a crutch, even on songs that aren't technically challenging.   Never mind that he's a corporate shill, a terrible misogynist, and an abusive prick.  While I don't generally enjoy pop music (the flair might give that away), I enjoy good musicianship, of which there is tons in the pop and rap spheres. Don't listen to Chris Brown. Don't listen to Iggy. Don't listen to Lil' Wayne. Listen to Rihanna. Listen to Tech N9ne. Listen to Hopsin.   I hope that makes sense.

Obviously it defeats the purpose if someone uses it when seeking feedback, but the truth is it's actually used in a lot of instances without anyone knowing it. The statement ""It is not a subtle effect"" is incorrect, you are just noticing it when people choose to use it in a less than subtle manner, at which point I would agree that it is often in poor taste and raises all of the concerns that you mention.  I especially dislike it's use these days for a capella ensembles for whom it seems to have become standard practice to record voices one at a time and use software to ""correct"" the pitches. I don't know if commercially available software is getting sophisticated enough yet to produce just tuning, but the equal-tempered tuning that the software locks everyone into by default is often harsh compared to what singers with good ears can produce naturally. I have zero interest in hearing a capella recordings that have been produced in this manner, which seems to be most of them these days."

Most people don't know this, but Auto-Tune and Melodyne do more than just correct pitch in an absolute sense, they can also flatten out natural fluctuations within a note, and alter the transition between notes. These parameters are all adjustable, but it is often the elimination of natural slurs, and loss of natural pitch fluctuations within a note that are normally present (not necessarily vibrato as such, but the same idea) that make it seem so unnatural."
singing,3an7jk,Akoustyk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Have to say, to anyone who needs to just fine-tunr some individual mistakes when recording a track in a hurry, autotune is a poor choice, as you have little control over its application to individual sections. Melodyne Editor allows you to fine-tune individual notes, even in a polyphonic recording (like being able to split a mixed song back into tracks) - So if you've sung one or two words out of tune or out of time, Melodyne will let you fine tune that individual note (they appear as bubbles on a grid, dragging up or down changes pitch and dragging left and right changes timing).  Much better than autotune and, as OP says, autotune wrecks tone unless you only use a very, very tiny amount of it."

If you listen carefully to Ne-Yo singing you can hear he uses a wide variety of cord closures, and some parts of the song have the same kind of buzzing/crisp quality that Ed predominantly uses in his song.  Once you practice enough you'll find that words like chest/mix/head don't matter, and it's all about getting the right vocal muscle coordination/support/vocal tract shape/mouth shape/tongue position/soft palette lifting/etc to produce the sound you want, and these can't be simplified to single words."
singing,3ap94v,redditisthenewblak,3,Mon Jun 22 11:41:37 2015 UTC,"On top of doing vocal practice, I would suggest doing some athletic training. I don't know your history with athletic training, but even if you didn't work out, vocal practice can actually develop some strength, endurance, and coordination in the muscles of the trunk of the body. Therefore, since you didn't get to sing how your used to, a few things most likely happened:  -Your larynx lost some strength and coordination (strength comes from muscle power, coordination is muscle memory)  Solution: Do vocal exercises in a place where you can practice at a comfortable volume. Perhaps a bathroom with the shower running? Practicing lightly can actually develop major coordination and strength, as long as you are not tensing your supra laryngeal muscles to quiet the volume. You will need a strong trunk of the body to achieve this.  -Your core lost its strength and coordination  Solution: Work out. Do core exercises, do back strengthening exercises, do glute exercises, and chest exercises. This strong core will allow you to practice quietly using the healthiest muscle involvement.  -You lost a bit of muscle memory of the connection of trunk of body and larynx, which is highly, highly complex and intricate (and is still not fully understood by modern science)   Solution: Keep practicing.  For now, your first focus should be doing exercises to strengthen your trunk, followed by vocal practice.  In a few weeks, you should start to get your mojo back! Muscle memory is a beautiful thing, even when it diminishes, it's still always in your body, just dormant."

singing,3ap94v,donutglaze123,3,Mon Jun 22 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"How long have you been working out? I ask this because if its been only a few months, your larynx will have to get used to the new airflow it receives due to stronger core muscles. Also, being new to working out means your muscles tire and sore easily, so even though you make progress you will more often than not be in muscle repair/rebuild mode, which can make singing very difficult.  If you have been working out for longer than say, 5-6 months, I would suggest doing vocal exercises to engage the core muscles in a healthy way in singing. These can include:  -Long sustain exercises  -Repeated pitch exercises, adding an ""h"" before each note. For example, singing ""ha"" or ""hee"" 9 times (for some reason 3, 5, and 9, are the most natural numbers, at least for me) on one pitch, then repeating this, up and down the scale half step by half step. You want to add the ""h"" to engage the core muscles, you should feel a slight inward squeeze of the core muscles with each ""h"" sound. This is very similar to a laugh.  -Combo of repeated pitch/sustain. For example ""ha ha ha ha haaaaa,"" sustaining the last ""ha"" for 5 counts. Move up and down the scale doing these by half steps. Alternate these with different vowels.  Note: These exercises, even if your trunk is strong, are very, very taxing on the larynx. You might tire quickly, but these exercises are essentially like heavy lifting for the larynx. I have been doing them for years and they make me tired if I do them for more than 15 minutes straight! Sometimes I even start to sweat. If you find them easy (for which you should be proud!), add more pitches to the repeated pitch exercises or make the count of the sustain longer in the sustain exercises.  I truly hope this helps!"

singing,3apjh9,enjarcher,2,Mon Jun 22 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"To make it easier to sing you can use vowel modification, and try to stick to similar vowels so you don't have to change much. This is probably the reason why it's hard to understand what some singers are saying if you don't know the lyrics, but you don't have to do it to that extreme. When I'm having trouble singing passaggio area parts I start by singing it slowly in a single vowel to make sure my coordination is right, then I begin changing the vowels to form the words, and gradually speed it up."

singing,3amqh7,TotoCotogni,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"Great article! Thanks for sharing. I completely agree. I'm a classical singer the article describes - I have no interest or knowledge in other styles and basically I can sing in two modes - classical solo singing, and classical choral (which are actually different, albeit more subtly than with a totally non-classical genre). That and old musical theatre, but I still generally sound like a classical singer when I do it.   But, I never claim to be anything else. I agree that in the broad sense of the word, classical training in its fullest should give you enough control of your voice to execute any style, but I think there is a ton of elitism out there saying that anyone who has sung any art song every should automatically be a great jazz crooner, which is patently absurd.   At the same time, I simply have not witnessed any other style, on a broad scale, attempting to codify and develop a system of singing as much as classical singers have, and as a result there is much less standardization of quality and expectations in other styles. (Noting, of course, that classical is not at all standardized, as the article mentions). I think the work done by classical singers throughout the ages deserves to be taken seriously, but that can and should happen in a way that leaves room for other styles."
singing,3amqh7,Cornish_Easy_Living,2,Mon Jun 22 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a jazz singer but always use standard classical warm ups, then ease into jazzy ones.

More and more, I feel ""classical"" singing is just plain good singing, and you can use it for any style you want."

But in an ideal world, physiology needs to be addressed at some point. Myself having the modal texture of a baritone and the upper range of a tenor, I've never found a single teacher that could address my entire voice. I relied solely on chest voice for about 5 years because no one knew how to fix it. but I learned all the components through having ""multiple"" teachers anyway, some classical and some pop. If I knew what I do now, I could have easily condensed my entire training into about a single year."

While they don't specifically list treatments (as reliable sources won't, because they want to treat them on a case by case basis), there is something related to this conversation in the Truths/Myths section:   Myth: I can just stay silent for one month and the nodules will go away for good.  Truth: While total voice rest will make nodules disappear, as soon as the voice is used again, with the same technique that caused them to form in the first place, they will recur.   There are also complications of nodules that may be giving you the shenanigans you're having right now depending on how long you've had nodules, or even if you have nodules. Keep in mind, that while you may be really certain, after you get a scope, something else could pop up. There are other types of vocal masses like polyps and cysts that could be giving you similar symptoms.  Should your final diagnosis be nodules, there's something wrong with your technique (and it could even be your speaking voice, not just singing) that is harsher on your folds than is good, so you may be continuing to harm your folds doing any amount of singing/speaking as you haven't unlearned your vocal habits that got you nodes in the first place.  It's also possible, that your body is doing the ""it's going to get worse before it gets better"" kind of healing. Be sure to keep plenty hydrated, as water is incredibly necessary for the healing process.  Honestly? Even if you can't get in to see an ENT for a while, I would call or email the office to see if they have any suggestions as to what you should be doing until your appointment, especially since I'm not a doctor, and I'm just guessing at what could be happening."

It can be hard to hear yourself accurately especially in falsetto but recording should help you get a more accurate idea of what you sound like, and then you can adjust based on the feelings once you have a baseline.  Also, don't forget that falsetto still needs to be supported!

Lots of people will start claiming they have super high or super low ranges, but that's because they're singing in a different octave than what they're playing on their guitar/piano/what-have-you.   Knowing your octave, knowing your key, and being able to fiddle with those things really do make all the difference. Make the song fit you, not the other way around."

singing,3aj0m5,Dekutard,12,Sat Jun 20 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"If it weren't within their range, they wouldn't be able to sing anything in the first place. OP is talking about singing within his tessitura - which is a different thing altogether.  A range can be from 1-5 octaves, but a tessitura usually spans about a fifth. Untrained singers also have no idea where that fifth lies in their beginning 1-3 octaves, so a lot of time is spent trying to figure that out - especially in today's ""teach yourself"" culture.  Your tessitura also shifts as you age and as you gain more control over your voice, so it takes constant re-discovery, especially in the beginning stages.  So yeah, you'd think it'd be common sense. Most of the things you learn along the way for singing wind up being rather simple concepts and common sense-esque, but there's a difference between knowing and understanding. The understanding part takes some trial and error."

So many people set themselves up for failure by singing a song in the wrong key or just a song that doesn't work with their voice. I'm all for pushing yourself (within reason) but I would really rather hear someone sing well in a comfortable range than struggling to hit notes and fatiguing their voice in the wrong key. Nobody will think less of you as a singer for changing to a key that works for your voice.

Not everybody's voice is the same, and you shouldn't be embarrassed if you have to move a song up or down to make it fit with your voice.  I think the hardest thing for most people in the sub is finding (or if they can't find it, making) transposed instrumentals for them to sing along to. It's really intimidating, especially if you don't play an instrument or have a decent grasp on music theory."

It ll start in your chest, then work your way to your head. When you start to hit the highest part of your register, you'll notice a ""gap"" where your voice cracks. That and above is falsetto"
singing,3ajgeh,EasyEwok,2,Sat Jun 20 21:03:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!  Right now from doing that it seems I either pass over the gap, or my falsetto range is tiny since after I reach the gap, I can barely reach anything above that (aside from a tiny squeak half a note higher)  Am I doing something wrong? I'm assuming the break is the point where your voice stops and you're just exhaling air while straining. Also, where's the best place to feel the vibrations when the note is in your head?"
singing,3ajgeh,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it's normal for a novice's voice to crack at [what I think is] the second passagio (~F#4).  If it cracks then everything above that is going to be falsetto.  But, it's completely possible to maintain full voice above that point.  Now, for my own purposes, I would probably call everything above F4, if I maintain full voice, ""head voice"" and everything below it ""mixed voice"" and ""chest voice.""  All of them together make up ""full voice.""  The only things that aren't ""full voice"" are falsetto and fry.  For me, there is no reason to distinguish between mixed and chest.  That could change in the future.  I feel ""mixed voice"" in my head.  I feel what I'm calling ""head voice"" behind my front teeth.  There are two ways that I have found to sing in head voice while staying relaxed.  One is opening my mouth really wide, using lots of air, and singing into the behind the front teeth area.  This produces a really thin, bright, weak sound.  I suspect that this is how most people without training sing in head voice sing, except they belt into the area, which produces a more powerful, albeit just as bright and thin sound.  The other way I can sing above the F# in full voice is by covering, which is harder to explain:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6dDQiBGyI  Because there's no agreement on the meaning of the terms, you have to make them work for you.  I think discovering the parts of your voice should precede the terms.  Find something in here that vibes with your experience:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaggio  These are all just my observations from my own singing.  I might be completely wrong, or simply wrong for you (OP).  And, if your technique isn't sound, just worry about singing in your comfortable range."
singing,3ajgeh,LordNode,2,Sat Jun 20 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"Passaggio:       Passaggio is a term used in classical singing to describe the transition area between the vocal registers. The passaggi (plural) of the voice lie between the different vocal registers, such as the chest voice, where any singer can produce a powerful sound, the middle voice, and the head voice, where a powerful and resonant sound is accessible, but usually only through vocal training. The historic Italian school of singing describes a primo passaggio and a secondo passaggio connected through a zona di passaggio in the male voice and the a primo passaggio and secondo passaggio in the female voice. A major goal of classical voice training in classical styles is to maintain an even timbre throughout the passaggio. Through proper training, it is possible to produce a resonant and powerful sound.

singing,3ajgeh,Dejimon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"Is the transition between vocal registers always clearly audiable? I can only hear one clear transition and that's at the very top of my range, after that I know everything is falsetto, but it's hard to differentiate in the middle of a song.   That being said, I'm having trouble finding a point where my voice breaks altogether. Just doing a slide from my lowest note to highest I can't feel a single point where my voice feels like it's shifting gear or changing pitch. What's happening is I'm sliding up and reaching c#5 (i guess recent vocal exercises are working because it used to be a4) before my voice cuts off altogether (can't reach anything above that at all). So my question is does the highest point of your vocal range always have to be falsetto, because if it is I'm transitioning into falsetto somewhere during my slide and I can't find where. Or does head voice reach the same height as falsetto? For reference, I can reach the same volume at c#5 as I can at lower volumes, hurts like hell though so I'm not going to do that anymore.  Also, is there any clear way I can easily distinguish between my chest and head voice (audial cues or internal feeling) and after that, any clear way to make sure you don't stray into falsetto while singing?"

I'm mostly looking to improve my range and power, i have trouble keeping up through longer lines and higher notes.

singing,3achp1,temporarysteve,2,Fri Jun 19 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"I think you have a lot of potential, and your musicality and tone are very nice. The guitar is a bit rough though, and needs practice. The longer notes seem to become tense and tail off, as if your breathing is too shallow, or you haven't learned how to breathe from your diaphragm."
singing,3achp1,singaway123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I know that I suck at the guitar haha, it's not something I practice regularly.   Just a couple questions!   1) What do you mean by musicality?   2) You mention breathing from the diaphragm; what exactly does that mean? What should I be doing to improve on that? Are there exercises I can do, or should I be trying to focus on a certain thing while I sing?   Thanks in advance!"
singing,3achp1,temporarysteve,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Musicality is a very vague term meaning you have some magic in your soul, including phrasing, expression, timing, how you move and feel, etc. No one has asked me to explain it before :) It is the best thing to have, and all the stars have it. A lot of amateur musicians only have a limited amount of it, and that is why they don't improve beyond a given level.  Diaphragm breathing will give your voice control and power. It means that when you breathe in, instead of widening the top of your your chest and lifting your shoulders, you use your solar plexus (mostly) and belly (slightly). When you breathe out, you use a combination of those groups to control how the air comes out. Take a look - https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=diaphragm+breathing"

singing,3achp1,temporarysteve,2,Fri Jun 19 04:23:07 2015 UTC,"Here are my impressions, since no one else has replied. I am not a vocal teacher or expert, and you clearly have some problem with enunciation which you are trying to overcome. But you're not there yet. But if you could overcome that, your singing would improve hugely, because (A) your notes are more or less in tune, and you have the feel of the song very nicely. (B) To a normal ear, your enunication is a major problem, and sounds sloppy, eg. the ""s"" comes out as z, t's are missing, and some of the vowels sound like yawning. (C) I think you need to embark on a long training regime to make everything clearer - consonants and vowels alike. Listen very closely to how Leon sounds on every word, and try to copy him. (D) Your natural voice is whatever way you speak or sing which other people like to listen to."

singing,3achp1,laughinwhale,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but from what I have been taught so far, try to connect your words, notes? The moment you let off of a vowel, and close off on a word you have to physically reset your vocal posture, so keeping it as close as possible between breaths can help create a good soundscape and add more depth. This makes it sound less like you are speaking words in different tones/notes. I probably have a lot of the terminology wrong but I hope you get what I am trying to put across haha."

singing,3achp1,laughinwhale,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sounds like you can belt pretty well, so if you played around with volume and phrasing a little bit you could make it your own whilst at the same time giving the projection needed. The way Demi does this at some points is by using her inhale at the same volume as the next phrase/word she is going to use. How wide is your mouth when you start building into medium-louder sections? Opening your mouth really wide will really help push the sound forward and cause less wispy breath noises to sneak in."
singing,3achp1,insert_deep_username,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:51:04 2015 UTC,Ah I see that makes sense! I should open my mouth more (another thing I'm working on).

singing,3achp1,temporarysteve,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"That's better ;) I think your singing is basically pretty good - influenced by Jimi Hendrix? The guitar sadly is way out of tune, which occasionally pulls your voice out of tune and makes the whole thing sound messy. My suggestion is - team up with a decent guitarist, or put in lots of practice. Then see how it sounds - I expect your voice will improve naturally with a better accompaniment.  One thing - you still need more voice volume and much less guitar volume."

Indeed hendrix influenced ;) someone told me my voice is in a lower register when I used to always since John lennon stuff pretty high and now I can sort of do both with a lot of confusion when it comes to picking an octave.

singing,3achp1,temporarysteve,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"To find out your range, 1. find your lowest note and then find it on the guitar (after tuning it!), then go up the scales as high as you can to find the highest.

Try singing alone, or to a karaoke track with the vocals removed. Or, when you sing along to something like the above, consciously listen to how close your voice is to the recording. You could also learn scales, arpeggios, etc and sing them with long slow notes, eg. 5 or 10 seconds each. Or, whatever inspires you most.  I don't know the mechanics of screaming, but it just sounds to me, that it needs more body, as if you were doing it much more loudly with more resonance."

I aim to have about three hours minimum between waking up and full singing (i.e. not a warm-up).   For me, the priorities are hydration and airflow. In order to be properly hydrated for morning singing, you need to begin your hydration process from (around about) the evening before, so ramp up the water intake then. From there, the warm-up process is really focused on getting the airflow in place, so I make heavy use of tongue/lip trills.

singing,3a879m,theskandal,20,Thu Jun 18 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Levels of technique, practice, passion, and attention to detail.  Lots of singers don't care what vowel they sing on in their tessitura, or how it would modify up or down. Or how hard they should aspirate a ""t,"" or how picky they should be about each dynamic level they sing at. A great singer does. They pay attention to all of those seemingly nit-picky details, and they nail them.  For a lot of those details, you need to be able to maneuver your voice in very specific ways in order to get it to be juuuust perfect, which means having your technique to a point where you can get your voice to do anything you want. And that is hard, and takes  a lot of training and oftentimes, a lot of voice lessons. To have as much control over your voice and breathing mechanism as a gymnast does their body is an incredible endeavor.  It's more than having a raw instrument - though that certainly helps.   Also, you could be a technically amazing singer/instrumentalist, but lack any sense of soul or emotion. You have got to be okay with wearing your heart on your sleeve to be an incredible talent, otherwise it sounds robotic and sterile. This is the part of the equation that's harder to quantify, as it depends person to person, as every singer has a different personality and soul to bring to the stage. You've gotta find what works and is honest for you."
singing,3a879m,ghoti023,11,Thu Jun 18 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"As a musician who sings but usually plays behind vocalists, the hardest and most honest critics will be the band behind you. the big differential we see among good singers (as in people who get hired TO SING, not just students learning or amateurs practicing) is ""are they a Karaoke dude/chick or a Session Singer?"". The karaoke person has their song(s) down, and has everything blocked out and mapped out- but they can't change what they're doing from what they practiced. The pros are the ones who don't just learn songs, but know how to use their scales, different voices, effects, and techniques to change styles, keys or tempos and still sell the song. both of these singers could sound just as good on one song, but the second can sound amazing with any band, several genres, and knows how to use every corner of their vocal palette to the best effect."
singing,3a879m,KillKennyG,6,Thu Jun 18 03:32:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you value in a singer.  It seems natural to value technical ability and then use that as a measure of greatness.  But, that doesn't have to be the case.  For instance, ghoti023 says ""They pay attention to all of those seemingly nit-picky details, and they nail them.""  That might be the mark of a great singer using a certain value system or set of criteria, and I don't disagree with that value system, but I do think there are other legitimate ways of evaluating a singer which might lead to considering a singer great who doesn't pay attention to little details like the ones mentioned.  I think Pavarotti is a great singer (he is) but I also think Morrissey is a great singer even though he pales in comparison to Pavarotti's technique, control, and on and on."
singing,3a879m,loolem,4,Thu Jun 18 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"I have thought about that question my entire life.   An ok singer is someone who sounds like the original artist but they might struggle with some notes here or there and to anyone with any training or even a passing interest in music they can here the little things that tell you this person is ""fine"" or ""ok"". They might be a bit wishy washy of the trills. A bit shouty in the loud parts but not simon cowell blasting bad. They are just ok and as soon as they finish you forget them. Thats all you feel nothing really  A good singer nails some of those things. They have practiced that trill and they know that song well.  But the high part is a bit wobbly and you can tell thats the part they worry about every time and it shows a bit to be honest. They might even hit one part where you almost feel something...almost  A great singer knows their stuff. They know their scales they know their repertoire they know the groove of the song and they know most of the singers in the genre they are singing and they borrow from them at the right times. They know how to hit those high notes and, this part is important, they know that its not about the high notes. Its about all the notes and more than that its about the story of the song. They are great and they move you quiet a bit and then...  There are the outstanding singers. You know these one because they STAND OUT. They are your favorite singers. The first time you ever heard them they at once sounded familiar and completely new they moved you either one or two lines into the song. They seem to break the rules sometimes of what you've learned and know to be true but they are almost always right. Alot of the time one of things that attracts you across genres to the outstanding singers is their TONE. I mean no one sings a note like them. They have internalised all the tricks and techniques of their genres and they just sing. They are in  the music and the moment and somehow by doing that seem to transcend it. You can hear a recording of their work from 20 to even a hundred years ago and you just feel their emotions, you feel their pain, their love, you feel... them. You know them as intimately as anyone has ever known anyone else and thats what makes them stand out.They are masters of every fundamental of their genre and now they just express themselves. They are why we want to sing.  peace and love my friend. I hope this helps"

singing,3a879m,Akoustyk,4,Thu Jun 18 04:30:25 2015 UTC,"I couldn't really say it better than /u/ghoti023 did, but to put it another way, for me a great singer is a singer that has complete control over what they do. Nothing on stage is an accident, whether it's exactly the right choice of diction, the quality of the sound, or the way they portray character and emotion. A reliable singer is a good singer. After all, nobody wants to hire someone who may be awesome or terrible at any given moment, but can't control when that happens. I think that really applies to any style, too. No matter what style you sing, it's really important to understand your style and your voice, and how to make your voice do the things each style calls for."
singing,3a8sqz,Pokebow,3,Thu Jun 18 03:20:13 2015 UTC,"As far as pitch is concerned, have you tried this method? It sounds like you need to better develop your aural skills, and I really think doing this sort of pitch matching activity can help. I would also recommend staying away from apps and relying instead on your own ears (you can record and listen back to help you). By using an app, you're less likely to audiate (mentally imaging the pitch before you sing it), which is a super important skill for singing. Also, songs are often not a great way to learn pitch because they are fairly complex in terms of pitch material. It's kind of like trying to do a triple back handspring before nailing a cartwheel. Keep it simple and gradually build up as you get more skillful. :)    As far as the larynx - this is definitely one of the big ""million dollar questions"" in singing. It's connected to so many muscles and there are so many factors that there really isn't a simple answer for how to deal with it.   That said, here are a couple thoughts that may help.   Typically, a lower larynx and a higher soft palate go together. I'm actually not totally sure why, but I know that in general when I focus on raising my soft palate, it helps to relax the muscles around the larynx too (maybe someone with a better understanding of vocal anatomy can chime in about the physiology here). So that's one place to start. At any rate, it can help to think of the entire mouth/pharynx space as a big vault or cathedral to allow the sound to come out. This can help you visualize the idea of a relaxed larynx without stressing out about trying to control it (which usually leads to more tension anyway).   Breath support is also a huge factor. In general, if you don't have enough breath support your body will kick in with lots of other muscles in order to control the air. Many of these muscles are the same neck and jaw muscles that connect to your larynx, leading to lots of tension there. Be sure never to ""squeeze"" notes or push them with your throat, but instead support the breath from the lower breath mechanism and let them come out naturally. It should not feel like a lot of effort from the chest up - and even in the lower abdominal area, it's more like a suspension of air than clenching or pushing the air.   Registration is also highly important. If you're trying to use the wrong balance of registration, you can also cause funky issues with the larynx. It's particularly problematic to bring the chest voice up too high, but any imbalance of registration can cause your larynx to tense up as it tries to hold on to that muscular configuration when it ""wants"" to be configured differently. Again, this is a bit of a complex issue that doesn't have any simple solution.     With tone, I think this will largely be solved with the first two issues, in addition to addressing resonance. Again, not an easy concept to discuss but resonance mainly deals with the shape and configuration of the vocal tract (the tube from your larynx out your mouth), where you amplify the right overtones for a pleasant and balanced sound.   As a related concept, I also wanted to mention vowel, as vowels are kind of the main way we can think about adjusting resonance and tone color. (There are other elements but I think they are harder to hear, especially at first.) So you can also start thinking about how you use vowels and diction to control the color of your sound. This could also be an element in your attribution of ""femininity"" to sound (which, by the way, is total nonsense in reality, although it might be useful in a subjective way). Diction plays a large role in how we ascribe cultural characteristics to the voice.   That said, I wouldn't worry too much about resonance and tone color at first - if you're still struggling to match pitch, dealing with tone should not be a priority, as intonation is directly related to the way you handle overtones.     And by the way, really don't worry about your voice type (being a tenor or baritone or whatever). Not only do you have many years until your voice finishes maturing (most male voices don't settle until around the late 20s or so), but it's really not that helpful to talk about voice type as an untrained singer because voice types assume a certain amount of training and a healthy mode of production, which aren't at all guaranteed in a beginner. Plus it really doesn't make much of a difference in terms of learning the basics, which are the same for pretty much everyone.     Finally, requisite comment to please seek a teacher if you are serious about singing. These are pretty complex issues, and it is safest and most efficient to work on them with a qualified voice teacher. These things are often a matter of trial and error, and it's really a good idea to have some regular guidance and an experienced set of ears to keep tabs on your voice and make sure you're not doing anything dangerous."

Half the battle is just mapping the sensations and stuff going on so you can have more control over what your voice does. Good luck! :)"
singing,3a8sqz,mezzolini,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:59:42 2015 UTC,"In addition to /u/keakealani :   Sounding more 'feminine': Unless you have fully developed classical resonance, you will always sound brighter and higher-pitched on a recording than you will in your head. The sound has to travel through bone and tissue to reach your own ears, but a recording and other people get the sound more directly. As my operatic technique improves, I've noticed that I sound brighter in my head than on the recording. It's physically impossible for anyone to hear their voice in their head the way it sounds out in the room. Tongue: You didn't mention it, but the tongue has a huge influence on your larynx and tone. You might be pulling your tongue back, pushing the larynx down on your low notes. If your tongue is too tense on high notes, it'll keep the larynx from making the necessary changes to produce a free high note. If your tongue is tense from side to side, it can make your tone very harsh (speaking from experience here).  Your tongue needs to be forward--at least at the back of your bottom teeth--and wide. Everyone's tongue is different, so you want to find where it wants to go when it's fully relaxed. I call it ""pillow tongue"" or ""jello tongue"".  Jaw: Dropping your jaw helps keep your larynx low without strain. Your larynx will definitely rise on high notes if your jaw is too closed on high notes. The higher the note, the more the jaw must drop. This could also be why your larynx goes uncomfortably low on your low notes--other muscles are trying to compensate, and they overdo it.   Practicing with a mirror is the best way to fix tongue and jaw issues. Your voice will feel & sound very different in your head when you make these kinds of changes, so you'll need to use visual feedback. Recording can give you accurate feedback, but it's most helpful to have a teacher who can see and hear you in real-time.  Good luck!"

singing,3a9473,supersoccerboy29,2,Thu Jun 18 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"Hi! I can actually comment from two sides - one as a perennial honor choir singer in high school, and also as someone with some second-hand experience with UT/Butler (my husband went there for grad school).   So first of all, congrats! I think you're right that the Texas all-states are considered some of the more prestigious - I'm not from Texas originally so I can't exactly compare them, but they do have a pretty exceptional choral community, so it's definitely an achievement.   In general, though, I think the value of honor choirs is what you learn more than how many lines it enters in your résumé. A big part of it is that most all-state honor choirs are directed by fairly big-name conductors, and you'll usually get a chance to sing rep you don't get to sing with your regular high school choir. That knowledge and experience should help you in terms of college choirs and that sort of thing.   At the same time, ultimately, what gets you into conservatories/SoMs is mostly your audition (and shit like SATs, but even that barely counts). So obviously you've auditioned well once and that's a great start (comfort with auditioning matters!) but in the end, if you give a good audition, you'll get into a good school, and if not... you won't. I really don't think colleges look that much at you credentials, particularly for choral stuff, since you'd be applying as a solo singer in undergrad. (If you're interested in choral conducting that's a bit different but you should still probably do an undergrad in vocal performance.)   I think especially for UT, audition will be key. From everything I've seen there talent is hugely important. (I should note, however, that I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a good undergraduate school. The graduate voice program is so big I think you would probably miss out on a lot of opportunities that you could get in a smaller school. But that's just a side note.)    That all being said... what matters when considering college and career is really whether or not you want to do it. Seriously. A music career isn't easy, and honestly in my experience most of what makes you as a singer is your tenacity and ability to put up with music for so many hours of a day. If the thought of spending 6 hours a day in music classes, another four hours a day in the practice room, and then a weekend singing gig excites you, then do it. If that makes you want to vomit, then don't. It's that simple (well, plus practical shit like whether or not you potentially want to be a starving artist/bum).   This is where honor choirs are a good experience - if you can tolerate intense rehearsals (in my state, the honor choir camp was like 6-8 hours of rehearsal a day for four days straight and then two concerts), that's a good sign for your future career, particularly if you want to go choral or opera. If you enjoy getting into really detailed nitty-gritty music stuff, that's a good sign. If you are ready to geek out with other music nerds (face it, the only people who sign up for honor choirs are music nerds), that's a good sign.   In the end, though, you're going to take your high school credentials off your résumé by the time you graduate from college, so it's not like you should do it just for the credentials. But the experience will last much longer than that.  P.S., as you can probably tell, I love talking shop about music careers and college. So feel free to ask more questions or PM me if you have any other concerns."

singing,3a9473,notestasiskis,2,Thu Jun 18 11:39:43 2015 UTC,"I was second alternate with Texas All-state my senior year of high school. It's only made a difference once in college. I missed the auditions for choir my freshman year and when I spoke with the concert choir director, he took that into consideration. I think it, plus my sight reading ability, was the only reason I got into the higher level choir. Granted, I went to UNT, so UT may be different. That's just my experience."
singing,3a9473,SirButthat,2,Thu Jun 18 06:05:11 2015 UTC,"Native Texan, here. Being an all-stater is cool in high school, but ends up being less important in the grand scheme of things. Yes, if you want to major in music you'll likely end up around plenty of other former all-staters, but college is more about your ability to take in new ideas and put the pieces together into something useful.  If you want to get into teaching or even pro choir singing this experience is good to have, mostly because you have an idea of what it takes to get there. If not, then it's really just a patch on your letterman and a fond high school memory.  Not to scare you away, but I will say that about 2/3 of my freshman theory class didn't make it to the end of their first semester. You really have to wantneedTM to make music to survive in our field."
singing,3a9473,keakealani,2,Fri Jun 19 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My first semester theory teacher literally took a picture of our class on the first day ""to see who actually survives"". He was mostly joking around and using it to learn our names, but the sad fact is, there is a pretty big leap between ""liking music in high school"" and putting in the work and dedication for a college major.   That said, I also believe that the first step to deciding you want to do music is to have people try to scare you away, and still doing it anyway. Frankly, if being told that first year theory is hard would make you want to drop out, I don't think majoring in music is the right choice. On the other hand, if OP looks at comments like this and says ""yeah, I'll definitely stick it out through college theory even if it's hard"", then that's the kind of person who has a good shot at college/professional music imo."

I'd say that if you made the all-state choir, you're definitely not bad at singing. Whether or not it's a good start for a musical career I can't tell you for sure, but all-state and all-eastern were 2 of the most educational and most fun experiences i've ever had. I'm sure you'll enjoy it and get a lot out of it as well. The conductors they invite for these are always incredible, and you'll meet a lot of talented people who are just as passionate about music as you.

singing,3a8p6s,Ge4rShift,5,Thu Jun 18 02:48:06 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all it's important to distinguish between actual tone deafness, and just poor aural skills. Real tone deafness is really rare and occurs when someone lacks the ability to differentiate pitch, usually due to neurological issues. It doesn't sound like this is the case, if you can differentiate pitch on an instrument. It's possible that you also have a physical problem preventing you from connecting pitch in your brain to your voice, but again, that's pretty rare.   The other option is just that you have underdeveloped aural skills and/or underdeveloped singing skills. It's important to note that in this case, singing has two parts, an aural part and a technical part. You both have to be able to audiate the pitch (imagine the pitch mentally before singing it) and physically configure your vocal folds to vibrate at the right pitch. For some people, that second half is pretty difficult, so that might be where you're stuck.   All that said, I think this article would be useful for you. I would definitely recommend recording yourself to check if you were singing in tune with whatever reference instrument you use. It sounds like you probably have good enough ears to hear if you are singing out of tune, but you need to figure out a way to associate that with the feeling of singing each note on the spot.   Also, honestly, who cares about your friends. I'm guessing they're probably not professional singers (since I would wager most professional singers can offer way better advice than just telling you you're tone deaf). Trust your own ear, and screw what other people think."
singing,3a8p6s,keakealani,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, judging from that I'm not actually tone deaf, pretty sure I used the term wrong so sorry about that.  I asked my friends to elaborate and they just say I can't hold the note itself and go off-pitch after singing it, the exercise on the link you provided proves I have some difficulty hitting the note directly and I have to adjust, so I'm going to work on that. I guess when I actually sing I just skip over it and dont hear myself hitting the wrong note initially.  I'll keep practicing with scales and intervals, My voice range reaches the fifth fret of the high e string on guitar, which I think is a4 if I'm not mistaken, so I'll work to see if I can improve that. If you can suggest any other exercises to make sure I can hit a note properly I'd be really grateful.  (also you're right, my friends sing out of tune all the time, I just sing a lot more because I enjoy it and I guess that gets annoying if I cant do it in tune, so I better practice.)"

singing,3a8p6s,Mattpilf,3,Fri Jun 19 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"You just need to practice connecting the part of your brain that hears different notes with the part of your brain that controls your voice.  Sing 5 note scales and arpeggios up and down your range along with a keyboard or piano or your guitar.  Take it slow and try to match every tone exactly.  Or, play a tone, try to match it while it's not ringing, then play it and check if you're on-pitch, adjust if you aren't.  There's plenty of stuff you can try.  Practice singing intervals.  You'll get better and better."

singing,3a8ajh,Girlprep,2,Thu Jun 18 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between vocalization and the actual applied music. The goal is to get your vocalizations to match the music.  You're not alone in finding that your warm-up exercises often lead you higher and lower in range than the songs you can actually sing. Your approach for the song is different from your warm up. Try to recall how you were successful in your warm up, and replicate that sensation exactly in the song. Is the high note in the song on a different vowel than the one you used in your warm up? Try replacing the one in the song to the one you used in the warm up temporarily, and try to shift that one into the actual vowel for the song.  How do you approach the note in your warmups? Is it a stepwise motion or is it a leap? Leaps are harder than stepwise motion, and chances are, in your warm up, you're singing scales (which is stepwise).  Vowels are also easier to sing than consonants. It's possible that the consonants in the song are stopping your breath flow, making your support weaken when you need it the most. Try practicing the song on just the vowels, deleting the consonants and see if that helps any.  Keep in mind that 1. 23 is still an unstable time for the male voice, as you've got at least 5 more years of puberty affecting your voice, and 2. 3 months of voice lessons really isn't that long of a period of time. Try replicating what you just did in front of your teacher and see if they have anything to say about it. Show them how you can do the exercise, but crack in the song."

In addition, many apps are tuned to equal temperament, which creates problems when you're in a differently tempered setting (which, for singers, is most of the time). Tuner apps also tend not to be very sensitive to vibrato, which is a byproduct of healthy singing. As a result, they often encourage you to sing with a constricted straight tone, which is really unhealthy.   Instead, I would recommend using a method like this which focuses on actually building your own ear and doesn't rely on technology that is inconsistent with the human voice. Notice that many of the folks in this thread recommend instrument-oriented resources - instruments don't create the same sounds as humans and resources designed for instruments do not necessarily work for singing."

(Granted guitar is transposed at the octave so it shouldn't be an issue, but all standard saxophones are either Eb or Bb transpositions). So if you're playing the same written note, it should sound different.   Even so, you should learn how to train your ears. It's totally impractical to rely on a tuner for the rest of your life.

singing,3a4dk2,iamMori,2,Wed Jun 17 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"True ""nasality"" means one thing and one thing only: some air is coming out your nose. Nasality is a separate discussion from whether you feel your nose bridge, forehead, or nearby areas (what people often call the ""mask"") vibrating as you sing.  To check for nasality, you can gently touch the sides of each nostril without closing the nose. If the nostrils are vibrating, air is passing out through the nose, and the seal between your soft palate and nasal passages is incomplete."
singing,3a4dk2,mwb2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:19:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! Could you specify what you mean by singing with my throat?  If I try to sing just using the throat without head/chest voice I can do it.  As I was experimenting around I reallized that I seem to have nasal vibration mostly when I'm trying to use chest voice.  When I'm singing high in my range with head voice I barely feel any vibration and when I use falsetto there is absolutely none.   This hasn't been a problem before but I think I picked up a bad habit and I'm just not sure what's causing it.
singing,3a4dk2,mezzolini,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"During vowels, there should be no nasal vibration--BUT-- there are some consonants that require nasal resonance: M, N, and the NG sound at the end of ""sing"" and ""hung"". You can practice singing while closing your nose completely, as long as you avoid these consonants. Just don't squeeze your nose to death! If the sound is muffled while closing your nose, that's evidence that you're singing nasally. You can combine that with the yawn method to get the feeling of singing without nasal resonance.   BUT--The yawning method will not feel natural at first. We don't speak that way, and it's usually what we're used to that feels ""natural.""  It's actually a modified yawn--the feeling at the beginning of the yawn.  In a normal yawn, your tongue pulls backwards in your mouth. For the singing version, it should be touching the back of your bottom teeth, and be relaxed on the sides (no pointy tongue), relatively relaxed. I tell my students to ""half-yawn"" while they inhale, and to keep that feeling of a ""sleepy voice"" while singing."

singing,3a1ooh,enjarcher,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:35:36 2015 UTC,Poor cord closure perhaps? That can lead to a loss of projection and blended registration as well as making less efficient use of air. Try going through some lip trills to warm up your voice and get the compression going.
singing,39za20,EasyEwok,4,Tue Jun 16 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to your hygiene habits. Are you washing your hands regularly? Are you habitually touching your face? Check out your diet- high intake of carbohydrates means more food for bacteria. Try sinus irrigation to flush out whatever nastiness builds up inside yo head.  I managed to get through my senior recital in college with a sinus infection, but I kinda wish I didn't have to do that. It took a while to recover fully."

In addition to what others mentioned, I would suggest developing a relationship with a doctor (ENT specialist would be best) so you can nip any infections in the bud with antibiotics or other treatments. You may also want to see if you have other risk factors for sinus issues like a deviated septum. Be sure to tell your doctor that you are a singer (and ideally see a doctor who has experience treating singers) so they'll understand what needs to happen to make your life bearable."

When my allergies flare up, it's nearly impossible for me to feel whether or not my soft palate is raised, and everything in my throat feels different. It takes a lot more attention to technique to make sure I'm not going flat and that my resonance is the same as when I'm healthy."

I've had two separate medical problems that caused similar symptoms. It's not very likely that you have either, but still, you never know. But it might be worth talking to a doctor about if it really bothers you. Though on the other hand, it may indeed just be a case of ""I rarely use my voice, so it's getting weaker"".  One problem was caused by an enlarged adenoid causing excessive mucus buildup on my voice that I kept having to work through, without it feeling like an ""i'm sick and ugh, coughing up mucus""-type situation.  The other was when a common nasal spray completely wrecked my throat's immune system, causing a very localised infection. It was  just on the back of my uvula and the area around my vocal chords. They stuck a camera down my throat and it was like ""normal, normal, HOLY CRAP WHAT IS THAT?"" Treatment was really simple though."
singing,39v8f5,keakealani,2,Mon Jun 15 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"I really think you should see a speech therapist. This sounds more like a speech habit issue than a singing one, and it might even be an indication of physical vocal damage (rapid vocal fatigue is one symptom of nodes, although obviously there's no way to diagnose you without a doctor). It would be a good idea to at least check out your voice for any medical problems or speech disorders - the more you let those things go, the more severe they can become.   That being said, I wonder if it's also maybe a result of puberty? The voice doesn't finish developing until around the mid-late 20s for most people, so it's very possible that your voice is changing and leading to problems. By itself, the voice change shouldn't lead to a lot of vocal fatigue, but it could exacerbate problems in your technique."

It could be a bunch of things. For dudes your age it's pretty common to try and speak in a lower pitch than is good for you or more gravelly or whatever to sound badass, so they push on their voice which is both a very inefficient way of sound production and also tiring and damaging.  Other possiblities: allergies could cause swelling of the vocal cords.  Also tension, are you stressed or generally tense in your body? That can really hinder your voice. I notice that on vacation, my voice speaks much more easily than other times. Both because I sit less behind a computer with shitty posture and because of stress, I think.  So yes, it's either poor vocal habits (solution: see a speech therapist), a medical problem or something like stress, I would say."
singing,39vdp5,nanananana-batman,5,Mon Jun 15 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"""Making it"" is more of a frame of mind than it is actual base talent.  Shitty singers become famous or one hit wonders every year, especially now that autotune is a thing.   If you're trying to become top 40's singer famous, you'll need to be ready to hear a lot of ""no,"" and then continue fighting against the grain until someone gives you a shot.   Go ahead and audition for American Idol. Why not? Don't expect to make it past the first round of producers - and that's not because you're un-talented. It's because they want to make a show that makes good television, and they don't really give a rats ass as to whether or not you'll become a famous singer after the show. What's the last American Idol winner that's actually maintained a spotlight career that you can name off the top of your head? Clay Aiken? Ruben? They're not still famous. Kelly Clarkson is the only one that's still in the news every so often. The producers will choose you if you have a nice enough voice and look like you have a good story behind you. (Being conventionally attractive is also a pretty big plus.) So absolutely audition. There's no harm in it - just take whatever answer they give you with a grain of salt. The whole show is scripted too, btw. There's a reason this is the last season.  You need to define what success means to you, and how ""big"" you actually need to make it in order to feel accomplished. There are many talented, accomplished singers and musicians that never hit full stardom, but live comfortable and happy lives. Many of them do not do music full time.

singing,39u2qh,QuixoticFiction,8,Sun Jun 14 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"I have good news and bad news - puberty isn't done with you yet.  The male voice continues developing through the late twenties. You may gain more high notes, you may gain more low notes, you may gain more of both. Your tessitura (what range of about a 5th that is the most comfortable for you to sing) will shift in all kinds of crazy ways.   I honestly wouldn't focus on what your range can and cannot do for now. It won't be the same month to month, let alone year to year. I've known tenors that become basses, and basses that become tenors, and at some point - everyone's a baritone.  Have your friends voices changed too? Is it possible to lower the keys you play your collaborations in? Is it possible to rewrite the old songs? Or better yet, write new ones to fit what you can do now?  Up until a point, your range will naturally expand if you solidify your technique in your middle range. From there, there are other things you can do to help continue stretching the highs (falsetto being a key player for a lot of people, but not necessarily falsetto), but all of that work will be essentially useless if you don't have a solid foundation to start from. I strongly suggest working on breath, tone, resonance, the whole shebang (we've got a pretty decent FAQ here on r/singing) before trying to modify your range. You'll find that over time, your range will expand all by itself.  17 is really young for a singer - men and women alike. Instrumentalists have the jump on us because they're working with essentially the same mechanics of their instrument from young age, but ours doesn't begin to show it's true face until our 20's. Patience is the name of the game - and it's frustrating as hell."
singing,39u2qh,ghoti023,8,Sun Jun 14 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"I've recently expanded my range from Bass/Baritone to Bari/Tenor by learning to belt (mixed head/chest voice).  I wish I'd known what I know now 10 years ago (I'm 34 years old). This is what I've learned:   Many high male singers are baritones who belt, rather than natural tenors. Your small natural range is not the range you have to end up with. Designations such as Tenor Baritone, Bass are less voice types and more roles for the choir or opera or other written music. It's perfectly reasonable to expect a well trained singer to have 3 good usable octaves. It is a reasonable expectation that you will have to practice a lot to 'break through' to your new range. It took me a month of singing 2-3 hours every day and making a lot of horrible noises to find my latent high range. I've gained about 4-5 notes from that which are now dependable and I've discovered about 4-5 more above that I can get at the end of a long practice which I hope to be able to add to my ordinary range.   This has now taken me from only being able to sing some male songs in the recorded key, to being able to sing almost anything I want in a male range, and a fair amount of stuff in a female range too. It's enormously encouraging.   I used a mixture of free Youtube videos, reading, listening, experimentation and a couple of lessons from a well trusted teacher.  If you want to start on something, learn to sing relaxed and in tune in head voice, as this will be the foundation for you to blend in your chest voice, which is what give the powerful note.

singing,39u2qh,rickscarf,2,Mon Jun 15 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"There's nothing mystical. As a male vocalist, you can expect to develop a usable range of about 2-2.5 octaves of your ""normal"" voice, with roughly another octave (much more can happen, but it's uncommon) of falsetto singing of some kind above that (whatever you call it and whatever the style--""head voice,"" ""rock screams,"" etc.). You can also get a few vocal fry notes at the bottom.  If you can sing roughly up to D and down to D, you're quite possibly a standard baritone, and you just haven't learned to sing in what classical singers call ""head voice"" (NOT falsetto), also known as CT-dominant singing."

singing,39ugrr,oatmeal_apothecary,2,Sun Jun 14 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"$50/hr sounds like a college teacher. If you're working with a college teacher, on classical singing, yes. Absolutely you'll want to learn how to read sheet music beforehand.  TBH - if you've never taken voice lessons before, I personally don't think you need to be taking hour long ones. 30 minute weekly lessons would do you fine for a while (especially since it doesn't sound like you want to take the classical route). There are pros and cons to taking lessons with a teacher that expensive, but I would hope that if they agreed to 30 min. lessons, that they'd halve their cost. If not, there are other options. Upper classmen in the music school of the college you're going to, or grad students, usually like taking extra students for an extra flow of income, and are usually much less expensive than the profs. You could ask the head of the faculty if they had anyone they'd recommend as a student teacher.  Also, I find it a decent policy to give a free introductory lesson to first time students, to see if they actually like working with me before they start shoveling out the dough. While there'd be no way that teacher would offer you a free full hour session, see if you can meet with them for 15-20 minutes to see if you'd work well together first, so you could make a more informed decision for yourself.  I'm not saying that teacher isn't worth the money. They probably are. I'm saying that you might be buying a motorcycle when you really only need a moped."

IF you have any inkling that you might want to pursue vocal music as a career then you should invest in vocal lessons. You don't need to learn to sightread before you start, because you probably won't be doing any learning of music in the first 8 weeks.   Vocal lessons are about learning what your voice can do, getting it basically under your control, and solidifying your technique. That won't even happen in 8 weeks but you'll get a start.   Learning to read music at some point might be a good thing, but I've been performing for many years and still can't pick up a piece of music and read it thru.   Good Luck."

One is developing the ability to play guitar with others, one is getting used to playing music in front of people, and of course the singing. Your timing and sense of flow will improve dramatically. Feel free to play quietly and not be heard, it's an amazing way to learn music. Everyone there will be understanding, as all musicians started somewhere, and everyone loves seeing young blood getting in on it. :)  And it's free.  I just started singing about 6 months ago, but when it comes to playing mandolin and guitar, I don't have much trouble playing on stage. A significant chunk of my practice is spent in the presence of others. So it's not that much different than a jam where family members attend to listen. I won't sing on stage yet, but I sing often at jams and know once I am comfortable with my voice, transferring it to a stage won't be that big of a leap.  If you're in Portland, Or or Northern Virginia I can guide you to where kind musicians will help you develop what you're looking for."
singing,39tql3,TotoCotogni,8,Sun Jun 14 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yes.  There should be no clenching or tensing of the pelvic floor or abdominal muscles. The chest and shoulders should be dead, the lower ribs should remain expanded backward/outward/forward. The filling of the lungs will make you feel like a constantly expanding beach ball and will also cause the displacement the viscera (guts) below them—which is why you feel a kind of downward/outward pressure.   This is literally the most natural and most effective breathing for singing that is possible."
singing,39tql3,TotoCotogni,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Here's my question.  Normally, we (I?) don't go around clenching the pelvic floor muscles, but they are not in a state of complete relaxation, right?  The neutral ""non-feeling"" state isn't complete relaxation.  Doesn't the complete relaxation take effort by that slight feeling of pushing out like you're about to urinate.  It's a strange phenomenon because it feels like effort, like muscle activation, when really it is relaxation.  Or, am I wrong?"
singing,39tql3,TotoCotogni,2,Sun Jun 14 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"It is both: only the muscles that need to be engaged are, and that allows the relaxation of the parts that are not necessary for the correct use of the breath. Any activation of the muscles that are not directly responsible for keeping the thorax in the position and gesture of inhalation (that is, resisting the normal impulse for the air to rush out in exhalation) is extraneous and therefore fatigues the body needlessly and sets up constrictive tensions and inhibitions that ultimately affect the function of the singing apparatus and the sound itself."
singing,39tql3,schudder,3,Sun Jun 14 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"You see, this is why it seems that seriously overweight people have better voices for opera, why they seem to sing better and more easily than thinner people. It is because when one is overweight, it is simply exhausting to do many physical things that thin people take for granted. So the overweight singer—smartly, naturally, and correctly—does the least possible clenching or tensing. They allow the chest and shoulders to be dead, the ribs expanded, and the lower portion gently ballooned... because this is the easiest way to breath, the only way that feels sensible for an overweight person. The ""beach ball"" expansion feels normal and natural to them.  Then what happens when they get a gastric bypass or rapidly lose weight? Well, naturally the mind becomes interested in the new shape, the parts of the body that were perhaps hidden before. The feeling-good of being thinner takes over and wants to ""help itself"" fit into this new form by perhaps sucking in the tummy, tensing the abs, or raising the chest up—all three of which are anathema to superior-level singing. The old, natural, correct way of breathing begins to become deranged, confused. And without the proper breathing, correct onsets are impossible. Without the correct onset, the vocal apparatus is in a state of constrictive tension, breath is lost more rapidly, and the singer now has to grip at the throat to stem the loss and/or to do with considerable effort what formerly very easy. It's a domino effect that throws the entire system out of balance."
singing,39tql3,TotoCotogni,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, I don't understand the ""no tensing in the abdominal muscles"".

The beginning (""God on high, hear my prayer"") should be done in your falsetto as it is a soft part of the song. When it gets to ""He's like a son I might have known"", the music builds in intensity. Therefore, ""the summers die one by one"" should be a powerful chest voice. A diminuendo is usually heard on ""And I am old, and will be gone."" Then ""Bring him peace"" should be done in your head voice, before building into a belt on ""bring him joy."" What follows is all chest voice until the soft ending. I'm sorry if you were after a more technical explanation but as an avid Les Mis fan and singer, I figured I could help you out with the stylistic interpretation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtXgljMM0sc this version is pretty much spot on with my description.

It may shift up, it may shift down, it may shift in both directions. It all depends on your voice. I've known tenors that crack into bass-baritone, and vice versa. Your teacher has a better understanding of your voice and the likelihoods of where it'll go, so if they say it sounds like it's moving up, it's probably moving up - but there's no real way to tell how much or how steadily, and teachers have been known to estimate wrongly.

It's not that you will acquire more notes into your range, it's that you will all around be able to sing more easily and high notes will become easier as well.   I started at around a high note of E4 but can sing G#4 at the top easily now as well. I can sing higher in falsetto also. And also, my voice has expanded downward as well.

Record yourself. It'll sound bad. Real bad. For a while. It'll get better, I promise. Just keep doing it.  Once you feel like you've at least somewhat captured one singer's ""thing"", move on to another. Eventually your voice will become a unique amalgamation of your different influences, and from there it will become something all your own.  Another piece of very different advice. Look up tutorials and examples of how to sing ""properly"", like you would in a choir. This will help give you a solid foundation of tone and pitch to build off of with other styles.   It's probably smart to start with the ""correct"" singing, but I personally recommend doing them together in separate practice sessions.

At 15, your voice is going to change, and you'll have to be able to roll with the punches. Your voice will most likely not be consistent on a day to day basis, and that's not even just a male-puberty thing - that's just a human thing. Some days will be awesome, some days won't be. That's part of the challenge! Don't look upon the challenge with fear, but with determination.  Record yourself during practice sessions as much as possible. Record what it feels like to accomplish the sound you like, either by writing it out, or speaking it to yourself. Practice daily (but not too long). With muscle memory, it's about practicing frequently rather than for lengthy amounts of time. 3 fifteen minute practice sessions will do you better than one 45 minute session a day. You don't really need to practice for more than an hour a day (vocally. There's still mental practice you can do). Basically, just keep doing it, and it'll be easier to recall. It's going to be rough going at the beginning, but just keep persisting! You'll get there.  I'd also encourage you to not necessarily hold fast to the sound you made (even though you like it). Flexibility in a singer is really valuable. Being a one-trick-pony early on will solidify you into that genre, and make it harder to switch and make other sounds later that you may want to use. There's a semi-consistent amount of posts here (particularly of classically trained singers) that find it hard to be flexible with a variety of sounds when they want to try something different. Flexibility is also an important concept for you right now, because your voice will keep changing, whether or not you want it to, so holding to a steadfast iron-level technique will just create a lot of frustration in the future as your voice develops, and you find you can't do certain things anymore. You'll get hung up on what you can't do anymore, rather than what you can do now that you couldn't before. Keep exploring!"

singing,39ol28,philmoufarrege,2,Tue Jun 16 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hi, solidsnake first you need to be able to sing up there cleanly and without strain.  This means a balanced mixed voice.  If you're confused about what mixed voice means, it simply means you start in your real voice and go all the way up and it just thins out.  You should definitely feel like you can come DOWN on top of the note rather than reaching up.  Usually takes a good 30-60 minute warm up for the voice to want to go there for me.    Then your vocal cords need to be conditioned enough so that they can resist against a lot of breath pressure.  When they can do this you can successfully ""distort"" the sound and get this distorted effect by ""leaning"" into the voice WITHOUT blowing more air into the sound.  this is a process itself.  Here is an example of myself singing in a similar range/style: https://instagram.com/p/35G77nr0kI/?taken-by=phil.moufarrege  When you do it right you will not get any pain/hoarseness.  Hoarseness indicates you're trying to BLOW air to get the sound.  Big no no.  It's actually about RESISTING the air not pushing it out.  You need to be very good at generating tension in the lower belly to serve as an anchor so that the throat can maintain relaxation.    Building this stuff is done by thorough specialized training not by doing any tricks or ""just doing an exercise""."

You've gotta be able to hit the actual note with all the ornamentation and all, but you've also gotta just have a tiny touch of tension in your throat to get that edge. On some of the syllables, you'll hear a sort of ""croak"" undertone - that sounds like he's engaging his secondary (false) vocal chords to me. To learn how strengthen those, you need to practice long tones at a quiet volume at first. The end result sounds like a guttural ""roh"".  Now, the other way to get an edge like that is to smoke a lot of tobacco, drink a lot of liquor, and otherwise abuse your body in general. You'll get the desired effect after about 30 years. Don't do this. Its bad for you.  Let me give you a word of warning: DON'T push yourself too hard doing this kind of stuff. Choking up is the result of clenching, and that is the way to hurt yourself. You have to support your sound, so keep that air flowing from your gut. You can get all kinds of injuries from pushing your voice over the edge - believe me, even doing it ""right"" can damage your vocal chords.  /r/screaming is your friend.

singing,39netm,Refuser187,4,Sat Jun 13 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"For beginners, having shorter but more frequent lessons is much better, IMO. You just have to be sure they're as efficient as can be--no five minutes of ""how are you"" chit-chat at the beginning."
singing,39netm,mwb2,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"Hey man, In my humble opinion I think you should be seeking any avenue you can for singing. The thing is, you don't need to go to a tutor right away (although I would probably recommend doing an hour every two weeks with a tutor) joining a choir will be a great step. Simply because you need to continue to strengthen your voice, control your breathing etc, and like with any instrument you need to practice.   My advice is to sign up with a choir 100% - I'm from Wales in the Uk where we have a very strong cultural background in musicals and male voice choirs especially. You'll gain a good grounding of technique in this environment, working with harmonies, learning how to blend with others, following and reading sheet music.   Start there, but I would recommend you get a reputable tutor as soon as possible and see them either by weekly or even monthly (Every little helps)."

singing,39lbjn,johnpj89,3,Fri Jun 12 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"Have you recorded yourself to see how uneven it is?  For my upper range sounds very different,  but when recorded it's actually much more connected.   I can't say why you are  getting this,  even it is noticeable.  Part of it is just some more training to keep it connected and even.  Things to watch out for and are common causes are tensing up to hit High notes,  a breathy falsetto like tone creeping in,  and a larynx that rises when you sing the high notes.  There are other reasons,  but you should  be able to Check if these are problems listed are the culprit.   Lastly,  if you are an adult male with a normal voice,  then your C4  and C5 are likely C3 and C4. This confusion could have been easily  related to the guitar,  which is written a whole octave above what is sounds."
singing,39lbjn,Mattpilf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"I've recorded this, yeah. It's definitely in key, and I'm definitely not missing an octave out when I sing low and high.  Is there any way I can check these problems myself, before I take lessons? I've read a little about head voice/chest voice, and it sounds like the problem might be the breathy falsetto voice you mention. I can imagine that bad technique would impact the tone, but in terms of the pitch, I just can't fathom why my voice sounds so much higher and squeekier!   I think you're right about that last bit, I think I have a normal C3 C4 range!"
singing,39lbjn,terrycotta,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"If your vocal coach is a good one, they will recognize your weaknesses when they run you thru your scales. I wouldn't say all this to them until the end of the lesson; let them listen and diagnose first. Then they will point out where you are to start concentrating but probably not everything as once. A good foundation in breath support is generally the first goal."

Yes, I'll get one as soon as I can afford it but until then, I'm working on my voice on my own.  Here's some possibilities:   You're not singing higher or lower, your voice is just thinner because you're singing from your throat and not your diaphragm.  That's just what your voice sounds like at that note and you shouldn't expect to sound like anyone else In conjunction with the last point, I've always hated how my voice sounds (which is common) so maybe you sound fine and you just hate your voice."
singing,39lbjn,Applepie345,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I bought some online resources, but I just found it too hard to learn singing from a computer screen so I've decided to invest in a teacher. Do you mind sharing the resources you're using?  You're right that it might be that my voice is thinner -- in fact, that's probably spot on. I would've thought that was an issue of tone, though, not pitch. I could get my head around my tone sounding rubbish, either through bad technique or that just beind my voice. I'm just trying to understand why it sounds so much higher. A weak voice shouldn't sound noticeably 'higher' should it?!"
singing,39l39i,Gliste,3,Fri Jun 12 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"Getting a strong falsetto is normally a matter of using it a lot (i.e. multiple years) - your vocal folds act just like any other muscle in the sense that training them allows them to operate at a fuller volume - but don't expect that training your voice will always give you an extra octave in both directions; your voice will grow when you use it a lot and correctly, but your range isn't infinite, and the cutoffs are thanks to genetics.  Vocal range is different for everybody, and unless you're already in or past your mid-thirties, it's still changing, but the point where you feel you no longer can produce a stable sound is normally the edge of your range. If it feels viable and sounds strange on playback, work on that area, and you'll probably see an improvement. Being able to relax your voice will absolutely help with expanding your viable range - some good resources for this include Seth Riggs's ""Speech Level Singing"" and the Alexander Technique.  Best of luck!"
singing,39jd3f,dialgatrack,5,Fri Jun 12 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"No. 2 weeks is generally long enough for almost all things to go away. If you've had issues for 6 week, it is reasonable to go to an ENT who specializes in voice. However, if your only problem is you can't hit your falsetto notes, depending on how high these notes are, it's could just be bad habits post infection. As in your voice is doing it in a different way, even though you didn't notice it.   It depends on the severity of the problem.   Have you noticed any other changes that still occurs?  How sever is this problem?   Are talking about some notes in the 5th octave and stuff, or is your whole falsetto and upper range gone?  It depends on your severity. A significant change in voice after 6 weeks would certainly warrent a visit to the ENT for viewing of damadge. Very mild differnces still wouldn't be a bad idea though to go."

Everythings been normal and I've been drinking strictly only water since then, my throat doesn't hurt or strain at all, I've been keeping mucus out of my throat frequently, nothings really changed from before the infection besides losing my higher pitched voice.

You did lose your pitching a little on the ""tigers come at night."" But you were aware of that which is good. Are you nervous singing? Because you have a lovely tonality - when we get nervous we sometimes don't really project.   There are moments particularly in this song that can be given some real gusto, that mid section ""But the tigers."" Etc you can afford to colour that with a different dynamic. She's a tortured individual (like really, that poor fucking woman) so you can use your breath support there - giving you a strong foundation and confidence to push through a bit of that anger with a little bit more projection. But remember to hold the melody.   Your vocal tutor seems to have it though, although there were times when she was playing totally different notes to what was in the score that would have thrown me a little!! It would be good to hear a recording of just you and the backing without your tutor, so in the future we can give you some solid feedback.   Good job though!! Just work on your dynamics in that one, it can be a good alto belter or it can be a passionate character song.

There's no rhythm. You sing very slow(?).   Overall you need to work on rhythm & beat. Add a bit more emotion, and sing faster. Should really work on the rhythm/pace your singing at first.

The reason why standing up makes it more difficult is because you are most likely holding tension in the lower back and chest area.  What will help for now is bending over and leaning on your knees and rounding your back out.  Exhale all your air, and then take an inhale.  Once this becomes easy then what you do is slowly change the position back to standing. It can take a week or two to develop this ability.  I made a video highlighting the standing posture that will help you learn how to relax the upper body.  At first it looks awkward, but after awhile you will be able to breath with satisfaction without looking like you are in a strange posture.

You can hit them and you're voice is really well set but speaking from personal experience, when I hit the high notes, my body tenses up and the notes become sharp and pushed. What I do now is a few exercises and stretches to release that tension. I typically hold it in my shoulders, but everyone's body is different, so I would a few scales and see what your body does. Lip trills, singing the high notes through a straw, even massaging your back with tennis balls are a few approaches. Look up the exercises if you plan on doing them. Best of luck!  TLDR; You're body needs to relax into the high notes as relaxed it feels to sing the lower ones."
singing,39g4oc,moxoum,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And ooh, interesting. Never thought about doing work on the rest of my body (e.g. back and shoulders). I might try that. I actually find that I sound way clearer and my tone is way better rounded at home than I do when performing live, probably because I'm less tense about how I sound when it's just me in my room. I do tend to find it hard to relax into my voice in general, probably because I'm quite an anxious person and I'm always worrying about every aspect of whatever song I'm in the middle of doing, haha.  I will definitely look up those exercises and give them a try, especially the last two with the straw and the tennis balls!"
singing,39g4oc,Deepblueish,2,Thu Jun 11 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"Unless you're going to perform while rolling around on a tennis ball the habitual tension is just going to come back in the heat of the moment on stage. You need to adopt an overall training style of body awareness and relaxation.  Tension in a local area diffuses back into the whole, it doesn't just go away with some exercises.  Deepening your self-image is the only way to lasting positive results.  Good luck!"
singing,39g4oc,moxoum,2,Thu Jun 11 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Honestly tension in the wrong areas is typically what works against the production of sound. FYI, the tennis ball massage hurts like heck the first time cause it's basically a deep tissue massage. Whenever you sing through a straw, it helps build your use of air within the notes you sing. If you want to further your studies, look up linklater books and Alexander techniques. I was trained in both so it's helped me gain further awareness of my body."
singing,39g4oc,mwb2,2,Thu Jun 11 15:40:06 2015 UTC,Don't forget about mic technique--most pop singers will pull slightly away from the microphone on the louder high notes so that they don't overblow it.
singing,39g4oc,temporarysteve,0,Sun Jun 14 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of classically trained singers are too emotionless, because they are trained to focus on technique, technique, technique, all the time. So you get legions of beautiful and pretty voices, but beauty and prettiness isn't always what you want. I've even noticed promising young singers have it knocked out of them by a push for ""perfection"" in voice and tone. But what conveys emotion is variation in expression and tone. You need to build a repertoire of expressions, piece by piece if necessary. Study how you would say things with expression, and say it like that through the melody, perhaps subdued or exaggerated according to your style. Get shades and tones into your voice, and try to feel what the composer felt. I've been listening to Alice Fredenham lately, and I love how she puts so much feeling into every syllable, twisting and warping the sound."
singing,39g4oc,mwb2,3,Sat Jun 13 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"because they are trained to focus on technique, technique, technique, all the time   Not true.    But what conveys emotion is variation in expression and tone.   ...and what constitutes ""variation"" and ""expression"" differs from genre to genre, culture to culture.  I do think it's possible to over-focus on technique, but this is by no means a ""classical"" problem, and it's biased to suggest otherwise."

But if it's hurting when you sing, stop straining your throat. Singing should (technically) never be a strain.   Don't over think it. You're not gonna sound identical to spooky black ( idk wiccaphase but I'm assuming it's like sb) but you're gonna sound like You.  tldr: IMO Make sure you're not singing out of pitch (seek ear training) and stop hurting yourself."

Practice breathing in and out and watch the books rise and fall. This is where you're supposed to breathe when singing.

But in all honesty, your voice is really pretty and I don't find it boring at all! That being said, you are your best critic, and to get rid of the feeling of ""boredom"" in your voice (at least to yourself), I'd say to sing songs that really REALLY move/excite you, relate yourself somehow to that song if you have to, and visualise yourself like if you were singing to an audience (if it doesn't make you feel nervous). Feel like you're into that story that the song is telling :) I'm no professional by any means, but this is what it works for me, maybe it works for you too! (BTW, your voice is so cute <3 )"

I used to be able to do a really abrasive high-range towards the middle-top of the treble clef but that's mostly gone now.  I still can (and do!) sing clean, but I generally avoid anything over middle C at high volume for fear of straining my voice. I've got a solid octave and a half that lets me sing most songs I want to sing, with good resonance and proper dynamics. If I want to do anything bigger (like, anything written for a high voice, or stuff in awkward keys like E major), then I'm very mic-reliant.

singing,39bwjl,Mackncheeze,2,Wed Jun 10 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to take the critical route. I see potential here. You need to improve a few things. 1. Your use of breath. From your sound, it sounds like you have a basic understanding. But the foundation isn't strong. I'm not asking for you to push your breath but asking for it to be focused. There are tons of youtube videos on how to gain a further awareness of it and expand its strength. Stretches, lip trills, using a straw are a few ways of approaching it. Now onto your tone, the reason it sounds boring is your placement of sound. You're not channeling the sound through certain areas of resonance. Linklater has a good approach on certain areas of resonance. I'm a high tenor as well, so when my songs are a bit higher, I tend to focus the sound on the crown of my sinuses. If that makes any sense but our bodies are all made different. Sometimes smiling while you sing helps the finding the placement a bit easier. Explore your channels of resonance, improve your breath, learn to relax into the notes, and keep challenging yourself. You have the foundation and the voice is there, it just needs to be opened up and channeled. Best of luck."

singing,39eq8x,sewiv,3,Thu Jun 11 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"More specifically helpful is the idea that as air leaves the body, the ""gauging point"" of your breath decends towards the pelvic girdle. This means that if you are not deep down in your core by the end of your breath, you have ""pinched off"" your true capacity, like squeezing toothpaste from the middle.  Breath awareness training is the key, not snappy little aphorisms like ""move that air,"" which are next to useless.  Trills do take more air than simply exhaling, because the air is under pressure to induce vibration of the folds, in this case the lip folds. But your whole body must be marshaled to help manage the respiratory process, and most reactions that lead to great sounds in the voice are actually found in the body.  Good luck!"
singing,39eq8x,Deepblueish,2,Thu Jun 11 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"When I do them, my chest voice takes much more air than my head voice. I could do them at the top of my head voice range for a really long time, but the chest voice exhausts my breath fairly fast.   I'd suggest that you keep trying them fairly often and try to really focus on your breathing. Other breathing exercises may well be what you need if you're running out of breath too fast.  Best of luck."

There was a pattern for 4/4 and 3/4, but I don't remember it right now.   Do something you can physically feel, and repeat it a lot, until it becomes ingrained in your body. I've had students march with high knees, or sway from side to side, as well.   One other thing is to subdivide your long notes. Instead of singing a whole note, sing it as 4 repeated quarter notes, then link them together so you're still thinking the quarter notes."

It's possible  to develop problems with  singing and speech when you had a nasty laryngitis and stuff.  Your voice can have two things wrong,  either some  damage caused by the infection,  or bad habits  that cause you to vocalize improperly.  Both tend to take a bit to get into full swing and could take two weeks.  I had something similar,  infection  lasted over two weeks,  and then lost all power and projection of notes afterwards.   My infection led to to do some very bad stuff vocally,  kind of like a limp after an injury is healed,  very bad over compensation. Luckily  there wasn't any injury  to the vocal cords It's  taken a good month to get close to normal even with therapy.   Most complications after infections go away on their own with time.  If two weeks after your infection has healed you aren't better or almost 100‰,  then you need to make an appointment  with a voice specialist who might be in the same office as you general ENT. (check with your hospital/insurance on what they have and what's covered)  Then they'll be able to check if there's any damage or not and what to do afterward."

I could sing well enough after the first couple weeks, but it took a while to get back to 100% control and hit the top of my range.

singing,3971r5,ghoti023,12,Tue Jun 9 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"If I were to list all of the ""a-ha"" moments I've ever had, I'd have a book published and on the shelves of your local Barnes and Noble.   I've had more voice teachers than I've had years of study - and that's not necessarily a good thing. I firmly believe that serious singers should find a teacher that works, and stick with them until they've got all the basics down. Of course, that can't always follow through, because there are bad teachers, and there are bad student-teacher matches, so sometimes trial and error is really the only way to go. So, you're absolutely right in saying that other input can be helpful - with the caveat that if you trust your teacher, to run things by them and talk about them too.  My most recent ""a-ha"" moment is that I really need to use more ""oo"" vowels/shapes in my upper register. I have a lot of power (/u/tri_sara_tops can confirm), and a lot of edge/resonance, but it doesn't always sound beautiful like I want it to. During my recent grad school audition circuit, I took a lesson with one teacher, and a masterclass with another that got some ""oo"" and ""oh"" in my high register, and it was awesome. I tried to do the same thing about 2 weeks ago at a lesson with a third teacher, and couldn't quite get it again. So, that's my new goal for right now is to figure that out.   TL;DR - Vowels are important, and have weird magic powers I don't yet understand.    When it comes to breath, I actually try to not think about actively contracting or constricting my abdominals - but just enhancing what they do naturally. If you lay on the ground on your back, you'll notice that you belly-breathe without having to think twice about it. I do the same thing while standing up. It takes some conscious effort to correct if you've been clavicularly breathing for a while, but you can get the hang of it. From there, I just think about enhancing what's already being done. It's also not about pushing anything out or sucking anything in, but rather just controlling the stream of air, and how fast it comes out - not dissimilar to manual bike-tire air pumps. It's not about muscular strength necessarily, as it is about muscle manipulation. Your muscles should also constantly be moving - it's not a one and done deal. The breath process is in constant motion. You can't just flex your abs and call it a day, it's constantly tensing and un-tensing, and at various speeds and levels.  I hope some of that made sense. I'm pretty sleep deprived - and my words are failing me.

singing,3971r5,ghoti023,2,Tue Jun 9 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"I firmly believe that serious singers should find a teacher that works, and stick with them until they've got all the basics down. Of course, that can't always follow through, because there are bad teachers, and there are bad student-teacher matches, so sometimes trial and error is really the only way to go. So, you're absolutely right in saying that other input can be helpful - with the caveat that if you trust your teacher, to run things by them and talk about them too.   When I started this singing ""adventure,"" I went to a teacher with amazing credentials, recommended by a friend who has pretty awesome singing credentials.  I stuck with it for a long, long time, and while I learned a whole lot, I felt that at the end of ~2 years I still couldn't really sing.  I get what you're saying here, but maybe it's because I'm old or something and I just don't intuit what other people might take for granted, but I'm really glad that I moved on and sought out other teachers and didn't give up at that point, as I was about to do.  The others didn't/don't have the same level of credentials, but I feel like I'm moving forward in ways I wasn't able to before.  Also I haven't yet discussed the support thing with my teacher, but based on her reaction at our last lesson it was definitely a move forward.  I will take your advice and mention it to her this week, though :)  I love the image of ""muscles in constant motion""!  Makes perfect sense, now it's application time.... :D  Somewhere I have a whole vowel post (posted by you?) bookmarked for future reading.

singing,3971r5,ghoti023,4,Tue Jun 9 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"2 years is a totally decent enough time period to stay with one teacher for someone your age. And in fact, 2 years is long enough for anyone at any age if they feel they aren't progressing further. The ""firmly"" is mostly for those in the 18-22 y/o age group that are attending university for voice/classical singing. I had 5 teachers in my 4 years of undergrad music school, and it was a hot mess. The collegiate world of singing is something entirely different though.  Also - CONGRATS! YOU FOUND OUT THAT CREDENTIALS AREN'T EVERYTHING! I personally don't give a damn if you've sung for the Queen of England if you can't teach. They are entirely two different skills. Teaching credentials and certifications are also subject to skepticism. I've worked with professionals who have doctorate degrees and found myself in want of something more from them. Just because you can jump through hoops to get a piece of paper that says you know your shit, doesn't mean you can apply your shit.  I do suggest keeping an open dialogue with your teacher about the things that you learn and how you describe them. It'll give your teacher a better understanding of how you learn, and your perspective on the material. It's also a great way to see if they'll work with you, and not just at you.  I may have written a vowel post, but I'm not entirely certain I have. I'm pretty sure I've just talked about it in lengthy novel-esque comments. ;)"

As someone who is pushing 40 myself, I've felt kind of like the ""old lady"" of /r/singing, glad there are a few of us ""older"" folks representing!  My major ""aha"" moments, of which there have been MANY, have all come about within the last couple years since I started with my current teacher/mentor. The two biggest being breath control/support, and ""placement"" (though I do hate that word). The best way I've come up with to describe the technique is to think of your body as a syringe -- your middle torso/abdomen expands to automatically fill with air, then you let it out with constant tension/pressure expanding down towards the floor, never letting extra escape, just as a syringe forces its contents out through that little hole. The key is never letting up on that airflow and keeping even pressure the whole time.   The other huge piece that finally fell into place for me was to keep everything above your shoulders out of the game -- no jaw, tongue down/relaxed, zero tension up in your head or lips. Just keeping your soft palette raised always, sending the sound up to resonate through that dome behind your forehead, no matter where in your range you are singing -- one unified voice all the way up and down. It should always be aimed out the same place. Vowels are important too, but I've come to understand just how minor the changes there should be -- the changes you make to form each vowel with the back of your tongue should be extremely slight, and they should all sound close from vowel to vowel. Thinking of them as keeping them ""tall"" has been helpful in this regard. There have certainly been other lightbulb moments (and more to come, I'm sure), but these were definitely the biggies.   Congrats on your progress thus far, do keep it up and have fun!"

Which makes me wonder if there are any others out there who started singing at an ""older"" age (but not that old since the 40s are the new 20s right?)    That whole ""placement"" thing...I've been trying to think of it more as resonance, and think the closer I get to hitting my eyeballs with sound, the more resonant it gets.  That's probably not the best description but it's what's working so far.  I love the syringe metaphor!  Oh, and the tension/relaxation thing...I'm so wound up it's the hardest thing to achieve.  But when you think about it, the way to achieve most everything in life is through well-placed relaxation.  Thanks again!"

I would love to hear others stories though, I believe I am currently struggling with breath/support as well and my instructor agreed.  By keeping muscle tension below the belly button do you mean intentionally squeezing your abs? Or just visualizing it and feeling it out as you breathe in and out through singing?"
singing,3971r5,branss,2,Tue Jun 9 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, what I'm doing is not squeezing, it's sort of the opposite...which is the counter-intuitive part. It's more like I'm concentrating all my muscle effort there, sort of in a down/outward motion, in the attempt to take away any muscle effort that might happen in my throat (like /u/sewiv I used to squeeze out my notes, since my voice was literally living down there at the bottom of my throat).  It's kinda like that yoga idea, that if you want something to relax in one part of your body, you have to displace your energy by tensing something else.  That's how I see it anyway.

For me, one big thought is that singing is the hardest easiest thing for the body to do. It's simultaneously very natural and very contrived. Yes, those are contradictions, but it helped me focus on what parts need to be ""easy"" (throat, pharynx, articulation) and which parts need to be super strong and engaged (lower breathing muscles, posture, ears/brain). The opposition helps me draw attention to whatever needs it, and not stress out about the stuff that doesn't need my attention.   On a similar vein, thinking about breath support as an opposition of forces (inhalation and exhalation) as opposed to unrelated forces (suck air in, push air out) was really mind-blowing. I still don't get it xD but it does feel more logical to think of it as one continuous cycle."

Just like plastic surgery leads to trollish bad looks, trying to modify your voice to suit your preference ends up warping its growth process. Instead of trying to make your voice this or that, focus on singing with a greater sense of freedom in your breathing and in your tone production.  You will end up with a flexible, free voice, appreciated not only for its uniqueness (because everyone is different), but also for the skill in which you use it (because becoming a world-class singer is hard work and discipline.) Let BigHairyBalls take bass in choir next year if your voice isn't quite ready for it, and focus on freedom!"
singing,399qet,Deepblueish,2,Thu Jun 11 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"This doesn't exactly answer your question, but as far as my knowledge goes, bass parts generally don't go below an E2, and may occasionally go down to a D2 (but rarely). So you'd be more than fine with the range you currently have!"
singing,399qet,yazbanaz,2,Wed Jun 10 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"A fellow 15M bass here, voice development is very subjective per person.  In my own personal experience, as long as I've focused on being able to maintain the range I've had, I've been able to gradually expand it. This may not be the same for you, so take it with a grain of salt. I've focused on breathing when I've tried to push below my normal range, so this may also help you, in the case of becoming too engrossed in trying to force the note.  A fellow singer, at age 25, has only settled his range entirely, with no variations for about 8 months.  My school offers no choir, so you're lucky there in that regard.  Hope I could help."
singing,399qet,eLECTIVIRE99,2,Wed Jun 10 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Just like /u/deepblueish said - your voice will continue to mature and change until your mid 20s.

singing,399qet,TheMightosaurus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:56:25 2015 UTC,"Mostly just time at that point,  since you obviously already have  access  to your low range.  Yazbanaz  is right,  bass parts rarely go down to E2, especially  in high school as there aren't enough Basses that can hit that and with sufficient  power.  Your choir won't really care if you can sing anything below that E2 because you'll pretty much be part of a small minority  and even less can sing with power down there.   What does matter is clarity,  tone,  and power in that low end.  Specifically  having  this between A2-E2. Working on keeping the bright clean and crisp sound down in your voice is what a choir wants.  This will project better and blend better too.  That why so many exercises going down into the scale focus on maintaing  resonance in your mouth and pharynx.   If you'd like critiqued in you low end and how to improve it, that fine,  but looking to expand you low end,  at 15, when you already can sing a C#2, is a waste of time. Honestly the fact that you admit your voice is still changing,  and you claiming to be able to sing an A4  at 15, makes me question if you have a strong,  clean,  and even sound through that range.  That by far is the only thin your choir director  will care about if you and already sing D2-A4."

I work with a guy who raps and I don't process his vocals the same way I do my buddy who sings with his guitar. Recording/producing, for me, is about being flexible for whoever you're working with to capture their sound. On the other hand, if he's only commenting about the loudness in certain parts, maybe he's just trying to capture a different tonality for a section. In then end, don't be frustrated about him micro managing, it's his job to think about things and how they fit as a whole, and work together.

It's rough, but he should find another singer that wants to do what he wants, and you should find another producer that's willing to produce what you like. Your styles are just different, and apparently non-compatible if you can't find any amount of compromise. He's not wrong to ask what he's asking for, and you're not wrong to not do it or like it. It's not like one of you is paying the other to do stuff. If you were paying him, he would need to do what you want.

singing,39ajms,SevenSixtyOne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"It's a producer's job to be particular about everything because they see the big picture at the end. I agree that if he's going to work with vocals, he should have a basic knowledge of how that sort of stuff works, but at the end of the day you can't make him, and it is regardless, his job to be picky about everything.  So you have to ask yourself - are you working with him for you or for him? If you're working with him for him, carry on with what you're doing, and it's going to continue to be a headache. If you're working with him for you - it's not working out and you should find another producer.  There isn't a right answer.   I don't work with my partner musically for this exact reason. He would want me to do things that I don't want to do, and so our relationship is just better if we do our own music projects and play support roles with each other rather than try to collaborate."

Self-teaching can be okay if you're not shooting for the stars, but since you are, you need a teacher. There's no way around it.  Your unstable voice is actually probably a mixture of improper breath support and puberty. The male voice doesn't finish settling until the late 20s/early 30s. If you haven't been trained from an early-ish age, it can take a few years to get that bull of a voice trained into a show-horse.  How old are you now? There are also some realities about starting a boy band and having high expectations that need to be discussed too. Not that you can't, but if this is what you want to do, you need to find other group members yesterday, and you all need to be taking voice lessons.   Since you've also had no prior singing experience, I strongly suggest joining a choir/mens group/barbershop to start getting an ear for music.  Getting higher notes in your modal register and not flipping over to falsetto is a pretty high-level skill in terms of male vocalization. I honestly wouldn't start attempting it until you're happy with your tone/support in your lower notes. You'll also find that as you improve your middle/lower range, that your higher range will slowly start to unravel all by itself as time goes on. If you have good technique where it's comfortable, it'll be easier to apply it to where it's not so comfortable.  For everything else, there's the FAQ from the sidebar."

singing,396xex,HueuH,3,Tue Jun 9 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"Probably a combination of cultural things and genetics. Low Russian singers are more likely to be sought after and trained, and historically ethnic Slavic peoples tend to be taller and larger (which, although there's no direct correlation with the voice, does create the potential). In addition, there are just lots of people in Russia. If you go out of your way to find low basses in a large population sample, you'll find some. It's just less culturally emphasized elsewhere so lots of low voices in, say, the U.S. might just never sing."

On top of that height is poorly correlated with voices.   Based on a study that estimated voice type with  height it appeared that  being 3“ taller was only about  a quarter tone  difference in passaggio.  This was an estimate,   but the point was only a difference in height would need to be like multiple inches to see a difference,  not a half inch shorter. It's obvious the difference  is slight,  tall women don't sound at all like men,  even the ones above 6'.   For some reasons white Americans tend to think Russians and black people tend towards giants and deep voices, and yet both populations are about the same height,  if not a hair shorter.  Of which African Americans don't have any different  voices, although  it plausible  Russians have naturally  deeper voices by a small amount do to genetics independent  of height. I do think it's almost  entirely  cultural though, and we really only have evidence.  Very very low  voices were not really sought after in the West in the same way.  The use of an organ in choral music made them pretty redundant,  and a super deep voice doesn't really  show its uniqueness in an operatic  setting nearly as much."

Yeah, white people are taller than average, but Russians aren't taller than the average person in English speaking countries, yet many of us wrongly assume they are. That's for reasons I don't understand and not really related to singing.  I know you didn't say the height was directly correlated, I just wanted to give you a sense of how little it was even indirectly correlated with actual numbers to get a sense of how much would be needed to have a significant difference in the amount of Basso Profundos in a population.  If the Russians were 3 or 4"" taller we'd expect them to have maybe twice as many, but  they are not any taller than average people in English speaking countries."

If a song isn't in your range chances are you can either get it transposed or you can sing it down/up an octave. But don't worry about it too much because...  2-You're 15. And your voice is far from done developing. I guarantee you your voice won't be the same 2, 3, 5, and 10 years from now. You could become a deep bass in 10 years or a squeeky counter-tenor. But there's no way to know that now. Just wait. Your range will increase and decrease in the coming years and that's just how your body works.  If you're really interested in why this happens and exercises to strengthen your voice or improve range, get a vocal teacher. If you can't find one near you try going through universities/primary schools and I guarantee you'll find someone.  tl;dr- Don't worry. You're letting yourself get bogged down in the technicalities when at this age you should just be enjoying yourself while singing. If you can't hit a note go into falsetto or drop it. It's okay!"

However, even with solos if it's a somewhat known show with an iconic solo then usually they won't let you transpose it because the audience is expecting a signature note (See: Music of the Night, Corner of the Sky)"

singing,395hzr,IWillBeatThis,2,Tue Jun 9 11:57:36 2015 UTC,"Well....no. Because if you aren't using your diaphragm, you would be dead. And we don't want that!  What I think you're asking if whether or not it's stylistically acceptable to sing without support. The answer is technically yes - all rules are meant to be broken and none of us can stop you from making decisions about technique.   HOWEVER, it is neither healthy nor necessary. It is totally possible to sing with a lighter tone color and still use proper breath support. You can do a lot, for example, by playing with registration. Using a lighter, more head-dominant sound can convey softness and weakness. You can also mess around with resonance - rather than trying to amplify your sound, you can decrease amplification and change to a warmer tone color for stylistic effect."
singing,395hzr,keakealani,2,Tue Jun 9 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to Leonard Cohen, maybe you don't need more emotion.  As far as using more diaphragm to subdue the sound, this can be heard In opera, however it doesn't work too well with low notes, only high notes."

After all, support has to be balanced by cord closure in order to work, and since the timbres I mentioned above use very light cord closure, trying to use support isn't particularly practical or necessary. Once you get louder though, bring that support back in straight away."

It sounds like he's just talking in a pitch that's a little higher than he's normal talking voice, and then using rhythm and vocal strength to get the rest of the job done. Try and emulate it, I bet you can do it without straining your voice at all. If that's not it - I don't know."
singing,393b5x,KingCowan,4,Mon Jun 8 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Your voice is a weird combination of muscle and membrane, and it needs the kind of care you would take for both types of tissue.  Keep well hydrated. When you dehydrate, your body rushes fluid to your vocal folds and they become inflamed. This can lead to laryngitis or serious damage if your vocal folds become chronically inflamed or are overused while they are also inflamed.  Refrain from overusing your voice. This seems pretty obvious, but many people don't realize that they are over extenuating their voices until they feel pain or experience hoarseness, and that is too late. Refrain from speaking loudly for long periods of time, or from speaking over loud noise. If you must do so on a regular basis (like if you are a teacher or something) make sure to keep hydrated and consider asking your employer to purchase a personal amplifier for you.  If you have issues with heartburn or acid reflux, do whatever you can to mitigate that asap. The acid from your stomach can actually leak into your vocal folds from your esophagus and cause damage.  Finally, if you must speak or sing for long periods of time, make sure to warm up your voice. Just like when you are warming up your muscles before a work-out, your voice needs to be warmed up as well to decrease your likelihood of overextenuation.  I hope that helps!  Like my old choir director used to tell us all in college before big concerts: ""Drink, drink, drink WATER. Sleep, sleep, sleep ALONE. And rest, rest, rest your voices."""

Train your air - mediation, yoga, pranayama, chi kung, Tai Chi Chuan, etc, whatever sticks for you.  Body and breath awareness, not technique, are the life-long keys to great singing.  The old Italian masters knew this, and some know it today, but by-and-large the patience and wisdom required to create great singing is gone, and artists rely on cheap tricks and Internet lessons, spending up their voices long before natural design intends. Listen to old singers to hear the sounds of wisdom. Young singers can only demonstrate the sound of raw power. Good for record sales, not so good for the soul. Good luck!"

singing,392rqy,shambol,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"Take lessons. Seriously. Musical theatre is up there with classical where you will learn most efficiently with someone who knows the style and idioms. It's not as simple as telling you how to do one thing - musical theatre has a lot of different styles and subgenres based on the show, the character, the staging, etc.   That being said, some basic stuff is to brighten the tone - you'll need a little bit of twang to carry and typically musical theatre doesn't aim toward the more bel canto choral sound. You also need to articulate more like speech - choral singing tends to use an exaggerated type of diction (which is great when you're singing in a large group and need to be understood, but not as a soloist with a microphone).   Listen to lots of MT singers of all styles and voice types. You need to get a feel for how they sing and how they balance theatre with music."
singing,38xg7d,mwb2,2,Sun Jun 7 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty much,  although   tessitura  is complex. Bing Crosby was comfortable singing very low,  yet was a bass/baritone.   Without the microphone he wouldn't be able to sing that range comfortably in an operatic setting.  Similarly  an untrained singer likely can't sing in his upper half of his range comfortably either.    Voice types are not exclusive  to opera and classical music,  but many of the terms don't translate  without giant qualifications, just like tessitura .  Range outside a classical  setting  can means quite a lot of things,  from low grumbles to squeaky  falsetto,  and those aren't much an indication  of voice type either.  Similarly  timbre can be complex because of one does not need to be very loud or project over an orchestra. Someone,  using a microphone,  who may have been best suited for a lyric baritone roles in Opera can sound like someone who's voice would be suited for high dramatic/Verdi  baritone.

singing,38xg7d,Mattpilf,2,Mon Jun 8 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think that although voice types aren't for classical music only, many people do get confused about voice types in other styles because the expectation for vocal production is different. For example, in styles that encourage lots of use of reinforced falsetto (the Hawaiian Leo Kiʻekiʻe tradition is the first that comes to mind, but there are western styles that are similar), a singer may believe they are a higher voice type because they are comfortable singing high in falsetto, when their modal voice would be classified as a medium or low voice.   This is also a reason why using Wikipedia and other sources is problematic. Wikipedia primarily uses the range assumptions for classical singers, even when discussing generic (not fach) voice types. Basically any source that claims to define voice type by range is subject to this error.   This is generally what I (and I suspect others) mean when I say things like ""voice types tend to be defined based on classical standards"". As far as I've seen, there have not been widely-adopted systems of voice classification in other genres taking into consideration those genres' style of vocal production.   With that in mind, I do think it is significantly less meaningful for a non-classical singer to label themselves with a voice type, because voice types are less important in non-classical paradigms. While in classical singing you need to know if you should be singing the high or low transposition of an art song, or what roles to study in opera, this is not the way singers choose music in non-classical styles (they may instead choose any piece with a compatible gross range, or just choose a piece for stylistic reasons and transpose as necessary, which is usually not published).   Obviously nobody can stop people from thinking about voice classification, but I do want to discourage people from assuming things from it that may not be accurate or relevant to their style of preference."

When you get nervous, it's easy to sort of clam up and collapse that space, but it does help keep the pitch up.

Most men won't lose much or their low notes because normal speech uses the muscles required, so there is much less of a loss. While standard things like breathing, resonance, tone, and some power might be lost, if a low note was in a natural part of your range, it's probably still there more or less."

Low notes require extreme relaxation, so forcing your voice downwards will just tense you up and make things worse."

From a singing perspective, it sounds like you've been mostly exposed to choral music. Nothing wrong with that - I love choral singing and that's where I started, too. But you haven't necessarily been exposed to your friends' style of music, which I'm guessing is some sort of pop or rock or whatever kids these days listen to </old fogie>  So the answer is - listen more and sing more in that style. It won't be great at first, but probably your first day of choir ever wasn't that great either. You have to get to know the idioms and styles, and figure out ways to do those things with your own voice.   Since you have some music theory background, I would also recommend trying to break down some of the songs you're trying to sing. This should help you get more comfortable with the harmonies and learn some of the melodies.   Ultimately, it's just a matter of practice. Just keep working at it, and you'll get there."

singing,38voem,yall_,6,Sun Jun 7 05:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that the mask and the lifted soft palate are not mutually exclusive. /u/mezzolini recently made a comment in another thread about this, so check that out.   Basically, though, you're looking for a balanced sound that has both the forward, ""mask"" resonance and the lofty, high soft palate sound. The exact balance is style-based - you're right that opera singers tend to use comparatively more soft palate lift than pop styles, but all singers use some sort of balance.   To more directly answer your question, I agree that tongue and throat tension is probably not a good thing for you.   It's worth noting that the ""ideal"" soft palate lift for singing is more approximated by the very beginning of a yawn, not the fully extended yawn. The goal is still a relaxed, natural shape of the mouth and throat, not the hyperextended stretch that happens once a yawn is underway. I'm not sure if that helps you, but I personally had a big ""aha!"" moment when this was explained to me."

singing,38voem,keakealani,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think for me, it's less that I'm conscious of my soft palate specifically, and more that I can hear and feel when the space is right or wrong. Like when there's not enough space, I'll feel it interfering with my sound and not resonating fully, and when there is the right amount of space, the sound is ""easier"".   I can't say whether it works that way for anyone else, but that's the feedback I tend to focus on."

singing,38voem,obrianite,3,Sun Jun 7 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, a raised soft palate has little to no physical sensation associated directly with it in the location of the event. As /u/keakealani said, many singers hear the difference in tone as a major indicator of palatal position.  Based on what you've said about your yawn exercise making you sound like you're ""mocking an opera singer"", I would bet good money that your tongue is moving backwards as a result of feeling open space at the back of the mouth. When doing the yawn exercise, ensure that tip of your tongue maintains (relaxed) contact with the lower front teeth, and that the root of the tongue is not pressing down and back onto the throat.  I would recommend that you try a few different ways of accessing the raised palate space, and assess which one gives you least residual tension. Not every method is going to be effective for you, and that's okay - so long as there is no pain, keep exploring. Some example exercises:   Stop at the ""top"" of a snore Breathe in and feel cold air at the back of the mouth (the ""just brushed my teeth"" feeling!) Phonate on an 'ng' sound, opening directly to a vowel (open o is a good starter vowel) - it may almost feel like there's a small 'click' in your mouth going from one to the other Pinch your nose shut and sing through a vowel stream   Do bear in mind that the balance of palate/jaw/tongue is an ongoing process for most singers, and each affects the others. When doing any exercise - unless you are told specifically otherwise - ensure that your tongue and jaw remains relaxed.  Edit: Because I'm no can reddit format lkjasdflkjasdf"
singing,38vnlm,Ajv2324,10,Sun Jun 7 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"In general for English diphthongs, you want to get to the second vowel as late as possible, almost like it's a consonant. So you should sustain the ""ah"" vowel until right before the end of the note, then do the ""ee"" part.   This is somewhat stylistic, though. Country is a genre known for moving through diphthongs more exaggeratedly, and depending on your dialect it may be appropriate to have more or less."

Whatever the ending vowel ends up being, its more like an ornament on the end of the syllable than anything else.   When I'm using my secondary vocal chords for kargyraa or other guttural stuff it usually ends up more like""oh-ee, or even ""o-i"", wherein more emphasis is put on the transition between the vowels than the vowels themselves."

If you're working with a coach, take their advice on what resonates best in your voice. If not, then sing thru different things where it's very present, record the results, listen over and over until you find what sounds best, and use that approach."

I've been taking lessons for about 6 years and still barely feel like I'm starting to ""get it"" with singing. So hang in there, first of all. All the best things in life are worth waiting for.   I also feel like I say this a lot here, but it is wasted effort to focus on what you can't do. Just trying to do the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity, according to some misattributed internet quote. You don't learn by trying to do things you can't - you learn by building on the things you can do.   If this means singing songs with a smaller range that is comfortable, then do that! Nobody is keeping score about how hard of a piece or big of a range you're singing in your lessons. Build on your existing skills rather than just butting up against things you struggle with.   Also, please, please bring this up with your teacher! They are by far the best resource to help you figure out issues and choose pieces and exercises that are appropriate and helpful. And at six months, now is probably around the time where you can judge if your learning style and needs are being met by your teacher. If not, there is nothing wrong with looking elsewhere.   That being said, the learning curve can be messy. Many times, you'll need to screw around with some things to fix other issues, and it may feel like you're not improving or even sound worse than before. But, this is often a combination of being in the middle of the process and learning to become more discerning as a singer. The better you get, the pickier you will be about your mistakes!  On the flip side, you also may not hear improvement as it happens. It is usually so gradual, you won't really see any difference on a day-to-day basis. But, if you listen back months or years later, you can see you've improved a lot.   Anyway, just know that you are not alone. Singing is a tough process, but I hope you are singing because you love it, and let that love propel you through the difficult times."

singing,38ua2o,yall_,7,Sat Jun 6 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"It sort of sounds like you're trying to combine two totally different concepts.   Head voice and chest voice are descriptors used to talk about registration, which is essentially the balance of muscle groups used to sing. Head voice uses more cricothyroid action, and chest voice uses more thyroarytenoid action. And they're not really two discrete entities, either. Almost all of singing involves both muscle groups, it's just a matter of which one is being used more at the time. They're labeled ""head"" and ""chest"" because a lot of people experience secondary vibrations in those areas, NOT because they are produced in those areas or resonate there. In fact, it's pretty much impossible for sound to resonate in your head or chest because resignation needs to involve an empty cavity, and most of your head (other than your mouth and nose) and chest are taken up by muscles and organs.   Nasal resonance is a term describing a type of singing where some of the air used for singing comes out of the nose instead of the mouth. This is because the mouth and nose are connected in the back of your throat (this is also why if you laugh really hard while drinking, the liquid can squirt out your nose). In classical singing, very little nasal resonance is considered acceptable (although classical singers and teachers have varied opinions), and in other styles there is usually a range of acceptable nasality as well. (Oral resonance, btw, is just the opposite - singing with the air coming out of your mouth.)  With those concepts in mind, would you be willing to clarify/rephrase your question? I'm not sure if this explanation clears up your confusion or you're asking something else."
singing,38ua2o,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:29:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you for that. I suppose I'm having trouble with keeping any nasal resonance in my higher register, specifically in trying to find my ""mixed voice.""

singing,38ua2o,keakealani,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:05:26 2015 UTC,"Um, why are you trying to have nasal resonance? Normally that's a bad thing for most styles, although like I said the threshold varies for different styles.   I also really think you need to think about resonance and registration as different things. Right now it sounds like you're confused between them or think they are the same thing. Mixed voice has nothing to do with nasal resonance."
singing,38ua2o,mezzolini,3,Sun Jun 7 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"One reason for a weak head voice is that your vocal cords have to have the flexibility to stretch, while still maintaining some of their thickness. If you've only focused on chest voice until now, your vocal cords simply haven't learned how to keep some of their thickness as they stretch, instead of just completely relaxing and going really thin. Let it be a little bit ""weak"" for now--don't tense up to try to make a bigger sound--and it should get stronger with practice.   When I sing a vowel in head voice and plug my noise, the voice doesn't change at all - which probably means I'm only resonating in the oral cavity... right?   Don't forget the pharyngeal (throat) cavity! Google ""pharynx"" and look at the images. The pharynx is the main resonating cavity of the voice, because it's where the sound waves go first. It starts behind the larynx and continues past the oral cavity, and ends behind the nasal cavity. The different areas are named (laryngopharynx, oropharynx, nasopharynx), but it's one continuous space.   Unless you are truly going for a nasal sound (which I don't think you are), your tone should not change when you plug your nose, so that's good. I use the nose-plug to check and make sure that the soft palate is raised. It's what happens at the beginning of a yawn or a swallow, and it's the reason water and food don't get pushed into/out of our noses when we swallow.  Singing in the mask is not the same as singing nasally. ""Mask resonance"" is the sympathetic resonance of our sinus cavities (google images of these too)--but the sound waves are not traveling from the nasal cavity to the sinuses! I think of it as ""skull resonance."" Imagine your sound shooting straight up the pharynx, hitting the bottom of your skull, and making the bones vibrate. I also call this ""singing behind the uvula.""   Check your jaw and make sure it is loose and open. (google a video of TMJ on Youtube to see how the jaw opens). Make sure your tongue isn't shooting back into your throat, and that it is relaxed (not pointy). Also, most important:  Let go of the expectation that you can experience your sound somewhere in your throat. A lot of us unconsciously tense up the pharynx, so the resonance stays lower, closer to where our own ears can pick up the sound. It really holds us back from our biggest sound and best projection.  You should experience the sound/resonance as originating in the nasopharynx, at the height of your cheeks. It will feel more distant, but it will be more 'ringy' in your head. Make sure your airflow is supporting this; it takes more energy than to sing with only ""mouth resonance."""

She's trying to make sure you don't sing too heavily, with the ""upper face"" direction. That's also a way to make sure you don't close down your resonance.  The ""smaller nose"" is the only thing I didn't recognize. It could be a way to make sure you don't have a nasal sound.  There's no reason a choir director can't be a good beginning teacher for solo voice lessons. If you reach a place where you're not improving, and you're doing everything she's teaching, you'll feel it--and then you'll have a better idea of what you are looking for.   Honestly, we all learn similar things in school, so anyone who's had enough lessons to get a college degree should be able to take you through some basic vocal exercises.  What's more important, in my opinion is how she taught these things. Some teachers have you do first, then explain. Some teachers explain first, then have you do. Does she check to see if you are doing things correctly before moving on? Does she come back to things to make sure you have them down? Does she present concepts in a way that is manageable for you? Is she open to feedback from you? How does she handle it when you are clearly not getting a concept or technique?  As a total beginner, you'll have to give her a few months to really evaluate this, so definitely go back and give it your best effort--practice regularly, record your lessons, write down difficulties and questions to ask at your next lesson."
singing,38ufe1,mezzolini,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"I think by upper level of your face, she's talking about singing into the mask - which is a way to describe the feeling of proper nasal resonance. Singing into the mask is when the frontal part of your face, just under the eyes, starts to resonate (or ring heavily, if you will..) with your notes. It's just a picture for you to imagine to help you nail the correct technique."

You can't possibly tell from the first lesson, with no experience, if the coach/teacher is ""good"". It seems to me that she's starting you out properly, figuring out what resonates with you as far as explanations, and taking you thru basic breathing and warmups. Keep up the lessons for a while and see how it goes.   I know ppl who's teachers have taught totally different ways from my teachers and they are singing professionally, winning contests, and sounding wonderful (over the years). A teacher is very personal to each student and I remember us arguing over who was the best many a time back in college. Just remember that what matters is your vocal improvement and that does take time."
singing,38ufe1,terrycotta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"That's not really enough information to make a good judgement, but there are a few red flags.   Being a choir director gives me some pause. While there are some choir directors with strong solo voice experience, they're very different skills, and quite frankly most choir directors I know are not qualified voice teachers. You might want to ask for her voice experience, such as whether she has degrees in vocal performance or has taken vocal pedagogy (the study of teaching singing) classes.   The ""breathe into your stomach"" thing is also a red flag. This is not anatomically possible - your stomach is connected to the digestive tract, not the respiratory tract used for breathing. However, it may depend on how she said it and what she meant. Some teachers use similar visualizations because when you breathe fully, the abdominal viscera (fancy word for guts) get displaced and it expands your belly area. This is a totally valid way to teach, but could also indicate that she doesn't know much about the vocal anatomy.   I don't really get what she was going for with the smaller nose and ""level"" of your face, so I'm not really sure if that's a good or bad thing. If it works for you, great!  The warmups seem straightforward, although I think she should use more variety and also not use that vowel too high in the range. But again, it's sort of hard to know what her intentions were so I can't really comment on whether it's appropriate or not.   Anyway, I'll point you to the article in the FAQ about finding a good teacher, as that has some other info about things to look for. Generally speaking, someone with a degree in vocal performance or vocal pedagogy is probably a good solid bet, as well as someone with a lot of performance experience (although not all good performers are good teachers)."
singing,38ufe1,keakealani,2,Sat Jun 6 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that these are exercises for a super-beginning student - and to breathe as though it feels like it's into your belly is a super common (though anatomically incorrect) method of teaching lower breathing. The teacher may have more understanding of how singing works than is being led on to the student, because they're describing it in much simpler and visible terms than the student would otherwise get. I don't personally see any of the things said in the original post that would constitute a ""red flag,"" especially if OP is at the high school level. ""Upper level"" of the face covers the mask area, in which many singers feel resonance in different places of that area.  While you're right that it's impossible to say that this teacher is good or bad, it definitely seems as though the teacher is on the right track for a novice if what the teacher is explaining is making sense to the student. I wouldn't qualify anything as ""red flag"" material here."
singing,38ufe1,ghoti023,2,Sun Jun 7 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"Fair points. Like I said, it's hard to know what the teacher intended or how they said these things, and that matters a lot as far as whether or not they're problematic. Of course, it's all a matter of opinion, and like I said, if it works, go for it!   But in all fairness, I've also seen a lot of these things done by people I wouldn't consider good teachers even for a beginner, which is why those are some things I highlighted. After all, the OP seems to have a reason for asking - if they thought the teacher was highly qualified then they wouldn't be asking about it. So if it helps to pinpoint reasons OP might have felt the teacher wasn't good, then that still is important.   Each to their own opinion. And it also may be that I'm using ""red flag"" more loosely as things to evaluate more closely, not necessarily reasons the teacher is bad."
singing,38u5d8,MadzAssassin,2,Sat Jun 6 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful about using videos/online courses while taking lessons. At the very least, I would strongly recommend consulting carefully with your current instructor about it. You haven't mentioned how experienced you are, but particularly if you're less experienced, online and video courses can be problematic because you aren't knowledgeable enough to separate out good advice from harmful advice. In addition, even for objectively ""good"" advice, it may counteract something your instructor is working on with you, leading to confusion and other issues.   Since you mention seeing a coach, I think if you are interested in additional instruction, you should seek a voice teacher. Coaches really shouldn't be your main point of contact anyway - their purpose is to polish your performances and work out little stylistic kinks, not to teach you the bread-and-butter of vocal technique. A teacher would be a much better investment, and frankly a lot of these courses cost as much as a few months of lessons so if you can afford one, you can afford the other."

I don't think anyone would use an online course to deliberate mess up their voice, but it does leave you prone to accidentally messing up because you misunderstood something or it just wasn't appropriate for your voice. Also, you could interfere with the strategies your current coach is using to teach you.   I would really say that if you think you need more instruction (and honestly for most people weekly lessons is plenty), consider extending your current lessons or meeting more frequently (like twice a week). Also, though, you may want to think about how much you're really practicing for your lessons and whatnot. If you crave more investment, it may be that you're not practicing enough, since if you are practicing enough most people's schedules would feel quite full. (I'm not saying you don't practice enough, just a thought based on general tends). If that's the case, practice more!"
singing,38tuu9,thankspeaches,5,Sat Jun 6 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Talk to that musical's director and musical director. See what's required for you to join next year.  Step 2: You'll probably have to join your high school's choir. Some high schools work on music for the musical in choir. Even if that's not the case, you should join your school's choir, because your choir teacher is probably the musical director for your musical, and you'll want to get to know them as a person and what they look for in a singer. Plus, if they know you before auditions and you know them, you'll be less nervous.  Step 3: Audition for the musical next year.  Step 4: Take any part you're offered. Even if it's chorus. People hate on being in the chorus, but chorus work can be a lot of fun if everyone's not so cynical about it. You do less work than the leads, but still gain experience - and the audience still pays attention to you. I REPEAT. THE AUDIENCE DOES WATCH THE CHORUS MEMBERS. IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING AND BE LAZY. THE AUDIENCE DOES SEE YOU, AND YOU ARE IMPORTANT.  Step 5: Repeat the next year. Possibly audition for community shows in addition.    As for the actual ""how to sing musical theatre"" aspect, it'll be easier to get advice on that based upon what your current experience is. What do you usually sing?   I would also suggest starting to watch a bunch of shows. There are quite a few musicals that have been turned into movies recently (Into the Woods, Les Miserables, Sweeney Todd to name a few, but there are tons more) so those would be easy to get your mitts on - but I'd encourage you to find video of live musicals. Movie versions are cut versions of the longer stage musical. Phantom of the Opera (which IS a musical, NOT an opera) has a live version on Netflix last I checked. Watch 'em all - even if they're not live stage versions. Go to local shows that are in your area too and get a feel for what your community's level and expectations are."

You don't mention your experience in singing, so I am writing this assuming you haven't sung a lot of musical theatre songs before.  My best tip is not to stretch too far too soon. When I got into musical theatre, I wanted to do all the big songs immediately, and I was no where capable with the voice I had. I wanted that big belting sound, and that's something you need to practice with small steps at a time. A couple of songs that really helped me vocally, and with finding that ""strong"" sound was Send in the Clowns from A Little Night Music, On my Own from Les Miserables, and Someone else's story from Chess. So I do recommend checking those out :)"

singing,38tuu9,keakealani,2,Sun Jun 7 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"/u/ghoti023's advice is spot on, listen to her.   In addition, I want to stress the importance of exposure and experience. Musical theatre communities tend to be small and rely heavily on word of mouth (yes, even at the high school level). This is the main reason it's so important to be in choir and get to know the director. They will be more likely to cast you if you've proven yourself as a valuable member of the musical theatre community.   This is a bit of a dirty little secret, but in my experience, high school directors are looking for maturity/reliability before talent. Sure, you may have a couple budding divas in your school, but most of the theatre kids are there because they've put in the time to show dedication. It's kind of unfair in the sense that this is basically playing favorites, but it's mostly to do with the fact that musicals are intense and the director can't afford to have someone who flakes out so they tend to favor tried-and-true singers.   The good news is, you can do this easily! Like /u/ghoti023 says, you can be in the chorus even if you don't get a lead. You can also tech the show (they almost never turn down stage hands, and knowing the technical elements helps a lot when you're on stage). You can volunteer to usher or sell tickets for the show. You can be a rehearsal note-taker. If you show initiative and dedication, you will have a big step up.   Vocally, now is probably a good time to get some form of instruction. Of course, lessons are best (if I recall correctly, the leads in my high school's productions all had lessons), but even just staying after school with the choir director to do some quick exercises would be helpful. The biggest thing you'll want to do is have some audition excerpts ready, so talk with someone knowledgeable about choosing the right piece for you and polishing it for an audition.   Also, work on acting and dancing at the same time. All three are useful skills for musical theatre and also can help you make connections and be more competitive. You don't need to be a triple threat (someone who is good at singing, acting, and dancing), but realistically you need to be at least decent in all three areas and pretty good in at least two. So taking a dance class or acting workshop would also be helpful (and maybe easier to find that voice lessons, depending on your area).   Good luck! Musical theatre is loads of fun, and I'm glad you're interested in it. If you get a chance, you might also like to stop by the next time musical theatre comes up in our weekly genre threads. That might be a good place to talk with more musical theatre people."

I'm a high soprano as well and may be able to help you find a piece, but I'm mostly familiar with classical and some musical theatre, so if those aren't genres you're comfortable singing then I'll be less helpful.

singing,38ukmd,keakealani,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I was in a lot of different groups in high school so I have experience with pop, musical theater, classical, jazz, folk, R&B, and more. I am comfortable singing in almost any language but I think the piece I do for this audition should be in English.   There are a bunch of different groups I'm auditioning for, but the main ones I'm interested do a mix of pop, folk, and R&B.  I will not have a live accompanist, I'll be totally solo but they can play a starting pitch for me if I need it.  I have the whole summer to learn the piece. To get a feel for my strengths and experience, my favorite things to sing are from Phantom of the Opera (and I'm thinking of using one of those songs to audition with but I'm trying to think of other options too/more upbeat options) and a lot of the things I've sung in performances in the past have been musical theater and pop. One of my other favorite songs I've performed was Green Finch and Linnet Bird, but again that's sort of a dark piece and I'd like something a little more fun.  I just started with a new voice coach and she had me starting with Part of Your World from the Little Mermaid, Castle on a Cloud from Les Miserables, Sort of by Ingrid Michaelson, etc.   If you have good musical theater suggestions I would love to hear them! Thank you so so much!"
singing,38ukmd,keakealani,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Yeah, I actually thought of ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird"" as a good option, although I can understand wanting something more upbeat.   I also think ""Popular"" from Wicked could be a nice choice. It's pretty popular (har har) which can be a positive because it's recognizeable or a negative because it's not a very original choice. But, it's a fantastic character song and I think it shows off a pretty wide range and a good sense of singing.   I would also look into some of the older musical theatre stuff. Something like ""I could have danced all night"" from My Fair Lady is pretty upbeat and fun, and there is a (somewhat) high note at the end so you could try to excerpt from there to show off your high range. ""Poor Wandering One"" from Pirates of Penzance is another pretty common song for sopranos, although it's more lyrical. ""Rosa's Confession"" from The Mystery of Edwin Drood is another nice one. It's more of a fast patter song and it is quite dark, but since it's fast it still has a different feel than Linnet Bird.   Also, I use the song list from these anthologies as a good starting point for finding music when I'm stuck. So if my suggestions don't suit your fancy, maybe something else will pop up? This company also makes books with 16- or 32- bar cuts for auditions, so that's something to look into once you decide. :)"

A lot of times you can get away with fun pop songs, but some groups will look down on that and will prefer more strictly classical or jazz pieces.  I'd find something by Beyonce. Her music is flashy and fun, and generally covers a wide enough range of notes to be a good technical showcase."
singing,38plcn,metroK,5,Fri Jun 5 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, the highs used to always come from my throat which hurt a bit. Screaming (and singing) should never hurt. What helped me with my highs (and I'm not particularly good at them to begin with) was learning to sing or resonate in my throat better by adding a sort of rasp. A really good example of what I'm talking about is Breakdown The Walls by Asking Alexandria. Pay attention to how he sings ""close your eyes"" the second time in the first verse and ""we carry our torches high"" in the second verse. The words I italicized, the way he sings those is how you want to get the crackle in high screams. Your screams will gradually become more powerful as you practice them, when you first start practicing them scream lightly. It's not bad to sort of whisper scream at first just to get a feel for how the air should be coming out. Once you're comfortable with that slowly increase the volume. Another thing that really helps is starting with words that you need to open your mouth real big for like ""yeaa""."
singing,38plcn,Ms_Carry,2,Fri Jun 5 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Probably using some sort of false chord/grunt scream. These use a lot of air and very little resistance since the true vocal chords are more or less open whilst the false chords above are brought together heavily causing the distortion. The fact that your true chords are used very little and not much subglottal pressure is able to build up means that the scream will feel very airy and unlike singing.   A better thing to do is learn fry screaming. The name is a bit of a misnomer, since vocal fry actually has no role in this type of screaming when done properly (though it is often used to create a similar sound at lower volume levels for exercise purposes). In this technique, the true vocal cords remain closed, as in regular singing. They are then brought together a little more (increasing airflow resistance) and the false chords are simultaneously closed above them, adding heavy distortion onto a clean note. The distortion becomes so great that the pitch of the note becomes indistinct, but it is still there. The good thing about this technique is that it is much more similar to singing and in fact works as an extension of it. By varying the amount of false chord closure above the true chords, you can achieve a whole spectrum of distorted tones ranging to slightly raspy singing to full on screams. And since the vocal cords are closed, air passes through much more slowly, allowing you to better utilise your breath support/diaphragm as well as hold out the scream for longer.  All vocal techniques, harsh or otherwise, should never hurt. If they do, it's a sign that you need to continue to refine your technique until they do.  To get started with fry, I'd recommend Andrew Southworth's youtube videos. He has made several on this subject, but here is one of the most informational ones. http://youtu.be/sTX4wsUZcyo"

singing,38qj8q,Entershakira,5,Fri Jun 5 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"It's a tough balance for sure. First of all, record yourself so you can hear what others hear. Second, try plugging your nose while vocalizing on different vowels. If it distorts the sound your placement is too nasal."
singing,38qj8q,FallJacket,3,Sat Jun 6 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Well, definitely don't do anything that hurts! That's definitely not going to be right.   I definitely agree with /u/FallJacket - recording would be really helpful in this case. Remember that we physically cannot hear ourselves ""from the outside"" because we're hearing our voices through muscle and bone conductivity and not through the air like an audience would. So as much as possible, don't rely on what you hear, but instead what you feel and external feedback like recordings or your teacher.   Which reminds me. You don't mention whether or not you're studying with a teacher, but this is definitely a case where I'd recommend it. This is a really complex problem and I think you would benefit a lot from lessons if you're not already doing that. A teacher can help you by giving immediate feedback as you try different things to balance your sound.   Besides that, I do want to comment that typically, ""singing too back"" and ""singing too nasally"" are polar opposites - one indicates too much pharyngeal space and one indicates not enough (via a depressed soft palate). So I would definitely check on which problem you're actually having, as it's pretty difficult (although not impossible) to have both issues at once.   A good way to test for nasality is to sing once normally (use a recording for this) and then to sing again while holding your nose). If you notice a big difference in sound, it's because of nasality. But some people mistake other issues for nasality (particularly if they're just commenters on Reddit or something - not everyone here is a trained vocal pedagogue). So be sure you're actually talking about nasality and not just a really bright tone or something like that.   Once you're established your problem, I think the first thing to tackle is vowel. Often, just correcting messy vowels can correct timbre issues because they force you to readjust the space in your vocal tract. Work on connecting all your vowels into a middle, neutral space. Recall your vowel trapezoid - make sure you're actually positioning the vowels in the right place. I also had a teacher tell me to balance vowels toward the middle (horizontally) in order to avoid sharp distances in timbre. This may help you, too.   In addition, make sure you're breathing with the space you want to sing in. A common problem is breathing in the wrong space and then trying to adjust the vowel after you start phonating. Not only is this much more difficult, but it just doesn't sound good. Make sure you inhale deliberately and focus on the space you want to use for singing."
singing,38qj8q,keakealani,2,Sat Jun 6 02:50:44 2015 UTC,"Nasal singing is super comfortable! I went a few years without voice lessons in my early 20's, and found a way to sing that I thought was awesome. Unfortunately, when I finally got back into lessons, I realized that I'd been singing completely nasally.   Singing too ""back"" can feel pretty good, because when you're too far back, your resonance is usually lower, and closer to where the vibrations can clearly get to your own ears. It sounds great inside; it sounds muffled outside.   Search for pictures of the pharynx, the nasopharynx especially. Get a sense of where it is in your head. Instead of trying to pull your voice back (to avoid nasality), aim it straight up. Make sure your jaw is loose and open. Record your efforts, to monitor the sound.  You might also need to work on raising your soft palate. I'll echo /u/keakalani in recommending that you work on this with your teacher (or find one if you don't have one, and make sure they are comfortable working with your issue).   We singers don't get to take the easiest path (nasality) or the one that sounds the best to us (too far back). We have to find the balance between forward and back, and take joy in producing a sound that sounds good out in the room. :-)"
singing,38ruek,ColdGirl,2,Sat Jun 6 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"I warm up every morning doing incredibly light exercises. The voice should always, always, always be warmed up very lightly before doing anything else. If you don't warm up from a small sound and gradually work your way up, your sound will not sound quite as solid, and you larynx will more likely work less efficiently.  I say warm up for a good 10-15 minutes doing light (and I can't stress ""light"" enough) exercises. Then, add more volume and see how it feels/sounds."
singing,38ruek,donutglaze123,2,Sat Jun 6 13:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the morning warmup takes the longest. In fact, normally my first practice session of the day is only warmups and exercises, and then I take a break and practice rep later.   So for the morning, I'll do around 15-20 min of exercises (strictly speaking, some of that is warming up and some is technique) and then 5-10 min of warmup before subsequent practice sessions.   Also, your mileage may vary - I think there are a lot of factors that can determine how much warming up is best."
singing,38r2tv,throwawaybaybae,2,Sat Jun 6 02:23:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, the breathing for woodwinds and for singing is completely different. If you think about it, the vibrating material in woodwinds (the reed) is WAY harder and less flexible than the vocal folds (which are really two flaps of flesh). As a result, you need way lower air pressure to sing than to play a woodwind, and many wind players severely overblow while singing.   This could be a cause of your lightheadedness - if you're using too much breath pressure, you are using up more air than you need, quickly. When you lose that much air, it can definitely lead to dizziness and lightheadedness.   You may want to try some of the standard breath visualization exercises like blowing a candle so it flickers but doesn't go out, or blowing on the horizontal edge of a piece of paper so it ripples lightly but not excessively. This can help you find the right balance of air pressure for singing."

Also, with falsetto you'll find that more breath support doesn't really translate into more volume, but with head voice it does.  Maybe it's confusing because most examples of head voice are from people using quite a strong mix, which is probably something you can't do right now. I think I've said it like 4 times this week, but to get these higher notes sounding consistent to your chest you need to use both the chest and head voice muscles at the same time. If you're anything like me then you will tend to use just your chest voice muscles to get that powerful meaty sound we're so used to, or we flip into a totally contrasting light sound for the higher notes with no middle ground.  I first learned how to combine the two at a low volume using sirens, and as I practice more I find that I can do it louder and louder, and my higher notes (e.g. above E4) sound better each day. I've been practicing this coordination for about a year now and I still have issues with slipping into my old ways, but I think I'm pretty close to having the muscle memory to sing at the volumes I want."

Before I started taking singing seriously I could only sing in chest or falsetto or a powerful head voice, and my midrange was shit, but I'm slowly improving my coordination to merge them together.  It entirely depends on the singer, and what they're singing. But most of the skilled ones are using a very good mix for everything, so their whole range sounds consistent."

After a while I got the hang of it, and if I then sang a note above my chest voice (e.g. F4), I found that I could use this same transition technique to get a decent sound above my chest voice. I then practiced this a lot more, and found I could then do sirens through my passaggio using that same kind of setup, and have no break.

Currently, I make my 'a's sound closer to ""ay"" and less like ""eh"" as I go up in range. 'O's sound more like ""oh"" instead of ""aw"", becoming ""heavier"" as I go up higher. Is this the right track or am I singing too hard?"
singing,38opfs,mrsrobinson1701,3,Fri Jun 5 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"Well, don't do that! =P but yes, breath support is one thing. Although it's more a common problem with guys, many women also have the issue of screaming high notes rather than singing them with support. Never sing higher than you can sing healthily.   Also, work on your whistle register. I don't exactly know why (especially because whistle register isn't well-understood by the scientific community), but it does seem to help build the top of the modal range by working through the top of the whistle. I would suspect it helps you with muscle configuration stuff.   Don't forget to modify vowels properly. Up above the staff, you'll increasingly have to open up to get vowels to sound up there. Adding a bit of /æ/ (as in ""cat"") tends to help me. My teacher also tells me to ""put a little smile inside"" to get the vertical space around the teeth. When you're singing above high C, nobody expects to hear clear vowels, so don't try. A good composer also won't write important text up there, because of that.   Also, be sure not to drag too much heavy/mixed voice up to the top. Although you probably want to connect the voice more than ""float"", it's important to keep things light and not just push those high notes out with too much breath pressure. Just ""let"" them come out, don't force them."
singing,38opfs,keakealani,2,Fri Jun 5 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"Adding to keakealani's answer, I would suggest working out, if you don't. High notes require a small stream of air at high pressure, and unless your trunk muscles (below collarbone and above pelvis) are incredibly strong, your larynx will grab on to muscles above the collarbone to hold back the air pressure it is getting. Also, the laryngeal muscles must be strong enough themselves to resist the air pressure of high notes, and laryngeal strength comes along with general, healthy voice training and repeated, efficient vocal cord closure.  Work out and practice high notes very lightly for now to ensure the larynx is working with its greatest efficiency in that area.  Very important: Do not consciously tense your core muscles for high notes! This will create too much air pressure and the larynx will not like that. If they are strong on their own, you will eventually, through constant training, call these muscles into play without really realizing it. Relax above the collarbone and the larynx will have no choice but to rely on the trunk of the body!"

singing,38nu7r,Notalp,4,Fri Jun 5 12:39:01 2015 UTC,A guess: You sing in chest voice with the attitude that your chest voice is 'thick' or 'heavy' or 'low'. Try reversing it.  Otherwise try playing around with your support?
singing,38nu7r,Masklin,3,Fri Jun 5 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"Could be a register thing, but it also could be the way you're hearing overtones. Chest voice naturally has a richer array of audible partials, and if those aren't in tune, the entire pitch can sound out of tune even though you're singing the right fundamental. (Also this may depend on what you're comparing to, since the timbre of chest voice can compete more with some instruments)."

singing,38nu7r,keakealani,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it may be the tuner, but I would think that the problem probably comes from a lack of support when using my chest register as Masklin pointed out above.  Anyway, thanks a lot for the help!"

singing,38mc6d,mdmccat,8,Fri Jun 5 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"Classical, from my understanding, is the best for learning any genre of music. Those fun pop riffs? Good practice for those comes from classical. Want to work on vibrato for pop or folk? Italian classical has good vowels to learn on. In my experience I've found that classical helps with fine tuning all the basics so you can move to other genres, or harder classical music if that's the direction you want to take. I'd equate it to learning all your basic beats for drumming."
singing,38mc6d,Ragstorichards,4,Fri Jun 5 03:46:41 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain extent, as long as your teacher helps you to bridge the gap between classical and pop styles. I've heard several classically trained people not sound good at all the minute they sound pop (of course, same for the reverse as well, so there's that). So make sure it's just the technique you're learning that you can apply in any style. Bring it up to your teacher, and make it clear you like those styles and that you'd like help with those. The fundamental technique should be the same though..."
singing,38mc6d,JayceCantor,6,Fri Jun 5 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yes...and no.   So the good thing about (most) classical teachers is they tend to be the most formally trained, just because the infrastructure is in place - most universities and conservatories teach classical singing as the foundation and it's just a style with so much history that a huge amount of literature is available.   So as a result, most classical teachers are very equipped to provide a solid foundation in singing - get the breath, resonance, diction, etc. in a good place.   But obviously singing in any style requires knowledge of that style, and an exclusively classical teacher won't necessarily know everything about style. (Notice I said ""exclusively classical"" - a lot of classical singers do know other styles).   This is also where the teacher/coach distinction comes in handy. You can supplement a teacher's lack of stylistic knowledge by working with a coach that has that knowledge. Your teacher can help you get there technically, and your coach can help tweak things to be more stylistic.   Also note that I say ""most"" - there are classical teachers that don't know a dang thing, and there are pop/rock teachers with excellent credentials and training. But as far as generalizations go, it's a place to start."
singing,38mc6d,keakealani,3,Fri Jun 5 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"If the teacher is good, it will help. 90% of what you will learn is really ""style independent""--you're learning how to control your body much better than before, and that will help you in any style.   Think of it like learning ballet and then being able to more quickly pick up most other styles of dance. Are you actually going on point? No. Does having well developed musculature, infinitely more precision, and a great sense of balance help with other dance styles? Absolutely."
singing,38mc6d,mwb2,2,Sat Jun 6 12:46:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely. My teacher is classical as well, and learning from her has vastly improved my clarity in tone, my vowels, my vibrato, my diction, my trills, you name it. Learning from a classical singer will give you very good base techniques to build on that allow you to sing other styles more skillfully."

And even though I struggled a lot, and I wanted to give it all up, it really helped me in the long run. My range got a lot better (I don't like my headvoice, but I can at least sing in it, which is a must in some songs), they helped with tension and breath control. My third teacher was into jazz and musical theatre (musical theatre being my specialty), and I don't think her lessons would have helped me so much if I hadn't already covered ""the basics"" with my classical teachers. They just were a lot better with base techniques than my 3rd teacher. I did not see that at the time (I was 16-18), but I totally get it now. BUT it's important to have a good communication, so that your teacher doesn't completely ignore ""your"" style. So talk to her/him about your style and how to incorporate ""classical"" techniques into your style."

singing,38mwww,njvsvalhalla,5,Fri Jun 5 06:33:43 2015 UTC,"You're right that this is asked too many times... There's like 3 or 4 posts on the front page alone that ask about range, plus several posts in the FAQ that talk about it.   The short answer is....don't worry about range. Trying to stretch your range before solidifying your foundational technique is one of the easiest ways to hurt yourself, and in general I would tread carefully.   The longer answer is that range is mostly a function of two things: breath support and registration. Without proper breath support and appropriate register balance, you'll experience cracks or loss in range.   You are also quite young, and since the voice doesn't fully mature until the late 20s/early 30s or so, there's an element of just letting your voice develop naturally. If your breath and registration is in place, you should see a pretty good total range.   It's also really important to note that voice types are a thing. While I'm not a supporter of rigid classification (or indeed, classifying at all for younger or less experienced voices), the fact of the matter is, every voice is physiologically unique and you should never try to sing something just because someone else sings it. Frankly, there are going to be pieces that are inappropriate for every voice type, and pieces that fit like a glove. Try not to attach yourself to pieces that you can't healthily sing.   Anyway, I'd encourage you to go back and read some of the posts about range here, but I just want to stress that range isn't everything. Most people would rather hear an average sized range with fantastic sound than a huge range that sounds terrible."

singing,38lhru,LordNode,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:28:18 2015 UTC,"Breath support is controlling the airflow, and right now you're not using enough to reach those high notes, so you're compensating by compressing more. I recommend you practice these notes at a low intensity and with a low amount of mix (i.e. a head tone), and gradually experiment with increased intensity (more air), and increased mix (more chest voice muscles). Eventually you should get a feel for the right balance to sing the way you want for a particular note."

Also, you shouldn't compare your single unedited take to their highly edited professional studio recording with multiple takes for each part. If you listen to Bono doing it live, it sounds pretty crap IMO.  The biggest issue I notice with your version is that you seem to shy away from the high notes (e.g. 1:42), and they're pretty inconsistent. Your transition at 1:15 was almost perfect, and I think it sounds better than the original, but all the others seem to dip in volume too much as you transition, or lack power at the peak.

This will help you with tone, range, pitch, and also holding those higher notes which you seem a bit shaky on, also provides a good base to work on enunciation.   also i reckon it'd be worth lip trilling through the song in pitch, that'll help pitching.

Performance tips;   Work on phrasing, and when to breathe during phrases eg; first 20 seconds should be one phrase, but you're breathing is good for this bit.  though at T:34 'happily i was mistaken' do NOT breathe here please, sneak one in after mistaken, or definitely after 'Joanna'.   -nb, with phrasing, you're singing a story, learn what the song's about and what emotions tie into it as well. write lines over where the phrases begin and end (some of them can be quite long, some can be quite short, you can also have small phrases within a bigger phrase. it's kind of like writing a story, you have the story, the paragraphs, and the sentences.)   at 40 'I'll steal you...' you come in a little early imo. make sure you finish up the last phrase as well, and begin anew here also. lead into 'steal' with 'i'll'   this can be a really beautiful moment here. (as rapey as it sounds lol) Enunciation on words sounding like 'air' be careful you don't go too much into 'err'  if that makes sense, might sound a bit muffled and hampers projection. be careful with singing 'a's so they don't get too nasally or chesty.  at 1:00 with 'at' and 'dark' try not to (for lack of better word) spit them out, use less 't' in your tongue if you can, unless that's the style you're after (this bit's purely opinion) a bit too heavy on 'dark' at 1:06 too.   in regards to you wondering about how 'i feel you' sounds to you, i quite like how you sing your 'e's   though you have to be careful at how you're shaping the vowel throughout the sustained notes. try to have the, this is quite hard to explain without demonstrating lol, but anyways, try to pronounce feel like 'ffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal'     rather than 'feeeeeeeeaaaaaaalll'  (if this make sense) have the constants short at the end, and don't change the sustained vowel too much if you can (unless it sounds good to do so) here's kind of an example of it  hope this is helpful :) keep on singin dude"

Try singing it very slowly, note by note, on your own. You may notice that it bears very little resemblance to the tune. But that it still sounds ok, because your timbre is very agreeable, and you are slotting your voice into any nearby notes which seem to fit. I am baffled.

singing,38lhru,temporarysteve,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"There are lots of ways to improve from your position. I think, if you can afford it, a few singing lessons would be useful. Or team up with a friend, and have them listen to you singing (slowly) and correct you. Or if you can't get either, get into the habit of singing ""a capella"" (alone) to yourself - slowly.  I suspect you've been singing along to karaoke a lot - is that right -?? So while it feels good, you don't actually hear yourself too well. So it all goes under the radar.  Also, learn how to sing scales, and practice them every day, a few days a week, or whenever. You could look up scales on youtube. And whatever your favourite songs are, quietly and carefully, listening over and over to the original singer, then trying to get the notes right. These basics will give you what you need."

I was just skyping with an old friend the other night and she said it took her 3 years of doing choir before she felt comfortable doing a solo. She also said it probably wouldn't take me that long as i'm doing private lessons, not group lessons. It takes awhile, but the feeling of progress is worth it."

Work on the verses it seems like talking instead of singing in some parts and could be going off pitch ( could be the style about the talking but keep it on pitch), on chorus work on better support for ""hand"" and ""under-STAND"" notes to give them more power, for some reason it gives the impression that you are reaching in those notes. Keep working you got a good base to grow from."

The hard palate is especially used in creating resonance (particularly in head voice), so it makes perfectly logical sense that you'd have trouble switching gears.  However- lots of people have a hard time switching from chest to head, especially if they haven't ever been particularly trained outside of the ""doing it for fun"" level. Getting your vocal folds to smoothly transition from one to the other (in addition to resonance) is a tricky thing to master. If you glance down the past week or so's posts, you'll notice that the switch from chest to head is a pretty common topic around here, because it's one of the most challenging things to overcome. So while your hard palate may be an issue, I wouldn't count it as the only issue."

Anyways,  a giant bulge in your mouth can easily  cause problems,  but if that were the case,  you'd also probably have issues with speech.    How night is yours?  Some looked like minor dents, and others look bigger than a thumb joint.  If can sing with gum in my mouth,  mimicking  a small growth there,  but obviously  as it gets bigger it would case more issues.   Most likely,  barring a huge growth there,  it's an issue of technique.  Try humming up on an ""ng""  sound.  If you still feel like you have trouble singing through your head voice with little tension,  it's technique.  If you don't have trouble it could is probably technique  though,  since pretty much every single person has that problem.   Also are you a guy or a girl?   Also can you whistle?  Whistling is like all mouth resonance.  If you can whistle,  than that likely means any distortion by the tori is not huge,  and you can still get a clean sound through your mouth. If you can't whistle,  well that could easily be the result of a lot of other things unrelated to the tori."

Not sure what the situation is like on your side of the pond, but here in Canada there are lots of places where you can rent sound gear for a day or weekend, and it's usually pretty cheap. Also, a lot of venues might already have basic sound equipment, so some of your gigs might not require you to bring much of anything.  Are you performing solo or with a band?"

If it was a good while, those things should come back again pretty swiftly with regular practice!  The point of a chorus is that unless you're a soloist, you shouldn't be going all out, so just don't! Hahaha. Most people can go a few hours in a chorus as long as they don't exert themselves. Make sure you bring water with you, and if the director doesn't warm up at the start of practice (which he really should!), make absolutely sure that you warm up beforehand!   Avoid smoking and drinking too much at the weekly rager. Get plenty of sleep, which I know can be a hard thing to get in uni haha. Also cardio is life. Like /u/pelneem recommended, jogging is really good for you. Other exercises that can do you a lot of good are swimming and planking. Good luck!"

I spent two years off from school where I sang much less than normal, and it came back within a couple months of resuming school and practicing regularly.   Be sure to vocalize a little bit every single day. Doesn't have to be a big practice session, but just touch your top and bottom, do a few lip trills and vocalises, and just keep your toes in the water.   Also, remember you got into this group because they like how you sound now. Just roll with that and try not to put unrealistic expectations on yourself. Singing should be fun!"

(Disclaimer: The Baritone Curse is not limited to Baritones)  By full voice, are you referring to your chest voice, or your modal voice in general?  If you're talking about your chest voice, I'd recommend working with your teacher (or finding one, I think you probably just graduated haha) on your head voice. I'd also definitely suggest not going so high in full voice that you're simply shouting on pitch, which most, if not all, male singers have been frequently guilty of at some point in their singing career. hahaha  The key to ease-of-access in your upper extension is increasing your comfortability in your regular range, I believe. Working with head voice and chest voice separately will also allow you to have more control with how you mix, though some amount of mixed voice is almost always present at any point in your range.  My brain is kind of fried right now, so I'm having trouble gathering my mind, but please ask if you have questions! If I think of anything else, I'll add it. :)"

Not head voice, or vocal fry, or any mix.  The style I would typically be singing is various metal genres, so I guess I'm looking for a healthy type of shouting haha. But I have found that even doing simple exercises using my full range, makes my low notes clearer and my high notes freer.   Will improving my head voice really affect my modal range that much?"

They are supposed to help you warm up, and you seem to be doing just that with them! Working as intended, I'd say, hahaha.  Yep! Your head voice is actually part of your modal range! (Chest voice + head voice = modal voice)  If you're doing lots of different genres, I'd also recommend looking into getting used to your falsetto, as well as ""reinforced falsetto."" Lots of screamers use this, and it's waaay healthier than screeching so high in modal that you rip your vocal chords in half. Hahaha  Good luck with everything! :)"

Of course, there are exceptions, even though you would probably not naturally speak just in head or chest voice, just because of how strange it would feel for casual speaking."

It's often around C3  for most guys.  Bottom sixth for me would be around C#2 to F2.  I dip down there a bit,  but speaking down there for even half the time would seem extremely  low.  So maybe that bottom sixth should have the average pitch be around a third way through your range."

I only have falsetto for my head voice and can't sing too high before I sound too immature, yet other tenors have no problems. And even if some low voices have mismatched registers, a lot of the time it's not mismatched registers with low voices but rather too much natural weight in the middle register, which is a DIFFERENT problem completely.

Singing is a lot like dancing in that everyone can learn how to do it, but everyone starts out with different levels of talent.  Those with less talent just have to work harder than those for whom singing comes more naturally. How you turn out when all is said and done may have nothing to do with your talent starting off.  I've known plenty of talented young people who weren't willing to put in the work and so never amounted to anything while some who were less talented became wonderful singers because they put the time and effort in to become good.

Not today, several  years ago. I had always assumed that almost anybody can learn to sing, given good instruction and sufficient practice.  He told me that he has encountered a number of students who could not learn to sing, because they could not match pitch with a piano or another singer, could not sing a simple tune recognizably, could not reliably tell whether one note was higher or lower in pitch than another, and so on. This was after abundant practice. This problem is traditionally called ""tone deafness,"" though other expressions also apply. Some of these ""tone deaf"" students were actually young music majors in college.  If you play a piano or some other instrument where you can push a button to produce the desired pitch, and practice a lot, and don't try to sing, you might actually get admitted to a college music program before your musical limitations are recognized.

Certainly, passing aural skills (a required class for any music major at a NASM accredited school in the U.S. And most comparable schools internationally) would be impossible, so this would be restricted to incoming freshmen, and not indicative of music as a whole. In addition, although an excellent grasp of pitch is marginally less necessary for fixed-pitch instruments like piano and woodwinds (to an extent), it is pretty necessary to perform at a high enough level to be admitted to a collegiate-level music program.

With that in mind, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, who is you.  For you, I think you'd be dissapointed in yourself down the road if you never tried. Practice with YouTube karaokes and just sing for fun and self enjoyment before taking lessons. I'm no expert, just talking from personal experience, lessons can be expensive unless you have a good flow of cash. Don't waste your time there until you figure out pitch, key, style, etc. Use the free online lessons until you find your voice appealing.

singing,38enz8,CobraCommanderVII,5,Wed Jun 3 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, you're right. Also, OP, even if you could only sing F, it isn't true that most women can sing lower than that. A lot of women have problems with F (or G). You sound like a straight-up tenor and you'll probably have a wonderful range when your voice settles. I'm not sure if the other comments were from people who listened to your video, but to me you don't sound like a kid or a male soprano or anything like that."
singing,38enz8,badcomposer,0,Wed Jun 3 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"I definitley did not hit a D3, I cannot go that low. The lowest I can hit is an F3. That is why I raised the key of the song. I use C4 as middle C."
singing,38enz8,CobraCommanderVII,4,Wed Jun 3 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"I just put it through my vocal tuner and it was definitely either a D3 or Db3, I think your ear is off. And I definitely think there's no way you have a D5 in chest voice unless you're screaming and hurting yourself. From your clip, I don't think you even went any higher than maybe a D4 in full voice, and your falsetto didn't go past B4. You sound like either a light baritone or tenor to me, but I really have a hard time believing you can full voice 5th octave notes and that you have an A6 in falsetto, because that is extremely high even for sopranos."
singing,38enz8,CobraCommanderVII,0,Wed Jun 3 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Something has to be wrong. I have vocal lessons, I am currently workin on that song, we have to increase the key by +2 because it is too low. When I sing along with the actual vocalist, I cannot match her pitch when she sings the verses. I can hit a D5. I haven't got perfect pitch but that is definite. I have a piano myself and I can hit that without pain. The A6 is also true. When I sing at middle C and scale downwards, I get to around F3/F# and struggle and switch to vocal fry. The A6 isn't head voice, it is a really breathy falsetto. I am really confused. If you wish, I will record myself trying to hit that F3 I tomorrow."
singing,38enz8,koiboyy,4,Wed Jun 3 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely a D3, no question. When I first tried to pitch my range when I first started, I put my comfortable range at B2-C5. Turns out it was actually more like G2-E4 at that point. I followed along with a piano doing that too. Often, the way you hear yourself can trick you. If you have a teacher and their trustworthy, then just listen to what they say. But the way you sing that Adele song is not even close to a few keys up form her. Listening to the song, you are singing it very much down from what I can hear. Maybe there's a male version that you had that got raised, but compared to Adele you are very low, and it is quite obvious listening to both side by side. For reference, her first note on ""Round"" is F4, while yours is Bb3. Go ahead and record yourself going up and down the scales, I'll listen to it and try and give my opinion on what's going on with your voice."
singing,38enz8,ghoti023,2,Wed Jun 3 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"You raise the key +2 because the song feels too low for you, but that is when you are already singing one octave lower than Adele. So in reality you are also lowering the key by a lot, but raising it by 2 is easier than lowering it by like 10. And nobody wants to hear instrumentations done that low anyways.   Which numbering system as you using, to clarify? Middle C for a male for the more common system is a C4 (within most male tessitura range)."

singing,38enz8,Pokebunny,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:33:15 2015 UTC,I think your vocal coach might be wrong in this instance. Your acapella scale video and Adele video show that you're singing in an octave that most baritones sing in (around an A2-F4). Try to ask your teacher what octave he places middle C in the next time you go to practice.

Your voice has define  mostly  dropped, but still could have a to go,  who knows since you are 15. Your recording is about a fifth lower than her recording and both 16 second and 56 second sound like about a D3.  On top of that,  you never  really got much above middle C(C4) (260 or so hz) in that recording in chest voice. Maybe your got about a D4, but not much higher.   Honestly changing the key doesn't do much to change the impression,  it's more changing the key to fit the voice  similarly. But you seem to be singing BELOW  Adele,  although you may quite reasonably have to raise the key,  you are still singing lower than her.   Also if you are taking lessons,  what does your teacher think of your ""lack of low range""?

Also in the original, the dudududoos in chest are F4 , then the yeahs go up to a Bb4.

I'm an experienced tenor in both choir and a cappella music, and have experience arranging/writing music...  I used this video as a reference:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n27WhyA_2tU&feature=youtu.be  The piano note that you played is C4, or middle C. However, you sing a C3, an octave below that, and then go down from there to F2. F2 is about the lowest that I can hit as well, and while my low range is poor, a tenor 1 will never have to sing that low. Realistically in most music a tenor 1 will never sing below a C3.   Your high range is not nearly as good as you think, you're stopping at a D4 and you sound like you are already cracking, which pretty much any decent baritone can do comfortably and even plenty of basses. Your upper notes will mature and you will learn how to control them as you get older, I didn't really understand how to utilize my upper range chest voice until I was 17-18. Now I can legitimately hit a C/D5 during warmups (though it doesn't sound pretty) and have sung as high as A4 in full voice in performance. My falsetto goes up to about B5 or C6.  Your current range is a pretty normal male vocal range, somewhere in the baritone-tenor 2 range. Give it a couple years and you will understand how to utilize your high notes better, you see very very few real T1s before college.  Edit: I checked your Adele cover video and you are actually singing nearly an octave below the original recording (I think about a sixth down). So you are just misunderstanding octaves.

Your voice is still in the beginnings of changing (yes, girls' voices change too) and you may just be experience an odd symptom of puberty.   That being said, I also postulate that you may have an underdeveloped head voice, which is very common. We speak in chest voice and most pop singers sing in chest voice, so many girls simply never learn to use head voice. Your low end isn't outrageously low (my low is normally around D-C#3 and I am a high soprano, so sitting a bit lower sounds reasonable) but the high end is right where a lot of girls start to need to use more head voice than they're used to.   That, plus just still being in the development phase are my best guesses."

Sure enough, his description of ""cover"" gives no precise and replicable characteristics for how to make this sound.  He then asserts that ""mix"" is different, before saying that they're actually ""mostly the same"".   He demonstrates a ""covered"" tone, noting its appropriateness for classical music, but sings something not at all approaching a professional ""covered"" classical tone.  Ironically, his ""mix"" tone at the end is much closer to a classical sound.  ""Voice Lessons to the World""  Please understand that Justin's usage of the terms ""falsetto"" and ""head voice"" is not at all the one standard usage.

singing,38akgv,mwb2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! So, are the terms falsetto and head voice used to denote the same (or similar) form of singing? Because my head voice/falsetto (if they can be used interchangeably) sounds just like the guy's in ""Voice Lessons to the World,"" I'm wondering if ""mixed voice"" is even possible. I've heard the idiom that, despite it's different registers, the voice is more or less a spectrum of adding or taking away tension to and from throat muscles (sorry for being kind of abstract), and that a ""mixed voice"" (if it even exists, which I'm not so sure about) is just a combination of the qualities of head/falsetto and chest. Just wanted some clarification so that I can know what exactly I should be looking for and practicing, or if I'm chasing something that might not exist. Thanks again!"
singing,38akgv,mwb2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:33:47 2015 UTC,"Very tough question to answer because the terms are not used consistently at all, unfortunately.   The two generally intended meanings of ""head voice"" are 1) falsetto, in some form; or 2) operatic-style high notes (aka CT dominant, for the vocal musculature people).  ""Falsetto"" tone is characterized by one main thing: incomplete closure of the vocal folds. They close along most of their length, but leave a little triangular hole at the back through which excess breath pressure can escape.  ""Head voice,"" when it doesn't denote falsetto, means that the vocal folds are stretched long and thin (completely unlike how they are when you speak and in ""chest"" register), but are fully closed along their length. (They're stretched by the cricothyroid, or CT, muscle. This just pulls down at the bottom of the thyroid cartilage, to which the front of the vocal folds are attached.)  ""Mixed"" voice, in either case, is truly what the name implies--a mix. It is not its own, special thing. Gradually, the chest voice function at the vocal folds gives way to the head voice function, and they gradually transition from one to the other. Great opera singers of yesteryear used to talk about being able to vary the amount of ""chest"" or ""head"" tone within a pitch, depending on the mood (i.e. ""I can sing this note with 60% chest and 40% head, or the reverse if I want to sound lighter"").  The voice can be blended to sound like a spectrum, but there are two, count 'em two, distinct ways of using them in ""modal"" (i.e. normal) voice: chest voice function (aka ""TA dominant"") and head voice function (aka ""CT dominant"").   Within this schema, falsetto is usually head voice function PLUS incompletely closed vocal folds; HOWEVER, it is possible (with practice) to sing falsetto (incomplete closure) well into the chest range. I can do it down to about C3. Again, it just means that even that low, there's a little gap at the back of my vocal folds where they don't completely close."

I can sing my falsetto down into my chest register notes, but only down to a G3 (My range being from D2 to G4 in chest), but what really interests me is singing higher. Like many up and coming (usually male) singers, I quickly found that pretty much any popular song sung by a male singer is just out of my range (the tenor high C to my Baritone high G). It can be disheartening to realize that that I would be incapable of singing and expressing the emotion of many of the songs I know and love without a couple more notes in my belt.   I'm not sure where, but I have heard the ""60% chest-40% head"" idea, but it seems difficult to emulate this considering the rigidity of the two main modal voices. If I were to learn how to sing ""mixed voice"" i.e. how to put a little falsetto into my chest singing, would I be able to sing higher, and would it be possible considering my age?

singing,38akgv,keakealani,3,Wed Jun 3 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the major problem is that the head and chest voice musculature opposes each other. The first hurdle is to teach the voice how to use the laryngeal and pharyngeal function, and then the trick is to strengthen the pharyngeal function enough that it will support the lower voice. The lower voice itself is already the heaviest musculature, so trying to work from the bottom up doesnt work.  Strengthening the head voice is the same with all voices, but specifically for bass/baritone, one problem can be psychological since the head voice is less separate sounding."

Choosing repertoire is key here - a lot of teachers mistakenly assign rep designed for more settled male voices, which can really screw with you when you're not at that point yet.   The cracking and range fluctuations are 100% normal. Annoying, yes, but normal. The best thing you can do is be flexible and go with the flow of your voice every day. Keep some rep in your pocket that sits higher for when the lower chest voice isn't cooperating, and some rep that sits lower to work on those new sounds. Do sirens that connect the voice throughout the range smoothly. And frankly just be prepared for a few days when your voice just won't cooperate.   I remember this time. I'm female, but my voice change was pretty rough for a girl. It might have its rough patches, but in the long run you'll appreciate singing through the change and getting to know all the quirks if your voice at a young age. Keep singing! :)"

While he takes singing more seriously than I have, he has a much larger chest range than I do. He doesn't at all have the problem I have which is only being able to sing up to C4 with my chest. I'd be very happy to have G4 as my chest high because I'd be able to sing any song I want really. I'm just wondering if this will change over time as my voice matures or if I will have to work at broadening my range in general instead."

She has a Master of Music in Singing Performance from the London College of Music, and a Bachelor of Music Education from the University of Queensland.  The app does not measure pitch as many apps do. Among the reasons you listed, Kim's method focuses more on developing your own ear, as opposed to the ability to make a note appear in the proper part of a screen.  My goal here is to open a dialogue with singers about a resource that they may potentially find useful in the continued development of their singing. I do indeed work for a company. But we are a company that exclusively makes products for singers, and we have long history of positive engagement with out the public, and that's why I'm here :)"

People can talk for many many hours a day, and good speech shouldn't tire this. Opera singers probably couldn't even fill a whole concert hall for  much more than an hour a day a time, but could sing in a choir for much much longer.   While you shouldn't feel significantly more strain or tension, it is inherently more stressful and demanding on your vocal cords."

However with proper technique it should be just as easy and relaxed as speaking."
singing,3860gq,thecontrakid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of those ""misspeak for simplicity"" issues. Objectively, yeah, singing isn't exactly ""stress free"" on your muscles. You are using them and they will get tired. This is also true with speaking. (And btw I don't love the idea of singing = speaking because most people have signs of disordered speaking that they shouldn't apply to singing.)  However, the point is that healthy singing is all about minimizing those stresses. It's about finding a way to let the breath do the work for you, and to avoid straining anything that can't stand up to that type of stress (like the throat and jaw muscles). And that should feel like very little ""work"" is going on although it's more that the work is centered elsewhere in your body.   Also, anything can theoretically lead to vocal damage. Julie Andrews is a good example who, for the most part, sang with pretty good technique but still got nodes (I think she pushed herself too much too young, but even so...) Although obviously you want to avoid risky singing behavior, you can't ever guarantee you won't hurt yourself."

singing,385cmj,Eboler,4,Mon Jun 1 23:38:19 2015 UTC,"There's a thread from just yesterday talking about this issue. TL;DR is that you can't really lower your voice substantially because there's a pretty finite amount you can thicken and relax your vocal folds.   I also want to point out that the male voice doesn't finish developing until the mid-late 20s for most people (sometimes even later) so you have literally 10+ years to go before you'll have a good feel for your mature voice's range. There's really no sense worrying about it now. This recent thread has more discussion if you're interested.   Edit: As far as voice type, here is a relevant article from the FAQ. But because of the aforementioned maturation process, I would strongly advise you not to get too caught up with voice type just yet."
singing,385cmj,keakealani,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Keeneland hits the nail on the head.    Added emphasis on voice type,  your voice still has many years of potential major changes  and unclear in which direction.  It's possible you could end up as a bass baritone or even tenor (almost every tenor can sing below C3). Lots of kids finish  the first major part of puberty thinking they have really nice low notes,  only to discover  they were not normal vocal production.  After years of singing,  knowing what how you sound in your low range and the rest of the range,  and how your voice moves through that range is how you determine voice type. By 20 or so you'll have a better idea,  but still too early  to pigeonhole with very high degree  of certainty.   Stick with what you  got.  Practice,  and focus near the middle of your voice,  less so the very bottom or very top nearly as much.  G3-G4 sound is more important  to have a handle on and discovering your voice type than singing a D5 or a D2."

Do not try to force it to happen because you can't do anything to help. I repeat: nothing you try to do will help you get a lower range. People (probably not here) will give you ridiculous advice about smoking and drinking to get a lower singing voice. Don't bother -- it won't work.  For range, it sounds like you're a bass-baritone but an actual bass-baritone already replied and he didn't assert that so maybe I shouldn't either. You could be an actual bass for all I know.

The overall effect is spoiled repeatedly, but could otherwise be quite enjoyable.  Since you play guitar, I suggest practising it word for word, and finding the correct note on the guitar, and trying to sing that. When you can hear a lot of small improvements (eg. 20-30), put it all back together and make another recording.  Repeat until good.  PS. Give yourself months, at least, to fix this. It is a gradual refinement of the muscular control, and the listening, together. Then go and wow some people in 6 months, or a year's time."

I personally haven't watched too many of his videos, but I'm a big anti-online-lessons person - so my opinion of that may not be too useful to you anyway.  The good thing I can say is that at least if you're looking for an online alternative, his videos are largely free as opposed to many others that are pretty expensive. So at least if you can't afford voice lessons, you're not paying a ton for something when you clearly do have the money for lessons.  It can't hurt to try for a while and see what you think for yourself. Yes the voice can be a delicate instrument, and yes you only have one, yada yada - but that doesn't mean there isn't good online content out there. I mean - we're all on this sub which is online content - and arguably less helpful because we're limited with typed words. Spending a month or two trying something out isn't* going to kill your voice for the rest of your life.   * Most likely."
singing,3835s9,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:22:00 2015 UTC,*Most Likely   That's what scares me. The thing is though that could happen with in-person lessons too can't it? What is it about in person lessons that automatically exempts them from the possibility of being faulty or fraudulent like everyone assumes online lessons are?
singing,3835s9,ghoti023,4,Mon Jun 1 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't automatically exempt them. Teachers are people too, and people make mistakes - or are simply bad at their jobs. Should you want, I could give you a laundry list of teachers I've had that did not work for me - and I'm sure a lot of people on this sub have horror stories they'd be willing to share too.  What makes them better than video lessons, is the immediate feedback. You can't properly hear yourself, or necessarily see yourself while singing. Also, since you're not a trained professional, if you could see (which obviously, you can. Mirrors. duh.) and hear yourself, you might not know what to be looking for that are red flag materials. A video won't/can't cover EVERYTHING that you could be doing wrong. You also might feel something differently than the person in the video is describing, and you would have no way of asking a question immediately. It's all the same reasons to hire a personal trainer as opposed to using other materials you can find. You'll get immediate feedback, and best of all it will be personalized to you and your body. These videos have a level of vagueness that they have to have in order to apply to the most people possible. For example, they'll tell you that you need forward resonance. Most people in the English speaking world need to work on forward resonance - but there are a good percentage of people who don't, and actually need to work on depth. You'd have no way to know that about yourself without some hard-earned research, whereas a teacher would be able to tell you right away sparing you a lot of hassle. Teachers (good ones) also can point out poor habits before they start based on small things. (My last voice lesson I was told I have tension where my neck meets my skull. WHAT. THAT'S SUCH A TINY THING TO NOTICE - and is also not what is normally considered in videos that address ""neck tension."")  The thing about self teaching is that you just don't know enough about the material to teach, and as with anything, knowing the material isn't the same as applying it. I could know everything there is to know about how to remove a kidney safely and transplant it into someone else, but even with all that book learnin', I'd be willing to bet that I'd mess it up if I weren't being supervised the first time.  BUT.  Don't let that stop you from looking at online sources and readings - just remain skeptical until it's proven. As I said, I'm really pro-teacher - but you'll also get the most out of your teacher if you've done your homework and can ask intelligent questions. Plus, most serious and irreversible damage to the voice is done over long periods of time, not a handful of months. You'll know if something is seriously wrong if you start losing your voice, feel strained, or pain. There's always exceptions to that, but - as I said - a teacher isn't really a sure-fire way of vocal safety necessarily either. Be knowledgeable and careful, not fearful."

singing,3835s9,keakealani,0,Mon Jun 1 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"In general, nothing I've seen is really that bad, although I'm also with /u/ghoti023 about not really supporting the online/self teaching model.   However, I think it's important to note that while a lot of people feel that using online tools will ""get a head start"" before they're able to start lessons, this isn't necessarily true. You are at risk of getting into bad habits due to misunderstanding or misapplying principles you hear in a video, which actually means your first few lessons could be spent undoing things rather than starting from scratch, actually putting you at a disadvantage.   This is something I can relate to since I came to voice lessons via choral singing. I had so many bad habits and it took years to really iron them out and get freedom into my voice. It's still a process I have to really think about as I continue singing.   This discussion might interest you, as far as online tools that differ from a teacher's style.  You may also have a hard time adjusting to the teaching style of your in-person teacher if you spend a lot of time using online materials, which by definition use a different model. This is particularly true about pacing - most adults and teens have a tendency to rush through material to ""learn as much as possible"" whereas in my experience most voice teachers spend more time building the foundation with seemingly basic exercises.   Then again, none of these are life-threatening or even really voice-threatening issues. I think there are other tools that can and should be developed with doing too much of the online voice stuff (diction, music theory, and aural skills, mostly), but I can't tell you how to use your time."

singing,381kx7,keakealani,9,Mon Jun 1 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really common problem. If you think about it, adding words really adds a lot of elements not normally present in exercises - you have to worry about more vowels and consonants, not to mention word inflection. Plus musical things like rhythm, more complex harmony, and tempo. It's not surprising that you're having a hard time with all of that!  What I would say, though, is to break down your music to make it more ""exercise like"". Practice just speaking the words in rhythm, but don't use any pitch (it might help to use a sing-songy voice to get a feel for singing it without caring about specific pitches). Sing just the pitches in neutral syllables, not worrying about words or rhythm. Sing the right vowels of the words, with no consonants. This can help ingrain various parts of the song into muscle memory, leaving you more mental resources to think about technique and performance.   Of course, you're right that you also have to find a way to deal with the psychological hangups. What do you do to be confident on stage as an actor? Maybe you can apply the same strategies to your singing."

I was being really hard on myself over it, to the point that I put off asking for advice because I was feeling ashamed and judging myself.  What helped me with acting was to find a technique I really liked that basically helped me focus so much on the character and the scene that I sort of forget I exist when I'm on stage.   I'm thinking breaking down the music like you suggested will likely have a similar result for me, plus help remind me that the sounds are things I'm capable of producing, if I just work consistently and hard enough at it.  Thank you so much! This is really helpful! I'm going to give this a try with a few songs I'm working on this week."

I like the idea of getting into character. I think that can help you a lot in this. If it helps, literally act the character of a confident, talented singer. It's kind of like the old adage ""fake it til you make it"". You will actually find that it feels more natural to be on stage and you'll perform better, even if deep inside you think it's a total lie. I've been singing for years and I constantly feel like a fraud on stage. But the good news is, nobody knows about it! Haha."
singing,380vif,godisuckatnames,16,Mon Jun 1 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason you need to sing a piece that uses your whole range? That's really unusual and any good choir director will also do the gamut of vocalises to determine your range.   In addition, it's important to note that ""range"" can mean many different things in context. I don't know how you're producing this range, but the way you sing is just as important as what you sing. If that low end is vocal fry (for example), it's not going to be useful from a choral perspective (most of the time), so it's not necessarily important to bring it into an audition. Choir directors have many criteria they'll use for voicing and the like, so try not to get caught up on just one criterion.   So on that note, I would say to choose music more based on what you can sing well and what shows off your technical facility the best. Because range is typically explored in other ways, it's not really the most useful way to choose audition repertoire.   In addition, your range isn't terribly unusual, except that you seem to have a bit of a lower extension. Music for choir typically doesn't go that low, so it's not that relevant in this setting. I would say it's very consistent with a bass or bass baritone, and that you should choose repertoire and transpositions with those voice types in mind."

The best thing you can do if you want to hit lower notes is age and get rid of as much tension as possible. Hitting the lower notes is all about freedom in your voice, and the thickness of your vocal chords is really going to be what limits how deep you can go.  Alternatively, you could become a heavy smoker, never get more than 3 hours of sleep, and get an adam's apple piercing with a string on it that you pull down whenever you want to go super low! /s"

singing,380i6n,maestro2005,6,Mon Jun 1 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"It's usually not possible to increase your range downward much.  Let's talk instruments for a moment--with pretty much every instrument except keyboard-type instruments with fixed ranges, the upper range is theoretically infinite and is determined by the skill of the player.  A violin can play all the way up its fingerboard with the notes getting closer and closer together and requiring more skill to play in tune, and then can be extended even further with harmonics.  But there's no way a violinist can play lower than open G (or whatever the lowest string is tuned to, if you use an alternate tuning).  It's not a matter of skill, it's just how the instrument works.  Same is true of all wind instruments, you simply can't play any lower than the fundamental frequency of the full length of the instrument.  Voice is kinda similar.  Your vocal folds can't relax any further than ""totally relaxed"", and so everyone has a hard bottom limit to their modal voice (it's a little fuzzier than with an instrument though, as it can fluctuate a bit with all sorts of conditions).  Since relaxing is not very hard, most people start out with access to the lowest notes they'll ever have, but some people will find a note or two because they unknowingly carry some tension that they learn to get rid of.  One way to sing lower is by mixing in vocal fry, but this is potentially dangerous so you should work with a qualified teacher (just messing around a bit isn't going to hurt though)."
singing,380i6n,Mattpilf,2,Sun May 31 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"I understand that the lower range is finite, I know I'll never be Avi Kaplan or any crazy bass like that (and I'd rather not be, I like being able to sing high and low!) but I asked this because I have gotten lower notes before, but I suppose they could have been one time things. I feel pretty relaxed down at the bottom, but when I'm making an attempt at those lowest depths, I certainly feel like I'm trying to swallow my larynx. So maybe I need to work on not doing that. Or just give up, but either way, thanks for your comment!"
singing,380i6n,godisuckatnames,3,Mon Jun 1 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with Maestro2005. Though I can plat a flute and octave below it's fundamental by covering up the end, but that's an absurd technicality.   Since men already speak with a chesty voice, there isn't much to develop. While you can keep relaxing your vocal cords, there's only so much that can be gained there. Think of what happens when you tune a guitar string down. It get lower AND softer. Complete relaxation means your cords are too slack to even make a sound. Approaching that line, you'll just get low notes without power.  Barring an abnormal male voice, like very feminine speech, or abnormal tension and vocal production in the low voice, there's not much you can do. Given that you have easy E2 and start bottoming out around there, it's unlikely you will strengthen much of anything down there while still keeping a clean sound.  To add,  while  everyone has days where you can hit an odd low note(you'll probably be able to hit a C2 sometime) you never hear people  have odd  loud low notes. You might hear of a baritone hitting a C2, but you never hear of those same Baritones talking how they could fill an room like a bass with an E2 on an odd day. Sure his E2 will be solid,  but it won't be that  loud,  and never will be."

singing,37zecd,Observes,5,Sun May 31 18:18:24 2015 UTC,"Does knowing your range matter?   Of course it does.  How else will you know whether something is too high or low for you or not?  You don't need to know your range exactly, because that kind of thing can vary over the course of even a single day, but you do need to know which parts of it sound good at which dynamics, etc.   Does knowing the difference between an A sharp or a C flat matter?   It does if you don't want to be a half step off.  If you want to sing with other people, also, then yeah, it matters.   Most importantly physiology, does it really make a difference knowing which chambers are resonating or which flaps and folds are at work in your throat?   This one matters less, but it still matters if you're going to sing with other people.  How are you going to coordinate styles if you have no idea what your style even is?   As long as someone can sing safely and well, do they have to know these terms and things?   Depends on what they're trying to do.  If they just want to sing for fun, nope, they don't have to.  They can sing badly if they want -- what's the matter with that?  I think we should all sing badly.  Or sing well, but that one's less important.  What's important is that we sing.  Way too many people ""don't sing"", whatever that means.  It's ridiculous.  EVERYONE sings, or at least they should.  Our culture loses when a person doesn't.  But if they want to sing in a musical performance with someone else, yeah, they need to know those terms.  How else are they going to communicate?  ""Hey, harmonize with me a fifth above.""  ""But... I don't know what a fifth is!""  ""OK, then, I guess we can't sing that song.  How about Hot Cross Buns; can you handle that?""  It's possible to be a very gifted singer who is also completely uneducated.  The great synagogue cantors of the 18th century, for example, were uneducated in music but were chosen because, even so, they could sing very well -- they were naturally extremely gifted.  If you're gifted enough to overcome a total lack of education, well, you may be able to be successful if you find some really patient musicians who do know their stuff and can guide you.  In a way, it's like being a blind marathon runner.  It can be done, if the person running with you tells you where to turn, where the potholes are, etc.  If you're not that naturally gifted, like most of us, you're really not doing yourself any favors by being uneducated."

It takes twice as long (at least) to do everything if you have to spend time demonstrating everything. Of course it's not impossible, but it is very frustrating and inefficient. And if you're talking about the professional music world, you're just not as marketable if you lack those skills. Why hire someone who has to learn everything by rote, when you can hire someone who can sightread everything in a fraction of the time?   I mean, there's a time and place for everything. I don't think anyone in this thread is advocating that every hobbyist singer needs to pass college music theory before singing in the shower, but I really do think if you lack basic knowledge, you are limiting opportunities for growth and performance."
singing,37zecd,keakealani,10,Tue Jun 2 00:08:54 2015 UTC,"I actually don't believe someone can really know what is healthy and what is going on technically if they don't have an even basic grasp of the physiology. It's pretty difficult to have good breathing habits if you think you're supposed to send air through the diaphragm and clench your abs to exhale. I don't think you have to have a PhD in voice science, but I do think a knowledge of basics is important for just knowing what to do.   Similarly, I think a basic knowledge of music theory is important for a musical performance. You can obviously sing notes and rhythms by ear, but there is a point where not having knowledge and vocabulary hurts your ability to make musical decisions and really interpret music. Again, not a super duper high level, but knowing the basics.   That said, there are many paths up the mountain. I don't think you necessarily have to take formal classes or get degrees to be knowledgeable in these areas, and I think a lot of people who claim to be ""untrained"" just got their knowledge from less traditional sources. That's great, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.   I also think it does depend on genre. Obviously, in classical music there is the most regimented and formalized style of training that definitely does require you to understand quite a bit of the ""technical"" stuff. Jazz is another genre that, though less strictly formalized, definitely has an expectation that musicians know certain idioms and terminology. Pop, by and large, does not have this history but does have its own idioms and ideas that should be honored by successful performers within that genre.   Finally, I think one thing that bothers me about this line of questioning (not saying you are doing this, just a general trend I've noticed) is that people are looking for excuses on how to take shortcuts and be lazy rather than learning all the tools at their disposal. It often comes with a distinctly anti-intellectual stance that ""self taught""/""non technical"" musicians are inherently more musical/genuine/better people than those who have studied music formally.   Not only do I find this line of reasoning personally offensive because I'm a university trained musician who values my formal training, but I think it is a highly prejudiced and hypocritical way of thinking that harms musicians in the long run. It often comes with misunderstandings about what constitutes fields like music theory and vocal pedagogy, as well as misunderstandings about how musicianship and performance work. As many folks here know, just liking to sing and ""feeling emotions"" does not make a good performer. It is based on skill and practice, and there is simply no shortcut to that end.   It's hypocritical because essentially most of these advocates say things like ""those elitists are trying to limit musical expression with their theory bullshit"", while often being the first people to claim that trained/classical musicians are ""not genuine"" or exclusionary, while classical/academic musicians are often the first to defend a broad understanding of music and to bring the study of pop and folk genres to a wider audience for study and appreciation."

singing,37zecd,keakealani,2,Sun May 31 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I definitely don't consider my training complete by any means! I started singing in choir when I was 8 and I started private lessons when I was 16. Took a couple years off and I'm now 25 and just finished my first year as a university voice major (I was previously composition so I was taking voice lessons but not as much and not as seriously). I'm terrible at math so I'll let you work that out =P   I think it's actually because of the time I spent in composition (and I actually originally enrolled as a theory major) that I've had to defend myself a lot as someone who really enjoys and values the more academic side of music. It's not that I don't enjoy the emotional side, but in my experience I gained more musically from the technical stuff than I did from the touchy-feely stuff. That's just me, of course."
singing,37zecd,zakraye,3,Sun May 31 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what you've written in both comments. I think that the only time knowing the ""more technical"" aspects of music becomes a problem is when you can't see the forest through the trees.  Also, a lot of aspects of music are very subjective. Personally my favorite singer is Freddie Mercury, but I'm sure there's some people out there who don't like his singing.  Also, I'd like to add that I don't think ""traditional"" is very important except in an historical context. I also think music academia does itself a disservice by focusing on non-contemporary sources (with the exception of computer music) because typically that's not what the majority of the public enjoys. This is just my opinion/observation but my middle/high school/college music courses were at best 20-30 years behind modern music.  I totally agree with you though that there's absolutely nothing wrong about wanting to go deeper into a subject you enjoy. I think going deeper is better honestly. It is interesting though how a lot of people who I would consider to be the ""best"" singers have very little ""formal classical"" training.  Ugh, I'm rambling again..."
singing,37zecd,keakealani,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"You're right that this is all incredibly subjective - I couldn't disagree with you more on the matters of taste in singers, but I think it's important to have the understanding and vocabulary to actually justify taste. There is a whole realm of aesthetics that seeks to explore the way we understand and appreciate music, and I personally find it to be a fascinating area of study. Whether or not any two people like the same music is irrelevant, but why those tastes differ is very relevant to any musician or artist.   I also think this is probably a matter of which school you attend, but my experiences are very different with regards to exploring contemporary music. Because I go to a smaller school, our theory classes are taught primarily by composers (an issue that is controversial amongst theorists and theory pedagogues, but that's a story for another day) and much of my study (particularly when I was a comp major) was focused on evaluating current trends and, of course, contributing our own musical ideas. We had some fantastic new music artists visit and perform, and our faculty are constantly premiering new works.   Obviously we study music history as well, but yes, there was quite a bit of focus on new trends and the importance of more modern ideas. I also disagree that tradition is unimportant. Tradition was, at one point, innovation, and it's through understanding the intents and context of those innovations that we can grow as a music community rather than constantly recreating the wheel. In my experience, musicians with an inadequate background in history and older trends tend to think they're being very avant-garde while often doing things that are very unoriginal and often lack impact artistically.   In addition, I think modern society places too much value on innovation for the sake of innovation rather than just doing what works. Older music can achieve many things, and I think it's important that older music stands side by side new music rather than relegating them to separate and unequal fields. They both contribute value to the musical idiom, and all contemporary eventually becomes old, so it does a disservice to all music to only be enjoyed in the short term."
singing,37zecd,mwb2,4,Mon Jun 1 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"It depends.   If you want to teach, you have to know these things.   If you want to teach yourself, you should know these things.  If you want to always pay others to teach you, you may not have to know these things. This is what plenty of famous pop singers do, and that's fine. But it's important to note that they may not know what they're doing, but they have someone around them behind the scenes all the time who does know. (There's actually a YouTube recording of Michael Jackson warming up by phone with his teacher, Seth Riggs.)   Theoretically, if you can sing safely and well naturally, and you can be sure you'll never fall into any bad habits, then you wouldn't need a teacher.  In practice, most famous popular singers get famous on the basis of talent, meaning they're doing lots of the right things right--but not everything. Most likely they are not singing completely healthily, which means any bad habits can easily start to grow until vocal injury becomes a danger.   (Many famous popular singers, it should be noted, had tons of training from an early age as well--you can bet Mickey Mouse Club kids and other child stars are keeping plenty of voice teachers in the black.)"
singing,37zecd,MadBismarck,2,Mon Jun 1 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what some people are saying here, I would say it's very important. Of course, the technical part is important for reading and writing music.  However, the psychological aspect of it is important for singing itself. Understanding the workings of your vocal instrument can keep you from damaging it. Additionally, there are some parts of your range that can only be accessed through trained technique."
singing,37zecd,temporarysteve,0,Mon Jun 1 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"No, they only have to sing. But quite a lot of people who sing or play ""by ear"" grow up wishing they could read music. They see other people doing it, and feel inferior and childish when they have to ask how the music goes. I've tutored a few like this, and they feel empowered and more grown-up about it when they finally know."

Not only did they examine the voice box and area , they did a speech evaluation too. All that cost  about $40 which is about a slightly high, but normal co-pay for my insurance.  Similarly voice therapy was about $40 per hour long session.   Also most ENT's aren't really useful for something like this and a GP is a no go. So I went to a regular ENT for tonsillitis. As soon as it seemed like my voice was acting funky, they sent me to a voice specialist. While they did a mirror larynx examine at the general ENT(and I think any ENT can do this), they are not really going to be able diagnose anything that's not obvious(which if you don't even have much problems, it's not likely obvious).   Are you a professional or planning on being professional? If so you'd probably wouldn't be thought of as a hypochondriac. Granted if the problem is something feels like a cut or like something is stuck there(if it's near the hyoid bone(a U shaped bone above your larynx around the throat), that can be caused by tension and some muscles not working with perfect technique, and still have a perfectly clean throat.  Definitely contact you insurance company about what is and isn't covered. You could be stuck with  big bill if they don't cover a test for whatever reason."

I love singing but right now it's more of a hobby that if money comes of it, great!  I guess I feel that if I get this test I'll magically understand more about my voice and what status it is right now. And maybe find a way to target whatever tension there is, or why I can't feel anything. I'm calling insurance tomorrow so I'll ask if any of this is covered."

I simply called the ENT departments of their hospital and said I need to see a voice specialist. All in all, yes it was an ENT, and at the same place as other non-voice specialist ENT's. I had a referral from another ENT, although IDK if that would be necessary, that would clearly depend on your insurance and stuff."
singing,380kj7,keakealani,2,Mon Jun 1 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"Costs (to you) are normally determined by your insurance situation.  An ENT isn't specifically a 'singing doctor'. Their specialty is in the anatomical mechanisms we use, but that doesn't mean they deal with the musical applications of that anatomy. They mostly deal with breathing, swallowing and ear problems. Going to see one without a legitimate problem will likely lead to them running back out the door to deal with other patients.  That being said, establishing a baseline of normal function for your voice is a good idea over the long term, as well as building the relationship with your ENT. Have questions ready to ask so you don't waste their time floundering to think something up on the spot."

You should be using registration as a tool for using your range in nuanced ways, dynamically speaking. And yes, a softer ending means you'll be looking at a slightly lighter registration. Nothing wrong with that!  That said, I like the metaphor that dynamics are about color, not volume. Much of what we perceive as different dynamically is more about the color of the voice, as well as the way we use resonance to either amplify or suppress certain sounds. Softer singing is mostly a matter of changing the color of your voice to ""feel"" softer to the audience. This can do with contrast between vowel and consonant articulation (a ""dramatically soft"" feel) or changing resonance (a more muted feel) or simply using a warmer or more gentle color.   Anyway, this might not be exactly what you want to hear, but I hope it's good food for thought.   Edit for spelling, sorry!"
singing,380ch5,keakealani,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:47:12 2015 UTC,"That is helpful. ""dramatically soft"" is exactly what I need for those high notes. it's all about control in that region of the voice.  if it's not a request you're constantly bombarded with, I'd also like help classifying my voice. past instructors were split down the middle."
singing,380ch5,keakealani,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"Well, as a general rule I'm not a big fan of voice classification - I think it's something that tends to cause more grief than help for most singers, myself included. Plus, I'm not experienced enough where I'd be comfortable trying to do that online - it really takes hearing someone in a lot of situations and I think the acoustic issues of recording could also be a problem.   That being said, my philosophy about voice type is that if you can sing (healthily and comfortably) 90% of the repertoire designed for a voice type, that's what you are (or at least a good working assumption). Ultimately that's what voice types are for - deciding what is appropriate to sing."
singing,37vr6b,LetThemEatWar32,16,Sat May 30 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"What are the qualifications of your teachers? You should NOT be losing your voice after every lesson. That indicates something very wrong is happening. I would be concerned that your teachers may be teaching something unhealthy - remember, not every teacher is created equal. Many people claim to be qualified voice teachers but have never trained formally in vocal pedagogy (the study of teaching singing), anatomy, and vocal health.   However, I would also raise concerns about a physiological problem. The conventional wisdom that ""everyone can sing"" is true, but there is a caveat that some rare physical conditions can restrict that. Typically these are neurological issues about pitch or things like cleft palate that prevent certain sounds, but it is possible that you have some sort of disorder that is preventing you from singing.   It could also be actual vocal damage. Vocal nodes and polyps can cause many of the issues you mention, as well, which also needs to be diagnosed by a doctor. So in short, either something is very wrong with how you're singing (which may be due to improper instruction) or due to a physical problem. But rest assured, it's not normal to lose your voice after every lesson and if you're able to get these issues under control I don't think there's anything stopping you from singing well."

To be fair to my teacher, I don't lose my voice in his lessons, only when I practise at home. I have no idea what I'm doing differently: obviously I make every effort to do as I've been told.  I had wondered if I might be suffering from some physical defect. I did make progress when I first started, but in past months I have really struggled with vocal health--constantly losing my voice, to the point that I avoid social situations to save my vocal cords.   I will book an appointment with a doctor. Thanks for the advice."

You may be doing something completely wrong which may end up damaging your voice longer term.  There shouldn't be any hoarseness. If there is, we stop.

singing,37vr6b,jaygreen88,2,Sun May 31 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well the most obvious thing to do is make sure you have strong diaphragm support when you're singing. When I lack that, I do tend to lose my voice.

Your cords do their best to resist being blown apart by the volume, but when there's too much, they will get strained.   Do you expand your lower ribs when you inhale, and try to keep them out as long as possible while you are singing? The feeling of support is sometimes more of resisting the ""wild rush of air,"" not of pushing air out (I only feel more of the out-flow at the top of my range).   There is a test for this (I've only read about it): Light a candle, and sing with your mouth close enough to blow out the candle flame. The flame shouldn't flicker from your breath, and it really shouldn't blow out. This means that you're only using the air necessary to make your cords (deep in your throat) vibrate, not blowing extra air.  Let me know if you try this; good luck!"

singing,37vr6b,HerkyJerky12,6,Sun May 31 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously, hope you like it cozy, cause we share the same boat.

There are better days that give me hope for what might be one day but most of the time, I could simply cry (and I've shared more than just a single tear).  You are so, so very not alone.   What keeps me motivated is one simple question: if someone told you to give up now, would you? Would your urge to sing suddenly be gone for good? Everything that has made you hold on for so long? If yes, then maybe take a break and reconsider this hobby.  If no,  then you have no choice but to keep on going and you'll have to find things to adjust.  Don't like your teacher? Try another one. My favourite teacher (till now) once told me that it's not ONE teacher to ""get you done"", but rather you pick up different things from different people over the journey of you building your voice.  If you don't think your current teacher suits your needs anymore, take the leed and be responsible for your progress .  BUT (!!) dont take this as a golden ticket to run away: singing is a skill that takes time to master and it's a progess. Often times we lose track of ourself within this very progress and get frustrated , so maybe try to work with recordings to keep your frustration in relation.   Dont let that current bad spot take away what you've worked for till now. Often, our expactations at ourselves are the bigger problem going on. Get aware of you goals, what do you want to achieve?  If youre planing on going pro, get a pro to give you honest feedback (but this might be tough). Want to sing for yourself? Then theres plenty of time left. Sing for fun?  Plenty of people sing awful and they're still having the time of their lives.   Get aware of you wishes, (get your voice issues checked!) and then go gettem!"

The answer's definitely no, but I am really scared of damaging my voice.   Also, don't you ever wonder what you could have achieved instead (the opportunity cost)? I sometimes think I am neglecting my natural talents in order to chase something that's really starting to look like a pipe dream.   But I will probably continue anyway. Even the slightest improvement thrills me, and I do love to sing. I just wish I could have been born into a body that wasn't so lousy at it."

It's not normal to lose ones voice after every lesson and I, too, would suggest to get this checked. Don't try to diagnose yourself. Have you told your teacher about this? And do you record yourself? If you don't get hoarse within the lessons, maybe it's something you're doing wrong when not supervised (e.g. singing too quietly/losing support/falling back into bad habits).   Also, don't you ever wonder what you could have achieved instead (the opportunity cost)?   Of course I do, because my lack of progress is actually quite tearing me down, but there will always be what if?'s, they're just not always useful. If you loved your ""natural talents"" or found such joy and passion within them, why did you stick with something you don't consider yourself talented in? Obviously you liked singing more even despite your negative perception of yourself (with this subject). Of course, maybe you could get better faster in something else, but you chose singing over this certain thing and have kept doing so all the way. There seems to be a passion that drew you to singing and not to $natural_talent. And further: you could still try $natural_talent and see how you like it.    I just wish I could have been born into a body that wasn't so lousy at it.     Were I not broke as fuck, I'd bet you a buck that you're not as aweful as you present yourself to be. It's great to be focussed on technical success and it's something to aim for, but don't forget the music on your way. Join a choir, form a band or start writing songs without thinking about technique (once you're in the clear with your issues) and get some passion back to the scale. I once wrote a parody of ""popular"" from wicked that was purely inspired by rage about my lack of talent .

Also, as others have stated, not all teachers are the same and some can even potentially be harmful.  I've had teachers where I made minimal progress, but having a good teacher even helped me navigate my physical issues.  My first good teacher actually helped me get properly diagnosed!  On giving up:  I feel like I struggled for years before I figured out the physical stuff.  Even after that, it took more years before I feel like I like my voice and how I use it.

singing,37xak5,Pokebow,3,Sun May 31 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"For your first question: consider yourself a baritone until further study. It's the middle of the range, and it's mostly located in the same area your speaking voice is (most likely). That doesn't mean you are a baritone, it just means you're not a trained singer, and that's what's the most comfortable for you right now. Don't put too heavy of an importance on voice type - it's really not as big of a deal as people make it out to be. But for the sake of looking for stuff to sing right now, baritone.  As for your second question - that's just going to take practice. Since you're new, you haven't trained your muscles to do what you want them to do yet. Just as if you were running a 100m sprint, you're probably not going to do so well when you first start out. Keep practicing and tuning your ear. I find that warm-ups and scales help me with my ear training usually more than singing songs, and it's less frustrating because then I can just focus on intonation, and not on how I'm fucking up the song in every other aspect.

I know it's confusing because there's so many terms in singing that aren't always used right, but the main difference between head voice and falsetto is that in falsetto your vocal cords aren't coming together, while in a full head voice they are.   Falsetto isn't useless by any means, it can be used as a stylistic choice, but it's not the same thing as full head voice."

I wouldn't recommend starting straight off the bat with rougher vocals until you've got a firmer grasp on the basics tbh - as those kinds of vocals can really fuck you up in the long run if they aren't done well. Granted, there are a lot of singers that don't give a damn, because the more fucked up their voice is, the rougher the sound they can achieve - so it's really up to you. Personally, I'd rather have the technique down so that the voice can do lots of stuff rather than be a one trick pony.  Also, check out the rest of the FAQ. There's tons of good shit in there."

singing,37w13h,marichipini,3,Sat May 30 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"TONGUE TENSION IS THE GODDAMN ABSOLUTE FUCKING WORST THING HOLY SHIT.  Anyway - your tongue tension is related to your pushing and breath control. When your breath isn't working well for you, other muscles in the singing mechanism jump in to help compensate. So while you're working on relieving your tension, don't neglect the breath - or your tension will just move to somewhere else. (Mine moved to where my neck meets my skull. BLECH.)  I fixed a lot of my tongue tension issues by singing with my tongue sticking straight out of my mouth - and over tensing it in the opposite direction singing on an ""ah."" After releasing that pull, I found that my tongue was a lot nicer to itself when I tried to sing normally.  The ol' ""Pencil under the tongue"" trick also helps with that too. You can also try massaging the base of your tongue under your chin as well. (Good and hard - this will also mess up your diction, but whatever - one thing at a time.)  I second /u/elerico's tip of singing on just vowels - or even just a singular vowel. The more crud you take out of the complexity level, the more you can focus on one thing. Find a vowel that works well for you and go from there, focusing on just what your tongue is feeling (and breath. Always breath)."
singing,37w13h,ghoti023,1 point,Sun May 31 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"After a couple of days with practice, I can say that it is definitely the tongue. I can feel it kinda...flatten out maybe? and tense up every so often. Its almost like I'm trying to forcefully expand my tongue or something. This is very hard to explain, anyways. Today I was able to do some of the easiest belting songs I know without feeling tight. But when I tried doing something just a little bit harder (damn me and my impatience) I could feel the tightness again. I think this might take some time..."
singing,37w13h,elerico,2,Mon Jun 1 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"Something I do that helps with tongue tension is to sing my arias just on the vowels. Not only does this help creating a nice, long, lyric line when you go back and add the consonants, you become really aware of your tongue's position. You no longer have your lips or teeth masking big tongue changes, so you start and end with a good, low, relaxed tongue.   Let me know if that helps! I have more exercises if that one doesn't work, but I use this technique regularly. Sometimes I'll just start on one closed vowel, just as [i] or [u], mostly for registration and placement. When my tongue was more stubborn than it is now, I would physically hold the tip just outside of my mouth, so there was no mistaking when I was pulling it back."

It's certainly not abnormal, and it doesn't mean you're singing incorrectly. I have plenty of friends that actually claim to have that sensation the entire time they're singing. It's mostly just a super forward resonance - that (at least in my voice) usually comes across as SUPER bright."
singing,37t7l3,ghoti023,1 point,Sun May 31 05:52:16 2015 UTC,"I have experienced this also, mostly when I place my voice really far forward in the mask.

singing,37sv0g,Girlprep,11,Sat May 30 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have serious reservations about a teacher who says things like that. It's not helpful (and borderline unprofessional) to put you down for things outside of your control.   Also, it takes a really long time for the voice to recover from illness. Like way after you feel better and stop having a fever or whatever, your voice can still feel the effects. I got sick in the beginning of May and I'm still feeling the end of it, almost a month later. That's just life. Be gentle with your voice and try not to get impatient (even if it's crazy hard to keep away from singing). Do all the good stuff like hydration, sleep, nasal rinses, and vitamins. That's really the best you can do to recover.   But that said, if you have a history of being sensitive to respiratory infections, I would strongly recommend working with a doctor about preventative measures and early intervention. Unfortunately, singing is wholly dependent on your respiratory system being healthy, so you will not be able to progress as quickly if you keep getting sick. Whether it means immunotherapy for allergies, rescue medication for asthma issues, an ongoing prescription for antibiotics, you will help your singing in the long run by minimizing illness.   All that said, yeah, it does take time to relearn after you've been sick or taken a break from singing. But it will come back, just go slow and care for your voice first."

However I just let myself get some rest, and get over what I was sick with, and then, when I'm singing again my voice will have changed dramatically usually for the better.

singing,37sipr,sparkleselite,8,Sat May 30 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"It would probably help to have a recording to diagnose the actual issue.   However, there are two general places (for me) that get a piece beyond notes and rhythms and into interpretation.   The first is text analysis. You really need to know what every word means. This is especially important in a foreign language, but even in your native language you need to be aware of the specific meaning of each word and phrase. Create a character. Is the speaker talking about their own experiences, or are they narrating a third person's experiences? If the lyrics talk about a person or object, is it physically on stage with you (metaphorically) or is it a memory/dream that you're recalling more distantly? What motivates the character?   This is not only jut important for you, but it affects how you perform the song. Which word get emphasized, what style of acting, the tempo, etc. are all informed by your decisions about the text.   The other big thing is diction. Actually, this is just a subset of text analysis but it's so important I like to treat it like its own category.   Diction is one of the main ways we can emphasize or de-emphasize text. In music we don't get much of a choice on pitch or rhythm - we're more or less stuck with what the composer wrote. We also can't get significantly louder or softer, since it breaks the line and also often gets overruled by dynamic markings the composer gave us. So all we really have left is diction.   What do I mean by that? Well, for example exaggerating consonants in a word can give it weight. In the phrase ""I love you"", you can emphasize the word ""love"" by elongating the ""L"" and putting a shadow vowel (a small neutral vowel) after the ""V"". This helps the audience hear that the important part is about your love, not about ""you"" or something like that. You can also open up the vowel a little to bring importance and make the word naturally a bit louder (but still within the overall dynamic range).   Those are probably the two biggest ways I emphasize and interpret music, although there are obviously others. Just experiment and really dig down into what you're trying to communicate and how that needs to be done."
singing,37sipr,keakealani,2,Sat May 30 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"Great insights, this is really helpful.  A similar thing I tell my students (and do with every choir I work with before they perform) is have them close their eyes, and imagine someone specific they are singing the song to. For a love song it might be a boyfriend, or a future spouse, or a pet, or anything, but once you've done the detailed text analysis (like you suggest) to find a reason you would say those things to someone, and which person you would say them to.  For some singers (especially young kids) they don't have as much life experience to relate to the song so they may have to imagine a character they are playing as well, though I always think I get a better emotional response when the singer is relating to their personal experience.  So before they start singing I have them close their eyes, picture the person they are singing to, breathe in while imagining the scene, and open their eyes looking at the audience as if they were all that one person you are singing to.  The diction tips are right on point as well, so many singing teachers get caught up in what you should imagine and feel while you sing, but for many singers they need to know ""What does that MEAN?"" ""What exactly am I DOING to sound more expressive?"" Things like elongating consonants for emphasis are so helpful."
singing,37sipr,TopherKeene,2,Sat May 30 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm a very analytical type of person and I used to get so frustrated when teachers would say things like ""sing with more emotion"". I had to figure out the hard way how to actually accomplish that and even if it sounds less artistic than some amorphous ""get into the music"" instruction, I think it is helpful to boil it down to what is actually going on. It might not help everyone, but it sure helped me when I figured it out!"

singing,37sipr,TopherKeene,1 point,Sat May 30 17:34:38 2015 UTC,"The emotion comes from within and you have to connect the lyrics you are singing to something, or someone, that makes them mean something to you.   One great I've found to get some weight out of a song is to sing it to someone, but specifically you think may need to hear the message. Tell it to them like you're telling them a story or how you feel about them. The inflections will instinctively change depending who you are singing it to."

singing,37sa7k,Wuh-Bam,8,Fri May 29 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"It's often a combination of factors. One is that you are probably using an overly heavy registration (too much thyroarytenoid action/not enough cricothyroid action). This is often associated with a ""pushed"" or ""heavy"" sound which can sound like shouting.   Another is that you are not accurate with regard to pitch. Shouting tends to imply that you're trying to get volume but not pitch or finesse. It's a more ""speaky"" type of vocal production. Without accurate pitch, it's hard to hear it as singing, and it tends to be relatively ""rough"" (as opposed to finessed) in character and sound.   A third option is not enough space in the vocal tract. This actually goes hand in hand with the other two issues. Insufficient resonance space means your pitch can potentially suffer by not creating an ideal space for that pitch to sound. It also often indicates tension which affects balanced registration. Finally, it usually corresponds with issues of diction that make the sound seem closer to speaking than singing.   There's no real magical way to differentiate this line (in fact, I had a teacher once say ""all singing is really just very artistic yelling"") and it depends on the genre as far as how much of these things are acceptable for the style (with the obvious extreme being literally screaming). You just have to learn by feel what is appropriate and what isn't."

I've been 'Shouting on pitch' for years, but only recently started trying to develop my head voice. I'm working from the Ken Tamplin course. A few things that have worked for me are...   1 - a daily vocal routine, which includes warming up with lip rolls (and also something called 'the tongue exercise') on ascending scales. The tongue exercise has really helped me to access my head voice.  2 - learning about 'zipping up' the vocals cords (adduction)  3 - learning about correct breathing and support (I've noticed quite an improvement since I stated taking this aspect of singing seriously)  4 - I'm currently trying to learn to 'shed the weight' from my chest voice as I go higher into head voice  5 - doing everything lightly. Not trying to do too much, too soon. Would you go to the gym and try to lift the heaviest weights in your first week?

I'm not really sure what kind of advice you're looking for, since you already know that getting a teacher is an important eventual goal.   That said, I want to caution you about having psychological hang ups about how ""good"" your voice was as a kid. First of all, puberty does fundamentally change your instrument so you're not working with the same product anyway. It's a little like being amazing at the violin and expecting to become a great bassoonist right off the bat (maybe not quite as dramatic, but still...) Just work with the voice you have and try not to apply value labels on your voice, as this only hurts your self-esteem and how you relate to singing.   In addition, realize that lots of people misguidedly tell young singers that they sound amazing in order to make them feel good about themselves. Especially if the people who told you you could be famous were not professional singers, I would take those comments with a large helping of salt. This isn't to put you down, but to be realistic - if you go into singing believing you are hugely talented you may not be as motivated to work hard, and you may be frustrated by a totally normal learning curve. In addition, the first priority for singing should be to develop solid, sustainable technique, not just become 15-minute famous.   I would also recommend steering clear from a reliance on repertoire, particularly if you are learning from recordings. A lot of less experienced singers tend to imitate recordings and sing for style first without thinking about technique. This is a really good way to develop bad habits that will need to be undone by a teacher, wasting your time and money in the long run. It also presents an unrealistic expectation about what singing is - it's not just endless karaoke, but a systematic training of relevant muscle groups to gain finesse and control.   Remember that pushing isn't the only way to damage your voice, and you can definitely do unhealthy things in an attempt to ""not push"" like hold back the voice or sing ""off the breath"" which can introduce throat and jaw tension. It's definitely a good rule of thumb not to yell and scream all the time (if you don't know what you're doing), but it's not as simple as saying that one element of singing is unhealthy and every other option is healthy and safe. Keep in touch with your body and know your own warning signs for unhealthy technique."

singing,37p5xf,TheFunkyBass,3,Fri May 29 08:28:15 2015 UTC,"Exercises  that remove the vocal wieght from voice tends to be very helpful  for baritones. Things  like humming, coming in on a sigh,  lip trills,  delayed  vocal insets where you breath at a pitch /position you want to sing and try to make a sound with as little tensions  and activation as possible. Even excercise involving vocal fry.  All these while focusing on keeping the resonance in your head and not throat or chest.   All these exercises can be done by any voice type,  but men,  especially lower voiced,  tend to carry too much vocal wieght,  sounding too big,  dark,  and chesty,  as supposed  to the opposite  problem of sounding too light and bright. Ironically  carrying too much wieght high up causes you to switch to a very unconnected falsetto  or lead to shouting.   Then,  just like every other voice type,  scales,  loosen torso up,  breathing exercises,  and general exercises for the voices. Voices are pretty similar,  so there's not really much that differs.  More so training is based on you individual  voice,  and problems you face.  These problems don't always present themselves equally in each voice type,  but can pretty much happen in any voice type.  it's just for low voiced men,  the importance of lightening up the voice is goes from  a common issue to an issue the affects the vast majority of  baritones and basses.

singing,37nqg5,gypsygrifter,1 point,Fri May 29 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"All of the higher parts at the ends of phrases (like the life in Story of my LIFE) sound really strained and forced, which is bad for your voice. I know you can hit higher notes seemingly by singing like that, but focusing on keeping your voice under control to hit those notes well will definitely be worth your while, even if it takes a long time.  Also, I would reccomend trying to sing with some sort of backing track, as acapella you won't be working on staying in key, and with the music, etc.  But not bad, just make sure you're not straining. Also, it seems like it's a bit nasal, but I wouldn't worry about that too much"

I don't think that they're too high for me necessarily, but I think that the problem is that I sing them loudly on purpose, but I don't realize how loudly I'm singing until later. Also, you mentioned me staying in key- I don't think I had any problems with that.  Lastly, is there anything you think I can do to get rid of that nasally and breathy sound I sort of have on the higher notes?"

As for trying to avoid nasality and breathiness, I would say to just try and keep your voice very controlled. The notes might not necessarily be too high for your voice to hit, but it sounds like your body is straining just due to some bad technique, so just make sure you pay attention to all the tiny details. I find that singing the song really slowly so you have to take your time on each note can be helpful with this"

I'd like to get that kind of thing down before I move on to trying to make them more raspy and rock-like like Paul McCartney for example does up there. I'm not sure how good Zayn's technique is though, or if it's even feasible to make my voice sound more like that because of how different his voice is from mine (and the same goes for Paul McCartney come to think of it)."

singing,37l47v,Ragstorichards,5,Thu May 28 12:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same vocal class as you, with about the same range. For me, the ""trick"" to reaching those higher notes easily and consistently is one of support and imagery.  The support, of course, is diaphragmatic support, and the imagery here is to imagine holding a beach ball down under water. It wants to come up, of course, and you have to resist it. Your diaphragm wants to collapse, of course, and you have to resist it. You can make a very big sound with just a small amount of air.  The second part is more imagery, wrapping your head around what it is you're asking your vocal apparatus to do. Most folks instinctively think of high notes as being physically (or metaphysically) high, as though they're above us and we're ""reaching"" up to hit them. But the vocal cords don't work that way; they stretch out to the sides. Think of it like two incredibly tough rubber bands that you're pulling out to the side to hit those notes.   If you're turning colors and making unhappy faces, then you're straining something, as you've correctly noted. You're already on track by having a teacher, so aside from the rest of what I've said here (which you are, of course, free to adopt or disregard as you see fit), just keep at it and don't let yourself strain like that. It will hinder development of the proper technique.  Let me know if that did or didn't help, and I can see if I can glean any more wisdom from my own teacher and books! Keep at it!"

singing,37l47v,exo67,2,Thu May 28 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have clarified it a bit better, so thanks for asking. :)   The collapse/deflation is due to the diminishing air in your lungs. You use your muscles to hold it out/keep it from collapsing or deflating, which facilitates better support of your voice. That's the imagery of holding the beach ball under water."
singing,37l47v,NorthernNights,2,Thu May 28 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"i see, thanks."
singing,37l47v,exo67,4,Thu May 28 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"When the pitch of the voice rises, the control of the breath must descend, like a counterweight, to the pelvis.  Concentrating too much on fine motor control of the musculature in the throat and face is a mistake and a waste of time in the long run. Lamperti, one of the last famed teachers of the old Italian tradition, and contemporary to Rossini and Donizetti in the golden age of song, tells us that any rigidity of the throat is the body's attempt to compensate for clumsy breath management. More awareness, not more technical understanding, heals the voice and creates power with ease in any register. The reasons so many singers miss this point are 1) people egotistically feel that we can ""outsmart"" a natural process like respiration/phonation, and 2) people don't want to hear that it's years of hard work, and not some eureka-like shortcut you can read about on reddit, that creates a master of singing."
singing,37l47v,Deepblueish,3,Thu May 28 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"My sure your jaw isn't rigid and stiff when you're reaching. That's evidence of having the wrong approach and you're probably straining. You're jaw should be able to move freely. Give it a wiggle with your hand while you're singing until it loosens up. Imagine that you're spinning the note through the top/roof of your mouth. Think brightness and smile if this is difficult. Natural vibrato should flow out. Do exercises where you take in a deep breath and release the air at a consistent flow. The secret is to ""pressurise"" your diaphragm instead of just taking in a big breath. My range didn't improve until my control did. Work on control exercises and the range will come I believe."
singing,37l47v,theves,1 point,Thu May 28 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a complex problem, and I do think age will help - in my experience, most men gain a lot more control of the top as they get through the mid-20s or so. I know that's kind of shitty to hear right now, but patience is going to be a part of it no matter what.   That being said, my first inclination is to start thinking more about the soft palate and pharyngeal space. A lot of times when young singers have the ""jaw jutting"" issue, it's because they're trying to push up to the pitch rather than relaxing into it from above (this is all metaphorical, not so much about actual pitch). The visualization I like to use is a wave coming up and over your head (I'm from Hawaii, so ocean imagery is kind of a thing here.) It might also help to bring in just a hint of a smile as you get to the higher part of the range - this helps to keep things vertical and avoid creating the space by overextending the jaw downward.   Ultimately, though, this is a really common issue and one that I believe is best addressed with your teacher. Everyone's voice is slightly different and the sensations you'll feel to tap into that upper register will be unique. All of us can comment on our own strategies, but ultimately it's going to be a matter of coming up with your own visualizations and ideas."

singing,37mun6,Mattpilf,1 point,Thu May 28 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"The voice isn't like your hamstrings. It's muscle configuration and stuff. Since you sang so long, and your voice hasn't changed much(though it may have changed a bit), your voice will surely pick up faster and all those years of practice weren't useless.   But as with anything else you, your voice will not be as solid as it was when you stopped. Your configuration will be slightly off and stuff. Don't expect to get back where you were in a week. If you try to go too fast you could easily overcompensate with bad techniques all while thinking ""I used to be able to sing that"". To an extent you'll have to re learn some stuff, but you are already many steps ahead of those starting from scratch. Getting a teacher, in the beginning can be very helpful because of it."
singing,37mun6,keakealani,1 point,Thu May 28 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"So first of all, yeah. You're just a bit rusty. It's been a couple years, and like any other muscular activity, you'll slide backwards after an extended period of absence (although it's only been two years - that's not exactly extended imo).   On the flip side, you need to realize that your voice is in a really volatile period right now. The voice doesn't finish maturing until the mid-20s at the absolute earliest, and the 18-24 or so age range is where a lot of changes occur. So yes, your voice probably has changed, just because of physical properties. It's the same reason you're probably not the same height you were when you were 11, either.   This is also one reason ""training classically"" at a young age (under 16 or so) is pretty much a misnomer. I have no idea what your background is, but really, the meat of classical singing can only happen when the voice is more or less on its way to maturity just because it focuses on what happens naturally in your voice (which changes so dramatically during puberty it's too much of a moving target to be very useful) and how to harness its best sounds. So most of classical training is inevitably going to happen in your 20s and 30s anyway, so it's pretty irrelevant what happened before then.   All this is to say, while I think you should absolutely jump back into the singing game and pursue lessons, try not to have unrealistic expectations about your ""training"" in your younger years, because you were working with a fundamentally different instrument and you can't really predict how your voice is going to settle at this point."

singing,37kpuj,Murch23,3,Thu May 28 09:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned about how often you say, ""when not warmed up"". If you're going to seriously sing and belt out those high notes then you should always do a warmup ahead of time. You wouldn't want to pull or strain something and not be able to sing at all, would you?   As you mature and continually practice, your voice will actually expand and becoming stronger in the lower and upper registers. I wouldn't worry too much about the range but keep working on it, warming it up, and taking lessons. It'll be interesting to hear how you're doing after a year or two of lessons in your college.   Don't expect to figure it all out on your own and don't expect everything to fall in place after your first few lessons. Since you've been learning alone, the first step may be un-learning some of the things that you've already put in place on your own and re-learning how to do it (sing) properly."
singing,37kpuj,terrycotta,1 point,Thu May 28 10:23:40 2015 UTC,"I do warm up when doing any sort of serious singing, but I didn't know whether the information about how my voice works before that would help.  Thanks for the advice on not worrying about it and maturing. I know the voice matures over time, but I didn't know it'd give more control of the high end (I thought it went away over time because so many rock singers can't hit those notes any more).   I'm not expecting stuff to just magically be immediately fixed or anything. Mostly just looking for the ""why"" on stuff, if it's there."
singing,37kpuj,terrycotta,2,Thu May 28 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of those old rock singers lose their voices due to drugs, alcohol, and constant overuse (30-40 yrs of touring)."
singing,37kpuj,keakealani,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:00 2015 UTC,"This is basically just all bad technique, which is pretty difficult to explain as it really requires systematically evaluating what you're doing and explaining how that needs to be adjusted for your specific voice.   I agree though with /u/terrycotta that it's concerning that you seem to be so blasé about not warming up and doing dangerous things with your voice. There's nothing wrong with a little experimentation, but I would really encourage you to place safety and vocal health above weird party tricks with your voice. If I'm reading your thread correctly, you're going to school for vocal performance in the fall? If so, you absolutely need to keep your voice in top health - sustaining vocal damage is a good way to end poorly in a voice program, and frankly doesn't show professionalism when it comes to your voice. (Although if you're this much of a beginner, I would perhaps advise you not to try college-level singing yet, as that really does assume an intermediate to advanced level of preparation before college).   Anyway, the fact that your ""voice has a lot of weight to it"" indicates to me that you probably have an overly heavy registration, a very common problem for beginners. Anatomically, this means you're using a muscular configuration that is imbalanced toward increased thyroarytenoid (TA) action and decreased cricothyroid (CT) action. Registration is more or less controlled by muscular antagonism between these two groups, and if they aren't balanced correctly, it's possible that the muscles get stretched with too much tension and ""get stuck"", leading to a characteristic voice crack or a sudden shift in timbre when the muscles can no longer hold onto that configuration. So the first thing I would recommend is thinking about that registral adjustment and avoiding overly chesty or heavy singing as you ascend.   Falsetto is produced by partially adducting (bringing together) the vocal folds so only some of the edge is touching, not the whole mass. This allows for higher pitches than are normally possible when the whole vocalis is adducted. If you're experiencing gaps, it is probably due to the way you're producing falsetto, where the edges may not be coming together cleanly or you're not using the right breath pressure to get the vibration going properly. I'm not a guy so I can't comment from personal experience, but my male colleagues have told me that falsetto often relies on a dichotomy between feeling very light and minimally pressurized, but also using quite a bit of air. This may help you find the ideal breath pressure, but of course it's very individual.   The problem of jumping an octave is probably related to stray overtones. Basically, the voice produces what's called a complex frequency, which is made up of the fundamental (lowest pitch and the one we identify as the pitch being sung) and a series of overtones. The overtones normally just provide color or timbre (they're what make vowels distinguishable, for example), but it is possible for the overtone to be louder than the fundamental for a variety of reasons. The clearest example is ""throat singing"" or ""overtone singing"", where you deliberately shape the vocal tract to amplify the overtones and suppress the fundamental.   Anyway, stray overtones can also pop out randomly if something is funky in the vocal tract or the vocal folds are vibrating irregularly for some reason. Normally it's not really a problem except indicating that you're probably doing something wrong (unless it's intentional), but in extreme scenarios it could potentially indicate vocal damage (very unlikely, but just noting for completeness)."
singing,37j5xt,Rideron150,5,Thu May 28 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"The only real difference is for with a really low voice, you can very easily get into a habit of singing very deep and dark, which isn't what you really want. Even a really deep voice is still capable of sounding bright and clean and accessing head voice.(notes above middle C)  So look for exercises that shed vocal weight and stuff.  It's normal to have a big change in sound at first there, but if you don't have control of a light, crisp, clean head voice, then your voice really isn't as powerful as it could be. Don't be afraid if it start to sound like a tenor up there. That brightness is essential for projection and being able to hear AND UNDERSTAND a bassy voice over large areas. Without it, you will be able to hear your voice, but no one will understand what you say.   Also if you are under 25-30 your voice shouldn't sound like a mature Basso Profundo, it will still have brightness in it, and that's perfectly fine."

singing,37f2hq,yeahThatJustHappend,7,Wed May 27 03:55:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with /u/deepblueish - this is really something that has to come from within. Being a singer really is a state of mind more than some external marker, and unfortunately that's just not something you can give.   However, I think there are small, subtle ways you can express your support (you may already do these naturally.   One is to attend as many performances as you can (at least the important ones) and be genuinely interested. One of the most important things I value from my SO is honest (but positive) feedback right after I perform. (Constructive criticism can come later, when I'm not in the performance high.) Actually commenting on specific pieces or successful elements means a lot more than ""sounded great, honey"" type generic comments.   Another is to make time and space for practice. Whether that's setting aside a time where you go out so she can practice at home without interruption, or it's just making sure noise distractions are at a minimum or taking care of an extra chore so she can practice, it really solidifies that singing is worth a little extra effort.   Thirdly, do start to get to know singing and her preferred genre. You don't have to be a singer yourself to appreciate vocal music. Even if it's just knowing the name of some songs and composers, it shows that you're interested in learning more about her craft.   Finally, let her explore her singing in her own way. One mistake I see for people in this situation is to really push the singer - constantly tell them to do competitions and the like. In my experience, this just puts pressure on the singer and takes a lot of the fun out of it. If she wants to compete, that's great, and I'm sure you'd be supportive. But if not, that's okay, too. And same for any other big step in singing (auditioning for pro gigs, open mics, etc.)"

I'd like to also do something big on top of the normal day to day. Like my example of setting up a meeting with a singer she admires. When starting out, I got her recording equipment so she can hear herself and critique. These kind of actions validate her, show approval on top of saying approval, and stand out over day to day support.  Hopefully I'm articulating well. I'm not disagreeing with anything you said as I do exactly what you're saying day to day. I just want to do something memorable and special on top of that is all.  Thanks again!"

I also wonder if she would appreciate going to more ""high profile"" performances. I'll use the example of my husband, who is a pianist, being very excited to see Menahem Pressler in concert while we were living in a city where he was traveling to. (In our case we luckily were able to get student prices, but without that it would have been pretty pricey and a concert we might not have normally decided to go to.)   Perhaps similarly, there are some concerts or events in your area that your SO might enjoy, but feels are a bit too pricey or wouldn't work out with your schedule, that you could figure out a way to go to?

I guess it's just best to be supportive without being pushy, excited for her successes, and a shoulder to lean on when she feels she's failed. Becoming a professional singer is difficult and you feel great when you're employed and terrible when you're back out looking for the next gig; that shoulder could be the difference between her giving up or keeping to following her dreams."

I'm not an expert or such by any means but it sounded like you have some throat tension, meaning your throat isn't relaxed when you're singing and also sounds like you're singing with somewhat of a raised larynx, it becomes more pronounced when you jump into your head voice. The raising of the shoulders, producing tension, when using your HV and tongue position are the indicators. Perhaps someone with more knowledge could chime in and correct me if I'm wrong. You have a good voice and sounds great but a vocal coach will correct what needs help and teach you how to do things with it you can't now."

I tried everything that people suggested to me.  At some point I just started googling ""how to sing well"" and just practiced the ""theory"" behind singing.  Without getting too deep into it...there are things you can do even on days you are not performing to help yourself ""train"" for gig day.  Breathing is a big part of it.

Singing is no different. You don't have formal training, and it's likely you have tons of bad habits that are severely hampering your technique. I don't know why people think they can teach themselves something as complex and difficult as singing, but it's not exactly surprising that after years of bad habits and a lack of guidance that you would be struggling.   And believe me, you don't have perfect technique. Almost nobody does, but certainly not a 21-year-old with no training. The first step to actually improving is admitting that you're not perfect.   As far as advice, honestly, this is why we stress the importance of a qualified voice teacher. The voice is a complex and difficult thing to understand and master, and you can do pretty serious damage by singing with unhealthy technique, a problem that is extremely common for untrained singers. If you'd like to continue singing in the future and not potentially damage your voice, I would strongly recommend seeking formal instruction.   I would also recommend perusing the FAQ - it's hard to know what your exact problems are from your vague descriptions, but you may find some of the articles help you address your problems. If you'd like to be more specific with your questions, folks can also try to answer those questions.   Good luck! :)"

In order to sing quietly, most people (especially beginners) just shut off their breath in order to achieve their dynamic. If you shut off your breath while singing a louder dynamic, you'll experience similar intonation and other problems.  So no - you're not necessarily doing anything wrong at your louder volumes because you're struggling with the softer ones. :)"

singing,37ck9s,keakealani,1 point,Tue May 26 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"I would be willing to bet you are shouting the pitch more than amplifying naturally. If you shout or push the sound you really lose control and that's where pitch issues can crop up when singing loudly. There is also a point where the decibel level of what's coming out of your vocal folds isn't going to be that loud (the entire instrument is about the size of a walnut so what can you expect), and additional volume has to come from resonance, or the way you amplify the sound with the space in your mouth and pharynx to sound louder than it actually is."
singing,37ck9s,xiipaoc,1 point,Tue May 26 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Does the volume make a difference?   Of course it does!  You're using your breath and your muscles differently, so of course it's going to be different.  You should, however, come up with some practice routines to handle this.  Start soft and get loud while maintaining pitch, for example, and vice-versa, at different pitches.  But realize that yelling is bad.  You should project, not yell.  The air should come from the diaphragm, not your upper chest.  Going flat is a pretty sure sign of an unsupported sound, so you need to use more air!"

singing,37dsnv,Bongotrip,3,Tue May 26 22:06:57 2015 UTC,Im sure it's a common problem. I am a soprano and I get stuck in my mix voice and cannot transition down into a full chest mid song. Your muscle memory is probably preventing you from making a smooth transition. It is most likely psychological as well. You feel like you are going to strain and the pitch might not be right so you hold yourself back into a more comfortable familiar placement. I'm not an expert these are just things I have noticed in my experience.

But as soon as I'm in choir, thats it, I'm stuck in chest voice and I'm back to my old tenor-not-really-a-tenor ways which strains!"
singing,37dsnv,enjarcher,2,Tue May 26 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"Not a dumb question at all. And the answer is that it's absolutely common. In fact, without having specifically learned the technique to do otherwise, most people will naturally be completely locked into a full chest voice configuration until they flip into falsetto.  Also, the thing to understand about head voice and 'mixing' registers is... there are a million different types of mix you can use. When you go up your range, you can use anything from a near-on falsetto light mix, to a powerful chesty mix. What you use will depend upon exactly what you're singing. If you can, a good exercise to explore this is the messa di voice, where you take a note in falsetto (but not too high), then gradually and carefully add nasal resonance and let your support mechanism kick in, to carefully crescendo your sound all the way into a chesty belt. Being able to do this smoothly is the key to having full flexibility throughout your range to sing in any dynamic you wish."
singing,37aflj,zealoustubist,3,Tue May 26 04:19:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly phone tuners aren't very accurate and it's just as likely the phone isn't picking up the pitch correctly as that you have actual intonation issues.

singing,37aflj,Mattpilf,1 point,Tue May 26 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Do you have any vocal fry in your voice down there? Any harsh rattling, popping, etc? Not saying it's pure vocal fry, but it's possible to have a mix in there that causes serious distortion. Really any throatiness or unclean sound can make the harmonics very hard to pick up.  I've noticed personally for me, my low notes, say from C2-E2 tend to be hard to pitch right(and worse as I get lower), especially if I don't have an actual note I heard below it. I feel like part of it is because a not like D2 might be my very last not I have or I might have even a B1 at the moment, so the feeling can be a bit tricky to go by, and I don't always hear the notes as well, since even if it's brightish sounding, it's still not as harmonic as the higher notes.  If you know any guitarist, check to see if your phone can get G2 well. My phones 2 years old and picks up these notes fine, but who knows....  Lastly vowel distortion, tension or other improper techniques when hitting low notes can make a note sound flat or something, but actually be on pitch.  See if you can record yourself matching pitch, that would be helpful too."
singing,37aaqr,copsarebastards,8,Tue May 26 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, if you've stopped singing harshly like this for weeks and you are still running into these complications, you should really consider going to an ENT and checking out you cords, especially if tone(like hoarsness) and power is a problem.  Although it's also very possible you got into really bad habits screaming and all the problems are just muscle coordination issues and not actual damage to the cords, so even if you have problem, it doesn't mean it's a huge problem that requires anything else than training and rest.  It's possible to sing similar to that with specifics techniques, but if you think you've damaged your voice, I'd first try to regain a clean and crisp sound again to see if you are damgagin or have damaged something."

Highly recommend to you and anyone wishing to learn harsh vocals like punk or screaming.
singing,37aaqr,TheChurchofHelix,1 point,Tue May 26 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"As a guy who goes between rough vocals and clean vocals often, I do have some tips: make sure you're relaxed. It doesn't matter how loud you're singing, or how much distortion is in your voice, or which set of vocal chords you're using. You have to be relaxed. Let pressure come from your diaphragm rather than your throat, and let your throat be nice and open.   While you're singing, it may be a good idea to clear the mucous out of your throat. Gargle with warm water and a dissolved pinch of salt. That'll soothe your throat and flush everything clean.  Warm up before you sing, and warm down after you sing. Look up simple vocal exercises and practice those in addition to learning songs. My personal favorites are scales with solfeg (You know, do re mi etc.), but a lot of folks think scales are boring as hell, so just find something that works for you. For my harsh vocals, I do a lot of deep breathing exercises. Look up the breathing gym. It's mostly aimed at brass musicians but its applicable to anybody who uses their lungs.  The nice thing about punk is you don't really need a massive range to sing it effectively, so don't worry if you've lost a few notes. You're still young and your voice has many, many years before it'll be full matured.   The bottom line is, don't overdo it and stay healthy. If you sing yourself hoarse, take some days off to recuperate. Don't sing after drinking alcohol or sugar. Avoid smoking if you can. Drink plenty of water. Sing standing up or sitting upright."

singing,37ak7o,SugaryShrimp,6,Tue May 26 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"A couple things. Vowel is really important. /a/ as in ""father"" tends to be a chesty vowel, /i/ as in ""beet"" tends to be a good mix, and /u/ as in ""food"" tends to be lighter and more head voice-y. So whenever possible (assuming the words are still understandable), adding a bit of those vowels where appropriate can ease the transition. In particular, making the middle a little more ""hooty"" (lots of soft palate lift) can move you back into a head voice area after singing in chest voice, while maintaining amplification so there isn't a sharp change in dynamic level.   Besides that, it's really just practice working through your registers. Do exercises where you slide smoothly through the passaggio, aiming to make a smooth transition without a big shift. I've heard the analogy of driving manual transmission - you want to ease slowly onto the clutch and shift gradually, rather than lurching right into the next gear all of a sudden.   Finally, I will say for female voices, this transition feels a lot worse than it sounds. You may feel a huge difference muscularly, but you can adjust things resonance-wise so it doesn't really sound like a big break. It's hard to explain (and I think it varies from person to person), but with practice you'll find that sweet spot where everything sounds balanced."
singing,37ak7o,keakealani,2,Tue May 26 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"Air pipe positioning? I'm no expert, so feel free to correct me if I'm telling a pretty bad advice here.  Try to yawn, and feel how your throat is when you do. That is a position I've been told to be good to sing, and it prevents voice breaking when going from chest to head."
singing,37ak7o,Kilazur,3,Tue May 26 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"Since you kind of asked, I'd like to clarify some of what you're mentioning. If it's TMI feel free to ignore :)  ""Air pipe"" is a kind of ambiguous phrase. The closest thing that comes to mind is the trachea, which is commonly known as the windpipe - this is the tube right in the front of your neck that connects your throat to your lungs. (It's the ""wrong pipe"" that food and drink occasionally goes down if you eat too fast.) The trachea is important for bringing air to your larynx (voicebox), but it doesn't do much of the movement needed in singing, which mostly happens in the lower breath mechanism (abdominal and intercostal regions) and up in the pharynx (the space between the larynx and the back of the mouth) and oral cavity (space of the mouth).   So you're sort of on the right track about shaping the whole system, but it mostly happens a bit later in the process, in the pharynx and mouth. This is what people are getting at when they talk about the yawn feeling. Yawning naturally lifts the soft palate (the squishy membrane in the back of your mouth leading to your uvula [the dangly bit in your throat]), which is one of the big ways we can change the space in that area, as the soft palate is very flexible. (Also, lifting the soft palate cuts off the air passage through the nose, which helps to limit an overly nasal sounding voice.)   However, it's a bit more complex than just lifting the soft palate til the cows come home. The goal is to use that space (and other areas nearby, like the mouth space) to create the right shape and size for the singing voice to be optimal. (We call the whole space from the larynx to the mouth opening the ""vocal tract"".)   When dealing with the transition between registers, this is complicated by the fact that there is going to be a muscular shift going on which changes how the sound is produced. In order to accommodate that change, we have to do lots of little adjustments in the vocal tract space and shape to make the transition less audibly noticeable. It never stops the voice from making that shift, it just makes it so the audience doesn't really notice.   Anyway, sorry for the information overload but I thought you might be interested in what's going on with this idea for the future. :)"

Most teachers won't expect you to come in with a lot of experience/knowledge, so don't feel like you have to be super awesome for your first lesson. But, here are some things to prepare ahead of time:    Pencil and notebook. Kinda duh, you want to take down any important notes your teacher tells you, and keep track of any assignments you should be doing for your next lesson. Also always use pencil for marking music (NEVER pen) because you might need to erase it later if things change (such as a breath you no longer need once your breath control is better).  Water in a closed container. You should definitely get into the habit of having water with you if you plan to sing even somewhat seriously. But especially during a lesson, you don't want to waste time going to the water fountain (or worse, just being dehydrated).  Recording device. Ask permission first, but if your teacher is okay with it, record your lessons. You won't remember every single thing that happens, and especially at the beginning you'll want to record things like exercises your teacher uses and other tidbits. A phone's voice recorder does just fine, but a portable recording device is a pretty useful thing to have, if you're willing to get one.  A couple songs that represent what you want to sing/what you think sounds good with your voice. This is totally optional, but if you already know of a couple songs you'd like to learn, that helps your teacher get to know your taste and style. Don't get too attached, though - your teacher may veto a piece (or save it for later) if they think it's too hard for you right now or it isn't right for your voice.  Enthusiasm! Seriously, it bears repeating. The most important thing you can bring is just wanting to be there, and investing 100% of your effort for the duration of your lesson. You'll get the most out of it and your teacher will, too. And that's a happy relationship in the making.    Best of luck and please feel free to post any other questions you may have!"

singing,377jam,keakealani,9,Tue May 26 06:00:52 2015 UTC,"Hey There! I've been a vocal teacher/coach and performer for a bit over a decade now, studied it in college and taught at middle, high schools, and colleges. I'm finishing up a book to show that EVERYONE can learn to sing, shy of a severe physical or mental disability.  I'd be happy to help out over Skype if you like. First, I'd refer you to some vocal exercises I put up for free for my students: www.soundcloud.com/keeneconductor/sets/vocal-technique-1  I love working with highly skilled singers but my favorite is helping people who feel like they ""can't sing"" but really want to learn to sing, or who are just getting started. So I'd be happy to jump on Skype sometime, I've been taking online lessons and giving them for years now, and they can be very helpful. A good teacher live is always best, but a good teacher over Skype is worth a lot more than a mediocre teacher live. My first session is always free so I'm happy to jump on and help out with some basic breath technique and give some advice on how to practice to improve your voice. I've helped a bunch of other aspiring singers from reddit who weren't sure how to get started, and I really love helping people in your position.  It's obvious you're dedicated to music and a hard worker, those things will drive your success, and I'd love to help you get started so you get the most out of your in-person lessons.  Anyway, if you'd like some pro-bono coaching, just hit me up on a PM or email TopherKeene@gmail.com Good luck in your journey!  (PS anyone else who comes across this is welcome to ask as well!) (PPS you may find this blogpost interesting if you struggle with believing you 'can't sing' http://www.topherkeene.com/blog/2013/10/01/i-cant-sing-i-dont-sing-and-i-wont-sing)"

Well, I have to say the simple excercises that you linked to are the bomb! I don't know if it's good or not, but I feel like I'm actually using my entire body to sing when and after I've done those, not just my throat."

If it would help, I'm happy to offer a free first coaching session over Skype to keep your progress going, sound interesting?  Just email me at TopherKeene@gmail.com and we can set something up.  Good on you for taking the initiative and trying the exercises, remember what I tell all my students, singing is like brushing your teeth, you don't wait til Saturday and do it for 3 hours, you do it every day for a few minutes.  That's the key to progress."

I also want to make sure that I'm really dedicated to this, if I practice for a few weeks only to stop later on, then I have basically wasted your time. When I feel like I lack motivation or when I stop improving, I might hit you up <3.   For now though, doing your excercises daily is enough for a befinner like me :D"
singing,3799o7,SovietWaffles,2,Mon May 25 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"What you want to try and do is create the rasp by using very tight compression, so that the speed of airflow is very slow. Start with a clean note, then gradually 'lean into it', adding breath pressure whilst making the sound sharper and possibly a little more nasally. Don't let the air spill out faster. When done right, the grit should feel like it is coming from your head/the back of the roof of your mouth."

I've always sung along horribly to stuff with headphones on because it's so much fun, but recently started to listen to myself singing to see if I'm any good. I thought about maybe taking some singing lessons in the future.  I guess I might have overacted a bit in this (me singing ""Don't Look Down"" by Threshold):  https://soundcloud.com/alemarius-nexus/dont-look-down-threshold"
singing,37714s,temporarysteve,1 point,Mon May 25 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"So overall, the phrasing, rhythm, pitch were decent, so a good starting block there.  What I noticed that wasn't as good though was your vibrato. I'm primarily a flutist, but in there i would describe it as a ""goat vibrato"". A very fast, kind of wide, and tense sounding vibrato. In the flute this is caused by too much tension in the throat, and I'd suspect something similar in the voice occurs, but that's just a guess. IF you are actively tying to do a vibrato, then do try to stop that forcing.  Overall I think you should keep singing. I'm not certain if things like lip trills, and trying vocalizations that minimize tension will work, but if that's accurate(take this with a giant pinch of salt), I'd suspect you'd see a large improvement in singing very quickly. So don't feel discouraged, because there some good things going on there, and possibly some easy fixes possible.   Good luck, hope things go well."
singing,37714s,erodisi,1 point,Tue May 26 07:45:00 2015 UTC,"Agree with Mattpilf. Try to straighten out the vibrato. It might take a lot of practice. You have a good strong voice otherwise, well suited to some a capella folk like this."

singing,374zn9,Ms_Carry,3,Sun May 24 22:46:22 2015 UTC,"Always hard to diagnose how you can improve without hearing your attempt at it. The notes in the example is Eb moving up to G then back (Above high c for male).  This on the way to whistle town... Few questions   1) Forgetting that it is airy/whispery, can you produce the pitch accurately or is a strain?   2) At what point do your high notes start to lose strength?"
singing,374zn9,tdub90,2,Sun May 24 23:12:25 2015 UTC,1) I can get it but it feels like I'm straining and kinda hurts which I know it shouldn't so I'm doing something wrong.  2) Pretty much anytime I go up to my head voice is when my notes get weak and airy
singing,374zn9,tdub90,2,Sun May 24 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"Ok so there is no quick answers to this stuff but if you play guitar or piano or anything tell me what note the straining feeling starts.

singing,374zn9,superbhappy7,2,Mon May 25 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specific advice for hitting notes in this range, but I can do them, and I find that it's actually quite easy if I put in a lot of power. For example, if I try and do it now at a low volume then I just can't get the required support, it sounds breathy, and my throat strains. But if I'm warmed up and put some power in, I just need to get that right placement and anything in the upper 5th octave is quite easy. It almost feels like my throat becomes a pinhole, and all the effort is in my diaphragm, there's basically no effort once you get the placement right. I believe the most important thing about these notes is that you must have full vocal cord closure, and no airiness.  To practice this I just sung a lot of songs that focus on these areas, so for me that's like Heart - Alone, or Boston - More Than a Feeling, etc. Right now I'm practicing midrange stuff around my passaggio, which is way more challenging!"

But I always thought I talked completely normally! So maybe it does change how we speak, I have been singing for so long that I don't really have a time in my life to compare it to"
singing,372tu4,lexarexasaurus,3,Sun May 24 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, using your voice is using your voice, whether it's speaking or singing. Also, when you speak more emotively, you tend to use a wider pitch range (thus the impression of ""bored monotone voice""). It's possible that your job not only requires you to speak more, but to sound more enthusiastic, which in turn uses more of your range.   As far as improving your speaking voice, singing can have some effect, but it's not exactly the most direct way to go about it. If you study singing, you will learn more about how to control your voice, improve articulation, and be able to create a more resonant sound, all of which can help with speaking.   At the same time, singing uses a lot of the voice that isn't normally used for speaking, so those parts probably won't have much of an effect. Also, the goals for singing are a bit different than speaking, so it's not really a direct way to work on it."
singing,372tu4,keakealani,2,Sun May 24 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"The improvements you might see while singing simply might be because you're actually using your vocal chords more. If you're singing after a day talking at work, your chords are warmed up and ready to go.  Can't give you an idea for the reverse, though."
singing,372tu4,Fallbourn,2,Sun May 24 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Since the entire nervous system is the instrument when we sing, or talk, your social nervousness is literally leeching your resonance, causing less of your ultimate force to ""sound"". A big part of training the voice is to learn how to constantly monitor your breathing, to make sure that it is a global process.  The more completely you breath (""the wise man breathes from the heels"" -Tao Te Ching), the more resonant and beautiful will your voice be.  Since stage fright, ego projection, or any form of overly mental activity takes away from your minds ability to stay connected physically (awareness doesn't multitask), our voice suffers and we don't know why."

singing,371wwn,Mattpilf,3,Sun May 24 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"Fred   Astaire,  Bing Crosby,  Barry White,  probably never really hit  anything above an E4.  There's nothing wrong with you.  Even as a baritone,  the bulk of your songs are likely  to be  have most notes  E4-E3,  maybe a bit lower if you can use a microphone.   Your problem is you can't seem  to lift off the weight and get proper head resonance. When you can do that,  you should be able to hit lighter sounding,  but bright and crisp notes like G4 and G#4.. At first it will be hard and sound too light and that's okay.  Don't go tensing up and shouting those high notes.  You'll never master that area if you keep doing that.   You are young and have only been taking lessons  for 3 months.  Has your voice between say B3 and E4 improved?  How does this area sound now?  If you haven't gotten this area stable then there's good reason why you haven't started working on your head voice.    I can assure you,  your voice isn't  abnormal  because you haven't  been able to hit those high notes and sound effortless there yet.   What does your teacher says about all this.?"
singing,371wwn,Mattpilf,2,Sun May 24 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yes.. The best improvement in my voice so far are exactly the notes between B3 and E4..! Those notes sound more obscure, with more body, and i can control them the better... and yes, those high notes above F4, sound very bright, almost as screams, or ""childlish"" voice... Hope they improve as well.... My teacher just keep saying my voice wont be fully developed until late 20s-to 33 years old... And he says its natural for baritones to ""open"" (lose the deep, dark quality of their voice) at F4,F#4.... But he just listens to classical... I was frustrated because i havent listen to one single baritone who ""opens"" his voice at that note... Everyone reaches highest notes... Thanks for the feedback"

singing,371ne8,hardikjuneja,2,Sun May 24 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"The start of this tune, up to 1m7s, can be considered a recitative in that it is rhythmically free and mimics the natural ebb and flow of speech. It doesn't work to attempt to confine it to one time signature or another and, this being the case, it could essentially be performed slightly differently each time (real time, of course).  Beginning at 1m7s, the song falls into a 4/4 time signature, roughly 62 BPM. At this time, before the singer comes in, you're looking at 2 1/2 measures of rest. He also appears to be taking somewhat of a free and improvised reign over basic rhythmic ideas whilst still remaining within the framework of the time signature.  At 2m2s we're back to the feel of recitative, then at 2m24s it falls back into 4/4, this time with less than a measure of rest before the singing begins. If you're looking to be super technical about this particular entrance, the voice enters on a triplet figure-- precisely the middle beat-- after beat 4 of the measure. In other words, a tripletised ""pick up"" to the downbeat of the following measure. Again, though, I think the idea here should be one of rhythmic ease and freedom rather than strictness and rigidity.  Etc etc.  As for how I, personally, go about learning music-- Well, I do so with an actual, physical copy of the music rather than try to sort out the nuances of a recording/s alone. If I were ever in a position where having the music right in front of me weren't an option and I needed to prepare it for a performance by rote or wanted to learn it for funsies, then yeah, repetition coupled with dictation if necessary."

singing,36yvh0,rOfLRfLolrfoLRfL,3,Sat May 23 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"This is why we spend so much time talking about why range is a terrible measure of anything and what ""voice type"" really means. Simply put, range is only one very small factor in determining anything useful about your voice, and attempts to quantify it are indicators that you don't actually know what good singing entails.   In addition, range is only useful if it's clear how pitches are produced. If you're squeezing and growling and yelling in order to produce a pitch, it's not a healthy indicator of your voice's natural capabilities. Many beginning singers also don't have a good grasp on registration (balanced muscular configuration for pitch), and especially distinguishing between modal and auxiliary registers, leading to problems determining range."
singing,36yvh0,keakealani,1 point,Sat May 23 18:37:14 2015 UTC,I realize it's completely un-qualitative. I'm a guitarist and the speed a player can perform is nothing.  I'm mostly curious about my octave range just out of curiosity. I don't have a keyboard and therefore am not sure how to find out exactly.
singing,36yvh0,minimildew,2,Sun May 24 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"So everyone's beating around the bush and not really answering your question. As /u/keakealani said range isn't that big of a deal, but according to what you posted above, you'd be a very high bassitenor(This isn't actually a thing). You most likely hopped an octave in the video. It's probably G2-D4 which would make you a baritone (like me, highest I can belt is an F4 (T_T)). Best solution to check if you did skip an octave is download a guitar tuner app on your phone (I use one called Gstrings, hehe) and sing into it. It won't be totally on point, as it's just a shitty app, but you'll be able to see for sure what notes you're hitting (A2 is 110 hz, A3, is 220, A4 is 440, for reference.)"
singing,36wx11,singa344,2,Fri May 22 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. Singing is like any other muscular skill - if you take a long enough break, you lose your muscle memory and stamina even if you were doing well previously. It's particularly noticeable after the voice change, of course, since so much of how your voice works is different than before your voice changed. So don't worry - what you're experiencing is very normal.   So first of all, I'll spare you the whole spiel, but consider getting a qualified voice teacher. It's simply the healthiest and most efficient way to learn to sing, and I think you're a really good candidate for lessons since you have some previous experience and are at a good age to begin working more seriously on vocal technique. (Also, here are some tips for finding a teacher.)  Secondly, step back and stop worrying about range. Instead, develop solid technique in your comfortable middle voice. All that straining and forcing is unhealthy for your voice, first of all, and isn't necessary right now. Spend some time just building up your foundation of technique - breathing, resonance, balanced sound. The goal isn't to brute force your way to high and loud, but to produce a balanced and healthy sound.   As far as diaphragmatic breathing - this is a pretty misleading concept to begin with, and it sounds like you sort of misunderstand what's going on. You can't breathe through the diaphragm - it's a solid hunk of muscle, and no air goes through it (other than oxygen carried through the blood, of course). And in fact, the diaphragm is a skeletal muscle without directly-controllable nerve endings - you can't really do much with the diaphragm on its own, since it just follows whatever the other muscles around it are doing.   I have no idea exactly what you're doing as far as breathing (this is why having a teacher is really helpful - they can be a lot clearer than you trying to explain what's going on over the internet), but I suspect these misconceptions are causing some issues for how you think about breathing. I would say to maybe step back and not overthink things with breathing and just focus on an expanded, relaxed breath.   From there, the hard part is really about controlling the breath as you sing. Often, when you feel strain or tension, it's because your breath is either escaping too quickly (causing too much air pressure) or not quickly enough (causing you to instinctively try to squeeze air out). I like to think of it as balancing the inhalation and exhalation muscles, just tipped slightly toward exhalation. You should continue to feel expanded until near the end of your phrase.   With all of this, I think you'll find that the range issues come more naturally. Much of range is just about finding the right breath pressure for each note, so developing good breath support naturally helps you expand your range. Plus, requisite comment that it's not about size, it's how you use it =P"
singing,36wx11,keakealani,2,Sat May 23 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Eek! Okay, I've come solely for the purpose of addressing the very common misconceptions you have about what actually happens when you breathe. So basically everything /u/keakealani has said and then some. I think that a good understanding of this information will be essential to your development as a young singer and will ultimately play a crucial role in laying the foundation for how to ""fix"" a lot of the technical issues you are having.      I also cannot breathe through my diaphragm very well anymore.   Again, this is a very common misconception about what happens when you breathe, and it's no surprise, either, considering the number of choral conductors, voice teachers etc. that shout ""Breathe with your diaphragm!"" in the middle of rehearsals whilst pointing to their belly buttons. This sets young singers up to mis-map and, honestly, form an extremely detrimental picture of the size, location and function of the diaphragm in their mind's eye.  As /u/keakealani has written, it is physically impossible to breathe through your diaphragm. The diaphragm is a highly-domed, horizontal muscle, the top of which is attached to the bottom of the lungs.  This is a brief, bullet-point description of what actually happens during a cycle of breath:     On inhalation...   The diaphragm contracts, descending to a less-domed position, which pulls on the bottom of the lungs and allows air to be drawn into them The ribs swing up and out, facilitated by the intercostal muscles that lie between them-- these muscles, responsible for this upward and outward excursion of the ribs, also allow air to be drawn into the lungs The spine gathers, facilitating the upward and outward excursion of the ribs (imagine a cat getting ready to pounce) The abdominal and pelvic viscera (your ""guts"") are moved outward and down by the powerful downward excursion of the diaphragm The pelvic floor (the muscle group below your ""guts"") descends due to the downward movement of your abdominal and pelvic viscera The abdominal wall (a cylinder of muscle that surrounds your viscera, front, back and sides) moves outward on ALL sides, not just the front, due to the downward and outward excursion of the viscera   On exhalation...   Air flows from the lungs through the trachea and out of your mouth or nose The diaphragm ascends back to a highly-domed position The ribs swing down and in The spine lengthens (the cat pounces!) The abdominal and pelvic viscera flow inward and upward The pelvic floor ascends, springing back to a neutral position The abdominal wall springs inward on all sides      If this seems like too much information at first, I encourage you to read it over a few more times and try to feel and/or envision each these movements as they occur within your body.      It feels like half the breath goes into my diaphragm and then I can't breathe anymore unless I breathe into my lungs.   We've already discussed how breath doesn't go into/through your diaphragm. So, then, where does it actually go?  I have a funny story to share on this, actually. During the first week of my first ever vocal pedagogy class, my professor asked us: ""When you breathe in, where does the air go?"" I kid you not, every single person in class stared at her with blank expressions for a good few seconds before ""Uhh... the lungs?"" was hesitantly given as an answer.  ""Uhh, the lungs"" is exactly where the air goes! That's all there is to it! It's not a trick question and is really laughably simple, yet, for some reason, singers often think otherwise.      Underneath my rib cage goes out a bit, but then it just goes back in   Two things here. One, I think that it will do you absolutely no good to think of your ribs as a ""cage"". This implies rigidity, stiffness and an overall lack of movement when, in fact, exactly the opposite is the case during a cycle of breath! Second-- and I'm not 100% sure on this--, when you say ""underneath ... goes out a bit, but then it just goes back in"", it seems as if you are talking about your abdominals? Again, this is perfectly okay as this movement is simply that of abdominal excursion!     As a closing small bit of advice, if you ever question whether or not you should breathe high, middle or low, the answer is: all of the above!     I hope this is helpful to you! Feel free to ask here or in PMs if you have any further questions! x     Edit: lol formatting"

singing,36thaq,rOfLRfLolrfoLRfL,2,Fri May 22 13:41:34 2015 UTC,"Hello! Firstly, good on you for working up the guts to post. I can definitely relate to the struggle of beating yourself up over each and every flaw that passes your lips, as I'm sure most if not all of us here can. That is, in part, why you should try not to be nervous about sharing your music as each of us are battling demons of our own and can count on the community to be supportive and constructive!     Now that I've preached to the choir ba dum ts, I'd like in this comment to talk about breath support and legato and some exercises you might incorporate into your practice sessions in order to feel and improve upon it.     Throughout this tune, I'm hearing a major ebb and flow of sound between words where a consistent stream would be more desirable. These swells in sound often peak in the central portions of words, where you are sustaining a vowel sound for some duration, and fall where consonants are introduced before phonation of the next syllable. The result of all this is a sort of quasi-, continuous messa di voce effect; or, if you're a visual person (like I am!), a ~~~ sound versus where a ---- sound would be ideal.  This I think has to do with a couple of things: consonants getting in the way of the line and an overall lack of appropriate breath support. You might try the following to help you feel a difference:  If you have an able-handed and willing friend available, have them place either one or two of their palms on your back, on either side of your spine. You should feel their palms open against your ribs. Or, if you are alone, orient both of your own hands as if you were about to shake someone else's. Then, with your hands in this ready-to-shake position, place them on your ribs so that your thumbs are pointing downwards. In this position, your arms will be bent at the elbows and your palms will be flush against the sides of your ribs while your fingers somewhat wrap around either side. In doing this, be very careful to avoid tension in your shoulders!  Now, in this position, take a few cycles of full, singing breaths in and out and imagine that you are breathing into your palms. What do you feel? Ideally you should feel the movement of your ribs as they raise upward and out on inhalation, and you should feel their descent as you exhale. Try to focus on this sensation.  Now I invite you to try singing from the beginning of your piece with your hands still in this position, while still imagining that you are breathing into your palms; HOWEVER, leave all of the text out. Instead, sing on the vowel ""oo"". Take care of your tongue; feel that the tip is relaxed against the backs of your bottom teeth rather than tense and curled. As you sing, feel what it is like in your body to connect every single pitch without the movements of your articulators mucking things up. Then, when you are ready, introduce the text back into the song whilst trying to recall that same smooth sensation of connection between pitches.     I hope this is helpful to you. Also, props to your pianist!"

singing,36thaq,donanobis,2,Fri May 22 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"A song like this might not be the best one to start with, the melody is kind of all over the place so you're pitch is never really finding a steady key. I would work on a simpler song and see if you can either play the melody on the piano or have someone play it for you. Practice holding out your notes on their vowel and really trying to match to each pitch that you sing. Don't add any riffs or ornaments until you have the base notes down."
singing,36thaq,temporarysteve,2,Fri May 22 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed listening to this. The strange intervals, initially, took some getting used to, and parts of the intonation were slightly out (not much at all). After about 30-40 seconds you were nailing it. I liked how it was followed by Pete Seeger, for a male voice in the same style."

singing,36thaq,donanobis,2,Sat May 23 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"You really have a lot of great potential and I love this song with your voice!  The main thing I noticed is breath control. It sounds like you're forcing your voice to be almost too stylized on every note. This is making your vibrato sound uneven and forced. It will help to breath through the phrases and try to hold out words more on their vowels. For instances, on a word like ""can't"", you're going to the ""n't"" part of the word almost right away, it would sound much smoother if you held out the ""ahh"" part of the word. I hope that makes sense. Also be aware of scooping your notes. Here and there it can be nice but when it's everywhere it can be too much and affect your tone."
singing,36thaq,donanobis,1 point,Sun May 24 00:00:34 2015 UTC,"He has a great start to his voice and I can tell that he is working hard.  Somethings I notice:  He's pretty much consistently riding below the pitch (flat). This will be fixed with more breath support, breathing from his core (diaphram) and not his chest. It also sounds like parts of this song might be a bit too high for him and maybe a lower song could be more beneficial.  I would work on articulation as well. I don't know this song but it's hard for me to make out any of the words he is saying. Avoid trying to riffs for now and work on pronouncing each word clearly. Make sure we can hear the onset and end of the word and that it's held out on a vowel. It would be a good idea to practice by singing the whole song on a vowel (like ""Ah"") to work on getting a deep breathe support and making his tone more steady."

singing,36thaq,itsgummybeard,1 point,Sat May 23 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds better. Your head voice sounds good on certain notes, but in general it's too airy because you haven't developed it enough. My favorite exercise for improving this is doing sirens, and focusing on keeping it sounding the same throughout (i.e. starting and ending with the same light or heavy tone). If you're anything like me then this will take some time, but this exercise really does wonders for consistency, and developing that mix."
singing,36thaq,Xemnas81,1 point,Fri May 22 22:54:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll incorporate those sirens and hope for results. I don't doubt that it'll take a while since head voice seems to be a difficult skill for me.

singing,36umm7,IQless,2,Fri May 22 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"I assume it's a cover of the acoustic version? I covered songs to learn how to sing. I'd try being more specific with words. Like the first words ""led you so far down"" - you articulated them differently. The more accurate you try to match a song (tone, range, and diction), the quicker you should develop due to variety. Eventually you'll discover your own tone (a good while from now), but to take on a variety of songs will teach you breath and methods without even thinking about it. I don't know technical names of using the voice but I can perform any sort of style because it has become second nature. It should sound like crap for a long long time, but if you're using the radio, then each time the song comes back, small adjustments are made apparent. Switch between several stations to try out all sorts of styles every time. Keep flipping between the same stations and sing songs you're familiar with.  What you're doing is no trouble. You're on the right path. Let loose with songs you listen to. Your vocal chords are a muscle, so they will get stronger by using them everyday. I never had advice and literally just did what you're doing; I did my best to cover songs. I worked the muscle and ideas naturally came to me for development. If I were to mimic the song, I'd be using the higher end of my chest voice with a smooth breath (avoiding the use of my nasal cavity, which it sounds like you're putting to a lot of use). But these are technical observations from the benefit of reflection and seriously shouldn't concern you. I don't like the idea of a vocal lesson because I begin to think of the voice as having different mechanics, when it really just feels like one big picture that coaches divide into parts based off of their reflections. I'm sure it works for some people, but (even among many appreciated singers on shows like American Idol or The Voice) I rarely see voices without insecurities because (I have to assume) they only believe in parts of their voice.  Everything the voice does is part of a whole and that's why I urge you to practice any and everything. Just use common sense not to hurt your voice near extremes, but know that you can maximize all parts of your voice with attempts at expansion (from resonant power, to range, and of all other qualities). Again, I say this in reflection, not in instruction. I'd say, for instance, that my vocal range was probably about B2 - F4 after a while of practice and it's now at, comfortably, E2 - E6. I can't attest for age, but you're certainly young enough to work a muscle. You definitely have some more advanced skills, you just need to be attentive to the notes you're singing. That's my ultimate advice: be specific. As long as your head is trying to match the sound then you're working on getting perfect pitch (and therefore, great singing). You'll literally be off-key because the vocal chords and brain/ear don't connect perfectly, but just do your very best to match notes and you'll hit them here and there until it's more often, then all the time. There's absolutely no reason to get discouraged. It just takes a while - progress is always being made in increments. One of my favorite bands to develop off of was Fall Out Boy (encouraged further by the fact that he never had vocal training). So I use songs from ""Alpha Dog"" by Fall Out Boy, to ""Where do we draw the line"" by Poets of the Fall and everything I hear, ever. Haha.  I'm sure that KeaKealani's link will tell you the same thing in a different way. ANYONE can sing."

I've been a vocal teacher/coach and performer for a bit over a decade now, studied it in college and taught at middle, high schools, and colleges. I'm finishing up a book to show that EVERYONE can learn to sing, shy of a severe physical or mental disability.  I'd be happy to help out over Skype if you like. First, I'd refer you to some vocal exercises I put up for free for my students: www.soundcloud.com/keeneconductor/sets/vocal-technique-1  I love working with highly skilled singers but my favorite is helping people who feel like they ""can't sing"" but really want to learn to sing. So I'd be happy to jump on Skype sometime, I've been taking online lessons and giving them for years now, and they can be very helpful.   A good teacher live is always best, but a good teacher over Skype is worth a lot more than a mediocre teacher live. My first session is always free so I'm happy to jump on and help out with some basic breath technique and give some advice on how to practice to improve your voice. I've helped a bunch of other aspiring singers from reddit who weren't sure how to get started, and I really love helping people in your position.  Anyway, if you'd like some pro-bono coaching, just hit me up on a PM or email TopherKeene@gmail.com Good luck in your journey!   (PS anyone else who comes across this is welcome to ask as well!)

singing,36qpj9,Pyroarcher99,5,Thu May 21 10:55:49 2015 UTC,"This may or may not be happening to you, but remember that the tightness in the rest of your upper body are incredibly important as well. In some cases, lower body tension can accumulate in the shoulders and neck muscles, making you have to ""squeeze.""  When that happens to me, I like to get weird. I'll often walk around the room slowly while twisting my torso left and right, letting my arms flap like limp noodles. I do this while singing up to, then down from, the note. Breath from your belly.  And if you're worried about looking stupid, stop worrying about looking stupid."
singing,36qpj9,yall_,3,Thu May 21 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"Since you can hit the notes,  maybe do some exercises to Remind your body to loosen up as you. Get high. Things like lip trills starting with no sound,  then introducing sound  with as little tension as possible.  Another one is you start from just pushing air out with no tension and try phonate again with little tension, then close you mouth and try to keep a bright sound,  and then sing. Similiarly  worms with starting from falsetto.   Another thing is. Knowing the notes I am hitting can help.  Sometimes I can run into tension early because I think the note is a lot higher it is,  and set myself up For an odd. Configuration."
singing,36qpj9,Mattpilf,1 point,Thu May 21 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"A tip I got recently from a Complete Vocal Technique trainer was this: During the note, start lifting your left knee and touch it with your right elbow. This motion ensures that you don't lock up your abs or back muscles.   If you practice like this, eventually you'll get used to the feeling of not locking up over that note, and you can do it without doing this 'yeah man' move.  Of course, the muscles in your neck should be relaxed as well."
singing,36qpj9,blobkat,1 point,Thu May 21 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"Resonance and registration.   Most people tense when singing high because they think they need to shout in order to produce a sound (especially a louder sound). Using resonance to your advantage reduces that impulse since the work is being done by acoustical amplification in the voice rather than just muscling through.   Registration is also a big factor - if you're singing with the wrong registration, you can easily tire your voice and the sound won't be very pleasing. Think of singing high as a gradual balancing toward a head voice mechanism rather than a completely different place and feel."
singing,36qpj9,keakealani,1 point,Fri May 22 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"When we sing high, our head tends to look up.. one thing that really helps me is pretending you have a string on the top of your head, and pulling your head up so that you are looking straight ahead.  Another thing I like to do is keep my throat open as if i'm always about to yawn.  To achieve this, pretend you have an ice cube in your hand and ""put it in the pack of your throat"" again - this is not a real ice cube, its imaginary.  This will help you keep your throat nice and open so the sound and note could come out better.  I'm not saying you WILL be able to hit the note with this technique although it might help you out !"

singing,36swue,noneofthefoxes,0,Thu May 21 21:23:11 2015 UTC,"I kind of commented on the other thread, but I think this is a really inefficient warmup and is way too long. It must take forever, first of all, and the voice is really not a long stamina instrument in general. But it also doesn't achieve very much. Long tones are helpful as one part of an exercise sometimes, but this type of exercise teaches you nothing about navigating your range, articulation, and a lot of breath issues. Also, if you are more of a beginner I have a hard time imagining you're doing all of this tension-free.   That said, I really don't think this has anything to do with raspiness, and I stand by my previous diagnosis that a chronically raspy voice is a possible indicator of a pathological problem like nodes or polyps. It's very possible you injured your voice from overuse if this is a normal day's singing for you."
singing,36swue,keakealani,0,Fri May 22 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"It literally takes two minutes, if that.  My voice isn't raspy like I smoke a pack a day, it's just raspy enough that it isn't smooth.

singing,36rhc8,Albatross_90,2,Thu May 21 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Its hard to say given that I can't hear your voice when you hit high notes, but I'll try to give the best answer. Seeing as you are a casual singer, I'd bet its more likely than not that your approach to high notes might not be the healthiest one. Even if, for a while, the sound can come out nicely, that doesn't mean it is not being produced by harmful methods. For years I sang high notes that felt and sounded great in the moment, only to discover I was approaching them in a harmful way. I had the same thing as you, they'd be great for a period of time, then after I pushed it too much, my voice would just give out, neck/throat cramping and all. You said in your question that you belt out high notes, and I think belting high notes as a casual singer is very likely to wear out your larynx.  I'd advise you to post a small clip/track of you singing a high notes, because without that I can't give you an answer that will serve you best.   As of now, rest your voice, avoid singing high notes, and practice in the middle of your voice till you feel the higher ends of your range start to come back."

If you learn how to sing properly (it takes awhile), singing in that style is stupid easy.  Also, develop your own style, you'll more than likely fail if you spend all your time trying to sound like somebody else.

I also think, when I stopped caring about how I sounded, and started thinking about what I did on stage, that was a major breakthrough in how I feel about my performance. /u/awsumed1993 is right - almost everyone is critical of their own voice. I'm not sure I'll ever really like hearing myself. But frankly, I'm not singing for myself, I'm singing for the audience. I started to focus less on how I sounded and more on how I affected the audience (did they experience the intended emotion of the piece? Were they satisfied with the performance? Did they feel that I displayed skill and finesse at my craft?). When I think in these terms, I don't really have to worry about sound - obviously that's a big part of it, but it lets me focus on the bigger picture and it makes me feel like a musician and performer, not ""just"" a singer."

If I'm not convinced/swept away in what I'm singing, I don't expect anyone else to be either. So while I may judge my singing on how it physically feels, I judge my performance by how it emotionally and artistically feels. In that regard, I absolutely am singing for myself. The disconnect of only singing and judging myself by the audience's level of acceptance is one I can't do.  Different strokes for different folks though. You do you. :)"

After some production, I noticed that it actually sounded good enough to pass for a real vocal track despite my relative inexperience on either front, which gave me a pretty good confidence boost.

singing,36p3zk,stumje,1 point,Thu May 21 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"Have you tried these exercises? They're basically designed to improve pitch matching and ear training, which is at least 50% of the battle with intonation (the other half is technique, which is a lot harder to write a quick article about...)   Intonation (singing on pitch) has two components. Aural skills (the ability to hear the pitch accurately and reproduce it), and vocal technique (the ability to control the vocal folds and other parts of the voice to make the pitch you want, perfectly in tune). I don't know which of these factors is giving you issues (or maybe it's both - they often go hand-in-hand), but the first step is definitely to figure out what your actual problem is, before you can solve it.   And no, your voice type shouldn't have anything to do with how well you sing in tune, technically speaking. However, certain voices tend to have certain technical problems more often that could affect pitch - if you are a young/inexperienced tenor with a tendency to ""push"" the pitch and use too much chest voice near the top, that is a big cause for intonation problems. Fixing the registration often fixes the pitch. (Just as an example.) But rest assured, people of every voice type struggle with pitch. I've been singing for years, but I tend to go chronically sharp if I'm not careful. It happens. (And I'm working on it XD)"

I think a great baseline for singing quality, no matter the style you're going for, is control. How much accurate control do you have over your intonation, how much control do you have over the variety of sounds you have available to you, how much control do you have over changing notes, etc."

It's just conjecture on my part, but I'd estimate about 98% of the music I hear nowadays is pitch corrected (it's possible it's closer to 100%). It's sort of how all the ""hot"" people on magazines are photo manipulated, the overuse of pitch correction has created unrealistic expectations on natural singing.

singing,36i2rt,nickfromdtown,2,Wed May 20 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"/u/ethanjhayward said ""control"". I can't stress that enough. control control control. it doesnt matter what your voice sounds like as long as you can control it. you said you cant get your voice to sound like you want and you never will. its like trying to make yourself taller than you are. your voice is your voice. with that being said you have never heard your voice. you cant control it enough yet to hear its full potential. listen to Casey Crescenzo from the Dear Hunter, Jonny Craig, michael jackson, lady gaga, freddy mercury. then go back and listen to Drake or katy perry. the difference is staggering. drake might be good on melodies and stuff, and he makes some of my favorite music, but he doesn't have the power to manipulate his voice the way really good singers do. I'm new to singing so let me tell you the most important thing ive learned. breathing. everything is breath control. look up the alexander method and see that your body is a big resonator like a pipe on a pipe organ and you're just pushing air through it. that's it. everything is breath. vibrato, yells, grit, high notes, low notes, trills and runs, even voice inflections. literally everything always comes back to breath. no one wants to walk before they run, but when you sing bad with bad technique that is the most you will ever feel. every single technique as you get better will feel easier, more relaxed and more natural than that. so in other words, vibrato, yells, all of that is going to feel easier than the way you began singing. that stuff isn't about going harder like it sounds like. its about going easier. you aren't trying to get more intense. get less intense. dont go up, go down.  anyone can yell. fucking no one can hold a note and milk it for everything it's worth. THAT is what a good singer actually is. it will be boring and tedious and you will not feel like you're sounding any better. then one day you wake up, warm up, sing and it just happens and you find your voice. you just have to smash against the glass ceiling until it breaks. singing really isnt that hard if you practice 72 hours a day for 9 days a week"

One thing is to narrow down your technical goals. For example, if you want to work on legato and breath control, it makes sense to choose a slower song with long phrases. If you want to work on agility and articulation, a fast song makes more sense. You won't ever find a song that perfectly fits one technical category, but you can get close.   On the other hand, go for variety. It's tiring (and often boring) to do the same things over and over again. Spice things up and try to keep a couple different pieces going at the same time so you don't overdo one thing at the expense of others. For me as a classical singer, I try to focus on multiple languages at the same time. That's probably less relevant for you in rock/metal, but surely you can find different styles to have some variety. You could also cross genres a bit just for fun, if you like other styles.

After a while I was able to transition between head and chest on one note, and thus somewhere along the line I was using a mix. Once I got good at this I found that if I sung head voice notes above my chest voice (e.g. F4), then I could use this same transitioning technique to turn the pure head voice into a consistent sounding mix.  I also recommend the siren exercise, which used to cause me to break at E4, but I can now do it throughout my whole range with consistent cord closure, and the more I practice it the more consistent my whole range becomes (i.e. I'm now balancing the mix in more notes).  One thing you have to keep in mind is that it's really easy to use the wrong muscles and strain your voice doing this, so I recommend you find a relevant vocal teacher.

I used to do Unchained Melody in the original key and strained to hit those top notes, but the first time I ever got applause on it was when I took it down a 4th and could easily nail the top notes and even riff up into falsetto for a big finish. Change the key into your sweet spot and give yourself some headroom to play around at the top.

I feel like that is by far the richest sound of my voice, and it is also the part I use by far the least, because here's my problem - it's rarely found in top non-classical songs.  By non-classical songs that I am thinking of I mean OneRepublic, Coldplay, Hinder, James Bay, Ed Sheeran, etc. And their songs are made with bits that are the main characteristic of their vocal type - height. First off, there are songs that, when transposed lower just are too low to be any good on their lowest part, while the high part is good. And I don't think that's really a vocal range matter.  I think that a big difference between a high voice and a low voice is simply because lower frequencies are less frequent sound waves while higher frequencies are more sound waves. So a lower note sung for half a second will have much less waves from it than that note an octave higher. That could go up to the point where the higher note is heard as a note while the octave lower note is just one or a few cracks, which practically don't get perceived very clearly by the listener."

I completely agree on the ""legit"" qualification) aren't classical really, they're just a stepping stone from one to the other.

singing,36fdpv,maestro2005,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:54 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend anything without knowing you, but I can list some pretty well-known examples of those four categories:  Classical uptempo: Surrey With The Fringe On Top (Oklahoma!), any of the Balladeer's ""Ballad of ____"" songs from Assassins, The Devil You Know (Side Show)  Classical ballad: Stars (Les Miserables), Some Enchanted Evening (South Pacific), It's Hard to Speak My Heart (Parade)  Contemporary uptempo:  Wonderful (Wicked), Luck Be A Lady (Guys and Dolls), Cool / Jet Song (West Side Story--The Singer's Musical Theater Anthology has audition-ready cuts for these)  Contemporary ballad:  I'll Know (Guys and Dolls), Pilate's Dream (Jesus Christ Superstar).  This category is kinda bogus, usually ballads get sung classically no matter the show.  Anything slow from a show written post-1960 will be fine."

It is a part of your genetics, your physical make-up, etc. Your tone is what sets your voice apart from others, just how your speaking voice is different from your friends or family.   You are likely looking to establish consistency of tone, i.e. not letting air filter through the tone to cut out your unique color, gaining clarity and volume, etc. All of this can be done through training, whether with a teacher or on your own. Also, breath support is key. Having a sound basis of breath support will help with that consistency you're looking for."

singing,36czvb,rOfLRfLolrfoLRfL,2,Mon May 18 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there! After a couple of listens I would like to dedicate this comment to two things: resonance and diction.     Concerning the first bit about resonance, to me it sounds as if all of your sound if being directed up through your nasal passageway. I'm hearing a somewhat constricted tone, especially when you approach pitches that are a bit higher in your range-- and for these pitches, too, it seems as if they might be ones that you are still not completely comfortable with as oftentimes you spread your mouth quite wide in order to facilitate reaching them.  If you are inclined, I invite you to isolate the bit of this tune where you sustain the ""oo"" vowel (""I'm in love- oooo""). When you do so, where do you feel your sound travelling in this moment versus when singing in other moments? I am interested to know if there is a difference here.  Also, THIS moment just a bit after 1m20s, where you sustain the final syllable of the word ""believer""... though I am not a fan of the retroflex ""r"" sound in general, YOUR sound is completely free of any and all muffled, nasal quality, and to be quite honest sounds pretty darn good! Can you hear the difference? If you give this tune another whack, can you feel the difference if you are able to recreate this sensation/sound? Vibrato and all, which is a good thing!  I think that this could partially be to do with the fact that you had approached that pitch both from above and from a focused, closed vowel. Your soft palate was naturally raised higher and remained as such as you descended in pitch, and you naturally directed your sound somewhere other than your nose, in part allowing for this vocal freedom. Oftentimes doing this exact same thing helps me when I am practicing bits of music that are higher up in my range-- I approach them from above, which helps me remember a more desirable sensation of resonance.     And as far as diction is concerned, you seem to have a habit of foreshadowing initial onsets of your phrases with additional vowel sounds! For example, take a listen here, when you sing the word ""love"". It actually sounds as if you are singing the word ""uh-love"". And here, just a but further along, when you sing the word ""that's"". It's coming across as ""uh-that's"". Which aren't actually words at all. Etc etc!     All in all I think you have a good foundation to build on and I'd love to hear more stuff from you!  PS Nice guitar playing bruv x"
singing,36czvb,Andy_B_Goode,1 point,Tue May 19 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the detailed reply! This is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping for when I posted.   ... I'm hearing a somewhat constricted tone, especially when you approach pitches that are a bit higher in your range ...   Yeah, I can hear that too. The top of my chest voice is around a G4, but anything above D4 starts to sound really thin. I hadn't considered the possibility that nasality was the cause of that (I thought I simply wasn't getting enough power/volume/breath), so I'll work at keeping those higher notes out of my nose.   ... isolate the bit of this tune where you sustain the ""oo"" ... [and] where you sustain the final syllable of the word ""believer"" ... Can you hear the difference? If you give this tune another whack, can you feel the difference if you are able to recreate this sensation/sound?   Will do! I probably won't get a chance to do much singing before the weekend, but when I get some time I'll sit down and isolate those parts and try to figure out what I'm doing differently.   ..you seem to have a habit of foreshadowing initial onsets of your phrases with additional vowel sounds!   I know exactly what you mean. I think the reason for that is that a lot of the songs I learned to sing early on were Elvis Presley songs, and he tends to do that a lot (eg ""uh-to have, uh-to have, uh-to hold, uh-to hold, uh-tonight""), and I picked up the habit from imitating his singing. I didn't even realize I was doing it in this song. I'll make a point of staying out of Elvis impersonator mode from now on!   All in all I think you have a good foundation to build on and I'd love to hear more stuff from you! PS Nice guitar playing bruv x   Thanks a lot!

My wife of 16 years didn't know I sang until recently. I can tell you that trying to sing, while trying to be quiet will not work. If you can't put the power and breath behind the notes that you are trying to hit, you won't hit them.

One being my wife and the other was a buddy in the studio helping me record.   For me right now it's about blocking out as much as possible. In my studio I have some nice lighting and different colors. All the regular lights go off. Throw on sunglasses if you have to, I just do whatever I can to feel disconnected from the room and people in it and try to focus on what I'm singing.  I have learned that it's harder for people to hear you than you think. If my wife is downstairs in the bedroom watching tv, I can scream at the top of my lungs to get her attention and she can't hear me. So singing shouldn't be a problem.

singing,36btop,kravitzz,6,Mon May 18 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"My first tip is to sing into the microphone like it's a microphone. A really common newbie mistake is to ""ice cream cone"" the mic. Basically sing with the make facing your mouth, not the ceiling.   Sing like normal, but do realize that it's amplification. If you're singing softer or quieter, you can hold the mic closer to your mouth, but the louder you are, the further back you'll want it, to avoid distortion. If you have monitors playing to you, letting you hear your own voice, you should be able to judge pretty well, even as a beginner. Good luck!  edit- Also if you don't have a pop filter, the little foam cover for the head of the mic, try to go softer on your hard consonants. K, P, Q, and T especially."
singing,36btop,YourFavoriteBaritone,3,Mon May 18 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"the best practice is with the mic itself, getting used to your voice as it is amplified. a good sound guy should give you pointers on how much gain and volume is ideal, but the biggest hurdles are your own psychological ones at first. like guitarists, a vocalist must learn to use electronics to their best advantage to be a good performer.  1. Practice singing,  talking, and moving with the mic until it's no longer a barrier, but a tool you use, a part of you.  2. When you can't get ahold of a mic, use a pint glass- singing into it reflects an amplified and altered version of your voice back to your face, which will help you get used to hearing yourself differently.  3. mic technique- hold the mic pointing straight into your mouth, not up or down, and only about an inch away (closer or farther depending on volume, but 1"" is good for almost everything). Make the mic follow your face as you move around, instead of bringing your face to the mic and altering your posture.  4. Practice dancing, walking, gesturing, and resting with the mic in hand (watch comedians for gestures and videos of pro singers in your genre for dancing etc.) your mic is your only weapon on a bandstand, so you can't be uncomfortable with it. also as the vocalist, you are the face of the band, so being confident and used to the mike will make the whole band look more confident and comfortable."
singing,36btop,KillKennyG,3,Mon May 18 04:20:17 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to compromise anything about how you sing when using a mic. Ideally you should imagine them as being invisible and stay focused on getting the best tone out of your own voice as possible. That is the idea in a nutshell, but there are a few things that might help you out on stage. I'll explain some techniques and hopefully you can get a few ideas to try out.   Dynamic microphones are what you're likely to be using, and most of them have a cardioid pickup pattern. Basically they pick up what's in front of them and cancel noise from the back and sides. Now you don't want to point your mouth at the mic, you want the mic pointed at your mouth. When I do small acoustic sets I'll set the mic off to the side and have it pointed at my mouth at a 45 degree angle to the left or right. This is so that I don't get any pops when singing plosives (if you use the right mic techniques you'll never need a pop filter.) Of course you want the back of the mic facing any monitors so that they are less likely to cause feed back, and I'd say the distance between your face and the mic is ideally about a foot.   There are all sorts of other interesting techniques but I'll say that if you start here then you're going to get pretty good consistent results. There is a lot more on the technical end, but as a singer you should be mostly worried about singing and having good vocal technique."

singing,36a0rt,keakealani,4,Sun May 17 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're a visualization type of person, but if you are, try concentrating on forming your sound more as a ""beam of light"" than diffuse light - think the difference between a lantern and a flashlight. I've found this helps to remind me about cord closure.   Also, you might want to think about how you're using the breath. Breathiness in the sound can both be a result of undersupporting and oversupporting. Either you're not using enough air to facilitate the full muscular closure needed for clear singing, or you're pushing out too much air and it is forced out as breathy air rather than as vibrating sound. Be really conscious of your breath support and balance, and see if that helps to fix the problem.   I also do want to point out that breathiness is a normal symptom during puberty (which, for the voice, can last until the mid-late 20s). It's primarily seen in the young female voice, but some male singers also experience a breathy sound during that maturation process. This is normally the result of underdeveloped interarytenoid muscles (one of the latest groups to develop), as those muscles aid in cord closure in the dorsal region, as /u/xaplexus points out being a major cause of breathiness."
singing,36a0rt,rOfLRfLolrfoLRfL,3,Sun May 17 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"When I first began taking singing more seriously, breathy tone quality was something that I struggled with. Along with letting vocal development naturally take its course with aging, having a better understanding of the inner-workings of the larynx is something that helped me grasp why I sounded so terribly breathy in the first place. So, in this comment, I will talk a small bit about that (and more)!     The larynx is situated at the front of the neck, attached to the top of the trachea (the tube through which air flows into and out of the lungs) at the bottom, and suspended from the hyoid bone (located at the base of the tongue) at the top. Try finding it on your own body: Using a couple of fingers, lightly palpate the upper front of your neck and swallow. The bump you feel moving up and down is the front of the larynx called the thyroid cartilage (aka Adam's apple).  The larynx is a complex structure, but all that this comment will focus on is the glottis and vocal folds.  The vocal folds vibrate within the larynx and are made up of muscle, ligament and membrane. The glottis is simply the space between them. Now, it's all very well and good to have a definition to think about, but imo it's completely useless unless you have a general map of where in the larynx these things are!  Hold one hand parallel to the floor and separate your index and middle fingers until you have formed a narrow V shape. Now point the opening of your V into your larynx whilst still keeping your hand parallel to the floor. Your index and middle fingers represent your vocal folds and the opening between them in this position represents the glottis when breathing normally! Now take a deep breath and open your fingers to form a wider V shape: This is a good representation of how the glottis opens for a singing breath!  Now take a singing breath, opening your fingers to form a wide V shape, but this time, when you exhale, bring your fingers together and hum. This represents the motions of the vocal folds and glottis in singing, the difference being that your vocal folds are actually vibrating at high speed!  As other community members have stated, your sound could be breathy (I say ""could be"" because there are other things that might also be contributing) due to inadequate closure of your vocal folds/glottis. If this does not happen innately for you, it might take time and practice to learn. Here are a couple of exercises that helped me, personally, combat breathiness:      Without singing, sustain an [h] sound. Try to sense what's going on within your larynx, specifically the feeling of air passing through your vocal folds without them actually touching. Now do just the opposite: grunt as if you are picking up a heavy box. Try to feel the sensation of your vocal folds closing forcefully (if you are particularly devoted to this portion of the exercise, you may also feel your abdominal and neck muscles at work). Neither of these extremes are good for singing, but (again, for me, personally), feeling the difference between the two helped me more accurately map the movement involved in creating an adequate singing sound. Open your mouth, creating a long, vertical and open [ɑ] shape (as if you were at the doctor's office and have been instructed to say ""ahh""). With your mouth in this position, on a pitch that is comfortable for you, sustain an [ŋ] sound (ie, the ""ng"" of the word ""sing""). Sustain this pitch until you are able to feel a sort of buzzy sensation in your nose. Feel the back of your tongue raised up, touching the soft palate, whilst the tip rests comfortably against the back of the bottom front teeth. After you are able to feel this buzz, change to an open [ɑ] vowel by lowering the back of your tongue from your soft palate (your jaw shape should remain the same, long, vertical and relaxed). Doing this helped me to feel a similar resonance that I felt for the nasal consonant [ŋ] even when singing the much more open [ɑ] along with other different vowels. I am interested to know if this helps you in the same way. What works for me may not necessarily work for others, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to throw it out there!      Breathy tone quality might also be a product of the shape of the vocal tract and the choreography of articulators such as the tongue and lips. For example, if you pull your lips into a reeeeally wide (and silly looking) and horizontal position, the resulting tone quality can often be breathy. Try experimenting with the shapes of your vowels and see if vowel modification changes anything for you. It would be best to do this whilst watching your mouth shape in a mirror.  For anyone interested, What Every Singer Needs to Know About the Body is a prime resource to have for topics like this. I basically eat, sleep and breathe it, especially since I've not been taking private lessons for a while now.  I hope this helps!     Edit: flottis"

I have been learning to sing for a while now through online resources, which is mainly YouTube as there's a lot of helpful content available there.  I have always been unsure about how I sound as I lack of another individual who can provide me feedback (due to my shyness to approach others). Some days I feel its alright and some days its bad.   One thing I would like to know is whether I sound good enough, if I am ""jam-worthy"" because I would really like to play music with other people someday.  I did 'Wake me up when September ends' by Green Day. Have a listen: https://soundcloud.com/user850200982/wake-me-up-when-september-ends-cover . Thanks!!"
singing,369ol3,kindarcher,1 point,Sun May 17 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, jams are more about how you are as instrumentalist than as a singer. Lots of jam sessions aren't about particular songs, just about chord structures and time signatures, and then all improvised on that. The only way to get better at jamming, is to just go do it. If you're jamming with a bunch of musicians with a stick up their ass about you not being good enough or whatever, find a different group of musicians to jam with. Fuck them. Singing ability has little to do with jamming in the grand scheme of things. If you want to be in a band, you should be proficient in at least on instrument. Not even great, just proficient.  As far as your singing goes, you sound like a beginner - which is fine. You've got a decent sense of where pitches are and what direction they should be going in, but your intonation is still off. I can tell you can hear where you're supposed to be, but your singing mechanism isn't following through with it. That'll just take more practice and drilling to make sure you're getting it right. Absolutely keep recording and listening to yourself in order to keep working - especially since you don't have any assigned teacher."
singing,368x71,tiikerikani,21,Sun May 17 08:55:50 2015 UTC,"Pop/Rock singing is intrinsically linked to the development of the microphone.  When singers began to use individual mics in the mid/late 20s (as opposed to just sticking a mic in front of the whole band) it became possible to do all kinds of things that wouldn't have been possible in a typical classical environment where one of the core concepts is simply how to make a clear tone and project a strong resonant sound - so you could ""reach the back row seats"".  With the development of microphone tech (their volume amplification as well as their high-end frequency response which improved through the decades) it became possible to ""sell a voice"" using other qualities than strength and clarity.  So although a strong, loud voice was still a good thing .. it wasn't a necessary thing.  You didn't need it if your voice had other interesting qualities.  Think of the typical ""Bob Dylan"" example.  Though I'm not a fan of his voice like some are .. you have to admit that if you couldn't hear his voice pushed right up front of things there wouldn't be anything to get into.  He would just be an unintelligible mumbler in front of a band if we didn't have microphones.  Same thing with a lot of the pop people nowadays with really ""light"" voices who have grown up in a world with perfect stage sound and in-ear monitors.  Their singing also wouldn't have hacked it even 50 years ago.  They would have been swallowed up on a noisy live stage in a 500 seat hall in 1967.  There is an undeniable connection between the music you make and the a) the tools you have to make it and b) the environment that it is made in.  So that's what was going on with all those jazz ballads in the 30s.  The ""torch song"" stuff.  What people loved about it was that the singers were ""whispering"" .. ""crooning"" .. into the microphone.  You could hear all of these tiny fine details of the voice - tiny intimate inflections that would fall flat on a live stage before even getting to the pit orchestra.  It was a totally different style compared to the big, bold way people had been singing before.  It was a new development.  A new way to sing.  Think of the ""brassy upfront nasal"" sound that all the jazz singers from the 20s used to push themselves through the mix .. and how different that is from the ""whisper in your ear"" sound of Nat King Cole or ""My Funny Valentine"".  So right from the very start I think that was the key difference.  Classical singing was built on concepts of strength, clarity, and resonance to fit the environments that it was being performed in.  But jazz (which then goes on to rock'n'roll, and all the other ""popular musics"") was more about an ""interesting voice"" (and possibly even an untrained voice) that would be engaging to listen to when it was amplified.  IMO that distinction is where most of the ""pop voices"" vs ""classical voices"" differences originate."

Kind of like when you learn how to speak as a child and you'll easily pick up whatever accent is around you.  The whole one time I visited Italy, there were entire families singing classically as they made dinner in their homes (windows were open). While those families very well may have had some training, it's also likely they didn't.  Music is a language, and the one you're most exposed to is the one you speak the best."
singing,368x71,ghoti023,3,Sun May 17 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"I would say there's a lot more soulful inflection in a lot of pop singing which sounds really nice in the context of popular music but technically is much easier to achieve than purely hitting and then sustaining a long note, for example.  With rockier styles there's a lot of belting and less subtlety and diversity. A lot of people can belt well, kids in playgrounds, drunk people singing Livin on a Prayer.  Both styles generally require less control, control of your vocal cords, breathing, posture etc. But all that said I love good pop vocals. A lot of that rawer stuff adds character that communicates emotion and creates a really immersive atmosphere for the listener. And the difference between a pop/rock singer who can sing quite well and in tune vs. one that can blow you away with their delivery and timbre is still huge.Just different disciplines."
singing,368x71,digitag,3,Sun May 17 11:54:17 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that pop music was designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of training, while classical singing has become a lot more regimented and restrictive over the years. The ideals of classical music are about things like executing good technique and presenting really polished performances, which necessarily require a lot of training and knowledge. The ideals of most pop singing is to be catchy and relatable, which means just being yourself and not strictly worrying about technique. Objectively, a lot of the most famous pop singers have some of the worst technique, but they're really popular and a lot of people like their style. It's generally easier to cultivate a style based on your own personality and vocal quirks than it is to develop a polished classical performance."
singing,368x71,keakealani,0,Sun May 17 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"Rock music is actually sort of a less popular genre than ""pop"" at this point. So I'm going to use ""pop"" in place of ""rock"" for my response.  I personally don't think there's that big of a difference between genres of music when it comes to singing (there's really only so many things you can change). I think the main two differences are vibrato and ""vowel shaping"" (I'm not a classically trained singer so I'm not sure what the correct terminology is). Classical singing seems to be just a little bit different vowel-wise. That and true classical music wasn't amplified, so you obviously had to sing a hell of a lot louder. I think the ""pop"" voice is more closed off than a classical singer, but it also varies widely.  If you've spent a long time training as a classical singer and singing/listening to classical songs of course it's going to be easier to sing.  I really do think it all boils down to popularity. Classical music isn't as popular, therefore people don't listen to or sing it as much, therefore it's harder for the majority of people. If they hear someone who is good at it then it's more of a novelty and therefore likely more impressive or confusing/different.  Personally I'm more impressed by someone who can sing well in ""pop"" style more so than any other genre. No offense to the classical folks, but the wide and frequent use of vibrato in a song is very unappealing. That and I prefer more ""futuristic"" sounding music myself. Nothing wrong with classical, but it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.  With tools like Auto-Tune singing on pitch has obviously become more commonplace than it used to be, and the majority of the public doesn't understand that almost all pop music vocals are pitch corrected.  Also, someone who can sing is just impressive. I'm rambling, but maybe some of what I've written helps.  I'm curious what songs you and your friends sang out at karaoke?"

One time I accidentally found myself in a pop/jazz choir and I just hated the experience, but that was more the style of the music/performance than the style of the singing.   I'm curious what songs you and your friends sang out at karaoke?   I tend to sing Finnish-language ballad/schlager songs at karaoke (since I'm in Finland after all), either that or ridiculously show-offy things like Nightwish songs (the band is from a small town near here so it's always a crowd-pleaser). With the latter people are impressed when anyone even attempts it, and the songs were written for a classical singer, so I ""get"" that. Occasionally I try a rock song and it just totally doesn't work for me.   As for my buddies, they were mostly singing the (English-language) pop songs that were around when I was in high school, around the early 2000s.

I am a classically trained singer, and there are just as many discrepancies to be found in that genre as there are found on this sub with people from various backgrounds arguing.   Using drugs and the like to ""loosen you up"" before performing sounds like a crutch to me - a way to fix tension problems that aren't otherwise being addressed. The fact that it's also a pain killer is concerning, because then if you were doing anything in your technique that might be tell-tale to something negative, you wouldn't be able to feel it.  Now, on the flip side - I do know singers that use drugs and the like to help them sing. It's 2015 - and there's a lot of stuff out there that can give you boosts. I am by far not saying that ""all drugs are bad mmmkay."" To directly answer your question, it is not ridiculously common, but it is not unheard of either. There are plenty of singers that use things to calm their nerves before auditions and heading on stage and they all do just fine. In fact, I'm sure people use Robitussin and are just fine (you even seem to know someone!) There are classical singers (in Europe specifically) that still to this day smoke like chimneys and have perfectly successful careers. There are countless stories of singers taking shots of alcohol to help calm the nerves. Various teas and the like with caffeine are also all considered drugs.  You do you - basically. If it works for you, you know about possible side effects, and you like it - do what you think is best.

What you hear in your head when you speak/sing is not what actually comes out of your mouth - which is why this disconnect is common. Your voice resonates in various places in your mouth/skull before it reaches the outside world, whereas you hear a slightly more muffled version. It's why (especially when attempting to self-teach) recording and listening to yourself is the best way to pick out flaws and what actually needs to get worked on.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents dental, alveolar, and postalveolar flaps is [ɾ].  The terms tap and flap may be used interchangeably. Peter Ladefoged proposed for a while that it may be useful to distinguish between them; however, his usage has been inconsistent, contradicting itself even between different editions of the same text.  The last proposed distinction was that a tap strikes its point of contact directly, as a very brief stop, whereas a flap strikes the point of contact tangentially: ""Flaps are most typically made by retracting the tongue tip behind the alveolar ridge and moving it forward so that it strikes the ridge in passing."" [this quote needs a citation] However, later on, he no longer felt this was a useful distinction to make, and preferred to use the word flap in all cases. [citation needed]  For linguists who do make the distinction, the coronal tap is transcribed as a fish-hook ""r"", [ɾ], while the flap is transcribed as a small capital ""d"", [ᴅ], which is not recognized by the IPA. Otherwise, alveolars and dentals are typically called taps, and other articulations flaps. No language contrasts a tap and a flap at the same place of articulation.

But they've gone now, and the adults keep asking me back.  So yeah, musical theatre - lots of fun, but avoid stepping on the toes of amateur prima donnas.  I also learned what amazing places theatre backstages are - warrens of secret passages and spooky bits."
singing,366gtu,joanamsat,4,Sat May 16 16:52:19 2015 UTC,"We do have an article in the FAQ for exactly this reason. Regardless, not only does range have very little to do with voice type, but voice types are by definition only relevant to moderately trained singers, since their point is to identify things like timbre, passaggio, tessitura, and full range which can only be accessed by relatively trained singers. Finally, it is impossible to determine anything about a voice type without actually hearing the mode of production used to identify pitch and range - as you state you are an untrained singer, it seems extremely unlikely that you were accurately discriminating about register and technique when documenting your range, so it's exceptionally useless to have this range given as it says nothing about your actual vocal production."

Because the content is addressed in the FAQ and sticky, they're not contributing to the subreddit and are, per reddiquette, totally acceptable to downvote. ""Banning"" posts isn't really practical - then the mods would just be spending a ton of time deleting posts and nothing would really change. Be the change you want to see - post in discussions you consider more substantive, or start your own discussions. Reddit is user-content driven, so if a user is unhappy with the content, it is on them to change that. You may also find /r/ClassicalSinger or /r/Opera more interesting; they tend to have more substance, but they are narrower in scope and much less active than /r/singing."

You'll only serve to damage your voice. I know it seems like it's worth the risk now but you'll regret it when you're older and can barely sing at all.  If you're going to mimic singers, mimic their (best) technique, not their voice, because everything else comes down to anatomy. In other words, embrace your own sound.  Having said that, sometimes a ""haunting"" tone can be a result of proper resonance, which is an essential component of technique. Your best bet is to make sure that you are ""open"" when you sing, ie. soft palate up, projecting from your diaphragm, resonating in your mask (behind your eyes), throat nice and relaxed. Pay attention to your mouth shapes and feel the air."
singing,3642p0,Kevman5,1 point,Sat May 16 01:21:44 2015 UTC,You have a very good way of explaining it. It sounds a lot like what I do when I sing. It certainly helps to listen to the artists who use the techniques you're looking for too.
singing,3642p0,Mackncheeze,2,Sat May 16 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"To put it very simply, singing is just air and mouth shapes. As soon as you focus on the air coming in and out, and proper vowel formation, your body should naturally know what to do, especially your diaphragm. When most people think of support they think of squeezing when it should feel like a gentle hold below your rib cage.  Once I stopped overthinking everything and focused instead on precision with vowels, all the other technique fell into place. I don't just mean mouth shapes with your lips and jaw - the soft palate is key. When in doubt, pant like a dog before you sing a line, taking note of your soft palate, and see if you notice a difference."

I agree that you should develop your own style, but being able to do more things is never a bad thing.   Anyway, a big part of what you're looking for is singing just above a whisper, and only getting louder in your head voice. Just play with it, try to get some weird sounds out of your voice.

singing,360772,rOfLRfLolrfoLRfL,6,Fri May 15 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"I wish I could sit in with you for a lesson!  I am going to dedicate this comment solely to your diction as it could do with some refinement. I'll go in chronological order of the major items that I hear using the format: Time, Word - Explanation  I think it will help you to listen back to your recording whilst you read over the explanations. If you don't understand any terminology please let me know and I will try to word things differently (or perhaps other community members can).      9s, Around - Specifically the ""ou"" diphthong. For the final sound in this diphthong, your lips should move to a rounded and very forward position, much more so than you are currently doing. 11s, Familiar - Specifically the first ""i"" vowel. As it is now, you are forming a lovely and more closed vowel suited for words like meat, heat, eat etc.; however, for the word ""familiar"", the ""i"" vowel you should be producing should be a tad more open, as in the words bit, sit, hit etc. Your jaw should be slightly lower, your lips unrounded and slightly more open, and the high point of your tongue should be slightly lower for words like ""bit, sit, hit"" than for ""meat, heat, eat"". 25s, Nowhere - Specifically the final sound of this word. At the moment you are finishing it off with a long retroflex ""r"", a sound in the English language (IMO) which leaves much to be desired. The vowel sound you should strive for at the end of this word is actually one that you have sung before! Faces, Places. The final open ""e"" vowel in these words is the exact same one you want for Nowhere. The retroflex ""r"" can come after, just a touch. 44s, Drown - Same as 9s, Around 1m11s, Circles - Specifically the ""ir"" sound in the centre of this word. As it is now, this sound is coming across like the open ""a"" sound in words like bark, dark, park etc. Funnily enough, the sound that would be more appropriate here is that retroflex ""r"" you used at the end of the word ""nowhere"". 1m40s, Child - Specifically the initial ""ch"" sound, called an affricative consonant. These consonants are formed when two consonant sounds are articulated into a single unit of speech. Right now you are making more of a ""shh"" sound rather than the necessary ""ch"" sound for the word to be understood. Try holding out the ""shh"" sound. As you are doing this, place the tip of your tongue to your teeth ridge while still attempting to create the same sound. This should stop the air from flowing out of your mouth and will put a stopper on the ""shh"" sound altogether. Next, quickly move your tongue tip from your teeth ridge, back to the position it was in for the ""shh"" sound. This (hopefully) is the sound you want for the initial ""ch"" of the word ""child"". 1m43s, Listen - Specifically the ""i"" vowel (same as the first ""i"" vowel in familiar). However! Listen to and feel the way you sing the preceding word, ""sit"", at 1m42. The way you are producing the ""i"" vowel in the word ""sit"" (spot on, I might add) is EXACTLY the way you should the ""i"" vowel in ""listen"", as well as the first ""i"" in the word ""familiar"". Try to hear and feel the difference between these vowels. Also, the way you produce the ""i"" in ""sit"" is different at 1m42s than it is at 1m44s. The first is correct, the second is straying too far closed.   And, overall, words that end in consonants could do with more consonant sound in general as a lot of the time they are absent altogether.     I hope this is understandable/helpful and apologies if not! I think it would be beneficial for you to practice singing (or at the very least speaking the text of) this song with a native English speaker so he or she can help guide you visually and aurally with your English diction.  Keep up the good work!"

If not, try sounding more like a singer - eg. go up half an octave (or an octave), put a lot more feeling into it, so that it is much louder; and sustain the words, so that each one runs into the next.  There is also a slightly irritating clicking sound (of saliva?) - it would be better to get rid of that. Perhaps it will disappear into the background if you try the above."

Most of it boils down to math, problem solving, and patterns, so if you're the kind of person who excels in that you'll pick it up easy. If not it still isn't difficult, but you might need a little more time to get it. Once you learn though, you'll use it all the time whenever you look at a piece of music so it is very easy to retain.  Any particular areas if theory you struggle with/have questions about?"

And artists develop a theory of their own if they haven't studied before, that goes without saying. What kind of things should I be looking for? I'm in a progressive metal/alternative metal band and I listen to primarily metal and prog. I love how intricate, or random it can seem. Syncopation and odd time signatures along with awesome fusions.   Also, I've always heard the myth, like getting vocal teacher, theory kills, or can kill creativity. Not that I believe it. But how much of that is true? I've got loads of questions, I just don't know how to ask."
singing,35wsor,Cant_Handel_my_swag,3,Thu May 14 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd only get a theory teacher if you have trouble understanding it from books, and there are many great books to teach theory (Sarnecki is a good one for beginner adults). If you are running into roadblocks though, a theory teacher can definitely help. When you start to get really advanced/into composition you'd also do well with a teacher.  The idea that learning theory makes you a worse musician/composer is 100% false, but I know why people think that. Imagine it like learning a language, when you first start you'll most likely be imitating words/phrases from the book or repeating things just as you learned them. Once you get more familiar with the language you will be able to form your own ideas. Once you master it, you can have the whole language at your disposal. So when you first learn theory you will probably have a period where you're very imitative and lacking in creativity, but that's just because you're learning the basics. Everyone does this, just look at Mozart's first symphonies, it's like really bad Handel."

singing,35wsor,ghoti023,0,Thu May 14 13:05:09 2015 UTC,Should the inhale be an inhale until the lungs are full or just moderate?
singing,35wsor,mwb2,4,Thu May 14 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"Full.  The exercise I do with my students is based on a series of counts. For beginners, I generally start with 4-4 and move to 4-8. (The first number is the counts for inhalation, the second is for exhalation.) Each count should be about a second.  Upon inhalation over 4 seconds (4 counts) you breath in an equal amount of air per each second until you are entirely full at the end of the 4th count - so over each count, you should breathe in 25% of your lung capacity. You should breath in continuously for all 4 counts.  The same goes for exhalation. I generally suggest exhaling on an ""s"" or ""sh"" so you can monitor your breath pressure with an actual sound. So if you're exhaling for 4 counts with even amounts of breath, the sound you make is going to be pretty loud.  As you get used to the 4-4 and 4-8 combination, you can increase or decrease those numbers as you see fit. I generally keep the inhalation number between 2 and 4, and the exhalation numbers between 4 and 16.  Farinelli isn't so much about how much you can hold, but how well you can use it. It is a breath control exercise, and I personally have found quite a bit of success in my own personal singing with it."
singing,35wsor,ghoti023,3,Thu May 14 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"IMO, moderate. Not tippy-top full--this creates way too much breath pressure and is too hard to counteract.   Caruso famously said that during performances, he took in as much breath as he would for a normal conversation.  Maybe think of it as ""easy full""--the moment you reach the ""yep, that's plenty"" point, you can stop. Don't pump up your lungs by another 50% or more after that point."
singing,35x1k3,LordNode,3,Thu May 14 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"This has been suggested before. While it's a good thought in principle, the problem is that most people seeking critique are beginners looking to learn, and they may not be able to offer much helpful critique if they're still in the beginning of the learning process.   Activity in critiques has definitely been a consistent problem here, but it's a hard one to fix. The more experienced members tend not to want to critique all the time because it can feel repetitive (much of it boils down to breath control, intonation, and addressing tension) and many of the experienced posters are students or professionals who have limited time to spend. In addition, there's only so much critique that can be made from one or two recordings. I, personally, try to avoid making too many diagnoses about technical problems because I'm not listening in person and some issues can be deceiving in a recording.   Also, frankly, some people seeking critique probably do need something more structured - often it's more about bigger systemic problems than just quick issues that can be easily fixed."

If you want to record the amplified signal, then plug the microphone into the preamp, and then go from the preamp to the instrument input of an computer audio interface.  Note that most audio interfaces have at least one direct mic input, and one instrument input.  They will also often have a headphone output so that you can hear the track you are singing to.    A lot of people will just record a dry vocal directly to the computer, and add the filtering and effects (EQ, reverb) afterwards.  You can buy a vocal shield to get a dry recording, but if you don't do it often then just prop up some pillows in a semi-circle around the mic."

singing,35wzhn,UnitedStatesofApathy,2,Thu May 14 05:18:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to figure out why you're flat. Intonation in singing has two major components: technique, and aural skills. Sometimes it's both, but in any case identifying the issue is really helpful in fixing it.   Aural skills are probably easier to diagnose - it's really a question of how good your ears are at detecting intonation. Since you mention guitar, an easy check is to tune your guitar by ear and then compare that to a tuner - if you can tune accurately by ear you should be able to sing accurately by ear, on the aural front.   Technique is somewhat more difficult to deal with since there can be multiple factors. Vowels are a big one - if your vowels aren't clear you can sound flat even if the fundamental is technically in tune. Breath support is another big one, as not having enough air can cause pitch to sag. Tension can also cause tuning problems."

Probably many years if it's beyond the 'play wonderwall' stage, to where you can actually improvise and such. Also keep in mind that the guitar can easily be taught from books and videos because you can see exactly what your fingers are doing and what they need to be doing, to the point where a beginner can easily do the same chords as any professional, just obviously not with as much speed/accuracy/etc. Whereas with singing no beginner can do anything a pro can do, and without professional guidance they may never be able to do it with the right techniques, which is why it can be so immensely difficult.  Like you I'm just learning from videos and such, and it takes a fucking long time. Especially since half the time I have no idea if what I'm doing is right, but I personally enjoy discovering these things myself so I don't mind too much.

Unless you do it very, very, very well, it will be quite apparent to a listener when you're singing outside of your comfort zone.  Practice often, but never too hard.

Work with your instructor on muscle control as well (you said you took one or two lessons, but then speak about your instructor in present tense.

In addition, Broadway is a terrible comparison because a) it's an industry that thrives on pushing singers beyond their natural limits (which is why so many of them have to take time off to recover from, guess what, singing unhealthily) and b) is amplified, thus enabling people to sing outside of their range and still be audible.

Drink water constantly. Clear pee and all that jazz. Take any vitamins you might need and be sure to eat as healthily as possible.   If you have any sinus symptoms, a nasal rinse is a good idea. If you have a cough, use a cough suppressant to avoid coughing as much as possible. Gargling warm salt water can also help with throat irritation.

singing,35o697,Mattpilf,1 point,Tue May 12 12:26:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm well  I have a similar  case like you.  Tonsillitis over  three weeks ago,  for over two weeks,  and still having significant  issues with  even speaking.  Got my voice box checked out and everything looks healthy.   Essentially  I have my muscles not firing properly anymore,  and I guess  I have a what would basically be a limp in the voice.  These problems can go  away on their own,  but if the persist  then voice therapy can be helpful.    It's certainly possible that with an illness,  like an injury it can take a while to get back into gear.  Has it been a whole week since you were no longer sick?  If not,  definitely  give it some time and a little relative rest, like no pushing or straining.  You can still have tissue that is tight  and stuff or a whole bunch of other things."
singing,35o697,Mattpilf,1 point,Tue May 12 14:15:18 2015 UTC,It was about a week now so I was getting kinda worried. I won't sing for a few days and see what happens. It just feels like my voice is weaker then usual.
singing,35k8ax,elerico,4,Mon May 11 04:03:13 2015 UTC,I was actually hoping you would crosspost here. This is definitely FAQ worthy. Very thorough and very helpful. Thanks for taking the time to write this out! :)
singing,35k8ax,keakealani,3,Mon May 11 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"Hey! Then you know like, a bunch of my friends that went to AIMS last summer! I went the year before. If you'd be interested, I'd like to PM you about who told you that you needed to gain 30 lbs to be successful, because that's a load of crap. Honestly, so long as you can remain flexible within your muscles, you can lift and be a singer. The body fat (speaking from experience) can help with breath because it's a natural weight on the breathing mechanism that'll help ""activate"" it without really needing to try, but that doesn't necessarily make it optimal. This is especially true since so many places are starting to focus on your physical attributes more than they would in the past, so the more conventionally attractive you are in addition to being a great singer, the more likely you are to get hired. I'm not a fan of looks > singing ability, but it's certainly not going to hurt you to be good at both.  EDIT: PS - this is now in the FAQ."
singing,35k8ax,Mattpilf,2,Mon May 11 05:01:57 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of this. Heck, I work out my core all the time, and my gut still expands from a 29"" waist to a 36"" waist during full breath.  And yeah, I do think the days of stars like Luciano Pavarotti. It's much harder to just get up and go sing like he did, and much harder to get started."

singing,35l5yd,LordNode,2,Sat Jun 6 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"It definitely sounds better and clearer, but now that I listen more closely your high notes sound strained and lacking in support, which might explain some of the clarity issues in the lower parts. If you listen to 2:31, you basically lose all support and you can hear the sound coming from your vocal cords. Obviously all sound comes from there, but what we should be hearing is the resonance from other places, otherwise you will compensate by straining the notes out too much.  The original song uses falsetto for that part, and it sounds like you want a more solid sound, so you should work on your mix voice more, which requires solid support."

singing,35l5yd,temporarysteve,2,Tue May 12 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"When you go up, the start of the first high note is higher or lower than it should be, and after a bit, you gain control and it slides into the pitch. So there's that. But also, the straining is causing you to lose the rich tone you have lower down. Perhaps practice it more slowly and carefully, trying to relax and open your throat?  Or take the song down a few notches to match your range. (I am not a singing teacher, but I have a good ear. So I hope this helps.)"

singing,35hif7,unitytracks,13,Sun May 10 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"Just saw a few clips of him singing live and from that I think I know what went wrong.  Because he usually relies on his falsetto for high notes, I think the upper end of his full voice has not been worked on enough. I can hear from his singing that when he attempts to sing higher notes in full voice, there is a lot of tension and unnatural sound manipulation (adding grunt to the high notes to give them substance). For example, when he sings the words ""Can I lay by your side,"" I can clearly hear the quality of his sound change. His larynx doesn't have the strength for notes that high at that fullness, and so he has to manipulate the vocal tract in order to achieve that sound. This habit is very damaging to the vocal cords, and unfortunately, it seems like the damage culminated rather quickly in his voice.  Also as binbincrackers pointed out, the breathy singing is indeed damaging. He relies on breathy singing way too much. Breathy singing has its advantages, such as in warming up the voice, but after singing breathy for too long the voice ends up getting hurt. The fact that Sam Smith's voice is breathy more often than not may very well have contributed to this issue."
singing,35hif7,donutglaze123,3,Sun May 10 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Probably a mixture of overuse and some bad habits, Mariah Carey and Celine used to not speak in between touring just to save their voices. Your voice is a delicate instrument so even if you have good technique, years of overuse can damage it badly. Lifestyle choices such as drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking and your diet can also affect your vocal cords. I'm not familiar with Sam Smith but I've heard him strain before, does he use airy vocals? That's a good way to dry out your vocal cords and overuse of it can damage them too."

singing,35hif7,HerkyJerky12,2,Mon May 11 10:13:23 2015 UTC,"Hard to say.  I don't think his voice sounds like it's particularly prone to injury  from technique,  but there's so much more.  From alcohol to shouting in clubs,  to even plan old genetics.  Sometimes you can have perfect technique and still get injuries when you ramp up your singing to heavy touring professional  levels."
singing,35hif7,Mattpilf,2,Sun May 10 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Sometimes all it can take is one bad day to set the cycle when you are a pro singer.  Because when you are not pro, and have a bad day, you simply take a day off.  But when you are pro you must sing...  And if you sing on a bad day, you will find you need to push in the wrong way to hit the notes.  That sets off a bad cycle to where the next day you suddenly can't warm up so well because of the rough night the day before.  Then this day becomes bad also.  When you have to do this 5 times in a row it sets you up for a bad cycle because your schedule won't allow you to rest when you know that is what you need.  Then that pushing becomes a default habit of your voice that you have no time to undo because to undo it requires rest so that your cord closure can return to normal.  Sometimes it is as simple as that.  But I don'T know enough about Sam Smith to be sure if that is the case for him."

He's always sounded like he uses way too much pressure in a very very high mixed voice and he's literally trying to BELT constantly in that area and I think it took its toll.

Extremely durable and good quality for the price point.  The cheapest and simplest complete setup would be that, a combo amp with an XLR input (most keyboard amps fit the bill), as long as a cable as you think you need to move around, and a stand if you need one."
singing,35k1qu,maestro2005,0,Mon May 11 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"Start off with a dynamic mic and a cheap preamp. Even though you don't need phantom power, you may need a condenser later.  For vocals, basically test the gain on your mic, by your vocalist singing and then exhaling, amplify the recording and find which setting gives linearity between the two sounds. That's basically it. 4khz and 400hz can be usefull to cut for low sibilance and echo, respectively.  Condensers are a bit too sensitive for vocals, i don't recommend them unless you can make a huge investment and have a studio.  As far as PA goes, it really depends. It helps to draw up a diagram of how you want your PA system setup, as everyone has different needs."

singing,35irxb,hopefullyhelpfulplz,1 point,Sun May 10 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on what the cause is of this change. When you scream or drink a lot your vocal folds can be swollen in the morning, making your voice deeper. Some people may like this sound but it's not a healthy sound of course and it's usually not very resonant, it'll probably sound better to yourself than it does to others. Swollen chords do not make high notes easier though. If this tired/dirty/whisky voice feels better to you then maybe it is just a more relaxed voice. Whisky and tiredness can have this effect of muscle relaxation, but screaming shouldn't. Anyway, if that is the case then you probably carry some tension in your throat normally, maybe because of bad posture or poor speaking habits. To get rid of that, find ways to keep the throat relaxed.  Of course I'm just guessing, there's no way to tell what's really going on from your post. In general the things you name aren't good for your voice, especially the lack of sleep and screaming are very bad so don't do those things intentionally to get a better voice!"
singing,35ie30,throwawaysobehonest,6,Sun May 10 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"So part of it is about where in the yawn you're thinking about. The ""ideal"" soft palate lift for singing is more like the very beginning of a yawn - when you have an expanded space, but it's not so expanded that it draws your tongue back or overextends your jaw.   You don't want to get to the point where you're actually sending sound through the ear canal (the same thing that happens when you pop your ears at high altitude), but just enough soft palate lift to maximize oral and pharyngeal resonance and reduce nasal resonance.   Does this help answer your question?"

singing,35ird1,ViktorClay,4,Sun May 10 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"people usually think just because someone sings lightly and clean they are less likley to get damage. The thing is singing very lightly is very demanding on the voice both from a technique point of view and from a wear and tear point of view. Add in a tour and tons of interviews loads of singing and talking you are looking at a scenario thats hard for your voice.  Also technique only gets you sofar, ive never had any vocaldamage but i know singers who had maybe twice as good technique as i do that got it. Overuse is one of the big factors in getting damage."
singing,35ird1,keakealani,3,Sun May 10 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"Stronger and weaker aren't the terms I'd use - the vocal cords are themselves muscles, and the strength with which they contract shouldn't have much to do with how easily they get injured.   But vocal injuries do have a lot of different factors, one of which is probably just an individual's propensity to get hurt. But it's also related to things like how well you care for your voice outside of singing (hydration, rest, eating healthy, etc.) and how you use your voice generally. It's not as simple as a linear thing of clean vocals is healthier than screaming/dirty vocals, so the clean guy is going to have less damage. A screamer who is very conscientious about technique and health could totally be doing less damage than a clean singer with bad technique. In addition, speaking habits can affect your vocal health a lot. Even if you sing with healthy technique, you can cause damage by speaking unhealthily.   So in short, yeah, some people might just be more prone to damage, but it's way more complicated than that."
singing,35ird1,Mattpilf,1 point,Sun May 10 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"Do some people have more robust vocal cords? Yep.  Vocal cords are a very complex structure with epithelium, muscle, collagen, and other connective tissue. All of these can very from person to person and hormones, and repair all vary. Just like some professional athletes can have great technique and plagued by injuries at competitive levels. It's theoretically possible for singers too. I for instance have a connective tissue disorder that has a higher incidence of vocal issue long term, just like despite great running technique, I was forced to stop even non competitive running at 23.  Does Sam Smith have poor vocal cord recover compared to James Hetfield? IDK. I mean no one hear has actually trained with Sam Smith to know how his voice behaves, and if there's unhealthy technique going on. It's possible, but he certainly doesn't sound like the worst technique out there.  Heck I've heard people claim that Julie Andrews had poor technique and that's why she got vocal nodes (totally BS, but that's the type of quick to claim people have poor technique that comes around).    Some people with good technique will get injured some time if you are a professional and touring. Poor technique will increase your incidences too, but you can't really compare two different people's recording and say ""well he must have better vocal cords because doesn't get injured."" So much else goes on that it's impossible to know what's causing his injuries."

When you stop smoking, there's a ton of different processes that need to heal and recover, so you will struggle while your voice adjusts.

I really internalized the whole ""support with the diaphragm"" thing to the point where I was clamping in on my abdomen when breathing (which is why I hate that phrase).   I can mention a couple things that helped me but I don't know if any of them will resonate with you.   One is to think of breath support as simply keeping a balance between inhaling and exhaling, with the exhalation muscles just tipping the balance toward exhaling. This helps remind me that I don't need a huge amount of ""push"" or pressure to get my air going, but just a little release.  Another thing that kind of helps is to focus more on the expansion of inhaling than on exhaling. This is going to take some mind tricks to get you out of your habits, but try visualizing your air as being buoyant and expanded. I like to use the visualization of an inner tube around your waist, floating in water. It might even help to physically hold your arms out like you're holding a giant balloon to remind you of that expanded breath.   But yeah, I totally sympathize with this issue - it can be really hard to undo bad habits but being aware is the first step! :)"

Both instrumentalists and singers adopt that mindset - so ""singers"" work less than the instrumentalists because ""well I sound good so I shouldn't have to."" (Something I call the ""American Idol Effect."") Instrumentalists mostly run into these singers and then look down on all singers (not necessarily without right) creating a split.  We are all musicians. Some of us are just shitty.  The more successful a ""singer"" is, the less like a ""singer"" they act in terms of professionalism and negativity. The higher up the ""singing"" foodchain I've gotten (which, we could talk about whether or not that's even a real thing for ages), the fewer shit heads I've come in contact with.   There are a lot of people that just come out of the womb singing well (or so they think, or have been praised to think) without having to work for it. This breeds a narcissism and a cockiness that is unlike that of other musicians. Of course, these singers get far to begin with, but eventually they tap out, because they don't know how to work.   Also, literally anyone can sing. It effectively is cost-free (you don't have to purchase some thousand dollar instrument in order to sound good, and a lot of people self-teach with online videos - which is also a rant for another time.) As such, it's simply a larger pool of people. As the saying goes, a person can be smart, people are dumb. If you've got more people to poll from, the more of them are gonna suck.

Vibrato is a problem because the game won't be able to distinguish the underlying pitch. Plus you would have the tendency to try to emulate other singers (with all the contortion that can bring) because all the songs are learned by ear. There's no training of actual musicianship or aural skills. But, if you do it a lot, it will really ingrain whatever habits you use, and chances are, that won't be perfect technique.

It all depends on your endurance, cord thickness, etc. It's really good that you are aware of how your voice feels.

Warm-ups are more than just some lame exercise to do before you get to the real song, they're to help focus on technique to apply to the song. Chances are, you had those notes the whole time, but something in your technique changed as you focused on intonation that allowed the release of those notes. Eventually muscle memory will take over (even on hard songs), and it'll all flow easily. Like, your guitar is ringing while you're singing? It's great (if your guitar is in tune). The soundwaves that you're making with your voice reverberate off of the guitar strings at the same (in tune) frequency and react to that. It's really cool to do to the inside of a piano sometime too."

singing,358lko,WellHydrated,1 point,Fri May 8 00:36:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well if i examine my throat, it feels like when the mix engages, it contracts at the sides/edges of the thyroarytenoid bump, which keeps it from shooting up. That's just the feeling I'm getting. The larynx still has to rise as you go higher, but it seems like the mix musculature can keep it from shooting up.  I dunno that's my best explanation for the circumstance. And when i say i feel it adjacent to the thyroarytenoid bump, it's totally different than pressure lower in the neck.  The pure mix is a lot more than just a feeling and a lot more than just imagining a low ta bump"
singing,358lko,kamerontenor,1 point,Fri May 8 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"There are certainly ways to support the falsetto! When we use the falsetto mechanism, the vocal cords are vibrating at their absolute thinnest edge and they're not making full contact with each other like they do in full voice. That's why a lot of falsettos sound ""breathy."" Commonly, singers will incorporate a lot of the throat as a support to counteract this breathiness. Instead, it's possible to find a lower support in the body even when using falsetto. In some voices this can sound like a mixed voice or even deceptively like full head tone."
singing,358lko,frankalliance,1 point,Fri May 8 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"Try to get into pure head voice. You can do this by singing gee and go. Pay attention to the feeling of your vocal chords closing when making the g sound.   It helps to say gee or go repeatedly. There's an exercise for this that's actually used at the last few seconds of Justin Timberlake's ""Cry Me a River."" The singer (I think it's Timbaland) is singing in his lower register but you can do that same exercise in a higher register to find pure head voice. It's easy to do it wrong but play around with it and see if you can find head voice without raising your lyyrnx.   edit: added a link"

I am a 29 year old male Englishman living in Virginia USA. I think I am a baritone but not 100% sure  I have had no formal training in singing but I do come from a musical family and have learned to play woodwind instruments.  I have also become involved in the local theater scene and have started doing musicals. I want to see if I can improve my singing so am looking for a critique/feedback.

singing,358hpt,thompssc,2,Sun May 10 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"OK, I've posted here before and generally get comments that I sound either nasally or stuffed up. I think I had previously not been singing ""nasally"" (or at least was improving), but I think what people were hearing was me singing/breathing from my chest instead of my diaphragm. I say this because I just figured out how to breathe from my diaphragm :). And I can hear that my sound is much more open and relaxed when I do it successfully. However. I still have to think very hard about breathing from there and supporting my breath from there, and focus on not doing everything from my chest.   I'm putting this out for feedback just because its hard to critique my own voice. I know it's not very musical, in that I'm singing everything loud and without much expression. I'm just focusing very heavily on the breath aspect of it right now. So I'm not looking for feedback on musicality, as I'll address that later.

singing,358hpt,Thandius,1 point,Fri May 8 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"One thing that helped me to practice using my diaphragm was forcing myself to project my voice (for theater also playing a woodwind instrument helped too!), pretend your singing (or speaking) to someone on the other side of a room slightly larger than the one your in but make sure your not ""Shouting"" as that will distort your voice. If you practice singing or speaking like that it should help improve your use of the diaphragm so you don't have to think about it so much and it becomes second nature.  Are you a Bass? I would love to hear you speak a few lines with your regular speaking voice to compare, try and place if your singing in your natural register, as it seemed some of the lower notes were a little... not sure if forced is the right word.  any way that's my 2 cents (no professional singing training but come from a musical background so take my suggestions with a grain of salt :) )."

singing,358hpt,LordNode,1 point,Fri May 8 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"The main issue I notice with your singing is that the low parts are way too nasal. Is this because you haven't developed your upper register enough, and find that this produces a more consistent sound to your falsetto?  If you want to sing in the style of Sam Smith then you basically need to be a master of mixing your lower and upper register, which you don't seem to demonstrate here. For example: if you listen to the chorus in the original (""you say I'm crazy""), Sam says 'say...' in a very light mix, almost in falsetto, then he smoothly adds more closure for 'I'm crazy...' to produce a very light but powerful sound. Whereas in your version you remain in falsetto for the whole thing and add no closure, which doesn't sound nearly as interesting.  You should try finding videos that focus on mixing, and cord closure. Once you improve this you should find you don't need to use such a nasal sound, and you'll be able to add more power to your whole range, and you won't have to rely on your falsetto so much."

Pick something impressive, but not outside your fach. If you don't know your vocal limits, that will be pretty obvious.  Then, they will have you sight-read a piece. It's pretty easy, something in latin that moves stepwise. Palestrina or something like that. The accompanist will play the other parts.  After that, they will have you recall pitches. This involves the accompanist playing a series of 5 notes, then you sing them back. This happens maybe 5 times. This was the hardest part for me, honestly. They get pretty tricky.  And that's it. You're auditioning for Steven Zopfi, the director. He's really nice and understanding. The assistant director and maybe some of the section leaders might be there. It's really fun to sing with them, though next season all we're doing with the symphony is the 9th. Not my favorite big choral work.

It sounds like he is just shouting as hard as he can and his voice is distorting. Healthy distortion doesn't sound like that. If you really want it just sing really loud and hard till your voice breaks up.
singing,35517b,Yex00,1 point,Thu May 7 19:49:46 2015 UTC,Can you give me an example of healthy distortion and how to do it? (I really don't want to fuck up my voice and would greatly appreciate advice on how to do it!)
singing,35517b,Yex00,1 point,Thu May 7 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Dio would be a good example of healthy distortion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhGEGIBGLu8  Healthy distortion is created separate from the vocals cords and is a sound laid upon a vocal sound, not the basis of it.  Young Chris Cornell is another good example of healthy distortion, but only on some songs. On many songs he uses improper and damaging distortion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAezfl61t9w  The best way I can describe is try to make the sound of a distorted electric guitar with your voice. Try to sing a riff like Highway From Hell. Thats where I learned how to do the basis of the technique, from there it takes refinement and a lot of practice. It's a tough technique to do because you have to stay firmly within your limits and support your sound very well. If your support is weak or if you distort too aggressively you risk hurting yourself.   The best thing you can do is get a teacher and work with them on the sound you want."
singing,35517b,donutglaze123,1 point,Thu May 7 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with Yex00. That kind of sound is the result of high tension in the muscles above and around the larynx. Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to make this sound without some painful muscling. You can even see in the video that the singer's neck veins are bulging, a sign of singing with way too many muscles involved.  You should focus on making sure your singing feels comfortable and not painful or overly-tensed in any way. I should point out that this singer you provided a link to is constantly singing with too much muscle involvement, even when there is no ""distortion"". If your overall singing technique is healthy and efficient, you can make distortions as you see fit, but make sure that they occur on occasion. As long as these distortions occur a few times per song, it won't do much harm, although I can't promise you won't feel hoarse or tense from it."
singing,354peu,nicetl,3,Thu May 7 02:10:56 2015 UTC,Are you doing vocal warm ups before singing? You're probably singing notes that are near the top of your range or right at the breaking point.
singing,354peu,carlwehden,1 point,Thu May 7 05:15:12 2015 UTC,I do warm up extensively before shows and rehearsals so I don't think that's the issue (I could perhaps try incorporating some new exercises though).  These notes are towards the top of my 'natural' range but I have to transition into 'head voice' (I think that's the correct term for the register) and that's not actually one of the notes which I struggle with.  I've been reading a bit in these comments about 'transition points'/'passagio' which sounds like a plausible explanation.
singing,354peu,carlwehden,2,Thu May 7 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"Do you have a recording of the song? Would really need to hear it to give you specific feedback. Songs that sit in the bridge area for significant amounts of time will really test the quality of your technique. If it's not perfect it will quickly become obvious something isn't quite right.  Likely the vocal cords aren't doing what they need to in order to sustain many notes in the passage area, you can take in as much air as you want but if that air isn't meeting the right kind of resistance at the vocal cords then the end result could sound any number of ways. The biggest factor in determining the clearness and quality of the sounds you make is the quality and efficiency of the coordination's the vocal cords are making, from there you can worry about balancing that coordination with the right amount of air. If the coordination isn't quite correct then it will always result in an undesirable and unpredictable sound no matter how much support you give the sound.  To address the problem you just need to get better and improve your skills, there are many coaches and programs out there that can help you get better. Consistent focused practice over a long period of time, with an end goal of extremely easy natural technique is the only real solution to any and all vocal problems.

singing,354peu,hollywoodL,2,Thu May 7 22:34:56 2015 UTC,"I used to have this often it's mostly a case of the technique being there but not fully trusted and solidified to always lock in.   What I found happened is that I would get it spot on but if there was any problem I would start to get less comfortable which would lead me to squeezing a tiny bit on certain words to 'help', when I'd do this it would immediately create more problems which I would squeeze on more and basically create a circle where I was becoming less comfortable and the squeeze to 'help' would create more problems.   Sometimes the technique is 'almost' correct, or the vast majority of it is totally correct but a couple of words here and there can cause things to come down like a house of cards if you don't trust the broader technique and worry to much about small details.

It's not about you being a baritone or tenor, I'm a baritone but sing above that range easily and consistently and never get hoarse. The reason is because my technique has got better over the years.

With good technique you should be able to sing for hours every day and never ever get hoarse.

singing,353uvs,1alexisawesome1,2,Fri May 8 00:52:51 2015 UTC,Well if you aren't getting hoarse consistently when singing then it could well be you're just under the weather. It's often hard to tell the difference between being under the weather and your technique being a little off in spots. One of the tough parts of singing is that 90% of your technique can be healthy and it may just be certain vowels on certain pitches that are vocalized in an unhealthy way. Keep it in mind and be careful you only have one voice! :)   I'm sure you'll get past C5 with some more practice.  Carl  https://www.youtube.com/user/cwehden/videos  http://carlwehden.tumblr.com
singing,353u8c,InterstellarFerret,3,Wed May 6 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"You need to find some closure on the edges of the cords from there you can add presence easily but often people mistake that light head voice for a disconnected tone and they let the vocal cords come apart completely. When this happens you won't really have anything to lean on and it will feel less predictable and like you can't make it any louder. It will also mean if you don't know what you are doing outer muscles will be more likely to start interfering with the mechanism to compensate especially as you sing higher into head voice. If you want to hear a well coordinated legit style head voice Thom Yorke is a great example in this performance.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZl6BRY9IYQ  The way to get it to work more consistently is with exercises that combine some closure with a heady sound like 'gee' and 'goo' the G helps you get some cord closure which gives you some grip on the sound, the narrow vowel will keep it heady and light, from that foundation you can start working in other vowels and more range without allowing the vocal cords to come apart and disconnect.

singing,34zfl0,ingenstempus,3,Tue May 5 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"Well Bb1 and C2 are really quite low, so the fact that you can actually hit those is impressive on its own! That's good you don't fry them and you also shouldn't worry about making them resonate. Notes this extreme on the spectrum can take a very long time to resonate fully. Remember, low notes require much more air at a much lower pressure than high notes do, therefore low notes should feel more relaxed and not nearly as compressed as mid/high range notes.   If I were you I would do scales every day on varying vowels around your lower range. Please practice very lightly and not loud at all. Get comfortable with the feeling of low notes, and get used to the fact that, for quite a while, depending on how much you practice, they will not be resonant and full like you want them to be. Every so often, practice a scale whose lowest note is your limit (Bb1). Then, keep doing those scales over and over again that until you are comfortable with the note. By comfortable, I mean that you can hit it and have it be a clean, solid pitch without any mental hesitation. This can take days or weeks or months depending on how much you practice. I would suggest practicing every day. Once you are comfortable with that lowest note, start practicing scales whose limit is a half step down than the previous one. Try not to practice in this area for more than 10-15 minutes, as it can over-tire the larynx.  Also, remember, everyone has a limit in the voice, so if you have been attempting to expand the lower range of your voice and after many times practicing, it doesn't come or it flips or it starts to hurt, leave it alone and work on your voice where you are comfortable."
singing,34zfl0,donutglaze123,2,Tue May 5 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"You can polish your technique, but you typically can't 'expand' your voice downwards without extreme measures like smoking, drinking, screaming yourself hoarse, sleeping 14 hours per day, eating hormone pills (?), etc.  You could learn mongolian throat singing though, it gives you a 4th or so extra, but the timbre is on the harsh side."
singing,34zfl0,Masklin,2,Tue May 5 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with donutglaze and Masklin. If you can hit those not without vocal fry, you are pretty much doing everything correctly. You won't be able to belt the bottom fourth of your voice. It will always be much softer.   Even many basso profundo can't belt a Bb1 or even a C2. To do that requires even more of a  low voice than most basso profundos. That why most opera pieces for them almost never go below E2, and only one requires a D2, and thus only done by some of them. C2's even less. Voices like these require until mid 30's often to develop resonance down there, and given all odds, you very probably aren't one of them. Much more likely you are a low baritone or high bass, and with time(mid 20's+) and practice and ability to hit notes in your head voice(even heavy basses can hit F4's), you can find out if your voice type is. Then you'll realize whether you'll ever be able to loudly sing a C2(probably not).   Focus more on clarity, clean resonance, and some brightness and musical quality in the voice in the low end over power. A nice sounding C2 and a microphone is 100 times better than an ugly C2 with moderate power. In time, your low notes will comes, if they do at all."
singing,34zfl0,Mattpilf,0,Wed May 6 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"Those lower notes, like the basso profundo/ contrabass, are in the fry register. You can either choose fry or certain kargyraa. the vocal cords only go so low before having to use fry. just keep practicing on those low notes and don't be discouraged if can't hit them. Aim for a D1 in vocal fry and see how powerful you can make it."

Some days are just great days, even for the voice. Regardless of that, what is really going to empower your belting voice is low breath support. Look into training  your diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing. The best thing is to get it straight from another singer who knows what's up, and who can demonstrate well what they are talking about.  Next best is to do some reading and a lot of trial and error with your own singing, but you can end up wasting a lot of time trying things that aren't correct, and since belting is similar to ""flooring it"" in a car, you might do some damage to your chords if you are attempting it improperly. Best of luck!"

singing,34wije,xarahn,4,Tue May 5 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"What is your formal training/experience? I think it's important to keep in mind that timbre can be greatly altered by what you're doing in terms of resonance and articulation, and this is particularly true if you're studying a non-classical style or don't have extensive classical training. This isn't one of those ""classical vs. others"" things, it's the fact that voice types were designed with a classical mode of production in mind, so if you aren't singing classically it's very hard to say what your ""natural"" timbre is anyway, much less whether or not that can affect voice classification.   Also, 18 is simply too young to be commenting about this much at all. Male voices tend not to fully develop into the mid-late 20s, and a LOT can change both in terms of timbre and in terms of range/tessitura. It would be more accurate to guess the outcome of the 2020 presidential election than to give an accurate assessment on an 18-year-old's voice type. I've heard voices from this age and into the mid 20s go in just about every possible direction, so I just think it's not the best use of your time or energy."
singing,34wije,keakealani,2,Tue May 5 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"a light timbre and light falsetto 'might' be good indicators that you are a high voice, like a tenor, even if you have a heavy voice to begin with."
singing,34wije,carlwehden,2,Tue May 5 06:59:14 2015 UTC,"A large part of your final classification comes down to the level of skill and type of technique you employ. Most of the problems you describe are due to a lack of technique not due to the type of voice you have.   Get better and as you get better you'll develop one voice with no breaks, and it will go much higher than most other singers. The way to get better is just practice, the right kind of practice, a teacher can guide you. Also there are programs like Singing Success can also help a great deal.

The best way to start doing this is just by matching notes on the piano (or another instrument that can play in the human range). This might be difficult in the beginning, but once you ""get it"", it'll become much easier very fast and it'll do wonders for your singing.   Once you have the concept of pitch down, you can start working on technique and performance and all of that jazz.  Also, I think this song is maybe a little high for you, so you might find it easier singing songs that are a bit lower in your range.   Best of luck!"

singing,34td05,ditmann,1 point,Wed May 6 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"This was quite a lot better!  Next thing you should work on is breath support. It sounds like your voice sometimes loses alot of power, especially when you do the bigger leaps pitch wise, which probably means that you lose your support. Your teacher probably has lots of excercises for this.  This is a tricky thing to get down, and it took me a long time before I started doing it correctly, but it's one of the most important things when you sing.  You should also work on raising your soft palate to create a more broad and open sound, because you have a tendency to sound very ""closed"" which restricts you from more easily reaching the higher notes.

After the word ""here"" at the start, try sustaining the note for a bit longer, and at ""joker to the thief"" try to just sing ""thief"" like in most versions since I think you go off pitch for it, this will sound really good I think. Else than that you have quite good control of your voice and a good sound!"

I'll warn you now my band sings with a broad scottish accent haha.  https://soundcloud.com/vote-for-lust/roll-with-the-punches-demo/s-XTraT  I was having a good day in that recording so it's no where near as bad as it was at the gig. I only mentioned fry cause it feels like the same as when i did fry metal screaming a couple times.
singing,34tmi2,HerkyJerky12,1 point,Tue May 5 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, so bear in mind I'm still learning myself and that this isn't really the kind of think I am personally familiar with, so I could be talking out of my arse.  I am going to assume you did this all in one take. It sounds to me like part way through your voice is getting tired, specifically at 1:37. I can hear a warble in your voice that sounds like hoarseness creeping in.  It sounds to me like instead of having a nice connected mix which you can then add vocal compression to, to get the grit and dirt you're looking for, instead you're pushing your chest voice up into your head vocal range. That's why your high-notes are turning into screams, because you're pulling your larynx higher than neutral position. A tell tale sign of this is if you feel a squeeze in your throat, and you feel like you're pushing too much air or if anything hurts/is uncomfortable.  When you do your high-notes, are you feeling them more in your chest or do you feel them causing vibrations just under the eyes where your ""mask"" is??  What I'd suggest is trying a version of the song without any grit or dirt in your voice at all. If you cannot hit those notes without adding the dirt, then you need to go back to basics with developing a mixed voice. Which means thinning out your chest voice somewhat so that you're not carrying so much weight up into your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th registers. It all starts there imho.  Not to say it sounds bad at all. For the style you're going for, you're heading in the right direction I think!"

singing,34rvyn,CRG_,5,Mon May 4 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"Start with the FAQ here. But as a pianist, you should already know that the safest, healthiest, and most efficient way to learn an instrument is by studying with a qualified teacher. A lot of instrumentalists believe that because they passed their college sight singing or already know how to read music that they basically know how to sing and don't need lessons! This is false! (Also it contributes to the really offensive and damaging stereotype that singers aren't ""real musicians""). Even if you're only looking to sing as a hobby, a few lessons will go a long way toward giving you a good foundation in technique.   That being said, I do want to make some suggestions. I know pianists like to practice 8-10 hours a day, but you cannot safely do this as a singer. The vocal cords are much smaller and more delicate than the large arm muscles used in piano, and especially as a beginner it's best to be mindful and not hurt yourself from over singing. I generally recommend 2-4 30-minute sessions of practice, punctuated by a fairly substantial break, as a good maximum for beginners. This is still plenty of time to learn a lot, but also to be pretty sure you aren't hurting yourself.   You can also spend a lot of time outside of actually singing to practice. You can (and should) translate and analyze your texts. You can practice breathing exercises (although if you phonate during your breathing exercises count that as singing practice). You can learn one of the major languages of singing (French, German, Italian, and English) including their diction rules for singing. (Yes, even if you speak English you can learn about rules for sung English diction that differ from the spoken language). You can learn the International Phonetic Alphabet and practice applying it to singing.   Anywho, I'm not sure how you got the impression that singing has to do with genetics because it really does not (and again, reinforces damaging stereotypes that singing isn't a skill).   Also as a pianist you are probably quite aware that you won't see much noticeable improvement in just a few months. I've been singing in choirs for around 15 years and taken lessons for around 6 years and I still barely feel like I'm scratching the surface of my full potential as a singer. So just be mindful of that and don't push yourself beyond your limits."
singing,34rvyn,keakealani,2,Mon May 4 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"Wow this is an excellent write up, thanks a ton!  Yeah I definitely agree with the practicing part, I'm nearing 10 years as a pianist and Im not even close to a tenth of my potential!   You're definitely right about a teacher, I really shouldn't try to self teach something I know nothing about, and I have connections to college teachers so I have 0 excuse.  You referred to the language and punctuating thing and it makes sense, but I'm a but confused to be honest.  Are there any books I could read that would teach correct English singing phonetics?    And the genetic thing, while I know from reliable sources isn't entirely true, has been pushed on me my whole life, my parents still are making fun of me for wanting to learn to sing since they say that I'm just not build for it (ironically neither of them are remotely musicians nor do they know any).  I just meant that I know my voice won't be something incredible because it is partially genetic, but I also know that I can learn to sing, and learn to sing well.  Just like how I could learn cello, of never be Yoyo Ma, but I could still he a great cellist.  Finally, I actually didn't know that it was bad to practice too much.  I can play piano all day for fun and be fine.  It makes sense though, as I've gone hoarse before from yelling a lot.   Thanks again for the reply BTW!!!"
singing,34rvyn,keakealani,3,Mon May 4 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"You referred to the language and punctuating thing and it makes sense, but I'm a but confused to be honest. Are there any books I could read that would teach correct English singing phonetics?    Absolutely! This is the textbook my university uses for our diction classes, which has some information for singing in English, Italian, Latin, German, French, and Spanish - more than enough to get you started. It is a textbook so it can be a tad pricey, but at least it's a paperback and really, not too bad for what you get from it. You can probably also search for other books, I'm just not familiar with them because this is the one I use.    I just meant that I know my voice won't be something incredible because it is partially genetic   This is only really, really tangentially true. The human voice is capable of a huge range of possible sounds, which means that, at least in my opinion, every single human being can harness their potential to have a pretty amazing singing voice. Not just okay, but pretty great. I do think it has a lot to do with perseverance, body awareness, and interest, which I suppose are somewhat innate, but that's true of pretty much everything - it's the same as saying that being a great computer programmer has a genetic component.   A lot of people get caught up in the physicality of singing - because we use our bodies to produce sound, the logic goes, then the quality of sound we produce must be related to what our bodies look like or act like. This is true in the sense that your body determines things like your voice type and range capacity, but it's not true in terms of an objective quality - just because your range may be different than another person's doesn't mean you're a better or worse singer. I just feel like a lot of people place this weird mystique on singing beyond even other instruments and it contributes a lot to this ""othering"" of singers that I don't like and I think is ultimately harmful both to singers and to other musicians. But anyway, that's probably mostly my personal hangup so that's the end of that rant XD   Finally, I actually didn't know that it was bad to practice too much. I can play piano all day for fun and be fine. It makes sense though, as I've gone hoarse before from yelling a lot.    Yeah, the voice is really fragile compared to other instruments. Basically the main thing actually producing sound is your vocal folds, which are two tiny pieces of flesh that are only a couple centimeters in length at the most, and are protected by a thin layer of skin and some mucous membranes. Not exactly the hardiest creature.   So yeah, I don't want to scare you, but be careful! Too much overuse or abuse of your voice can actually lead to some pretty serious damage, so it's best not to push it imo.   I'm glad I was able to help and feel free to ask any more questions! :)"

singing,34rvyn,carlwehden,2,Mon May 4 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"Hi CRG_ personally I'd recommend keeping in mind and consistently applying some of the following ideas.   Sing at least 1 hour - 6 days a week, preferably 2 hours. Never sing higher than you can freely and easily, good singing is in many ways much easier than most people realise, keep that in mind. If it feels like you are having to hold on excessively or if you feel any pain it's wrong. Keep in mind if you are starting singing as a second instrument you will have a huge advantage over singers that haven't grown up playing music. Learning the voice is in many ways exactly the same as learning any other instrument the more you can realize and embrace this the quicker and more effectively you'll learn.  Belief in the talent paradigm will put a ceiling on your potential, belief in the learning paradigm will make your potential limitless. Work with a teacher but do some research and find one you can trust. They need to give you some sense that they have knowledge of things that you want to develop and get better at.  Get a program personally I would recommend 'Singing Success 360' however you might do research and go another direction the choice is yours. A program will give you a system that you can repeat every day. It covers the 'what should I practice?' problem. Have fun. It takes time, just like learning guitar or piano results come from years of consistent work not days or weeks. The sooner you start the sooner you'll get good but always remember there are no short cuts to mastery it takes time and huge amounts of work.   Best of luck.

This is somewhat harder for pop music, but most well-known pop songs (certainly many older ones) now have scores available in anthologies or on sites like musicnotes.com.

You hear not only the sound that goes from your mouth to your ears, but you also hear the sound being conducted through your bones and skull.

You slide around a lot rather than distinctly hitting notes.  Some manner of sliding can be used in a purposeful, stylistic manner, but that is not the case here.  I would break down the song phrase by phrase, decide on consistent places to breathe, and work on hitting the notes appropriately and with the desired articulation.  If you can, work alongside a piano or guitar to check your notes.  Also, record your phrase, listen back to it, make conscious decisions on what to change, then attempt it until you get it right."

Your aim shouldn't be to get random people with varying opinions on the internet to give you approval, but to perform at your event to the best of your current abilities.  I recommend learning to develop an objective ear to know whether or not you sound 'okay' on your own.  If you can't, get a teacher.  If you can, get a teacher anyway.  In addition, a good critique shouldn't overwhelm you with negatives, so you aren't going to hear about everything you could do better at once.  Instead, take the major points you get, improve on them, and next time you will get something different to work on.  To me, you sound like a fan of 90s punk rock singing along to Sinatra on the radio in your car.  Does that mean ""it's okay?""  Doesn't that depend on what you want to sound like?"

Make sure your sound guy has you at a level where you can hear yourself over the rest of the band, or you will start yelling to compensate and blow out your voice.  Even if you know that you're oversinging, it's hard to overcome the habit.  Making sure your vocals are loud enough in the monitors is the only solution.  You do eventually learn to feel where certain notes are in your voice, but that takes time, and you don't want to get in the habit of not being able to hear yourself onstage."

This might be hard in a small space due to feedback so you have to strike a balance.

I'm far from good at singing, but in my opinion you should start even sorter, almost like a whisper, but build up the power in each phrase so it's more interesting to listen to, and it eludes to you being able to use more power. Because right now the start of the song gives the impression the whole thing will sound weak.  For example: if you listen to the start of Sam Smith's 'Stay With Me', it starts off very light, and some parts of it are much lighter than your singing. But the main difference is that each phrase at the start contain a lot of dynamics, and makes it more interesting to listen to."

singing,34mdoy,carlwehden,2,Sat May 2 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"This has some good ideas in it you're doing well. The reason you like those long 'si----gh' notes towards the end is that they are balanced and free of clutter. Your whole voice will sound like that when you improve and get better.   Staying as calm and comfortable as possible will help a great deal.  Accept that there is a learning process with singing just like anything else. Many problems will just get weeded out over time as you improve.  There are exercises that can help you feel less inhibited and more free when you use your voice. It comes down to getting out of the way and discovering your voice rather than forcing it. It will gradually open like a flower if you stay relaxed and be open and vulnerable and in a frame of mind that is congruent with learning. Make many mistakes, in many ways being comfortable singing badly is one of the biggest steps you can take as a singer. Embracing mistakes are the key to learning and developing, just like a skateboarder trying the same trick over and over again until they get it right.

singing,34n8dr,y_r_u_shooting,6,Sat May 2 18:28:38 2015 UTC,"A musical ""pitch"" is simply a vibration at a certain frequency. Lower frequencies produces lower notes, while higher frequencies produce higher notes.  When an instrument (even vocals) gets played, it produces a fundamental frequency and several extra frequencies, called overtones. The fundamental frequency is the name of the note being hit, (A through G, along with the sharp/flat terminology that you've probably heard), while the overtone frequencies are added extras. The specific combination/volume of all these overtones produce an instrument's unique sound, or timbre. Timbre is what makes a piano sound different from a trumpet - they could be playing the same ""note"" (with the same fundamental frequency), but the overtones allow you to distinguish between them.  Now that THAT'S out of the way.  Hitting a note means matching the fundamental frequency - that's it.   What you're talking about with ""I just hear people singing in a voice that fits perfectly along to the instruments that are playing"" means that the singer is singing in the ""key"" of the song. A key is basically just a bunch of interrelated notes that sound ""nice"" together.   If you want more specific advice, feel free to PM me."
singing,34n8dr,Fallbourn,2,Sun May 3 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what you mean but that has more to do with a audio engineer mindset then vocalist mindset (even though I am also a vocalist)  basicly what you are aiming for to keep it more in layman terms is if you sing a note doesnt matter any note, maybe the one you listen to in a song you like or just a random note on a piano. The aim is to make the note be in ""harmony"" with each other the best way to notice when its spot on is if it sounds in your head and feels like the note you are singing disappears. The reason for this is that the more off the note is the more presence/bite it gets and the more annoying. A funny fact even is if we use autotune nowadays and pitch correct a vocal the vocalist will actually disappear into the music.  Tips on figuring out what sensation it is like on finding a note if you are not familiar with it is. Just sing as you speak just sing that note the one you speak in most frequently and maybe say ""hey"" in make it a really long HEEEEEEEEEEEY and hold that. Now instead of matching your voice to the note you hear instead use a synth/keyboard or any other instrument to find the note you are actually singing. Or if you have a friend that plays an instrument ask them to help you find the note. Someone who plays a instrument has a better perception of what note is being played and where to find it on a instrument.  You'll notice the closer you are to an instruments pitch the less your perception of your voice becomes."

Like any skill, learning to differentiate pitch can take practice and exposure - if you didn't get really strong music education growing up you probably just aren't as practiced at it compared to someone with more experience."

singing,34n8dr,heart_of_blue,1 point,Sun May 3 05:40:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like when you hear a note and try to sing it, you are either too low or too high, and you don't know what it'll be until you hear that something is off, then you have to adjust your pitch up and down until it matches. Being able to ""hit a note"" means that you can listen to a note and then match that exact note immediately and without making adjustments. You know you'll be in tune before you've made a sound. This requires a combination of being able to properly hear pitch, and having the muscle memory and vocal skill to reproduce the pitch you hear. If you're tone deaf, you probably have a lot of trouble with the first bit.    Do you have access to a piano? Do you have a bit of basic music theory? It may help you to play scales on the piano and try to sing along. If your pitch sounds off, then play keys above and below to try and find where you actually are. It's a simple way to see visually whether you're flat (too low) or sharp (too high), and by how much (a semi-tone? a whole tone? several tones?). Also keep in mind that it's possible to be in tune with the music, but singing in a different octave. For example, if you're male and singing along to a song performed by a female soprano vocalist, you are probably not going to match her exact pitch, because her vocal range is much higher than yours. But you can sing the exact same song to the same backing music, just in a lower octave, and still be in tune.   It's also possible to change the key of a song, and be in tune relative to the new key. This is because pitch is relative. Looking on the piano, an octave is 8 keys. You could move a song up or down the keyboard, and it might not be the key specified in the sheet music, but you'll still recognize the melody because the relative pitch of the notes will be the same. Another visual example is guitarists using capos. If I start playing a song and find that the key the song is written in is too low for my voice, I can use the capo to quickly change the tuning of all the strings at once, instead of having to retune the guitar or rearrange the whole song.   If you have a friend who can sing, ask them to listen while you sing with a recording, and they can identify right away when you're sharp or flat. That feed back might help too.   Lastly, have you been tested for amusia? If you are truly tone deaf, you can still enjoy singing but it may never be something that you can improve much in. Sorry if that's hard news to take."
singing,34n8dr,CheapBastid,1 point,Tue May 5 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"I know that when I hear myself singing to a song that it sounds off, and that it's not quite right, but I still don't understand the concept of ""hitting"" a note - what does this exactly encompass? When I'm trying to adjust my voice to the song, what exactly am I looking for?   Conceptually one way to think about it is that you're overlapping targets.  Think of a specific note like a Crosshair Target.  When you are singing along to that note you're making another crosshair target, when they perfectly overlap you're 'in tune' and you've 'hit the note'.  If we just think about them on a vertical track, if you're not 'right on' the note you're going to either be higher or lower.  Since you can't 'see' the crosshairs it takes some practice to 'hear' if you're higher or lower than the target, and some practice to be able to very slightly adjust to hit it.  The big training is to 'imagine' the note in your mind and overlap the crosshairs and then throw out your target and hit it.  That's what trained and skilled singers can do."
singing,34lf04,harmeety,8,Sat May 2 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"I've been doing that since I was 12 or 13.   Know what you're playing by heart, if you have to focus too much on playing guitar, you're losing focus on singing. Know your lyrics and melody by heart, if you have to focus too much on your voice, you're losing focus on your guitar.   (I think if you must have one of the two down perfectly, make it be the guitar part, I personally find guitar becomes muscle memory and while singing also does, it's harder for me to have perfect voice control than perfect guitar playing)  The biggest mistake people will do is they will change chords when they change lyrics or change lyrics when they change chords etc... This is why you need to get both down perfectly before attempting to sing while playing.  In my experience, the melody of the lyrics needs to be known by heart, so does the guitar part you're playing. From there, you have to practice doing both at the same time without messing either up.   Start by trying to play the guitar part while speaking the lyrics so you don't really have to focus too much on the notes you're singing, just pay attention and make sure you stay on-time both on your guitar and your voice.  If your problem is melody instead of lyrics, hum the vocal melody while playing your guitar.  I think coordination from learning drums helped me with this as well.  From there, I don't really know about any magic miracle thing. Practice makes perfect.  When I bought my first acoustic at age 12 or so, I mainly bought it to sing with in my room. It took me a LOT of time to get it down (a couple months of doing just that (after school obviously)) and even today I'm pretty average at guitar (but that's because I'm mainly a singer and don't practice guitar so much). I'm good enough at guitar to play rhythm while singing and even some lead parts. I think this makes me (and will make you) a very valuable asset to a band if you work hard and get good at both.  Hope this helps man, good luck."

Sometimes I'll watch tv while I'm doing it so I can try and practice not thinking about it.  Eventually I'll be able to separate the two things (singing/playing).

Of course tricky bits are always going to require concentration and extra practice,  but a few months in its gonna come a lot easier than now, and a few months after that it will get to be like second nature.

singing,34lf04,otompotom,2,Sat May 2 14:19:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed with this. All the previous advice plays into the process of singing while playing, but the ""perfect your guitar, then your singing, then throw them together"" bit is too often hocked as the whole story, I think.    If you want to perform a perfect rendition of the song, then yes, you will have to learn how to play the guitar perfectly and sing the lyrics perfectly, without much conscious thought. But that doesn't really explain how you marry the two in the first place. Starting at a slow tempo with a metronome is a good start. Try to talk/hum/sing the lyrics that land on the beat or accented subdivisions of the beat. You need to hear how the guitar and vocals relate to be the beat and to each other. Play the guitar part with only chords if you have to. After a few times through, the rest of the lyrics should start to fill in. You can start to fill in the guitar as you see fit.    The point is to relate everything to the beat. When you become comfortable doing that, you might see you are able to play and sing parts of songs right off the bat."
singing,34lf04,carlwehden,1 point,Sat May 2 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"Keeping the beat with your foot will help with singing especially during riffs, lead and finger-picking parts. For me, I like the aesthetic of a microphone more than I need it for practice (singing into a an mic with headphones>acoustic amp is cool) If you are covering songs, harmonize with the original recording, sing loudly and resonate. Try different ranges, sing songs you love from outside your genre.  Mind you, I don't even have a band, or any complete songs, or much experience. So take it for what it's worth."

singing,34l26z,keakealani,1 point,Sat May 2 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge supporter, but it can be better than nothing. I do feel that technology out there is just not ideal for the lesson situation - even the tiniest little bit of lag can cause issues coordinating basic activities, such as singing while the teacher plays piano, or can cause skips in sound that might be very important from the teacher's perspective. In addition, you would need a pretty good mic and speaker system just to be able to hear high enough quality audio to make accurate diagnoses and hear issues, and also quality video, ideally of the full body, to note physical concerns or work on posture. (And the extra data needed to ensure this quality means expensive Internet, often limited to people in urban centers). Losing out on these areas can make online lessons significantly more challenging, leading to a lot lower value for the student and therefore usually low pay for the teacher (after purchasing and maintaining equipment), which means you're less likely to find online lessons given by the same caliber teacher as one who gives live lessons.   I think if you're going to invest in lessons at all, you might as well invest in good ones, but that's just me. If online lessons are your only option it is better than nothing at all, you just need to be aware that you may get less value and progress may be slower than in a live situation."

You high notes are not the problem; your high notes right now are a symptom of your current breath support. There's nothing wrong with a good G#4 at your age, it's actually a pretty good range.   Unfortunately, what works for one person may not work for another. There's no one video or chart that will perfect your breathing apparatus. Right now, you want to have powerful high notes, correct? What are you doing to accomplish that? Probably tightening your abs as much as possible. This causes your vocal folds to have to push super hard together, creating a rougher sound that is full of tension. This is probably present throughout your range, but especially on the top end. Exercises you should be doing should emphasize a lyric, legato sound. Not choppy, not grabby, but gentle and with each note connected to the other. Sliding warm ups (not sirens) are really nice for this, because every note has to be connected to every other one. You need to read the FAQ section on breath support and REALLY pay attention to it.

Step back and really devote energy to building a core middle voice, and the highs will come. Besides, your voice is nowhere near mature so it's hard to know what your range will settle to be.

Also, I think you need to work a little on your enunciation, as I really had to concentrate to hear what you were saying.

I too have a quiet/soft voice, and if I try belting out louder stuff it can often sound like total shit.

Your natural inclination is approaching the note from underneath, which (whilst perfectly fine for contemporary music generally speaking) is vocally taxing on long notes. As an exercise, try sighing down to the 'goal' note from about a minor third above.   Secondly, you could look into a slightly more classical/choral approach which involves using space at the back of the mouth (search ""soft palate lift"" if you want to get started; it's quite a lot of info so I won't include it all here) - this produces a more resonant and less 'pressed' sound, which makes it easier to sustain over long notes."

singing,34gmxc,LordNode,1 point,Sat May 2 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. The issue with your high notes is you're sending the sound to the wrong area in your mouth/head, thus the resonance is inconsistent to your lower parts. To fix this you need to work on lifting your soft palette, and probably work on your chest/head coordination. You can probably find good YouTube videos for this stuff."

To my ears there's a lot more dynamics (e.g. changes in pitch & volume), and certain words are longer than what you'd normally hear in speech. So while it's not full on singing, it's certainly a good blend between singing and talking. Now that I listen to yours again, I suppose yours does contain many of these elements to differentiate it from talking, so perhaps the main thing that threw me off was you singing it in a lower octave, thus making it sound like a typical male talking voice.

If you're having issues with, say, the extrinsic laryngeal muscles that can definitely have an effect on singing (which I guess tangentially relates to breathing). Some other muscle groups are less involved, though. And in general I think the issues with the neck are mostly going to surround the larynx rather than breathing which mostly occurs below that point.   Anyway, like I said, it's hard to know what is at play with your description (and also requisite disclaimer that I'm not a doctor and medical advice on the internet is sketchy).

If she's majoring in music, she's probably learning classical technique (operatic) in which vibrato is encouraged. It may not yet be perfected as she's still a student, which could be why you find it distracting. You also may find it distracting simply because it's something you're not used to. It's hard to say without a recording of her. (Please do not post a recording of her - it is against the sidebar rules to post recordings of someone other than yourself.)

However, the performer ideally will learn to adjust how wide the vibrato is depending on the scenario. Like /u/ghoti023 said, solo operatic will likely have the widest vibrato.  Any performer should not use so wide of a vibrato, intentionally or unintentionally, to mask what note is actually supposed to be sung. And in an ensemble setting, vibrato should be kept within the range of relatively narrow to non-existent depending on the piece (e.g. for style and blend) and the director's preference."
singing,34e7gf,Khashoggi,3,Thu Apr 30 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"Vibrato is often a difficult thing to moderate for young singers, too. The goal, generally, is to start out with a very free, relaxed tone with whatever vibrato is naturally occurring. From there, it's possible to learn how to change and shape the vibrato, but this process needs to be approached with caution that the singer is not just constricting the throat to control the vibrato. In my experience, this tends to occur late in undergrad or in grad school for most collegiate singers, both because of age and because of experience."

This is actually better for stage, anyway, as a higher pitched speaking voice carries better and sounds clearer to the audience.

Whenever I do heavy guttural vocals, I just go deeper into that growl. Believe it or not, I use lady Gaga's Bad Romance as an example if what to aim for (mainly, how she has that Louis Armstrong gurgle). When I go higher (I'm a guy, but I do listen to halestorm), I open my mouth up more, use my diaphragm, and try to focus more on ""ee"" or ""yah"" sounds since they are the easiest to scream.

For example, if I want to ""sound like"" a singer with a brighter voice, I utilize more forward resonance in my own voice but I don't over-do it. What's bright for my voice is a different kind of bright for their voice. There's flexibility in the voice, but for longevity, you have to keep everything in the spectrum of what your voice does.  Everyone has their own way to do word emphasis, runs, melodies, onsets, offsets, harmonies, etc. It's possible to emulate these individual things within the context of your own abilities. It can take a lot of careful listening and knowledge of how your voice works in order to itemize things like that, but it's worth it.  If you try to just imitate their voice like a comedian would do an impersonation, you're probably going to get vocally tired very quickly, and won't have the longevity you desire.  Your results of emulation will greatly vary, depending on who you try to emulate. If someone has a similar voice to yours, you will have a greater success rate than someone say of the opposite gender or a higher/lower voice type."

If you are a different voice type, it won't work right. I.e. a baritone and tenor have different muscle ratios when singing properly.  The best you can hope for is just to be around the type of voice you like. Some might be more lucky. My type, bari-tenor, is akward because there arent that many bari-tenors to imitate.

How do they pronounce their words?    Where is their placement?    What kinds of runs do they do? Are there certain lines they always sing?  That will give you the ""essence"" of their voice.  Tonality, like the others have said, has more to do with genetics/lifestyle/training and may be achievable but not always practical.  Easiest example would be Michael McDonald.

The few ""hardcore"" vocalists I've worked with all typically have problems with breath support, not because they don't have the lung capacity, but because scream vocals require such a different approach.

Either way, you could use a piano to use as your extended range when trying to find the notes you're hearing.  Btw, if you want to find out what the note you're singing sounds like an octave up, find the pitch you're singing on a piano, then go up 12 keys (that includes both black and white keys). That's the octave up. Vise versa works as well. Find the pitch you're singing, go down 12 keys, and that's an octave down (octave because in the scale you're working with repeats every eight notes, i.e. C4 to C5 is 8 notes in the scale, including both Cs - C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4 C5)."

singing,349dyl,barnszy,4,Wed Apr 29 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely lessons. But really, keep in mind that 3 months is a very short time to be learning a really new skill. And sometimes progress isn't linear - you may need to spend time undoing bad habits where actual progress won't be as apparent. You may also work on small, subtle changes that don't appear to affect anything but will add up to a long term improvement. It's not like 3 months into lessons you can go from crap to awesome or necessarily even decent, depending on a lot of factors. So just don't build up unrealistic expectations."

I've learned that the best way to improve your voice is to record it as much as possible, and use instant feedback to hear what you do and don't like in your voice, then to perfect it. There are great free apps or simple ways to doing this. Happy to recommend some if you're interested."

As mwb2 suggested, make sure you're doing practice SESSIONS, rather than a whole block of singing at once. I would also be careful about singing too much - you say you want to spend 3-5 hours per day working on singing, but this has the potential of going extremely pear shaped. Would definitely recommend 2 hours maximum."

I want to thank my friend Peter Griffin for being really skinny and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpole for surviving against all odds for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that I will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Abraham Lincoln, the fish I caught in the third grade, my light in my room because i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on the bodybuilding forums, my house because without it i would be homeless, and last but not least i would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of their day to read this.

singing,34a1zg,nicagrace,2,Wed Apr 29 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"I fully understand not having the opportunity to invest in lessons right now, but if you have plans to sing in the future I would recommend skipping the video programs. First of all, most of them cost as much as a couple months of lessons so if you're willing to pay for one at least get the beneficial one.   A really big reason is that everyone's voice is different and everyone's vocal needs are different. I'm assuming you're not a trained vocal pedagogue, which means you probably don't have the skill or experience to identify and diagnose technical problems with singing. So even if a video tells you one thing is right and another is wrong (and trust me, very little in singing is actually that simple), you wouldn't necessarily be equipped to fix it. And that's assuming the video is even correct 100% of the time, many of which aren't.   In addition, self-teaching can easily lead to bad habits because you're not being monitored as you progress. Should you ever decide at a later date to take lessons, you'll need to spend more time undoing bad habits, which is overall not as good an investment. You may as well start with a relatively clean slate than have to spend time erasing mistakes."

singing,345sts,felt_pen,5,Tue Apr 28 15:08:11 2015 UTC,"Are you matching pitch immediately when you work with the piano/guitar, or do you need to fish around for a bit? If the latter, work on that, first.   But secondly I think it's a good idea to start working within a tonal/harmonic context. Either practice working with pitches in a chord (a good exercise is to play an open fifth and fill in the third of the triad (major and minor both work, and I suppose other chords too), or learn a solmization system like solfège. The important part is developing an aural picture of how notes relate to each other - how voice leading works, how chords are constructed, etc.  Also, don't under appreciate the other technical aspects that go into singing. Imbalanced registration, unclear vowels, lack of breath support, and other factors can also contribute to intonation issues on some level or another."

singing,343ici,cagewithakay,3,Tue Apr 28 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a common problem. The way you hear yourself internally is mostly through bone and muscle conductivity, while the way others hear you (and the way you'll be picked up on a recording) is through the air, which obviously will sound different. For many people, this does mean subtle issues of intonation are difficult to detect with yourself, especially if you've gotten used to believing you are singing a pitch that you really aren't.   This is why so many singers and voice teachers tell people to ""feel"" how they sing rather than ""hearing"" it. Yes, you obviously need to use your ears and know how your pitch relates to how you feel, but you do need to have a good sense of what your voice feels like on each pitch.   Since you mention doing ear training in college, I'm going to assume that this is mostly not an aural problem, but more of a physical/technical problem. So yes, I suppose singing through a monitor can help (although I think that's kind of unrealistic since you should be able to react to your own voice without the aid of external technology). Spend some time with a piano and really listen to see if you're matching pitch exactly. Try to match through overtones as well - play a note and sing a just fifth above it, for example. That's a really good way to develop a sense of intonation that reacts to the context around you, which is arguably more important than just being in tune with yourself. Even though most of this is probably review, you could try some of those exercises (or modify them to your needs) to work on maintaining good intonation through various intervals/harmonies.   In addition, be conscientious about vowels. Remember that vowels are just a unique combination of overtones produced through formants that give each vowel their own characteristic sound. By definition, this means that if those overtones are funky (due to, say, a malformed resonating chamber), then the overall sound can sound out of tune (formants not matching up with the fundamental) even though the underlying pitch is in tune. So if you notice any issues with vowels, that is another place to think about."
singing,343ici,keakealani,2,Tue Apr 28 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, this response is very good. When I speak, I hear myself like there was a subwoofer in my throat, the sound is full of bass and resonance.  When I hear myself on a recording, I suddenly hear the complete opposite, my voice sounds really raw and clear, lacking all the bass and deepness I hear from inside my own body."
singing,343ici,xarahn,2,Tue Apr 28 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"Find a way to sing with some really good monitors. Even when you practice (noise canceling headphones can do the trick). Often times if you don't have good monitors or a good acoustic space you end up ""hearing"" how you imagine yourself sounding not your actual voice. Kind of like how you ""hear"" your internal monologue.  Once you've got that down a bit and take off the headphones, work on how and where you're hearing your voice. Find a balance between how you hear your inner resonance with the sound of your voice in the room.  Good luck!"

A condenser isn't worth it unless it's in the 1k usd range. Try to understand that condensers are way more sensitive than dynamics. A cheap condenser will actually color your voice more, and they tend to boost the 'high mids',2k-4khz, which is good for guitar tone, but the opposite/ really bad for vocals."
singing,3437df,keakealani,7,Mon Apr 27 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, you could say that, but this is a huge amount of confirmation bias. For every one ""untrained"" (and, as others point out, that is often less true than we think) singer that became successful, there could easily be thousands of singers who just wrecked their voices and never became successful singers. I'm not sure it's a really good way to test causality or even correlation when we have no access to the whole data set.   In addition, I think it's important to examine the narrative behind this line of reasoning. There has been a huge investment over the last several decades in popular to glorify the ""self made man"" (and I'm being gender-specific on purpose here - this is a gendered phenomenon by and large). There is a huge amount of popular appeal for musicians and other pop figures to ""feel"" like ""one of us"" and that separates themselves from the ""elite"" (often explicitly rejecting classical music, which by and large does value achievement through lessons and formalized structures).   I'm not a sociologist so I won't get into why these cultural influences came about, but suffice to say it places a huge burden on these singers to fit into a narrative even if, as /u/terrycotta points out, they probably did have some sort of training or coaching especially after signing to a label and making more money.   Another reason this narrative is important is because it is privileged and exclusionary. All the people you mentioned are straight white men with some level of opportunity (I'm not going to get into this argument if you're a hellbent conservative that doesn't believe in privilege, so don't try). I'm not saying this, in of itself, gave them their careers, but it did give them and edge by, for example, making it easier for them to portray characters accepted by mainstream media and culture (i.e., white men). Being easily accepted is not a small benefit when you're in an industry that is basically a giant popularity contest. This goes back to point A about being relatable.   I think it's also important to examine the opposite premise: if ""uniqueness"" arises from a lack of training (or even unconventional training), then does that mean trained singers aren't unique?  ""Uniqueness"", I think, has different meanings depending on what you're listening for. A lot of people would say that all or most classical/opera singers basically sound the same, but I think they all have a lot of unique qualities that make them special and make me like some more than others. But of course, this is because I grew up listening to classical music and it's what I'm studying in college, so I have a lot of experience and know what to listen for in classical music. Yet, I think I can safely say that none of those classical singers are ""untrained"" in any sense of the word.   By contrast, I actually do think most pop/rock singers more or less sound the same to me, especially if I'm using my ""classical ears"" - the criteria I would use to compare classical singers don't apply for other styles. (This is not a classical vs. pop comment, either - the same applies for comparing any other style, whether it's Carnatic singers or yodeling or Hawaiian ʻoli.)  So given that point, can you really point to any sort of trend, or is this just uncritically buying in to an idealized model that has been sold to popular music listeners for the past 50+ years?"

singing,3437df,mwb2,4,Sat May 2 07:17:46 2015 UTC,Often people will say that they had no vocal training because they didnt study formally with a vocal teacher. But they studied the records of their favorites and practiced their styles and riffs. They also worked hard on their own voices and some even had a vocal coach once they were signed to a label (or when they hit vocal problems on the road).   Lack of training isn't a mark of uniqueness. If you have the opportunity to study; it will teach you about your voice and how it works IN THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE WAY. Not to say it'll be fast but it'll be a lot faster than trying to figure it out on your own.

Cobain is a terrible singer--his live recordings show this. But he sings in a genre in which being Mariah Carey doesn't win you any points, so flat-out screaming is good enough. ""Untrained"" is different than self-taught or professionally trained, as others have mentioned. Since we're in Game of Thrones season, think of it like Bronn. Bronn never had ""dancing lessons,"" I'm sure, but he observed, learned from experience, and picked up tips wherever he could along the way, and is now a formidable swordsman.

Additionally, speech habits play a big part. Basically, you're always phonating (using your vocal cords to make sound). He could also have good phonation habits in his speech that just naturally carried over into his singing.  And how you use your breath is perhaps the single most important factor in what ""voice"" comes out of you. Trumpet can certainly help your skill in using your breath.  What we call the ""voice"" is a bunch of muscles and tissues that we control in a coordinated way, and move with the breath. You don't just get immaculate motor skill coordination from nowhere.

When I just stumbled upon a couple random spots, I'm not hearing any vibrato at all, so I can't seem to understand what you're trying to show with those recordings.   Also, I want to be sure you understand that instrumental and vocal vibrato are extremely different processes. It's really impossible to compare the two because vocal vibrato occurs naturally under certain circumstances of good technique and balanced breathing, while instrumental vibrato has to be intentionally produced. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking when comparing them, but it's important to keep this in mind.   That all being said, you really shouldn't ""speed up"" vibrato. That's not really how it works. You can adjust vibrato to some extent, but it's honestly mostly going to just be how your voice works in ideal conditions.   It would be great if we could get a recording of the problem to understand better what you're asking about, as well. It's pretty difficult to give a blanket statement for something like vibrato without hearing a recording."

On Mad World, 1:18 at the tail end of very, and at 1:32 at the end of each phrase.  It just seems a lot quicker than what I can pull off and I'd find it surprising if natural vibrato can get up to that speed. Perhaps I'm confusing vibrato with riffing?  Here's another example that is littered with the technique I'm describing:  https://youtu.be/F8c5Tk1RrYs?t=1m09s  That whole section has a lot of it.  EDIT: As for samples, I won't be able to record anything until this Friday at the earliest, but there isn't really an issue, it's just something I want to learn how to do, if possible.

singing,343c5v,keakealani,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"Hm. Yeah, that sounds like regular vibrato to me, and if anything, it's actually quite faint and hardly noticeable at all. In the first couple examples (and a bit in the third example), the sound is rather pressed in general, so that may be causing some of the interference you're detecting as vibrato? But that's not really healthy vocal production so maybe you're right to say that it's not ""natural vibrato"" in a sense.   I think maybe if you could record yourself it might be easier to compare with these recordings. But to be totally honest with you, unless I'm really listening closely I wouldn't exactly consider these singers to use vibrato. It's barely audible and doesn't really do anything musically when it's so faint, in my opinion. So I'm not sure these are the best examples to model yourself after anyway.  Edit: Also, in your Hallelujah example, notice that the singer is using a lot of jaw motion. Natural vibrato really shouldn't have that much jaw motion, which indicates a lot of tension in the jaw/neck area, and possibly a manufactured vibrato. Which is really another technique entirely."

Perhaps you could look for a voice therapist? I think they would be most suited to helping your voice get back to shape.   Also definitely try to figure out if there are any dietary triggers for your reflux - it's best to prevent it from occurring than to just rely on drugs and things.

singing,340bj4,Adamskii97,3,Mon Apr 27 07:58:11 2015 UTC,"Hello there! The biggest concern concerning singing and working out is that you need to make sure you're not going to make your chest and stomach muscles too stiff.  If they are too stiff, they can't expand properly, which will lead to you suffering from a lowered breath capacity.   I hope this helped!"
singing,340bj4,YourFavoriteBaritone,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:36:11 2015 UTC,Thank you! Is there any way to work out so they don't get stiff?
singing,340bj4,Mattpilf,6,Mon Apr 27 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"There's no reason you can't have strong and flexible muscles.  Just because you get stiffer muscles when  you work out doesn't mean you can't get them loose with some stretching.  Every endurance athlete I know,  from swimming to running to rowing lifts weights including their chest muscles,  and for them breathing is just as important as singing. The key  is to remain flexible.  A healthy person should have no reason why moderate strength training (you aren't trying to break world records here)  and flexibility  should be opposed. Yoga will also help,  but it rarely does much to strengthen unless you do atypical styles of yoga that can be dangerous too because of all the weird muscle loading involved."
singing,340bj4,Bothan_Spy,3,Mon Apr 27 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"OP, you won't get too stiff to sing.  Just work out according to your routine.  There are plenty of singers who are in great physical shape.  Nathan Gunn comes to mind as a pretty fit operatic baritone, and his vocal power is just fine.  You can have both."
singing,340bj4,keakealani,2,Mon Apr 27 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Try doing yoga or another exercise style that emphasizes flexibility over strength. Basically, you don't want your core to be so strong that it limits outward expansion of the abdomen during inhalation, but retain flexibility so it can expand and contract as fully as possible. If you do choose to do strength training, be sure you work all muscles equally, including all the abdominal groups and both sets of intercostal muscles. Again, the goal is a large range of movement in the abdomen rather than just a tightening in one direction (usually people try to tighten the abs inward, which can inhibit good breathing for singing)."

singing,340mbp,ColdGirl,4,Mon Apr 27 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure someone else can more properly address the first part of your post, but I'll answer your actual question at the end there, for now.  In terms of breath support, stopping a note should never be by running out of breath, since nothing ever sounds nice when you're desperately pushing to get that last bit out while trying not to suffocate. Everything falls apart. The goal when singing (what proper breath support is) is to never totally run out of breath before your next inhale, so your singing isn't bogged down by distracting inhales/gasping of air. You should always maintain a comfortable level of breath. If you're having trouble with this, you should analyse the song you're singing, find where you have unused opportunities to take breath, and use it. Do some Farinelli exercises to get better at exhaling consistently &amp;amp; over a longer period of time.  Since I'm oftentimes a neurotic singer as well, I will say not to get obsessed over trying to have breath left over at notes, either. In terms of breath, as long as you have enough to keep the note going, as long as you never feel like you're physically running out, and as long as you're never pushing it, then you're doing it right. Stopping notes? As long as you stop deliberately and you don't put TOO much emphasis on it so as to distract from the rest of the song, you're good (ideally, this comes from not thinking too much about it beyond ""stop this note now"").  Also this is not a silly question! It is a totally legitimate request for clarification on a not-100%-clear topic."
singing,340mbp,Hissrad,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:14:32 2015 UTC,Great answer thank You!
singing,340mbp,Fallbourn,4,Mon Apr 27 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hissrad has some awesome points.  For me, I know I had a similar issue when singing the end of Les Mis' ""Stars"". It's a super long note, and I would frequently have almost zero breath by the end. My teacher told me two things:  The first was that it's OK to stop a long note short if you need to.  The second was how to stop a note without as much ""ugly"" at the end. Basically, at the end of the note (especially if it ends in a consonant), you can quickly close and re-open your mouth, while simultaneously stopping your breath. This forces everything to stop all at once, rather than over a small window of time.   Hope I helped at all! Good luck."
singing,340mbp,keakealani,3,Mon Apr 27 11:24:06 2015 UTC,"I want to also add a couple things.   If your phrase ends on a consonant, use it. A lot of beginning singers forget how important consonants are, but they can really help you end strongly and articulate the phrase. Consider using a shadow vowel (a light schwa) after plosive consonants and extending fricatives slightly.   Also, actually, beginning consonants can be really helpful for getting your breath going.   If your phrase ends with a vowel, release using your breath, not your mouth. In other words, your mouth should remain open in the position of the vowel after the sound stops (then you can close, but not until the vowel has fully rung)."

singing,340s0n,elerico,2,Mon Apr 27 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"You need to stop thinking in terms of pitch for a bit. Honestly. You have a nice, bright sound, but all I can hear is your throat completely squeezing tight.   I'm going to make some assumptions. I think you are putting far too much pressure on your throat when you sing. I think you are tightening your abs to push air out to reach the high notes. All that pressure cannot be pushed out of your throat at once, so you have to tightly push your vocal folds together to prevent that air from getting out. All of this probably makes your veins bulge out of your neck when you sing, and gives you posture issues (bending forward). How close am I?"
singing,340s0n,oldpainless,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks so much for listening and taking the time to write a reply. You are pretty close :) You are right about tightening the abs. I just feel I sound so boring when I relax. Maybe I should work on trying to add some x-factor to my relaxed tone. At the moment, I can hit higher notes by adding a little ""oomph"" to them. A part of the problem is that my transitions from chest to head aren't the best. I rarely practice them so maybe that's something I should look into... If you listen to the part that starts at 2:08, I really have to put everything behind that first note to be able to hit it. At the moment, it's almost impossible for me to make it sound soft without going into falsetto. My transitions from falsetto to head also aren't that impressive. I can do an O.K falsetto, but I can't switch to head voice mid-note without breaking.  Regarding the posture, I don't think I have any serious posture issues. I always try to stand straight while keeping a good ground connection and keeping my shoulders loose (I have to keep a good posture to sing the high notes. For example, singing this song sitting in the car or with a guitar is harder for me than standing). Again right about the veins, I usually get some minor vein action going during the longer/higher parts. It's not as bad as it used to be, but it still happens. I used to get dizzy singing in the shower, but that hasn't happened in years. I could sing this song over and over again (and have done), but I'd probably be better served working on a more relaxed approach.   Sorry for the long-ass reply. Do you have any suggestions on what I should work on first?"

However, I think it's really important to stress that if you are serious about singing (it's not really clear from your post), you should not try to self-teach. You are very liable to develop bad habits without proper instruction, some of which can even lead to damaging your vocal cords themselves. And honestly, it's kind of a waste of time because you can't really learn efficiently if you don't know what to do.   It's okay if you can't invest in a teacher right now.

Chest head falsetto and everything inbetween everyday. Loud to soft and in between. Then after a while(years) you get great highnotes and become a great singer."
singing,33vglt,keakealani,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:05:27 2015 UTC,"What is your voice type? My guess, though, is that you shouldn't be singing that range in chest voice at all. Most voice types will need to adjust to a more ""mixed"" type of registration here, and that will likely be a lot more comfortable."
singing,33vglt,keakealani,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"According to my voice teacher, basso profundo. My most comfortable range is between B1 and F2, and it is extremely bassy. I can push all the way up to anywhere between a D4 and a G4 though depending on the day, before I have to go into head voice. I no nothing about mixed voice."
singing,33vglt,keakealani,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah. There is no way you should be singing in chest voice in that range. Actually, I think for lower basses it would very much qualify as pure head voice for you."

singing,33w0km,drachs1978,3,Sun Apr 26 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"For live performance I would recommend against becoming dependent on a compressor. The amount of compression required to bring up softer notes as you describe is also going to remove the dynamics from your singing and have a large impact on your tone as well. It's probably not worth squashing the sound of your voice for the sake of bringing up some low notes.  Compensating through mic technique will usually produce far better results, this skill set is an important part of being a trained performer in addition to your actual vocal skills.  If you really want to get a vocal compressor for live use though you might consider one of the vocal stompboxes on the market now. You probably won't find a standalone vocal compressor like they make for guitars, but what you get will be better suited for vocals, even if it also comes with a lot of other stuff you don't need. If you want to get a guitar compressor, make sure it has an attack knob you can dial back, otherwise it will probably be too fast and dull your voice."

singing,33w0km,link2x,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:31:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, I can easily compress while I'm recording on my rig at home, I just need something between me and the monitor when I'm singing live."
singing,33w0km,brute-squad,2,Sun Apr 26 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"If you must compress, depending on your live rig you could probably just use a guitar pedal. I'm not sure what prices you're thinking, but remembering that we're talking about Audio equipment here, Boss is always a good choice ($99USD).  That said, I also recommend looking into/practicing your mic technique. There's nothing wrong with getting up close for the quieter notes, just as you'd move away for the louder."

I also made my professional facebook page this past month. Not because I expect much to come from it, but because I need to start getting my foot in the door.

singing,33tugu,keakealani,3,Sun Apr 26 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"So I'm officially (ish - we haven't confirmed dates but everything is in order) giving my junior recital next semester. First major solo recital ever and I'm already pretty nervous. I'm working with my teacher to finalize my recital, but I'm working on a three-theme program: Rain, Abandonment, and Hope. Pretty much the most common art song themes ever, but also a lot of fun music to explore. I'm also excited to work on blending sets that are not all the same language/composer (most students in my university just do 3-4 sets in different languages).   So far, the ""for sure"" pieces are: (not necessarily in order)  Rain * Resipighi - Pioggia * Debussy - Il pleure dans mon coeur * C. Schumann - Er ist gekommen * Barber - Rain Has Fallen  Abandonment * Bellini - L'abbandono * Bizet - L'abandonée * Mozart - Als Luise die Briefe (most likely - I haven't settled on this but I needed something classical)  Hope * Schubert - Hoffnung * Wolf - Er Ist's (this one I just want to do although my teacher points out that it doesn't really fit the theme... maybe I'll change the theme so I can do it XD)  I have a couple more pieces that I'm chewing on, but if anyone has suggestions for a very light (possibly may at some point develop into a lyric coloratura) high soprano for a junior recital level, I'm all ears! We're definitely still looking for something more lyrical and ideally in English."
singing,33tugu,nemesmith,2,Sat Apr 25 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a really nice recital program. You probably know of them already but just had a couple of ideas for lighter English coloratura songs, My Heart Ever Faithful by Bach or O Had I Jubal's Lyre by Handel. Both fairly ""hopeful"" songs, I think. Good luck and have fun with this, I'm sure you'll be great!  EDIT: Just thought of another... Shake the Cloud from off Your Brow - Purcell"
singing,33tugu,keakealani,2,Sat Apr 25 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"I started taking lessons a couple years ago because I wanted to be able to sing Colossus by Borknagar, which has a part with a lot of notes above the upper passaggio.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2HZVzXuYg  I'm not sure if even now I can get through it without belting.   I ended up choosing a classical teacher just because his reviews seemed good.  He's a performing operatic Baritone.  So, he started me off learning classical technique, singing Italian songs, with the promise that I'd be able to use the technique in other styles.  Well, I never made the transition and I've been singing classical Italian ever since.  I haven't actually had a lesson in like six months, but my voice feels better than ever.  It's definitely due to the David Jones CD I made a post about.  It really helped me move even further into the ""voice as an instrument"" mentality, rather than the voice as the intuitive speaking/singing thing that I've always used it as.  I feel like I sing like a ventriloquist now because there's so little movement of anything.  It's like the voice is a broken clarinet that I'm playing, but I'm also holding it together so it doesn't just fall apart.  Singing is both those things, not just the playing.  The CD also helped me understand the role of the tongue in directing the sound to where it will resonate best, and where to put the sound in different parts of the range that makes singing in that range feel easiest.  Somehow this has all solved my feeling the need to push notes, which I've always had a problem with.  Recently I made the discovery that I could maintain a very slow steady stream of air without hissing.  I feel like this is even better than hissing because it takes more focus on support than hissing because the air flow isn't being resisted by the teeth.  My teacher never classified my voice, even though I was with him for like 2.5 years.  I'm 30 by the way.  I think I'm a low tenor.  It's weird because sometimes my voice naturally sits low, and I have an easy rich G2.  Other times I can't even hit an A2 without frying.  I don't know.  I'm currently working on Una Furtiva Lagrima, when I get around to it.  I might post something."
singing,33tugu,keakealani,2,Sat Apr 25 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of interested in your experience. Do you regret not transition to your target style or are you happy singing classical? Do you feel you benefited from classical lessons to the point where you can start to branch out into other styles? What are your goals as a singer?  I'm asking because the only style I know anything about is classical (and, when I'm better qualified, that's what I want to teach, ideally). But I know there are a lot of potential voice students out there who want to eventually sing other styles. I want to find a way to at least be helpful for non-classical singers (if I'm honest, that's where the money is), but not step outside my knowledge and experience. I also feel a lot of folks don't initially want to sing classical because they have a stereotype of opera/classical music, but once they start singing it's less of a problem. What are your experiences with this?"
singing,33tugu,nemesmith,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I never had any plans to do anything with my voice beyond singing for my own enjoyment, singing around a campfire, or maybe some busking, so I can't really regret anything because I still have time to do whatever I want.  I don't feel like I would have gotten more enjoyment if I had transitioned earlier though.  I'm perfectly happy with my chosen course.  I find the practice of classical singing to be as interesting and enjoyable as any other kind of singing.  I do feel like I am getting to the point where I could start to branch out using what I know from studying classical.  I also feel like improving my classical technique further would make branching out even easier.  Of course, I've been singing my entire life without any instruction.  My mom has tapes of me singing Phantom of the Opera when I was like 7.  In fact, I'm constantly singing.  So, it's really less of a complete transition than it is a blending of how I've always sung intuitively and what I've learned from classical practice.  The benefit has definitely been huge.  There are certain songs that I can sing entirely with classical technique and tweak the sound so that it sounds right.  These are songs I'd have to belt my way through before I started lessons.  At the same time, it's frustrating because there are songs I'm pretty sure that I'll never be able to sing without belting, and now I'm very reluctant to belt.  I don't feel like I've learned to belt with healthy technique at all because to me it's the opposite of healthy technique as I currently understand it.      I don't really have any goals other than sounding good, being able to sing what I want to sing, and being able to use good enough technique that my voice doesn't wear out for a long long time.  I do take it seriously though.  Being a good singer is enough in itself.  I would like to ""do something"" with my voice, but I don't know what.  Sure, I'd like to be in a metal band, but I'm not at all confident in my song writing ability.  I would like to be able to sing ""Nessun Dorma"" half-decently.  Yeah, I never wanted to sing classically.  I don't know if I had a stereotype but I never liked the way operatic voices sound.  I always wondered why they ""tried"" to sound ""that way.""  I don't know if I even realized I was taking classical lessons at first because I had had a few lessons with another teacher, who definitely wasn't classical, and it seemed like we were doing the same thing with my new teacher.  Then, when my voice started sounding operatic it threw me off.  The first song we did was Johanna from Sweeney Todd and I remember my teacher telling me the dude from the movie's rendition was terrible and to look up videos on youtube.  Even though it's theater, the vids are way more classical sounding than the guy from the movie, and I remember thinking ""What is this crap?  He prefers this?""  Then, he had me singing like that, when I was trying to mimic the movie sound, which I didn't really like at first.  But, as it became apparent that the classical sound is actually a natural result of free easy technique, I started to embrace it.  But, I was at karaoke one time at a super divy bar, not a hipster a dive bar, but the real deal.  There were no people there except myself, my friends, and some bar flies who were completely out of it.  We were having a good time messing around, when in walks a troop of musical theater performers like it's some sort of 80's movie.  And, they just steal the show.  Of course, they have probably had a lot more instruction than me, but I still felt really lacking.  This one girl sang ""Take Another Little Piece of My Heart"" and just nailed it.  It was far less screamy than Janis Joplin, and had some insane runs at the end, but it was completely belted.  I have no idea how that works.  I might be able to belt a similarly difficult song for me, but I know it would sound so shouty and kill my voice.  Although, maybe it has something to do with the mic?  I'd rather have the experience of having the skill and control of Pavarotti, but I'd still rather sound like Morrissey.   I kinda rambled that who thing bit by bit over the course of hours.  Does that help?  Was it coherent?  I could probably say more."
singing,33tugu,keakealani,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"No, that's great! I really appreciate your perspective :)   I think it's interesting how many different angles people can take when they get into classical singing, sometimes more or less by accident (as it seems to be with you). I think it's pretty neat that even though you aren't really looking to be a classical singer professionally or in any sort of specific capacity, you can utilize classical singing technique to give you more control of your voice in other styles. This is something I've always believed to be true, but it's awesome to see it in practice. Thank you for sharing :)"
singing,33tugu,nemesmith,2,Mon Apr 27 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't been as present on this sub lately, been crazy busy with other things. But I did do a little recital of sorts for my grandmother's retirement community in March. Here's my rendition of Mein Herr Marquis from that performance. The pianist was very sweet, but I have to say, it was quite a challenge working with her and the very out-of-tune piano. Learning a lot about accompanists and how to work/communicate with them. I'm quite excited to be able to sing with a really good one for my next recital scheduled for mid-June. Only done a couple practices with her so far but she is amazing, definitely the best I've ever had the privilege of working with. Really having fun with that."
singing,33tugu,keakealani,2,Sun Apr 26 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"You sound lovely! I'm not sure if I had heard you before so I'm really glad you posted :)  But yeah, the process of working with pianists can be very complicated. My school has a really awesome class called Piano-Vocal Collaboration, and it has really helped me understand how pianists work and how to rehearse with them efficiently and respectfully. I think it's really important to work with a variety of pianists in different situations because it does teach you a lot. I'm lucky to be married to a pianist who traditionally collaborates with me, but that offers its own set of challenges too. And this semester I chose to work with another pianist for my exams because I am trying to learn how to work with other pianists and not rely on the connection I have with my husband.   Also, working with an out of tune or poor quality piano is the worst! And trust that your pianist probably hates it even more than you do. But, as you know many gigs take place at community centers, churches, and the like which don't have super nice pianos, so it's something we just have to deal with, I guess :/"
singing,33tugu,nemesmith,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you! You are so kind.   How awesomely convenient to be married to a pianist? That must come in very handy. My husband isn't into classical music at all so it's a struggle sometimes even to just practice without getting on my family's nerves. But anyway, yeah, I'm learning just how important the relationship is between singer and accompanist and how crucial it is to get experience practicing with lots of them because each pianist's style is so different. You definitely get what you pay for in most cases, it seems. The gal who played for me at the retirement home did so for free so I didn't want to be overly critical with her. I could tell she just wasn't super comfortable with the material, but she did the best she could under the circumstances, bless her heart. The gal I'm using for my next recital is amazing but, quite understandably, costs quite a bit. Since I have to pay for all this out of my own pocket it is sometimes rather hard to justify, but I feel like if I'm going to do this, it's worth paying for someone who knows their stuff seeing as I put all this time and effort into it.   Wish I could find someone decent at this who would want to play with me for the experience... might check around some colleges or something just to see. If I could find someone who wanted to collaborate as a team with me that would be ideal, but probably a long shot."
singing,33tugu,keakealani,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah. It has its ups and downs. Since I'm not a ""paying customer"" (I do try to help out with some chores though), I'm always a lower priority for my husband compared to the people actually paying him. Totally understandable, but sometimes a bit annoying. At the same time, since we're both starting out he views playing for me as getting experience and getting his name out there, which is a win-win.   But yeah, I know what you mean about getting what you pay for. It is hard to justify paying a lot for an accompanist for an event or recital, but it makes your life easier as a singer to work with a skilled pianist and know you can get good rehearsal time with them. I'm not sure how your recital is working, but maybe you could solicit donations or charge a small admissions fee to offset the cost of the pianist? You can also donate the remainder to a good cause like a local music education project if you don't want to take the money."
singing,33tugu,nemesmith,2,Mon Apr 27 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure there's some give and take involved in that. Would be tricky to balance priorities at times, I'd imagine. But still a pretty nice deal if you ask me!  I'd actually been considering the whole donation thing. I'll need to check with the church I've reserved to make sure it would be ok with them, but I'd love to be able to offset some of the costs, as you suggest.

That's just how baritones or basses sound at that part of their range.  If you're baritone/bass and your voice is trained, relaxed, and supported, it's just going to sound similar to that if you're just trying to sing a pure, open tone (varying from person to person, of course).  And that note Ernie Ford hits is just a B3.  Listen to Bill Medley when he was with the Righteous Brothers.  That guy could really bring a brassy color to his voice way up there."
singing,33r3bz,Bothan_Spy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Isn't this supposed to be what vocal weight  and ""boomy""  part of being a bass  describes?  At least part of what distinguishes  a bass is that it's natural and can exist up through his range,  while still allowing the proper format tuning ,  as supposed  to what happens when a baritone shouts that not with vocal weight.   Or maybe this falls Under  timbre in the natural chest resonance and/or sub glottal  resonance (I think that's the right term) a bass will always have in modal voice.   Honestly though IDK much about what really is defined as vocal weight vs boomy vs chesty  as it always seemed like there wasn't a clear idea what was being articulated and more just a gist of something.    That guy could really bring a brassy color to his voice way up there.   I assume that's supposed  to bassy,  but not a 100% because brassy can apply to voices.   Also while we're at this in terms of bassy  tones,  is there any term for the darkness that comes from age and takes until their 30s or so to really hear(especially for basses).  And does anyone know specifically why this happens,  like what in the voice actually changes?"

Although it is not very synonymous with this style of music taking quiet, full breaths from the diagram will make for a much more smooth running piece. Not only does practicing these breaths allow for longer phrases it also allows you to open up and make more vibrant sound. Cutting up all those phrases with an audible breath sort of takes away from the piece, as you never usually here that in pop music anyways. Still, I really love this and I hope you continue work on it. Try working on breath control and if you just pick up the gusto to break out of your shell I'm sure this will sound even better than it already is. :D"

singing,33nlwx,Tonytarium,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:55:47 2015 UTC,m/18  https://soundcloud.com/tableu/wheels-of-a-dream  Im singing Wheels of a Dream from Ragtime acapella. I recorded it on my phone so it isnt the best quality. I know that there are some timing issues and also some parts where my voice falters a little. When ever I hear myself singing I always think I sound really young and amateurish. I mean I am an amateur so that makes sense but what can I do to take my voice to the next level?  edit: Here is another thing I recorded acapella on my phone. Just to give you guys something that isnt musical theatre. https://soundcloud.com/tableu/riptide

singing,33m9as,Mattpilf,7,Thu Apr 23 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"It's not that you were necessarily wrong in the first place. My passaggio has been slowly moving up over the past few years. It used to be C5-d5, and now it's f#5/g5 ish.  The voice goes through puberty until your late 20s, so change is to be expected.  There's also a difference in an untrained voice and a trained one. An untrained voice will have a lower passaggio simply because it isn't equipped to sing high in the first place. It's not dissimilar to training a muscle for weightlifting in that way. You won't press 200 lbs at the get go, but that doesn't mean you never will."
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,5,Thu Apr 23 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, I have a video somewhere of me straining on what seemed to, at the time, be the highest note I could produce without voice cracks or falsetto (usually a good indicator of the second passagio because untrained singers rarely use head voice) and that note was a D4...   barely a year later D4 is one of the easy notes of my range and my second passagio is actually F#4-G4."
singing,33m9as,xarahn,2,Thu Apr 23 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"So then wasn't the D4 more  of you struggling because of not being able to navigate above your first passaggio?   Did have what you believed to be to be a passaggio  at A3 as well,  with noticeable shifts if resonance and flipping into falsetto if you didn't?"
singing,33m9as,xarahn,5,Thu Apr 23 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was. I didn't mean my passagio moved like ghoti023's comment first half says.  I meant my voice was untrained and therefore if you had to guess where I would need to switch into head voice, you would've probably said at that D4-E4 mark, which wasn't the case after discovering all my registers.  EDIT: I realized my post didn't help to contribute to your OP but my first guess would be (if this really happened to you) that your voice is still changing, your age would be good info for this."
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,2,Thu Apr 23 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"Ohh I'm almost 25. I've been singing a bit here and there for years but nothing very serious .  I think I'm fairly accurate on where my passaggio  is. When it's heady and lightish  sounding  it still consistently want to break at D4 or C#4, (despite support that I've been using to play flute and saxophone  for decades)  unless I use tension or start switching vocal production, and my A3- C#4 range has a lot more brightness to it, and a bunch of cracking around A3 if my voice isn't warmed up and used to lightening up. That part has been fairly stable for years.   Head voice is weakest part,  and untamed, but can be accessed,  but not well enough for use in songs yet. That tends to take another shift around F#4 and could  continue  near C5,but with noticeable  shift to a thinner and lack of any chest sound from G4 up so I haven't really trained that at all and never use it.   My low notes carry some brightness and smoothness,  yet loud enough to understand   the room(30 ft?) even at D2.  That's something I don't here when I've seen baritones hit low notes, and even a bunch of ""basses""  who tend to either get gravely/fryish or lose brightness or whisper quite.   Mostly this was just to see other people experiences with their voice,  and less a diagnosis  of my own,  especially  since I have tonsillitis  and can't record well. (booooo)  I wanted to see the limitations of people's  perceptions of their own voice,  and stuff, and maybe this could help others who were a bit uncertain about their own voice. It's also only been recently that I've thought  of  thinking of my voice as more than just ""lowish"" and think the bass-baritone as accurate."
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,5,Thu Apr 23 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"despite support that I've been using to play flute and saxophone for decades   I just wanted to point out that support for singing vs support for wind/brass instruments is actually a little different.  While it is similar, wind and brass use a thinner and stronger stream of air than singing does. Singing generally needs a little thicker of a stream, so it's perfectly understandable why you still have a little bit of struggle on your upper passaggio notes."
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,2,Thu Apr 23 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'd think many notes on the flute require a thicker stream the n singing,  at least if you talk about how much air is moving.  Flutes have so little resistance that the low notes are very difficult to hold for 20-30 seconds,  as supposed to the sax which is very differnt airstream due to the resistance."
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,4,Thu Apr 23 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"Right - sorry. I'm a little hopped up on pain medication right now.  Flutes are a thicker stream. Other woodwinds/brass are thinner. Obviously - you knew that.   The point is that it's not the same as it is for singing, so don't let that mystify you in your singing support journey."
singing,33m9as,keakealani,2,Thu Apr 23 22:28:27 2015 UTC,"While I know registration breaks occur at atypical places for beginner's,  does it really make sense to say the change in the have a lower passaggio  because their registration breaks are occurring earlier?   I guess it depends  on the voice,  but acoustically,  the vocal cords can only vibrate so fast before they have to change the way they vibrate or put excess tension on them.   If it's anything like training a muscle,  I'd think it would be training a joints flexibility for something like your elbow.  There's only so far  you elbow bends when you stretch it out,  but if you aren't used to using its full range,  you might think you have naturally small range of motion. (excluding us people who's elbows  go past 180)"
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,3,Thu Apr 23 22:00:45 2015 UTC,does it really make sense to say the change in the have a lower passaggio because their registration breaks are occurring earlier?   I don't quite know what this question is asking. It looks like you had phrased it in 2 different ways and glued them together to make a question that doesn't make too terribly much sense. Sorry. :/
singing,33m9as,ghoti023,2,Thu Apr 23 22:06:08 2015 UTC,Oops.   Does it really make sense to say that there is a change in their passaggio because their registration breaks are occurring later?
singing,33m9as,keakealani,3,Thu Apr 23 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"I think I'm getting what you're trying to say, but your wording is still really weird for me.  But yes?  You'll also find that most people struggle singing high (even natural-born sopranos) because everyone starts of singing like how they speak - and they don't necessarily transition into full on singing until they get the hang of it. I've had quite a few students who thought they were altos that turned out to be sopranos, simply because they hadn't figured out how to sing higher note yet. It's not that they couldn't, it's that no one had ever shown them how. Some things just take some guided practice."
singing,33m9as,CobraCommanderVII,3,Thu Apr 23 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like a broken record, but this is yet another reason why it's unhelpful to classify voices too early. Although the passaggio absolutely can and does change over time (especially during the maturation process), I also think many of these cases are about misunderstanding the passaggio in untrained voices, where it appears to be lower because the singer has less skill with their higher range. I don't believe singers ""turn into"" other voice types, but are just improperly classified when they're too young/inexperienced, often because they don't factor in these considerations.   Also, in general I think passaggio is the least helpful tool for voice typing anyway. I know plenty of people who have vastly different passaggi than their voice type would imply (myself included), but other factors like tessitura and timbre clearly indicate that voice type. It's a fine tool, but it's only one of many and there are lots of exceptions to the rule."
singing,33m9as,ViktorClay,2,Thu Apr 23 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"Do you find passaggio  to be less useful for women than men?   I've heard for women,  not only is the passagio  less meaningful for women(since it occurs amongst a much narrower  range),  but the passagio  is also harder to locate,  since the break is more  subtle,  and thus less likely to determine the exact location.   I do agree completely,  very novice singers,  especially those who have no head voice  at all,  especially  if they feel their tone isn't even good enough join a local choir yet, as they may easily be experiencing atypical  registration breaks.   I think the most dangerous thing is early and young singers trying to sound as dark or bright  and similar timbre as what they think their voice type is, which I feel at least  the passagio  might indicate where their potential timbre could lie."
singing,33l4cb,TktsboCardiomyopathy,3,Thu Apr 23 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"This looks like smoothed Kargyraa. This is an overtone singing technique. Feel free to PM me (or reply here) if you want to discuss that.  [edit] You are putting you false vocal chords in vibration, this is why it feels different. They vibrate at half the frequency, hence the lower octave."
singing,33l4cb,D4r1,2,Thu Apr 23 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Kargyraa of article  Tuvan throat singing:       The more deep sounding style of throat singing is known as Kargyraa (in Cyrillic: Каргыраа). Kargyraa has a deep, almost growling sound to it and is technically related to Tibetan Buddhist chant and has some similarities with vocal fry and the way Popeye's cartoon voice was created. It uses both the vocal and the vestibular folds (also known as ""false vocal chords"") simultaneously, creating two connected sources of sound.  By constricting the larynx, the vestibular folds can be brought together (adducted) and, under certain conditions, vibrate. It can produce an undertone exactly half the frequency of the fundamental produced by the vocal folds. Therefore, for each second vibration of the vocal folds, the vestibular fold completes a whole vibration cycle. While the larynx generates such rich sound, the mouth cavity may be shaped, just like in the manipulation of vowels, to select some particular harmonics, resulting in a sound that may be perceived as having different pitches simultaneously.  This vocal mechanism has been only recently elucidated and shown to be similar to the chant practiced in Tibet by the Gyuto monastery and other Buddhist orders.

Whatever your opinion is on more abrasive styles of music, it can be used very effectively.   Strengthening your false vocal chords is something you have to very careful about. I suggest checking out The Zen of Screaming if you're interested.

singing,33lkr5,tsilihiNehT,3,Thu Apr 23 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"Do you live near a college or university with a music department? That is a really good place to start, as many students or recent graduates may be looking for students. They may also be able to advise you on voice classes or choirs that are open to the public.   I would also check with any other musicians you know, like choir directors or pianists. Most music communities are small enough that they'll know of a teacher or know where to look."
singing,33lkr5,keakealani,3,Thu Apr 23 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"You can also check for high schools with a music program. My school has a voice teacher who works at a university most of the time but does three days out of the week to work at the high school after work. She does voice lessons outside of these so the moral of the story is you might find a good, cheap-ish teacher from a high school as well."

singing,33kxw8,WuckFestern,6,Thu Apr 23 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"I would suggest treating the issue the same way a guitarist or saxophonist would. Learn all there is to learn about chords and scales and begin improvising. It really is the only way to be creative and unique. You could of course imitate the usual pentatonic runs that you hear throughout popular music, but there will be little interesting about it.  As a proof of concept you can learn to sing a Am7 chord, and practice singing it over different chords (on the piano or guitar). Am7, Cmaj7, Fmaj7, Dm7 etc.  Practice intervals, chords and scales. Skip notes, add chromatics, be creative about it. Begin slowly and increase the speed as you get more comfortable. Not only will your voice and technique develop but also your ear. It really is something that far to few singers take seriously."

singing,33kwoj,Coprosmo,3,Thu Apr 23 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"You should first make sure you love the songs you are singing. If you don't, try to.  A considerable part of it is getting into the rhythm as well. It can start off moving your hands to the beat and the rest will follow through, once you get in to a comfort zone that allows you to channel the song with your body.  It doesn't hurt to be a little cheesy and do a borderline interpretive dance with the lyrics. For me, doing that might get some laughs out of the audience, and when I make people laugh, I am immediately put in a comfort zone.  Make sure your gestures are natural or as natural-looking as possible, nothing forced and mechanical. If you practiced beforehand and choreographed what you're going to do, don't let people know. Trick them into thinking it was improv. Remember, natural, nothing forced.  Most importantly, be careful not to overdo anything that might hinder your ability to sing (bad posture for a prolonged time). Most of the time, it is the singing that people are there for."

Do, however, analyze your text carefully. Both analyze poetically for things like alliteration, meter, rhyme scheme, imagery, etc. also analyze the narrative and create a specific story. Be very specific about the narrative - where things are, what they look like, who else is present, etc. You should basically be able to draw an exact picture of what is happening in your piece.   From there, walk through the narrative on stage. If you're talking to someone, turn to them. If you're talking about something, hold it or look at it. Take a step forward, backward, or to the side if your music calls for it (maybe you're really excited and step forward).

singing,33l058,SevenSixtyOne,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"As a fellow tenor I will say that falsetto is extremely useful when it comes down to singing. Having a strong falsetto can  A.) Help fill in those high notes that are hard to hit in full voice as you begin singing (although this will have to be filled in as you can hit higher notes) B.) Really work out your larynx muscles and make transitions from full to falsetto voice very easy C.) Is kinda fun, if you ask me, not that useless and not terrible at all but most importantly D.) THE exercise that has helped me with my voice throughout countless practices is one where you sing high and then gently swoop down until you hit a lower falsetto note and stay on it for a moment and then start to crescendo and flourish into a full voice. I can make a voice recording for you later if it will help. I'll PM you maybe.  So don't get discouraged! Our age is the best time to really peak into what our voices can do and get ourselves prepared for out future in singing. Good luck."

Eventually with much practice,  and training,  and time you will develop a fuller head voice, and you will be able to bring a brightness and ringing ton through your register that will project much better.   Now it is hard to determine your voice type if you can't actually  hit notes in your head voice,  but if you Feel your voice is transitioning and breaking at E4, then that a strong sign you are a baritone, and not a high bass. A bass-baritone  upper passaggio(commonly  where the voice need to switch to 'head vocie',  strain or go into falsetto)  tends to D4, and fuller and heavy basses are C# and C 4.   Your voice type isn't really important  now,  since you should be accessing your head voice,  even as a bass,  but there's high chance you'll have reasonably bright high notes,  possibly up to a full A4 or higher but less full tones  Unfortunately I can't really give advice on exercises on how to, access your head voice.  I can say that many baritones and basses tend to depress the lyranx with their tongue,  sing  in the back or their mouth,  try to carry a chesty sound high up,  and possible issuess with support.  .  At first your head voice will sound weak and undeveloped,  but there should a non airy aspect,  and a brightness that not in falsetto,. which not much tensioh  Once you access that consistently you can increase  the depth,  boomy and chesty aspect. Remember a teacher can be very useful to get you to access your head voice early on."
singing,33kacx,Mattpilf,4,Thu Apr 23 05:48:25 2015 UTC,"Get a good coach, me and a friend had the same issues. I cracked at C4 could push E4 a good day, nowdays i sing higher then most guys and girls.  Range has alot to do with technique and how trained your voice are, the sky's the limit on range. So get a good coach/teacher that knows how to expand range and get a practice routine going :) cheers"
singing,33kacx,ViktorClay,2,Thu Apr 23 07:16:13 2015 UTC,"the sky's the limit on range   While I wouldn't go so far to say this, people definitely underestimate just how far you can extend your range, particularly upward. It's not a coincidence that many great vocal teachers have 3-4 octave ranges; they have spent so much time on their voice, developing proper technique, and exercising their voice just as an olympic athlete exercises the muscles used in their sport. Even a Bass (possibly even a Basso Profundo, but no guarantees) could learn to extend their upper range until they can reach an A4 (usually the highest note you hear in pop punk styles) in head voice, and if they've worked enough on their head voice, it can sound very chesty. Don't expect to achieve this in a few months though, I'm talking years of practice here. You might never have the same brightness or ring to your voice as a 'true' tenor does, but so long as you can sing the notes, shaping them and developing your timbre so that those notes sound good is something that just needs time and, again, practice."
singing,33kacx,TktsboCardiomyopathy,5,Thu Apr 23 09:45:58 2015 UTC,"Good post, one point i also wanna highlight is it's impossible to hear how a voice Will turn out before the technique is in place. Very few teachers and singers actualy use classification the way it should be (a a guideline for parts in opera).  Mostly what we get is alot of untrained or uncoordinated singers throwing fach here and there, this can also be done by highly regarded teachers.  My vocal Journey was just like that, people telling me what my voice was how it would become ect. In the end i got all the things they said id never be able to do.  Cheers"

singing,33iyc4,HydroCon,6,Wed Apr 22 22:06:52 2015 UTC,Any experience is better than none. Try out singing in the band while learning from YouTube singing tutorials. It's the best of both worlds. Just try to be mindful of not straining your voice and how loud the band is playing. Everyone should be able to hear each other without destroying their instrument.
singing,33iyc4,Shaderlees,3,Wed Apr 22 22:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think it kind of depends on what your goals are. If you just kind of want to sing for fun and your band is good with you singing, then just go for it! It sounds like fun and good experience.   On the other hand, if you're trying to actually develop good technique and longevity as a singer, I would say to wait until you are able to get lessons, or at least work on things at home for the most part. Band rehearsals are not a good place to be working on technique (it's just a waste of everyone else's time, and you may be self-conscious about doing technical exercises or working on something from a technique perspective).   You are in danger of developing bad habits by singing a lot if you don't know what you're doing, but it's up to you how much you care about that. If you don't really have long-term goals as a singer, there's no harm with just having fun now."
singing,33iyc4,keakealani,2,Thu Apr 23 03:57:47 2015 UTC,"I sing alone and in a band, and while any experience is valuable, I'm at my best singing alone, because I can really focus on the quality of sound and level of strain on my voice. At the rehearsal studio I don't often hear myself as well, so I tell the guys not to judge me and to wait for the recording."
singing,33iyc4,manamachine,2,Wed Apr 22 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"Both, if your going to be a singer of a band of course. I am a singer for a rather loud band, and it's been a learning process. If you do not know how to sing properly alone, you will not know how to not push yourself with the band when your in a crappy audio setup, things go wrong, or the band cranks it as the gig goes on. You need to sing like your on your own when your with the band. But... If you don't sing with the band, you will never figure out what it's like to push yourself too far while with the band, and what to work on with a teacher, or yourself. Also will give you material to work on. My other biggest thing, be yourself, don't try and sing like someone else does, find your natural key, and if a song just isn't working for you, try and have the band transpose it. Also try and get other people to sing backup, even if they can just hit a note or two, it can help you out a lot.  Practice your bands songs on your own, either with a slow downer, or get them into guitar pro or some other midi format. If you don't have a piano in your band, put the main tune, probably lead guitar, into a piano sound.  These are simply the things I have learned with some teacher help, friends, and myself.  Good luck"
singing,33iyc4,iComeInPeices,2,Thu Apr 23 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"Singing in a band and singing alone are two entirely different animals. You should be practicing both, but you aren't going to be able to sing with a band until you start singing with a band and working on that, no matter how good you are. Confidence is a big part, and you seem to be fine with that, but understanding the audio system and your bandmates is really important too.   You should be singing in some form at most band meetings if possible. Even if you're doing backing vocals (which I do most of the time since I'm also doing lead guitar), anything helps. Also practice on your own, because you still need to understand your voice on its own and how everything feels, but make sure you're working in a band context as well.  Also be careful not to strain yourself. I've made that mistake a couple times (mostly by reaching for my highest notes without properly warming up), and it'll do more harm than good. It's hard to notice, especially if you're getting really into the music, but keep it in the back of your head, and dial back if you feel pain or anything. Feel free to take breaks, stuff like that. Give a member an extended solo, involve the crowd (live shows can wreak havoc on your voice especially), and have backup plans. Not only will this let you rest your voice, but your band will be more connected and your shows will be more entertaining."
singing,33iyc4,Murch23,2,Thu Apr 23 11:11:18 2015 UTC,"Hey! I think its very important to practise singing alone at home for two hours everyday, first half hour of physical stretches and vocal warm-ups that are very comfortable for your range, then you want to focus on specific techniques that you are weak on (vibrato, straight tone, pitch etc), then for the rest of the time you HAVE to practise with backing tracks, those will guide you in the right direction of the key, rhythm and will make you comfortable when you will be playing with the band. I think its very important (and totally cringe) to record your voice when practising songs, and then evaluate what you have to work on. Its a horrible process learning how to sing well, you will always feel shit, but as long you practise all the time with baking tracks before you practise with the band, you will probably be in the right key, have the tempo down etc when you are in a gig. And thats important. There is oohing more scary then getting the key wrong, i personally haven't but my boyfriend was hired for a gig and the girl decided to change all the original keys of the songs, and then the keyboard player forgot when playing Stevie Wonders Superstition, and  oh boy she was panicking for the whole verse until she finally LISTENED TO THE REST OF THE BAND and fixed her key. Also, many singers are very very very stuck up, don't be like that. Lets be honest, singers are not the most important player in a band, its the drums, because if the drums fuck up everyone fucks up. ANYWAY sorry to trail off, but after you practise at home lots and lots with backing tracks and record yourself, i promise you will feel a lot more comfortable singing with a band. and yes it is very very vital to get together every week to practise the songs with the band, because hopefully they will be honest with what you can work on. sometime we are not our worse critic. I hope that helps!!"

singing,33k0yh,tsilihiNehT,4,Thu Apr 23 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"So I come from a super choral background (started in a community youth choir when I was 8 and have been in at least one choir ever since). I am also currently in college as a vocal performance major, which is pretty much exclusively solo music. In other words, I have a lot of passion for both forms of singing.   So it shouldn't surprise you, I like both! I think they both offer something important, and I think both are really beautiful.   In fact, I don't think they should really be treated as the same instrument at all. I think they're maybe like the difference between an oboe and a clarinet. They're related - they're both woodwinds. They can have similar types of music. But ultimately, what you're getting is a bit different and isn't completely comparable.   Choral music is all about creating a unified (not necessarily blended) sounds with a bunch of people - the community and togetherness is a big part of why it's so wonderful to listen to a great choir. It's also a wonderful experience as a singer, since it involves so much cooperation and listening to others, which is a very valuable skill as a musician.   At the same time, solo music allows you to connect with one specific soloist who is expressing their own interpretation of a piece, without a conductor and a bunch of other people also lending their interpretation. Then it's just between the singer and the audience (and the pianist or orchestra, of course!) and, with a good soloist, you can feel exactly what they're trying to convey.   Also, I think age has a lot to do with it. When I was your age, I really idealized the choral sound because it's a lot more accessible to younger voices. This is just a physiological thing - the types of sounds valued in choral music are just easier to produce with less mature voices. It is also a very forgiving art - although in a good choir everyone must be a good singer, the point is not to showcase one person's superb technical ability, but to showcase the ability of the group. I've heard choirs made up of some really talented singers who could not work together, and it's awful (even if the singers individually are really great), and I've heard choirs of somewhat mediocre individual singers that really come together and produce a great performance, even if most of the individual members would have only been ""okay"" on stage by themselves. I think this is very compatible with a lot of developing singers because it is a safe place to explore your voice without necessarily being judged as an individual. It took me until I was about 23 to really feel comfortable exploring my voice beyond the choral setting.   However, on the flip side, I will say that now, I'm at a point where choral singing is often less enjoyable because I'm almost always contracted to sing outside of my natural voice type. But that's less about choral singing generally and more about being misplaced, but I do think that's an issue with choirs for many reasons.   Anyway, great question! I'm excited to hear what others have to say - I do think there are lots of angles to approach this from. :)"
singing,33k0yh,keakealani,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your response! I can really get behind what you're saying here. I definitely should embrace an ambivalence towards each side. Truthfully that safeness does come out a lot with me. I remember one Spring my school choir had a select few, including myself, have the chance to sing Chichester Psalms by Bernstein with other schools in the area and also the Plymouth (MA) Philharmonic. I sang bass, and together as a whole I felt completely safe and the sound was awesome. But at my level at the time when I took myself and did a solo practice I would often lose myself and get off tune. I look forwards however, to pursuing some solo work. Thanks for the feedback! :D"
singing,33k0yh,keakealani,2,Thu Apr 23 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"I would really encourage you to explore solo singing! You're not alone. It's really nice to work within the confines of realizing that even if you mess up one note, another singer has your back and you'll overall still produce a great sound. Also, things that are totally unfeasible as a soloist become possible in a group. If I tried to sing my real pianissimo as a soloist, you would barely hear me! But you can get some really haunting super soft sounds when you're in a group and you know together, you'll all be heard but the effect is stunning.   Also side note, kinda jealous you did Chichester Psalms! I think we're going to do them next year in my university choir, and I'm so excited. Just really fantastic music."

Luckily I don't think you count as a heavy smoker and it's only been a few years,  so I wouldn't expect a significant amount  of permanent  damage. Smokers voice tends to take daily smoking over decades,  but things can happen earlier or later, and probably earlier in terms of singing.   Smoking,  even hookah is harsh on the vocal cords.  It's hot,  thick,  and irritable air,  so there is certainly  some damage,  even temporary  that occurs.  If  it causes some people to cough,  it's gonna be somewhat harmful. Idk if hookah is significantly  less harmful than cigarettes,  considering you often smoke a fair amount in a session. It might be,  but it would be stupid to think it's harmless.   Everyone's voice is different,  and some people will be significantly  more affected than other on a temporary  basis.  I can certainly say after a hookah session,  my voice has some minor,  but noticible changes."

A friend of mine was having terrible vocal problems, airyness, cracking, etc when she started grad school. She eventually realized that her throat/folds were getting irritated from the heavy breathing she did when jogging (we are also in CA, so the air is very dry.)    Also you mentioned heavy dieting, which overall can make your body weak. Food contains a lot of the water we get for the day, so it's also possible that you're dehydrated.

You can message me or you don't have to share, but did you suffer from an ED? Because I think this might be a relapse for me. I used to binge/purge but I recovered but now I'm obsessed with food and weight and calories again and I've been restricting to low intake + cardio.

I was constantly stressed out, and had low self esteem from not getting roles/solos. I would go most of my day without eating a meal, and some days went from 8 AM til night and I was just EXHAUSTED. I couldn't get the strength and support I needed, and my voice was super wimpy (I have a light voice anyway!) If you're having problems like this I really recommend some counseling. I did the ED program at my university and it helped a LOT. I know how freaking stressful music school is and how it can make relapses happen.

Ugh.  I'm just confused why it's only one part of my range though. I have a light voice (but it's big for a light voice if that makes sense haha) and my power hasn't changed at all, it's just that singing in that part of my range that I normally have no problems with, suddenly there are problems.

My only other thought is maybe, if you're younger (if you're doing arias I'm guessing not that young), this is some sort of physical development issue? E5 is a really common passaggio for sopranos so it is possible you're just seeing a bigger change than normal, although probably unlikely.   I will also say, sometimes things like allergies and illness sneak up on me - I otherwise feel fine and don't notice any symptoms, but my voice just decides to be crap for a couple days. So I wouldn't completely rule out things like allergies or sickness as you may have just not noticed many symptoms but still have some irritation going on in your vocal folds.   Of course, none of this really helps with your audition, so all I can say is good luck!"

Music school really can be a super stressful time and I'm seeing a lot of peers in that grad school mode (luckily I'm behind so I have a bit more time before approaching that beast). It's a really rough thing to deal with and I relate to struggling with those underlying mental health/emotional problems during times like these.

singing,33i3bt,ghoti023,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"Any voice type can be used in any genre,  although modern  pop tends to favor lyrical voices with high extensions, often  tenor or baritone. But there's ton of genres that are good for low baritones and you'll find many singers.  Hip hop,  R&B,  Rock,  jazz (last two have so many sub genres),  classical,  and many others.   There's a few reasons modern pop us hard on low voices.  For one,  they tend to not have the same brightness,  and the bass gets lost on  shitty sound systems.  Two,  they are rarely good singers in general.  Most people who have low male voices get stuck sounding like a deep chesty bass and never handle their upper register.    Many fail to get much brightness  through  their range that their singing sounds like they are speaking.  What they are doing doesn't sound like good singing in pop,  because often it isn't.  If you can't handle you high notes, in full voice,  you'll probably wont get far in pop.  So the amount of low voices that actually do make handle their head voice y(and there certainly a high amount,  just smaller percentage than higher voiced people)  face the current  issues that favor tenors,  making them even less likely to be exposed."

singing,33e280,HovaPrime,5,Tue Apr 21 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Hi, I know exactly how you're feeling and I would have liked someone to have given me this advice a few years ago so I'll try my best.  :-)  This career is extremely harsh, unstable, and unpredictable.  There are tips and guides online on how to become successful at it, but everyone's path is different.  However, like any other business, the most important thing you can do as a singer is to build a name for yourself.  Also, networking is extremely important.    When I started out, I sang the national anthem at a lot of different sporting events and those were the first few things I put on my resume.  I also performed every year for free at community events and that got me my name out there as a good performer in my genre.  Later, those connections led to paid gigs.  After I met a pianist while recording at a studio, I started a band with him and 3 other musicians with me as the solo singer.  From there, we started to do bigger events and festivals who wanted a band in our genre.  So basically, the best advice I can give you from my own personal experience is to identify your genre and niche, network with other musicians, and be professional.  A lot of people in this career are flakes so being reliable can go a long way.  Also don't give up and develop tough skin!  No matter how good you are people will always find something to criticize and point out.  Finally, sometimes dealing with bookings can be frustrating but don't let it get you down.  Set up a nice press kit and email it out there to venues who you think will like your music and make sure to call and follow up with them.  It's a lot to juggle at once, but you will get better with time.  This is just some of the advice I can offer according to my own experience as a singer and songwriter.  I wish you nothing but the best!  Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have.  I'm glad to help.  :-)"

You can - and should - always have your ""fun for myself repertoire"", do a few shows per month with it, but if you want to get booked to get paid (at least until you have a name with your other program), be prepared to play what they want."
singing,33e280,ghoti023,2,Wed Apr 22 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I really agree with this. It's something I struggle with, too - I have very eclectic tastes for a classical singer (think Barber and Schoenberg more than Schubert and Mozart), but I know that I won't be able to make a living singing obscure contemporary music.   It's not to say you should always ""sell out"", but yes, you eventually have to provide a product people want to buy. That's capitalism for you. May as well find a way to be at least sort of happy with that compromise."

singing,33e280,terrycotta,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'd start at church.  Talk to the music director of your church (I'm assuming you're in church based off of the name of the competition you won. If I'm wrong about that, sorry!) and start there. It's important to start building a base to start from, and churches have been funding the arts since their conception.  Community theatre, open mic nights, bars etc are all great places to start. I would also be taking voice lessons. I know that that's an expense, but you can convince your parents that as a hobby, it's important to you. Talk to them like singing is a hobby, for now.  I'm assuming you'll be going to college soon if your parents have their way (after stalking your profile, you're roughly 18) as you can't have any of those high-paying jobs they want you to have without a college degree. Minor in music if you wind up going to college and you can't convince them to let you major in it. Not that you need a college degree necessarily to be a professional musician, but you do learn a lot, and not just from books. You'll also be able to make a lot of connections in a short period of time, as well as have a bajillion and one performance opportunities. College may also help ease your parents' minds. idk.  Right now, you can't make a career out of singing. Winning one competition at 17 isn't enough. You need to be performing everywhere you possibly can and taking lessons the whole time. Everyone's path to music success is different, and right now, you don't have enough experience at all to have too many different options. So your first step is to perform everywhere and begin really seriously exploring the options available to you in your area. It's possible, but it's hard. You'll have to do a lot of outreach yourself - people won't necessarily come to you in the beginning."

My goal was to minor in music and I was hoping to find something I'd be interested in for a major but so far with no luck.  I actually found my passion to be a singer at my church, my pastor heard my voice and wanted me on the worship team and afterwards I entered the competition I talked about in the first post.  I then lead the youth group band as lead vocals for about half a year until I became too old to be a part of the youth, my music pastor has been trying to talk me into singing with him for Sunday services but due to my job on Sunday I haven't been able to do it.  Thank you for all those advice, I think I might see if my work will let me come in a few hours later so I can sing on Sundays I think it'll be a good practice for performing in the future."
singing,33e280,terrycotta,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define prestigious.  Before you can reach your goals, you need to know what they are. There's miles of differences between joining a prestigious musical school in classical singing, and having your cover song be #1 on YouTube or whatever. If it's because you want to play sold-out arenas, that's one path. If it's because you want a huge network, that's a different path entirely. They're not mutually exclusive, but they're very, very different things to focus on."
singing,33e280,terrycotta,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:09:22 2015 UTC,Well what would you recommend I do if I want to create a good solid fanbase on YouTube?
singing,33e280,mwb2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:36:24 2015 UTC,Start learning about video and sound editing; and start posting covers of popular songs with your own spin on them.
singing,33e280,keakealani,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"Well, sound and video editing, as the other guy said. Spending money on quality equipment helps as well - nobody wants to subscribe to built-in webcam videos of some guy singing into his iPhone while sitting in an undone bed in a messy room.  YouTubers have the ability to drag their audience into their life and make them a part of it. I think that can definitely be a good tool, you just have to be creative. What makes your music channel so special that people will subscribe to you over the thousands of other channels? Maybe it's a cooking&singing channel, maybe you do vocal lessons or concert reviews, or maybe your life is (scripted?) interestingly enough that people just want more of your charisma and humor.  Once you're ready to go, I'd say create ~a month worth of videos before you get started. Work on your channel and how it looks. Stores don't open in empty buildings, they put up signs and decoration to catch peoples attention.  Make sure you're visible on social media. Create a fan page, an official twitter, an Instagram etc. and let people know you're planning on starting this YouTube channel.  Then with a month or so worth of videos (whatever amount you think you'll be doing without preparation as well, I'd say min 2 a week), you're ready to get started. Post it on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, both your personal accounts and your official accounts. It doesn't have to be fancy yet, it can just be:  Hey, everyone. I'm going to start doing covers every Monday and Thursday from now on. I did a Fanpage for this project, which you can find over at @MondayAndThursdayCovers, so make sure to subscribe, it is going to be awesome!  If anyone has any requests or opinions, I'd love to hear. And share for the love of all that is holy!  Disclaimer: telling people what you want them to do is good, being annoying about it is bad (no ""hey John pls like my page and share it pls and respond pls haha""). And absolutely no cold approaching no matter what, not on public pages statuses, not in private messages, not on Skype, nothing. You can't get much more annoying than ""if you like these guys, you'll love my music, check it out, sub for sub etc.""  Alright, so after a month you should've started to notice that people seem to begin to care about your project. Not a lot, but at least a few likes on whatever you post. Sure, it's probably still mostly (if not exclusively) friends and family, but at least they see your stuff and support you!  Time for marketing and networking! Make sure you have a decent press kit - a biography, a few good photos, quality videos. Then you can start reaching out to those who can help you in your progress. Be creative. There are blogs and YouTube channels dedicated to showcasing people like you, that can definitely help you. Don't be afraid to reach out to the local press as well. ""Local kid the next YouTube sensation?""  Network with similar YouTubers, either YouTubers who do the same kinds of videos or YouTubers who live near you. Collaborate with them, make videos together if you live near each other, and/or create music with them if it's a music channel.  Network everywhere. You never know who you're going to meet. If somebody had told me my first time on the local radio would be because of a random guy I spoke with for five minutes, drunk out of my mind at 6am in the morning, requesting me to show up at the very radio station with my demo tape 1,5 hour later, I wouldn't have believed them, but that's what happened. Similarly, I got my first tour arranged at a small, nasty bar, frequented mainly by drug addicts. It was 10am, I had been partying since 10pm the day before, and I hadn't even ate anything yet. Some guy was doing cocaine in the back and we got talking for whatever reason. Turns out he used to tour the continent and had a shit ton of contacts. Point is, the contacts are everywhere and you may not even recognize them.  It may be impossible to plan out a YouTube career, but these are my experiences. I hope it can be at least somewhat useful!"
singing,33e30z,DeudeWTF,2,Tue Apr 21 19:50:36 2015 UTC,Practice enunciating each consonant and chanting each vowel (in scales too). random mouth exercises and stretching the tongue in all directions and jaw may help loosen some tension and realign the chi/nerves
singing,33e30z,Shadowfury957,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:08:03 2015 UTC,Ok sounds like it will help. All my words just kind of flow together into a melodic piece of gibberish lol
singing,33e30z,keakealani,2,Wed Apr 22 02:09:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely just practicing, as /u/Shadowfury957 points out, will be really helpful.   But, I would strongly recommend you also begin to think about the specific sounds in language and be very specific about what those sounds are and how they work. For me, it is very helpful to work things out in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), because each character represents a distinct sound and I can boil it down to a few sounds that are giving me issues.   You can go in both directions - recording yourself and transcribing the IPA (and fixing anything that is incorrect or inaccurate), and writing IPA of your songs and trying to sing with those sounds (noting any time you don't use the sound you wrote). Both are extremely helpful for being accurate with your diction and just being more understandable to the audience."
singing,33e30z,carlwehden,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"Part of the journey of improving your voice is gradually separating / isolating the various muscle groups so they work independently of one another.   Many struggling singers will habitually engage muscles in the jaw / mouth / tongue area when vocalizing and as a result will struggle with certain vowels / consonant combinations. The mouth / tongue / jaw should be used in exactly the same way they are during speech to enunciate and pronounce words. If you feel unable to do this normally when you sing then it's likely there is tension there that you are unaware of.    In terms of exercises anything that prevents you from engaging those muscles inappropriately when you vocalize will help, so the idea is to counteract any tension by occupying those muscles with something that inhibits the old habit and give a new one the chance to establish.   Doing an 'ng' exercise with the mouth wide open can help. Or a clear 'aah' again with the mouth open and the tongue hanging far out of the mouth. Also just generally becoming more aware during your practice of when the muscles in the mouth / jaw / tongue are becoming active and gradually letting go of that tension can help.   This is the kind of problem you can't fix over night, it takes patience and time to let go.  Carl  https://www.youtube.com/user/cwehden/videos  http://carlwehden.tumblr.com"
singing,33e30z,keakealani,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"The mouth / tongue / jaw should be used in exactly the same way they are during speech to enunciate and pronounce words   I don't agree. Vowel modifications are common (and in fact necessary, often times) during singing, and there are certain speech patterns that are universally rejected in singing but acceptable in speech. For example, the syllablized alveolar approximant [ɹ̩] is never acceptable in singing, but is always replaced with the rhoticized mid-neutral vowel [ɚ] or low-mid neutral vowel [ɝ]."
singing,33e30z,carlwehden,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:19:49 2015 UTC,I'm not commenting on vowel modification or speech patterns these are by and large irrelevant if the singer can't yet enunciate clearly and easily.   The basic point is that for most people learning to sing what inhibits free enunciation is tension that isn't present when they speak. The idea is that whatever the larynx is doing the mouth / tongue / jaw should be left alone to do there job which is to pronounce and enunciate words.

singing,33e30z,keakealani,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"Well, perhaps we'll have to agree to disagree. In my experience, I actually think quite a few singers who have diction issues in singing also have diction issues in speaking, so I don't necessarily think turning to speaking is a good way to solve the issues. But of course, neither of us knows exactly what's going on with OP so it's impossible to say whether your advice would work in this situation. Thanks for providing your opinion :)"

I saw improvement, but not as much as I wanted.

In my opinion, the problem with dvd's and online resources is they teach you technique but can't tell you real time what your doing wrong. I'm sure some people can learn from them and do well, but that wasn't the case for me.  Whatever you end up doing, good luck!"

I feel like I'm running stairs sometimes, but it's good for me. :)   There is a lot of free stuff on YouTube too, but it overwhelms me a bit and I wanted something that could interact and show me where I am singing things wrong so the software approach is working well so far and it was pretty affordable compared to the virtual online lesson stuff.   http://www.emediamusic.com/singing-lessons/singing-method.html"

singing,33crwb,Mr_Uptick,2,Tue Apr 21 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Let me preface this: I am by no means an expert on this, or anything really. I've only been playing around audio-related things for about 6 months, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  First of all, are you planning to record vocals only or do you play any instruments?  I notice you linked to a couple of acoustic performances. If this is the kind of thing you'd like to do I'd recommend getting two of the less expensive mics to get a better set up than with a single mic; Although, with a condenser it can totally work.  Currently, I use a Scarlett 2i4 interface, a Rode NT1-A for guitar, and a Shure sm58 for vocals. I just found this set-up two weeks ago and immediately fell in love.   My best advice is to go to your local music shop. Most shops offer some sort of service where you can buy a mic, try it out and if you don't like it bring it back. On top of that, the employees are usually involved in music in some way or other and they often have great advice on what to get.  Also, check out /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers and /r/buildastudio for help. These two are more technical oriented than /r/singing I'd say.   Rode NT2A (is this just a slightly better version of NT1?)   The NT2-A is an NT1-A with options. It can be either cardioid, double cardioid, or omnidirectional. You can add padding of of -5 and -10dB, and even a high pass filter if you so desire. Personally, I don't think it's worth the higher price."
singing,33crwb,BigJuiceBox,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"Great start out pick about the Scarlett 2i4, but do note that there is a lot more different behind the NT2A and NT1A when it comes to build ;)  As an engineer I can tell you theres a huge difference when it comes to end results that are hard to notice until you have recorded both mics at the same time"
singing,33crwb,dantev,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"/r/audioengineering is the sub you're looking for.   On that note, any of the mics mentioned would be a solid choice.  Which one is right for you will depend on a slew of variables from the type of voice you're recording, to the genre you're working in, to the room you're tracking in.   You may also want to look into a Sontronics STC-2 in your price range.   As far as the interface goes, I cannot suggest the Tascam. The build quality on their units is not great. If you're only looking to do things like vocals and maybe guitar, i would HIGHLY suggest something like the Focusrite 6i6. The two mic preamps are very nice for the price range. Build quality is durable, and you have room for mild expansion in the event of needing more inputs.   Good luck."
singing,33crwb,JVAFD,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"You should first narrow it down by deciding if you want to get a dynamic mic (SM7B) or condensor (all the others you listed). The condensors are a lot more sensitive and detailed which is great in a studio, but this can work against you if you are at home recording in a less than ideal acoustic space because of all the room sound they also pick up. They can also give you more headaches with sibilance, and will require an interface that provides phantom power.  The dynamics do require more gain however. If you want to look at dynamics, consider the EV RE20 as well. It has some nice features like lack of proximity effect and minimal off axis coloration that make it easy to get great results (it has a deserved reputation as one of the best broadcast mics ever). For what it's worth I have a deep singing voice and own an EV RE20, an SM7B and several condensor mics, and for my own voice have come to usually prefer the EV when recording at home. A lot of people with both prefer the SM7B though, so it really depends on your voice and the sound you're trying to get. You really can't go wrong with any of the options you listed."
singing,33crwb,Bolmac,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"Audio Engineer Here!  Judging by your sound choice those might actually be indeed the best options for you most likely. I do recommend asking around in your network if anyone you know has one. You would be amazed about how many people have either one of the microphones you have listed cause they are quite populair choices (make note also the c214 a lot of people in our business use a 614, which is nearly identical in response but slight differences in components).   If you go for the SM7B do note that the microphones voltage -> dB is really low so if you get a interface with it be clear to state this with a retailer.  Personal Opinion per Mic  Rode NT1 Lovely open sound, but the top end (airy sound) can sound quite metallic/glossy. It is really great for a budget microphone in it's range especially considering it was Rodes first microphones.  Rode NT2A Mostly an updated model of the original NT1 the glossy metallic sound is still there, but in a mix if properly edited is barely audible for most consumers.  Shure SM7B Great Microphone, but it might sound a bit less open compared to the other microphones you have listed, because it is a dynamic microphone instead of a condensor. Great thing though if you are a hobbyist is that a dynamic microphone works a whole lot better in a situation where someone is just sitting in a untreated room. Downside of this microphone is that the output is extremely low, which can be quite annoying when you are recording a vocal track.  AKG c214 Great versatile microphone in general. Can sound a bit harsh but never really had an issue with the harshness and especially considering your tone choice and my experience with artists with the same tone is that it sounds fantastic on them.  Neumann TLM 102 Neumann is quite populair for what most people consider a quite natural microphone tone, but I do have to say that if you are just getting into recording and mixing this microphone can also ""exaggerate"" a lot of sounds you do not like about your voice. I highly recommend it if you really wanna jump into the deep of pro audio and mixing, but I highly disapprove this microphone for starters.  My Advice would be take the SM7B if you mainly want it to sound warm Take the C214 if you want a bit more grit  And feel free to PM in case you need to know anything I check reddit daily  Edit: made some slight edits in layout"

The voice is one of the last things to fully develop, so even if you thought you were done with awkward adolescence, unfortunately you still have many years to go before it's fully settled. So first of all, what you're experiencing is very nomal. Male voices especially fluctuate a lot in range during this age range, and that's just a normal part of life.   I would also say, this is one very good reason to take a step back and work on your middle range rather than  trying to sing higher in your range where more is going on. If you build your technique in the middle, you'll give yourself the tools to sing high when your voice catches up, without potentially introducing strain and other issues."

To be honest, I get a fair few comments from people about when I sing with my own English accent. Not that it sounds bad (or, no one has told me it sounds bad yet) or anything, but that it sounds strange because they're used to hearing that American accent in singing more often."

It can have a few different presentations, and milder acid reflux, etc... well some people will hardly notice it.   Edit: Idk if you did end up trying the prilosec, but if you even think acid is a possibility, it's not a bad drug.

EDIT: Also, should you choose the collegiate route for voice, you can expect another 4 years rather than three. Most colleges require 8 semesters of private voice alone for a Bachelors of Music, and then a ton of extra requirements on top of that. I don't know anyone who's finished a music degree in less than 4 years, even if they have previous college (unless that previous college was also music related). Most people take 5 years for their music degree so they can stay sane with their class load. You could look into a Bachelor of Arts, which has fewer requirements, but also holds less weight irl."

singing,337gzd,ghoti023,4,Mon Apr 20 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"There are a variety of degrees that you could get that would fit those genres - but it's important to ask yourself if you really think you're ready. 19 is really young, and a lot of the people you will be going up against will have degrees.  You can get contemporary voice degrees depending on your college, or vocal jazz - which is also in the pop-ish area. There are specific music theatre degrees (which, if you want to go that route, you will have a harder road without one). You could get a Bachelors of Music in voice performance, which is classical, or a Bachelor of Arts - which is mostly classical.  I have a lot of friends that have taken various combinations of these routes. For musical theatre, I honestly think my friends with their BM's in music and dance, with a minor in theatre, are probably going to get the farthest.  College was useful for me to narrow down what kind of music I want to do. (Even within the realm of classical there's a bajillion different paths.) It was also the closest taste I had to a taste of how busy in reality I would need to be in order to be successful, and how much not-stage-time work actually needs to be done to be more than good.  These jobs you're looking at may not specifically require degrees, but you will be at a disadvantage not having one. College is also incredibly useful to begin building your resume and gathering connections. If nothing else of value comes from college, those connections are probably the most important part. If you have connections, you can piece together a career.  I have heard tales of people attempting to get into the music business without an undergraduate degree, but I do not personally know any of them. I know a few that have made it work without their masters.  If you're really concerned about the cost of college, there is no harm in trying out the professional field for a year or two to see if it works for you.  Be aware that a full-time performance career is probably not a viable option at this time, and that you'd be getting a lot of part time work, so you'd need to supplement your income with a ""day job."" Yep - those are real things, and not just for Broadway hopefuls. Many singers have voice studios or music teaching jobs as their day job, but without a college degree, you won't be qualified for those positions at all. While you may have a shot performing against others with degrees, I would eat my hat if you managed a teaching position.  There's nothing wrong with being a non-average college student. There is no reason to rush into it if you are uncertain. The voice takes until at least your mid-twenties to solidify itself anyway, and if you keep taking lessons outside of school, you'll be up to speed for collegiate auditions later if that's what you decide you need. I repeat: there is no reason to rush into college. You should just understand the genre and line of work you're trying to get into, and have a clearer idea of what your overall goals are.  Are you songwriting? Are you a back-up singer? Are you the front man? Are you playing other instruments? What jobs are available in the area you're at right now?  TL:DR - If you're unsure, play the field for a year or two and get a feel for what's out there. Don't set your expectations too high. Colleges will be there if you need them."
singing,337gzd,keakealani,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:17:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this, and also want to chime in with personal experience. I'm 25 and after a rather non-traditional path I'm in my junior-ish year of college as a voice major (I transferred over from composition so I'm behind in voice but had music credits already). And I'm so glad I took the time to really figure out what I wanted to do and pursue my field.   I took a few years off from school and tried on a few different hats before figuring out what I wanted to do, and that's okay! But, I also value my education now and am excited to finish my degree and perhaps go to grad school.   In other words, it's not only all right to not rush through school, but sometimes you're better off for it. So try not to make any ultimatums, but do take time to really think about your best option."

Because I'm sure you know if you are talking about ""rock/pop/indie/whatever"" kind of music, then even if you get to the point that you are big enough to be touring all over the place you still are barely making any money.  So .. you know .. when you want to buy a house, or start a family, or pay for you parents seniors care, that becomes an issue.  And then after you have had a (relatively) successful run of it and toured all over the place for 10 years .. then you are 35.  So .. what then?  Wait tables?   Get a job in retail?  In music, vocalists have the hardest time of making money.  It's basically an ""all or nothing"" kind of situation.  Big money for .0001% and the rest are barely surviving (or not surviving).  If you are a player it's different  ..  you can gig 4, 5, 6, 7 nights a week in a big city with all kinds of different acts.  Little trios and duos.  Receptions, boats, gallery openings.  Whatever.  There are tons of music jobs out there that have no use for a singer.  Those are the jobs that will be paying the rents of keyboard players, drummers, bassists, guitarists, whatever.  They can make a living without necessarily going on tour, if they are in a big city.  But as a singer .. you can't really do that.  Not even talking about ""Can your voice hold up"".  You just cant fill up your schedule in the same way.  If you have a band nobody is interested in seeing you 5 nights a week.  If you try to have several different acts then you start having scheduling problems, because all of your bands will want to play juicy weekend gigs.  And you will have to tell Band 3, and Band 4 that you cant play with them because you have commitments with Band 1 and Band 2.  So Band 3 and Band 4 will start thinking about finding another vocalist that will be able to take all the gigs they are offered.  So .. you have to do the ""touring thing"" with one act that you really like and keep touring all the time in order to fill up your calendar with paying gigs.  Forget about a ""normal social life"".  Forget about a ""normal family/relationship situation"".  You will always either be away, or have no money if you are at home.  And this will keep going on until .. ?  Until you get sick of it.   Or .. until you get old and ""not cool"" anymore.  Then you get a boring, low paying job. And have a mid-life crisis.  Or .. you try to stay in the same place and you hook up with some kind of regular show like a hotel gig or tourist show somewhere.  Or maybe get a low-paying spot in a choir or in musical theatre and squeek by that way.  This might be possible in a big city.  Teaching might be an option .. but it's also hand-to-mouth existence.  And good luck if you don't have a degree, or are a man.  It's super tough.  And pretty much anyone that has been through it would tell you to stay in school and get your degree.  I would even say to get a degree in something non-musical like marketing.  That way after your music career peters out you will have an easier time getting into something like events management or culture.  You know .. still stay inside the entertainment/performance industry .. but move to a desk or admin position.  I would only say to do the music degree if you want to have teaching as an option.  If you are black and good looking .. then your situation is marginally better.  There are tons of cruises, resorts, hotels, whatever around the world in places like Russia China and Dubai that love to have ""authentic real-life black people"" performing.  The only time that I would say ""Yes. Do it.  Drop school."" Is if you had some incredibly juicy thing on your plate right now that you would lose if you stayed in school.  If that is not the case .. do your future self a favour and get a degree."

It surely can be true and does happen; but I would say that if you're going to plan on touring with shows or in a band that you should do it while you're young. Realize that it may not last forever and also plan to have a fallback and make sure to make connections along the way. You never know when those connections will end up being a ""juicy"" longterm gig or leads you to the next phase in your life.  Touring is not a sucky life tho. I had a blast in my 20s doing it. Saw most of Europe, The Americas, and Brazil. Hey, you may decide to take a job in travel when it's all over. lol  I guess the point is to do your research and then set a plan but keep updating your plan as things come your way.

singing,336xli,Girlprep,16,Mon Apr 20 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"This is why we discourage beginners trying to figure out voice type too early - it's very confusing and you're more likely to hurt yourself than gain anything useful from trying to type your voice at this stage.   However, it's worth making a couple of points.   Voice types were developed in the classical singing world, and there are standards beyond being able to ""hit"" a note in order for it to be considered part of your functional range - namely, that it's audible in a decently sized hall over piano or orchestra, and that the singer is capable of sustaining that range for the duration of a recital/opera. This is probably why people are saying that it's ""impossible"" for a baritone to sing C5 - it's not about the physical possibility, it's about the fact that baritones won't be able to produce it in that way. (And I'm also not one to deliver ultimatums - a faculty member at my university is a bass-baritone who has, in my witnessing, sung a tenor C at full voice. It's just that it was not a pleasant timbre and it would have been really taxing on him if he had continued - this was just for a demonstration in my vocal ped class to discuss exactly this point.)  Obviously, this means that if you're measuring by other means (such as producing pitches that are audible, but would require external amplification to carry in a bigger space), you'll necessarily get different results than the classical definitions of voice types. It also means that if you're vocally doing something different than classical singing, you could get different results - for example, some genres include falsetto-like sounds that wouldn't be considered part of a classical singer's range.   In addition, as you've probably heard before, the voice doesn't settle until the mid-late 20s on average (and in my experience, the 21-26 age range is the most volatile for men), so whatever you're doing now has very little bearing on what your eventual voice type might be.   But no, I don't think baritones ""turn into"" tenors. I think, though, that a lot of inexperienced singers and voice teachers make the ""baritone/soprano assumption"", and then as the singer's training continues, their voice shows more of its true colors and this assumption needs to be altered. It's partially statistics - statistically most men are baritones, so it's a fair place to start out absent of other information. Developmentally, most young men also have an easier time singing in their mid-low range, so it also makes sense in that regard for singers to start out with that general area.   In short, don't worry about voice type. I've found that people who try to type their voices too early tend to sing poorly because they're trying to fit their voice into a mold (or push their voice into a different one), while people who train their voice naturally end up with a better overall conception of technique and are less likely to hurt themselves."

singing,336gz4,xarahn,2,Mon Apr 20 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken you shape your voice using 2 groups of muscles.   The first set of muscles, when used almost exclusively, will produce your chest voice and have more weight and tone. Without using the second set of muscles, you will not be able to sing high.  The second set of muscles produces your head voice, it is bright and powerful. Using this exclusively, you won't possibly be able to sing low.  Mixed voice is when you use both set of muscles at the same time. Under this description though, pretty much every note you produce is mixed voice, but what we usually refer to as mixed voice is when both muscle groups are used in about equal amounts and is the ""middle"" of your range.  Your passagios (E4 and A4), refer to where you swap muscle groups. Below E4, you are nearly exclusively using chest voice, above A4, almost exclusively using head voice, and between those notes (inclusively) you need to learn to ""blend registers"" by mastering the use of both muscle groups at the same time.  What your teacher means by ""dropping the weight"", is using less of that chest voice and more head voice to balance the mix you are using to create notes higher."
singing,336gz4,enjarcher,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your explanation!  So it seems that when I sing at a lower volume, I am able to blend the registers without any audible signs of any breaks compared to singing at regular volume.   Is this perhaps I am using my muscles correctly when I'm singing normally compared to controlled volume, where I pay more attention to the bridges and how I transition through the notes? Or is this just a matter of practice and adding power?"
singing,336gz4,xarahn,2,Mon Apr 20 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"You're probably bridging from a soft chest voice to falsetto, which happens fairly naturally at low volumes. It helps internalise the general sensation of bridging, but it's not exactly the same as going up in full voice.  What you should feel when you go higher is this: if you visualise a 'ball of resonance' of sorts in your chest when singing in a comfortable range, as you go higher this ball of resonance will rise up, into your mouth and head. You don't push or reach upwards; the voice drifts.  In order to do this you'll need good compression and forward placement, such that you feel vibrations in the front of your face when singing in your mid-upper range. Your voice should be very bright, and not at all breathy, using minimal airflow to create a loud sound. If you try making a staccato 'eh' sound in a brash, obnoxious manner, you should begin to feel this sort of sensation. Remember: when done correctly, you are actually using very little air, and creating a loud, resonant, forward resonating sound.  Hope I could help :)"

singing,33531a,stillinthewest,5,Sun Apr 19 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"This actually makes a lot of sense. For Western ears, the half step (minor second) is the smallest unit of pitch we really think about (unless you're into microtonal music), so it's pretty easy for most people to just think ""move to the next discernible pitch"" and be pretty accurate. The whole step (major second) is a toughy because it's still a small interval that we think of as ""just a step away"", but it's twice as big as a half step! If I had to guess, you're probably singing slightly too small of an interval leading to being flat. Try to remember that whole steps are quite big, and you may find it easier to sing it in tune.   But yes, whole tone and chromatic scales are really good exercises, so I fully recommend continuing that. If you want to get even trickier, try octatonic scales - that's a really good way to teach yourself to differentiate between half and whole steps. Although it really is a tough scale to sing - I'm a university voice major and former composition major with a lot of experience in extended tonality, and I still stumble."

I see people recommending the Shure sm58, but it's just a popular name that leaves so much to be desired. Handling noise is annoying and it's muddy on lower frequencies.   For studio mics  in that range, Shure SM7 is a popular go to for rock singers. As others have said, you'll need a high gain preamp to get the mic to a useable level.

Does your speaking voice hurt?  Even a soprano can sing this low.  Edit: wait I see  you said ""on the staff""  so I assume that means around G 3 or 196 hz. Still,  at what pitch do you generally speak at? Is it possible  you are trying to beef up your voice or sing them loud before they've developed, well(like if you song softly do they come out).?"
singing,332rsj,QuietLotus,6,Sat Apr 18 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"Hi! First of all, it sounds like you already have a good head on your shoulders, and I think that's the first step. Here are some things I do or would like to do, as a classical voice major in university - you can tailor this to fit your own needs but I thought it would be a good start!   Vocalises every day. Every single day. Even if you don't get a chance to run rep, sit down and do ten minutes of scales. Touch the top, touch the bottom, and work around the middle a little. It's not about time, but focus - if you are really focusing on how your voice is working, you can learn a lot in a very little period of time.  Listen to singers. Met Opera is a great start, but see if you can supplement that with some live performances. If you are near a university or college, consider attending some student recitals (most are free!) or faculty recitals (those you might have to pay for, but are higher quality). Even go listen to good church or community choirs. It's really helpful to just expose yourself to all kinds of voices. Start to be critical - what you like and what you don't like. Trust your ear to tell you when something sounds wrong or unhealthy, and consult with your teacher if you have a question.  Theory. You don't really mention your theory background, but I think if you are even somewhat serious in classical voice, it's really helpful to have your basics down. Be able to read music reasonably well and kind of get a feel for the harmony behind your melody line. If you can, try to muddle through some of the piano parts.  On that note, piano. Even if you are not a proficient pianist, try to sit down and work on piano skills, too. They're just really helpful for singing. You don't have to be perfect, but ideally being able to play with your warmups/vocalises and get a feel for your piano parts can be very helpful. (And piano often helps with theory and reading too.)     As far as languages, I think Italian classes are a great idea! I'm actually about to take French this summer for exactly the same reason. Having a moderate capacity in the major singing languages is SO helpful, if just for making it easier to translate and knowing what's going on in an opera. Definitely consider German and French in addition to Italian. Duolingo and Memrise are also free online resources you can use if you're not able to take a class.     As far as actual practice tips... I'm a big fan of quality over quantity. You'll learn more by being really critical of yourself as you practice (not in the low self-esteem way, but in the stop and fix every mistake rather than singing through it way). This is a really great article with some other pointers. This is another article - it focuses on pianists, but many of the same tips apply to singing.   Finally, consider enrolling in a degree program. It's not the only way to make it as a classical singer, but it is a big way. Late 20s is not too late (I'm 25 and halfway through my undergrad, and I'm not the oldest person in my program) to pursue a degree in voice, and I can say personally that the types of classes I've taken for my degree (vocal pedagogy, diction for singers, vocal literature, etc.) have improved my performance and technique a LOT more than I think I would have achieved with lessons alone."
singing,332rsj,keakealani,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response! I do have a couple of follow-up questions for you: Do you have any resource suggestions (books, videos, etc) for learning theory or piano? I've asked several music teachers for theory guidance and the usual response is ""yuck, why?"" And while I can't play a lot of piano due to my carpal tunnel syndrome, I think a little bit would be really helpful for plunking through my pieces as the very least and understanding the chords.  As a note of background, I played the flute for about ten years through middle school all the way to college and just decided it wasn't my passion. I took a break for several years before realizing that singing is really what I want to do.  I have been considering a university program, and I'm not sure yet about where to go from here, but I appreciate your encouragement and advice on the matter! I don't know that there are any great ones near me so I'd have to consider relocation, auditions, etc.   Your advice on practice is good, based on my previous musical experiences. When I played flute, I had a really specific, structured practice regimen, but my main problem was that a lot of it was going through the motions and honestly, I didn't listen to myself, so I didn't improve that much. These days I listen to myself a lot more but I feel like I lack some kind of ritual to get me where I need to go every day with my voice, if that makes sense.  I'm also sort of having a voice type identity crisis which makes this difficult for me. I'm very goal-oriented and when I was with my first teacher (who said ""you're a light lyric soprano and it sounds like you might eventually have some coloratura""), so I bought all these books, tons of CDs and just loaded up on playlists of all the lyric and coloratura soprano music. I felt like having a direction and understanding of where I ought to be going helped me work harder. But, since seeing my new teacher, he believes I'm more of a mezzo but isn't really ready to classify me into a particular fach at this time. He said that we should just be working to achieve the best sound possible and effortless singing, and then we'll figure out where I land as we go along.   It's so silly because I SHOULD be happy that there aren't any limits on what I can do and I'm allowed to just be myself! But I almost feel like I'm having an identity crisis so maybe that is part of my problem.  Thanks again. I never really know what to expect when posting on Reddit in terms of the kind of help I will get and your answer was really high quality!"
singing,332rsj,keakealani,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Yeah, if you have previous instrumental background, that's a really good start and you probably have some idea of how to approach practicing.   You're absolutely right that ""going through the motions"" is a problem. It's very easy to do (heck, just this morning I was warming up and going through my to-do list at the same time...) but really good practice does need to be focused and you do need to listen for specific things to work on.   As for piano, I would say to really try to at least do some basics, just because it's so helpful (and, if you're ever in a university program, you actually would have to take a few semesters of piano to graduate, so it's not a bad idea to get a head start). Some things I would suggest - be able to play a simple I-V-I cadence in every key. This is super helpful for warmups and exercises, since most warmups more or less fit into either I or V chords. Also, practice a little bit of sight reading regularly (I'd say every day, but in terms of practicality, that rarely happens for most singers...) Even just playing through some simple melodies or the left hand of a song is a really good idea. Just enough to get you through your pieces without being completely lost.   As far as the identity crisis, this is REALLY normal, but I would encourage you to try not to worry about it. I made a post in another thread that talks about some of the reasons it's unhelpful to worry about voice type, but your experience is a big reason as well. It is very easy to start building a box around your voice based on your perception of your voice type or fach, when really, it's best to just build healthy technique and let your voice show itself when it's read.   Believe me, though, I understand. I'm in this spot too - over the past year or two my voice has started being a little more solid in its fach but I'm still not comfortable really settling into that, and neither is my teacher. Especially for those of us who are more analytical, it will drive you nuts to want a simple label that helps you find repertoire and model singers, but not be able to do that. But, for the sake of your technique, I'd say to just work on building your personal voice. If it decides to fit into a fach, that's great. If not, that's fine.   Anyway, I hope my walls of text are helpful and feel free to ask any questions you might have! :)"
singing,332rsj,JayceCantor,2,Wed Apr 22 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm from a pop background, so I'm unsure of how much help I can be, but for me, to have a more structured practice regimen I record the lessons that I take with my teacher, and run back through them, so that I can solidify what we work on each day. So about an hour of pure practice. Then I usually spend another hour songwriting/recording, and I like to sing alot during that time, so about two hours a day of singing give or take 30 minutes depending on what I'm working on. I would ask your professor if you need language classes, you may need pronunciation work, but I'm certain you don't need to know the language to connect to the song (although don't let that stop you from taking the classes, languages are always cool to learn), you could probably read the translation and then apply that knowledge, I mean that's how I sang Selena songs in Spanish.

I started at 16 and I was on the early side of average, from what I can tell. The voice doesn't finish maturing until your mid-20s at the earliest (and often well into the later 20s and 30s), so you're already starting early by working with a largely unformed instrument.   If you do want to feel ""ahead of the curve"", though, I would recommend working on one of three things:   Music theory - sight singing, reading music, knowing your way through harmonies, etc. Piano - at least functional keyboard skills to accompany yourself during warmups and exercises, and plunk your way through your songs Language skills - either a good handle on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or Italian, German, and/or French.

singing,330l0p,Hannathepoet,2,Sat Apr 18 09:32:35 2015 UTC,What do you need it for? What's being offered to a singer that helps you? Is it for fun? What quality/level of experience singer do you need to sing it?
singing,330fct,rolledupincoffeecake,2,Sat Apr 18 07:49:28 2015 UTC,"That's really odd. What does your teacher say about your sound? Is it possible that it's got something to do with your technique? What does it feel like when you try to sing?  Also, yoga/flexibility is totally related to singing. It's not stupid. Yoga, tai chi, and swimming are all common exercises for professional singers to take up, because they focus on breathing and a looseness of the body, which is entirely necessary for healthy singing."
singing,330fct,ghoti023,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"Is this swelling affecting your singing? If doctors don't think anything is wrong, and it's not a big deal for how you sing, I would say not to worry about it.   On the other hand, if it is affecting your singing, I would definitely keep trying with doctors. I would specifically find doctors who work with professional singers - some doctors are more familiar with the needs of singers than others, and things that aren't problems for non-singers can be problems for singers.   Beyond that, I don't know what to tell you. I agree with /u/ghoti023 to triple check your technique to be sure that there isn't something going on that's causing this swelling, but I don't know what else you can really do."

Most of the time these issues are caused by lack of knowledge and lack of consistent technique. If your speaking voice is OK then the problem is more than likely you singing technique.   In terms of consistent singing over the long term, breathing comes secondary to the vocal cords being coordinated efficiently and easily. Most problems are caused by consistently pushing the voice and engaging muscles outside of the larynx to 'help' the process.

How good is your teacher? What do you consider good enough?   All of these factors (and then some) are different for everyone. It could take you anywhere from 2 months to 2 or more years.
singing,32yek3,ghoti023,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yup. To add to this, previous musical background is a big factor. Having a sense of good practice habits, having a good ear, and knowing how to read music can also help you profess more quickly.

If you already have experience in drama or musical theater or whatever, that would give you a leg up on things like diction, projection, and delivery.  But who knows, maybe you'll be a motherfucker in just a few months. In any case, DO NOT TRY TO FORCE your progress - you can, and probably will, damage your vocal chords.

I thought that maybe if I bought his program id continue to progress alone (because i kind of prefer to learn solo since im shy with singing) but I don't want to just hit the peak and not be able to progress again in a couple of months if it'd benefit me more to get a vocal teacher.

If you lift that, you sound a lot better. Your tongue should lie flat in your mouth, most of the time.  Moving it around can really squish up your vowel sounds Underarticulation, often caused by face/articulator stiffness.  It seems and looks pretty dumb, honestly, but you need to stretch out your face.

singing,32umy0,humon2,3,Sun Apr 19 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  An actor here...so, you know how singing is about finding that uninhibited 'you' voice; an open sound, free from tension?  You can do the same thing for your speaking voice.  If you're twenty, I'm assuming you're in college.  Look into your university's theatre department and find their equivalent 'Voice for the Stage' class.  It shouldn't matter if you're not a theatre major or minor, most voice teachers would probably be more than willing to have you join.  Many aspects in such a class are going to be and feel familiar compared to what you already know about singing because it's ultimately about relaxation and tension removal.  A trained speaking voice will likely be more resonant and chesty sounding, and I think that's what you are looking for.  I do really want to stress that a voice class is about freeing your voice, not about trying to sound like any sort of 'ideal' voice.  Can't get into a class at the moment?  Pick up a book called Freeing the Natural Voice by Kristin Linklater or Right to Speak by Patsy Rodenburg (or both!).  They are wonderfully written and provide exercises you can practice on your own; however, much like singing, to get the full benefit you'll need somebody to work with and guide you.  I also personally think the ensemble that you build up in a class with others is completely necessary for the vulnerability you may feel experimenting with this type of voice work.  I want to end this by saying I think your voice is lovely."

singing,32uhxo,Willmasaur,5,Thu Apr 16 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Are you suuuure this is an aural problem and not a technical one? A lot of minor intonation issues are technique related - a slightly wonky vibrato or inaccurate vowel can make the pitch sound flat even if the original impulse of the pitch was just fine.   If it is aural, then yes, readjusting your conception of pitch is probably necessary - you need to really train your ears to hear the exact pitch and not ""fudge"" it. I can't really think of any way to fix this but practicing.   But, if there is a technical element at play, I would really encourage working through that, too. It doesn't really matter if you are able to hear the right pitch but unable to sing it in tune.   Edit: oh yeah, also keep in mind the inaccuracies of tuning software as well as the problems with equal temperament. Don't become wedded to a crutch as a replacement for actually tuning."
singing,32uhxo,keakealani,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response!  My guess that it was an aural problem was based off the fact that if I'm allowed to watch the needle with my eyes, and adjust my voice until my sound matches the exact frequency, it will sound wrong to me internally.  But technical sound-production elements could definitely be contributing to this as well, since if I hear a recording, I can usually (but not always) tell in the recording that I'm flat.  So maybe a better way to practise is with a microphone/speaker, where I can hear myself being flat instead of only seeing a needle telling me I'm flat."
singing,32uhxo,keakealani,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It could also be both, and sometimes one begets the other. If you're used to singing a bit flat, you get used to that as being in tune and then your ears get all messed up.   Yeah, I think listening as you dig can be helpful. Also, try to feel what it sounds like when you're singing in tune. We can't always trust our ears, but you should start to feel what ""correct"" sounds like."

singing,32uhxo,xiipaoc,2,Fri Apr 17 00:13:55 2015 UTC,"Train myself to always sing a bit higher than I think I should sing? That sounds crazy - and extremely unenjoyable - to me; forcing internal dissonance in order to achieve external consonance. Is there a way to train my ear, so the pitch that ""sounds"" right internally is indeed right externally?   Basically that.  You need to somehow get used to the right pitch.  You somehow trained yourself to match low, and you need to retrain yourself to match appropriately.  My recommendation would be to use a tuner, if you have to, to sing the actual right pitch when pitch matching, instead of matching it first and checking if it was right.  You can get instant feedback with the tuner.  You'll want to learn what matching correctly sounds like.  There's a very specific sound you get when you really match.  You can play a drone really loudly, for example -- but not through headphones or you won't hear yourself -- and try to match it, falling into the sound.  When you're in tune, it will click.  You need to get that click.  Eventually, you'll get used to singing the right note.  I still have trouble with fifths, for example; I find them the most difficult interval to get in tune.  I'm not the only one in my group with that problem, either!  But once you figure out your natural tendency, you can work on changing it by singing it a bit wider or a bit lower, whatever will help, until you overwrite your tendency."

I wouldnt worry about a 2.5% pitch innacuracy (191hz instead of 195 hz). It is pretty much impossible to discern pitch that finely. Do this test to see for yourself: http://www.audiocheck.net/blindtests_pitch.php?cent=2  Additionally human vocals are never a pure tone. just because your program computes an average or median or whatever (i have no fken idea how it has calculated the pitch of your voice) pitch that is slightly off, doesnt mean you will sound off pitch. Perceived sound is affected by other frequencies present in your non pure tone voice."

Unfortunately, I think my inaccuracy is actually significant (and indeed people frequently tell me I'm off-tune).  I can be off by as much as 50 cents (half a semitone), which according to that website is more than what most people can discern (25 cents).  But I seem to be able to discern pitch just fine up to the 5-10 cent range, so it's probably not purely an aural problem on my part."

But, I have a question about this... Did you use autotune on some parts? Because especially near the end the changes between the notes sound artificial. It could just be your voice but it sounds a little odd."
singing,32v7l0,Cptsaber44,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:03:58 2015 UTC,No I didn't use auto tune. I was trying to be quiet tho so as to not wake up my parents/brother. Another reason for the artificiality (idk if that's the right word) is that I was trying something new (my voice generally isn't that high pitched). Thanks for the reply!! But yeah the change between high and low pitches is something I'm trying to make more subtle.

singing,32v7l0,poopdick666,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:45:58 2015 UTC,good until 7 seconds where pitch goes off. then you seem to change keys at 10 seconds. then you seem to be fine again pitchwise from 10 seconds until the end. Your rhythm is off as well. try tapping your foot in time when you sing. rhythm is something you need to work on ive noticed from this recording and your other recording. good luck :)

If you have a weakness in any of the points that you listed, then you should work on them every day. Sight read something new each day from the internet. Play and sing back pitches. Practice your song til you know it like the back of your hand.  Can you find someone to help you sing in the best possible key, maybe someone who plays piano in your school?  Just prepare yourself, get some rest, do a 15 minute warmup before you leave home (or in a practice room), and then perform as if you were singing to a full audience.  and Good Luck!"

Drink warm lemon water, but not just the day of your audition - try to keep a healthy voice the days before too. Sleep a lot, no alcohol or smoke. Warm up your voice everyday and practice the song you chose. That said, don't practice too much, but practice the right things: what do you need to improve? Don't overuse your voice and most of all, if it hurts, stop everything and see a vocal coach/teacher to make sure you're doing the right things. You can practice meditation too, to improve your breathing and visualize something positive such as rocking your audition! :-) Good luck!!!"

In fact, even if you think you're a good reader, it can't hurt to practice. In my experience, select choirs often choose for reading first and voice second. Quite frankly, even if you have the best voice in the universe, you're not very useful to a high-level choir if you can't read. These types of choirs need to hold your own and be a leader, which means you can't be fishing around for notes."

If you don't practice it by itself, you're treating it more like an accessory to the guitar.  :/  When recording, many softwares provide a tempo tap start.  You can tap your foot to keep time, or use a metronome that has a light with the sound off.  Or if you record the guitar first, you can use monitors to listen to that and sing along with it.  Good luck!"

singing,32qc9x,throwaway185733,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:35:41 2015 UTC,"figure out how much latency you have, cause that might be part of it. You need to use ASIO drivers for your interface instead of what's built in to your OS and you sort of need a fast computer, i have a quad core 2.4Ghz quad core and 8gb of ram and it hasn't been cutting it. Depending on what DAW you use setting up latency compensation sometimes fixes it. Also you can go into your interface driver and change the memory buffer size, a buffer that holds fewer samples has less latency but is more likely to have skips or glitches in the track which is really annoying but that is one way to speed things up.   Also, start practicing with a metronome tons, I suck at playing with a metronome and it definitely is an issue with recording  As far as pitch make sure you have a good mix in your headphones so you can clearly hear yourself singing and can clearly hear the previous tracks you're singing over. Also some people like to leave one headphone off so they can hear themselves the way they're used to hearing themselves."

If you have pitch issues after training, then you need to train more. Given time, effort, and guidance, it's tough to be a bad singer in that sense short of having some kind of disability.

Good singing isn't great singing, isn't professional singing.

singing,32quq8,musicandteaandstuff,6,Thu Apr 16 13:04:55 2015 UTC,"I agree that good singers typically have musical talent and a great sense of pitch.  However, I don't think they just 'have talent' the way you are saying. They weren't born with an amazing voice.  My experience is that good singers were usually brought up singing, with or without professional training. It is much easier to learn how to sing well as a child than as an adult (much like many other things).   Comparing it that way, it is perhaps more accurate to say that bad singers have as hard of a time singing as an adult would have trying to learn Spanish on their own. In both cases, having a teacher helps, but doesn't guarantee you will get good at it.   I don't personally know an adult who became a good singer after completely sucking, but I don't doubt it's possible. The same way there are adults who become fluent in a new language.

singing,32quq8,AudiblePlasma,6,Thu Apr 16 00:36:13 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough - most people are apparently born with perfect pitch.  A large number of Chinese people have perfect pitch because it is a tonal language.  It seems that the process of learning english convinces your brain that perfect pitch isn't all that valuable a life skill and thus it is lost in most people.   Jenny Saffran and Gregory Griepentrog at the University of Wisconsin compared eight-month-old infants to adults with and without musical training in a learning test of tone sequences. The infants, they found, relied much more heavily on absolute pitch cues; the adults, on relative pitch cues. This suggested to them that absolute pitch may be universal and highly adaptive in infancy but becomes maladaptive later and is therefore lost. “Infants limited to grouping melodies by perfect pitches,” they pointed out, “would never discover that the songs they hear are the same when sung in different keys or that words spoken at different fundamental frequencies are the same.” In particular, they argued, the development of language necessitates the inhibition of absolute pitch, and only unusual conditions enable it to be retained. (The acquisition of a tonal language may be one of the “unusual conditions” that lead to the retention and perhaps heightening of absolute pitch.)

singing,32quq8,Mattpilf,11,Thu Apr 16 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"You seem to think that being a good singer relies solely on if you hit the right pitches 100% of the time. Don't get me wrong, singers should have a sense of pitch, but I believe emotion comes before hitting the right pitches. IMO good singers are those that truly express their emotions through their voice. I would rather hear a slightly off pitch performance of a singer who sings with a vast amount of emotion and confidence then one who is classically trained and only thinks technically about singing. I honestly believe pitch isn't the only factor you should judge whether a singer is ""good"" or not."

This held true for voice and instruments.  Obviously this was a generalization and limited experience,  but I'm not alone In noticing this trend.    Of course they still care about pitch,  but there's only so much a mediocre  singer can achieve, so there is some compromise. Pitch is important,  and in general easier to train too. You can't a robotic musician how to have emotion and originality,  you can teach a singer(unless they are full on tone deaf)  to sing in tune."
singing,32quq8,drachs1978,-8,Thu Apr 16 03:33:17 2015 UTC,shitty pitch can work for some styles namely rock/punk and bob dylan. It is very rare though and the vast majority of singers are inherently musically talented and have a great sense of pitch. I could care less about classical technique. Some really interesting vocals are a result of 'incorrect' technique. But if you listen to any professional singer they are most in tune. heck every rappers rap in tune.

Yes many times they stuff up live which can be due to many reasons for example trying to dance simultaneously, nerves, bad acoustics/echos throwing them off, tiredness. stuffing up or singing off pitch isnt really an indicator of a lack of musical talent in itself. a talented person will realise when they stuffed up whereas an untalented singer will be oblivious.   Auto tune is usually done for effect rather than because the singer cannot sing in tune. justin beiber is hated and criticized for being a talentless bubblegum pop singer.

singing,32ov77,keakealani,2,Wed Apr 15 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"I can only provide one anecdote that isn't an exact analogy, but my husband is also a pianist (holds two degrees in piano performance). He had sung casually in the past and is getting more involved with singing. He started taking formal lessons recently (a few months ago) and I can already hear a difference. It's not perfect, but it's helping.   Of course, this depends on your goals and how much you practice. In this case, my husband is working as a professional pianist and spends more time practicing for those gigs than for his voice lessons. He still practices almost every day, though. And he is also working on a longer-term goal of gaining vocal competency for professional church music/choral music, and that's the direction his lessons are going. And he's working with a friend with a recent master's and less experience than an older teacher with more experience/credentials.   But in short, I think as a pianist you do have an advantage. If you're willing to put in the practice time, voice lessons could be really helpful for you."

However, for most people you won't really see results you are confident with for months. So it depends on how long you have til your anniversary. If you know someone with singing experience than you can ask them to coach you for the song, that way you can get out minor tweeks and make it more smooth."
singing,32ov77,Mattpilf,2,Wed Apr 15 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"Singing for your partner is generally going to turn out fine,  unless you are excessively  pitch or are shouting out your high notes. At least that's enough to please my boyfriend(although he still claims my voice  is best listened to at an appropriate  distance away, even without  shouting).  I do think a lesson or a few could make a reasonable difference if you've never been a singer.  It's possible you have very poor support,  or are placing your voice too low and chesty inhibiting some high notes,  or other issues like too much tension.  You won't become fantastic,  but it is possible you could make some strides in a few lessons If you've never been taught and almost never sing.   Best of luck to you two.  Hope  she loves it!"

No. Anyone can be good at singing if they sing with confidence. Sing when you're alone and record yourself.  Key thing: practice, practice Practice, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.   The 'bad' recordings will probably make you not want to hear the whole thing but power through all the embarrassing mistakes you hear and learn from them. Besides it's just you hearing it.

Do a quick warm up, then get to a piano or load up a keyboard on the internet. The real piano is definitely preferred. Then record yourself playing the piano and singing ""ah"" while attempting to hit the pitch. Then listen to it. If it's too low, you go up. If it's too high you go down. It will be slower than doing it with a voice coach, but it's better than nothing."

Generally speaking, you want to sing one of the notes in that chord on the pulse. That makes almost no sense so here's an example.  If I play a G chord on 1, which contains the notes G, B and D, I should sing G, B, or D, otherwise you get a clash.  If my next pulse is 2 and I play a D chord, then I should sing notes in that chord, D, F or A.  In between these pulses, you can (almost) sing whatever. It's best to step up and down and avoid big leaps.  So I you were to play (in quarters)  G   D  On 1 and 2, you could sing (in sixteenths)  G-a-b-c D-c-d-e  And it sounds kinda alright. And by alright I mean musically sound.  Anyway, I have no clue if this is helpful or if you already know this, but you should definitely check out www.hooktheory.com/hookpad, has helped a bunch with my songwriting."

singing,32k38r,Mattpilf,3,Tue Apr 14 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  this is generally the gist,  but I'm a little more laxed  and like some more dissonant  sounds.   If you start  a note same time as chord,  it should probably be a note implied by the chord or the next one off for a slight dissonance. For instance,  sometimes a not Chord  will omit the fifth,  or maybe you have a seventh chord, playing the fifth or the ninth or any note in chord  might work in any octave. Those are the ones you start with.  . Generally you might have these be own beats one and three if it's a 4/4. Generally I try not to have every not be in unison with a guitar,  as that will get tired very quickly.   In between you want to just fill the notes that are in your head,  keeping in mind the strong beats to keep a rhythm. and often play the notes implied by the chord changes, but a few chromatic,  especially in a solo or melodues can sound really good. It's hard to think of melods that last 20 chord changes,  but breaking it to phrases for  Which notes are implied by the chord changes?  In simple songs,  it's probably just the notes in the other chord,  in complex songs,  like many jazz standards,  you best bet is to break up the song into little chunks.  Lots of songs have changes which are mostly chunks of ii V I progressions(or other common changes) .  If you can think of a scale to play for 3 or four measures and break this up through the song,  you can navigate the majority of songs making solos and nice melodies. That's how a lot of us keep melodic phrases over many chord changes.  The rest you need to just use your ears. Manipulating melodies of songs over similar chord  changes can be a good place to start.   In the end everything comes down to does it sound good, theories only give you ideas and starting points,  and can even help  you pick certain notes like for a Japanese feel,  an Arabic feel,  or a dark dissonant feel,  but that requires  more theory"

singing,32k38r,terrycotta,4,Thu Apr 16 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"There's so many different ways to come up with an original melody. Sometimes  a writer gets snatches of it in dreams or inspiration from life. Sometimes you hear a piece of music and just starting singing along. One thing you could do is just start scatting while you're playing your chords (maybe while recording) and see if anything interesting comes about, if any themes begin to form. There's no one way to do it, but it can be learned. You just have to get used to opening up your mind to suggestion.  The hard part is after getting a few good ideas; you have to actually have some craft to sculpt it into a presentable form. That, also, is something you can learn with practice."

I can't be sure.   I've written a lot of songs for DJs and producers who've sent me tracks over the years. Sometimes I'll just let the song play while I'm working around the house and once I start singing along; I'll capture it on tape and then start listening for a hook and definite melodic phrases to build upon."
singing,32k38r,TheChurchofHelix,3,Tue Apr 14 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"I just sit down and play chords and hum a melody over it until something comes together. Then I'll make a lead sheet, do a couple pages of freewriting on the associations I have with the song, and make a sketch of the lyrics structure (accented syllables per line and rhyme scheme) and the first few verses are pretty bad and hard to think of but after that it will stay in the back of my mind and verses will just pop into my head over the course of the next few days. As far as background that's helpful for this, I have a solid theory background, have read up on lyric structure a bit, I can sight sing, and I can transcribe melodies I hear, and I have a background in jazz and blues on guitar and piano. The main thing is that songwriting really benefits from regular practice, just like on an instrument or with your voice. If you sit down and work on songwriting for 30 minutes per day at first you will feel like you can't think of anything but eventually you will start to accumulate musical and lyrical ideas and you'll have something nice in about two weeks.   The shorter version: Just figure out the concept of a key. You take the notes that are in a key and use them to build chords, and then your melody draws from the notes in that key to harmonize with your chords. Lets think of G major for a second, because that's what your chord progression is in. This contains the notes G A B C D E F# (G). The most popular chords are built on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th notes in that scale by stacking thirds, which means going through that G major scale in skips. So lets pick the super popular progression I vi IV V. Your I chord contains G (skip A) B (skip C) and D. Your vi chord contains E, G and B. Your IV chord contains C, E, and G. Your V chord contains D, F#, A. So play your chord progression for four beats each. And start singing through the G major scale so that you sing one of the notes that is in the current chord whenever you are on the first beat or third beat of the measure. Start with just singing quarter notes, so one note per strum. Your second and fourth beats don't need to harmonize and are used to smooth the connection between the notes on the first and third beats.   This is a massive oversimplification but hopefully it helps. Just find some easy 200 page theory book you can crank through in a day or two, it's not even nearly going to tell you the whole picture but it's totally adequate for pop purposes. Then check out ""writing better lyrics"" by Pat Pattison, and whatever else looks good. ""Songwriting"" by Stephen Citron is a decent quick overview. Also building your comfort on an instrument and doing tons of improvisation will help. Good luck!"

It sounds like you and /u/LmaoSomeNerd are saying very similar things, so let me see if my understanding is correct given both your awesome feedback:  I'll build off and example using the merlin dulcimer, since this is what I'm trying to make melodies to, in ""standard"" tuning of DAdd or DAD.  My chord progression will be the original posted one of G, Em, G(3rd fret), D  So if I strum a G in that tuning, I'm playing 3 notes since there are 3 (4, but two are the exact same) strings being held down or open at D,B, and G all at once to give a G chord correct?  So sticking with your progression of I vi IV V (not really sure what this means outside of context clues fyi) my most logical choice (I love making logical inferences of/about creative subjects!) for the first vocal note out of D,B, and G is either D or G because we skip B correct? Or should I have skipped A like you were saying above?  I kind of assumed the list of G based tones was based on a full guitar chord?   Then, my second beat need not harmonize, I could continue singing my choice from the first beat or go wherever the lyric takes me.  My third beat however (a higher G) would have the same basic options as the first, but possibly at a higher pitch?  Then my forth beat, again, need not harmonize.    Great, so how far off was I from what you intended :)"

One of the best things I ever did songwriting/vocalwriting wise was to ""jam"" with myself. I can come up with pretty good ideas while playing around on an instrument and singing but I find that multitasking doesn't give me the freedom to explore vocals.  If I'm working on a song I'll get a basic chord structure and record it onto my phone or key it into some music software. Then I'll just keep listening to it and experimenting with a bunch of singing ideas.  I find I come up with better vocals and phrasing when I can approach it JUST as a singer. Physically playing an instrument while writing can sorta limit what you think you can do cos you're also concentrating on something else. You ideas will be more confined to the rhythm etc."
singing,32k38r,hehehh,2,Wed Apr 15 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"One tiny, tiny suggestion: Instead of playing a G chord third, why not a C?  Right now what you have is an I - vi - I - V in the key of G major. This is very, very similar to one of the most pleasing and consonant chord progressions around: I - vi - IV - V. Give it a try; see if you like it."
singing,32k38r,greenvortex,2,Wed Apr 15 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"As a guitarist, you can approach Both creating melody and riffing/runs off of your melody by using any number of the basic pentatonic scales. For example in your chord progression, the G Major Pentatonic scale is(from low E to high e): 3-5 2-5 2-5 2-4 3-5 3-5 if I can remember it correctly. Pluck around with these notes until you hear something you like, base your song on that simple melody and then deviate every so often. That method is very applicable to riffs as well. When riffing just descend or ascend through whatever scale fits the mood. Hope this helps!"

Frankly, it's less about the programs themselves and more about the philosophy behind it - the belief that a cookie-cutter method without any external feedback, relying completely on an untrained singer teaching themselves, is going to do more than cause bad habits is just not rooted in any sort of fact. These methods are, generally speaking, really unscientific (some going so far as to say anatomically incorrect or confusing instructions) and really not based in any modern vocal pedagogy research.   Obviously, there are probably some people who have ""improved"" from these types of methods, although in general those are based on self-reporting and only indicate that someone thinks they improved, but may or may not necessarily have the corresponding vocal technique (people have a tendency to overestimate their own technical capabilities in any field).

Well, in the exercises, all of that takes place well below the big passaggio around F4.  Then, other sources refer to that passaggio as the point between registers.  Still, other sources refer to what I think of as reinforced falsetto as head voice.  I think that's what Anthony Frisell uses the word to mean.

I think a big problem with the way many men (especially younger men) approach head voice is that they think it's too ""falsetto-y"" even if it's not. There's so much cultural conditioning about that chesty, brash sound being more masculine and macho, that even for singers that don't think they're using too much chest voice, are often using too much chest voice. And from the outside world, a lot of what guys complain as ""too light"" or ""too falsetto-y"" sounds like a nice, well-adjusted mix to me.   Which brings me to another point. I personally subscribe to the ""unified modal voice"" type of philosophy, where everything is just some sort of mixed adjustment between head and chest resonance (cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid dominance respectively). In short, 90% of what most people would call ""head voice"" is going to be some sort of mix, the question is just how you tip the balance.   This is to say, the other problem a lot of people run into is the opposite problem - that of having too much head voice with no connection to the chest resonance at all. Unless you're pretty high in your range, this is unnecessary and leads to an unpleasant ""break"" in the sound. (Note that this is not the same as an actual passaggio - it's not the result of a normal shift in registration, but just not navigating the range correctly).   Anyways, all of this is obviously way easier said than done, but in my experience those seem to be the most common issues plaguing a lot of guys when dealing with the head voice."
singing,32it2t,elerico,3,Tue Apr 14 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to expand on what you said about the macho, brash voice that so many younger guys like to use. I also really believe in the unified modal voice. I notice that when guys attempt to go full chest, ESPECIALLY with an unreasonably-lowered larynx, we go flat. It's a weird kind of flat, though, because we're cutting out the top half of the color of our voice.   I've seen you mention over-darkening, even to me, and I feel like it's a pretty common thing, especially in choral singing.   I kinda branched away from head voice itself, but I definitely agree with your points!"
singing,32it2t,Masklin,2,Tue Apr 14 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Over-darkening is a common problem in choral music (and singing in general), for sure. And it can very much compete with registration, especially in men. A lot of registration for the male voice is more about acoustics - creating the right space for the vowel and pitch. Over-darkening really interferes with this process occurring naturally, and it can definitely cause those wonky breaks and issues in the upper range.   The fact of the matter is, higher pitches are going to be a little brighter than lower pitches, for the most part. There's no sense trying to fight against it - you can't change how overtones work."
singing,32it2t,Masklin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"I totally subscribe to the unified modal voice. I like to think of voice as a continuum, with chest and head on a line with no breaks or stops. Almost everything is some kind of mix. That's a more useful way to approach IMO, and it's more in line with what's actually happening with the anatomy involved. It's not like there are only 3 positions the thyroid cartilage can be in."
singing,32it2t,Masklin,6,Tue Apr 14 06:40:42 2015 UTC,"The ""Ba"" vowel/sound is good for finding the head voice/pharyngeal voice, as the B keeps the voice from flipping to 'true falsetto' and the 'A' helps train the pharyngeal part. That's the basic function, then expanding on that is training the head voice with emphasis on onsets. Emphasizing the onset of the word in head voice will allow the vocal cords to momentarily adduct while still maintaining the stretched position / cricothyroid tension, which will lead to the ability to start blending your muscles. That's it in a nut shell."

Keep in mind, it won't sound like head voice for a long time, because you still have to learn how to blend your lower voice into the upper, but it should sound better than true falsetto."

singing,32j1g6,Vocalist,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"I think there's tool tips but sure. This is for RaidCall(don't know anyhting about mumble)  So basically you sign up, create your group(only 1 person needs to do this). Then you basically own the group. It's there forever, you can create other ones if you want but pretty much just stick to 1 dedicated one. You can give other people admin powers in the room as well if you like. You cannot pass ownership to anyone else, and admin cannot give other people full adminship(just certain channel adminship).  Then there are channels you can make. whether AFK, karaoke, or random chat. You can also password protect the rooms/membership only and etc.  http://puu.sh/hfeiP.png  Where the notepad is your group ID. Everyone that enters will go to the lounge(you as admin or creator can drag people to other rooms) and you can set other room as the entry room instead if you want(so people can directly go to the karaoke room once they enter).   Anyways, that's basically Queued mode. As you can see there's a timer, if you want an admin you can extend the timer if you wish, anyways, once the timer is gone, the person is kicked out(they can leave beforehand) and the person after, their timer starts. Basically you press the ""Raise Hand"" button and then you join the queue. Oh P.S. bonus, you can also send e-flowers to eachother!(worthless but yeah as you can see)  To set the mode to queue mode there's a little drop down list above the timer. That's about it. If you need help with anything else let me know, but it should be fairly easy. No one can talk during queued mode except the person that has the time. There's also a music mode below(it plays to everyone everything your computer is playing, so you can have instrumental, but honestlky usually there's a ping delay, so it's best just to record your speakers/do acoustic or acapella. To talk in normal rooms you can set it to push to talk or freemode(less feedback ftw)"

Long story short, whenever you're abusing your vocal cords via screaming, shouting, wailing, or whatever, you need to pay attention to your body.   What it sounds like to me is that Danzig is singing high in his range after singing himself hoarse, getting a halfway raspy, pinched sound. That particular slip where he dropped a word sounds like he just ran out of air. It happens! Screaming uses a lot of air and is very much an endurance activity."

singing,32ifaz,ASSFAIRY,2,Tue Apr 14 01:19:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your tongue and jaw are tense. This may be happening because you are not supporting enough, and since the body likes to maintain a sort of equilibrium, the throat, tongue, and jaw try to pick up the slack in ""supporting the sound"" by tensing up, which in reality makes it worse. The solution to this is two-fold:   Release the extraneous tension in your throat, tongue, and jaw. Imagine the feeling of the beginning of a yawn or sigh as your sing to keep everything open and free. As for the tongue, if it feels like it is falling back, try putting an unvoiced ""th"" sound (like in the word ""thin"") in front of a vowel. Feel the forward position that the tongue has to take in order to form that consonant, and then try to keep the tongue in that position or at least near that position as you sing the vowel. Physically energize your sound. Focus your energy for singing into your core instead of your throat, not in a way that makes you forcefully tighten your abs, but in a way that allows flexibility for changing dynamics and pitches. One thing that can help with that is to bend your knees, it unconsciously focuses your physical energy lower in your body, which is exactly where it should be. If you are able to do this with sufficient energy, your throat should not feel the need to get involved, and then from there if you are able to reinforce the idea of keeping your throat free of extraneous tension, that should hopefully open up your sound.  Best of luck!"
singing,32ifaz,hookandpush,2,Tue Apr 14 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"I have TMJ as well, and just saying 'release tension' is far easier said than done, but this information is the right direction.  I also have difficulty opening my jaw much without the muscles in the 'bad' side of my jaw freaking out and objecting.  Don't let jaw problems keep you from proper breath support.  My last vocal teacher recommended using my hand to weigh down the jaw and aid in getting my muscles to ""remember"" how to relax for a few of your starting exercises (NOT FIX IN PLACE - if your jaw is not allowed to move, it makes it even harder to create differentiated sounds and you might try to 'fight' the weight of your hand, causing MORE tension).  I like to do this with a basic La-Ga on a scale or just while morphing my vowels on a single note like Ay-Ee-Ah-Oh-Oo.  This way I can put most of my focus on relaxing everything.  If I'm super tense, sometimes doing silly lip trills until I giggle helps.  I hope you can get help for your TMJ eventually.  Don't let it stress you out too much!!

singing,32ifaz,singingsox,2,Wed May 27 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"The root of your tongue is tense, which is probably combined with jaw tension. Stick your tongue all the way out and feel the space above it. Now, say ""ya ya ya ya ya"" in a descending 5 pattern. Do this in the mirror. Try to get your tongue to just move and not your jaw. It's going to be difficult at first and it's not supposed to sound nice, but it's going to do wonders with getting your vowels out onto the blade of the tongue and not stuck in the back.  Exercises with k's and g's are also good for this."
singing,32fr2o,Gravitom,29,Mon Apr 13 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the other subs, but I can give a few reasons for this one.   Producers that come to this sub usually don't offer a lot of compensation for the work they want done. It's pretty common that singers get asked to do things ""for the exposure"" or for ""payment if the recording makes any money."" I'm not saying that those kinds of offers are inherently bad, but they aren't necessarily all that enticing to experienced singers who are getting work already. A vast majority of the people on this sub are beginners who aren't ready to put themselves out there like that just yet. There's quite literally a handful of experienced singers that come to this sub on a daily or even weekly basis, and most of them are classical singers, that do have jobs doing live performance. I can think of maybe 2-5 singers on this sub frequently that are experienced and non-classical, and I guarantee they're all busy, or just don't like the offers that get posted.  Since a lot of us do work live, and most of us are beginners, there's a strong chance that we don't have the quality recording equipment necessary to give you the recording you want to produce via the internet, and we aren't particularly keen on purchasing expensive equipment that we may only use once if the gig you're offering doesn't lead to more.   I'm pretty sure that boils down this sub's reasoning for low responses to the producer posts. It's not that there's anything wrong with them, we just have different goals."

When you're recording vocals, your take can be ruined by a particularly reverby room, traffic noise, emergency vehicles, roommates with headaches, toddlers in the apartment upstairs, dogs and babies anywhere in a 1-block radius, neighbours closing doors, a fridge or heater or HVAC turning on... The equipment involved in recording box may seem trivial compared to producing and mixing, but getting a suite/apartment/house/roommates/acoustic treatment that'll let you record good vocals at home is also expensive. More of the cost comes in the form of inflated rent or increased commute time and transportation costs to quiet suburbs and exurbs."

Then, I met a singer at a Skrillex show in Brooklyn because she wanted to take a picture with my mau5head. I told her I produced EDM and she said she was a singer on Broadway. We exchanged information and started seriously intending to collaborate 2 months later. I had a finished track and she had a song written. We worked on it and 4 hours later, this song was born. Two months after that, we formed a duo called Trillium and self-released an EP. Since then we've played Webster Hall and Melrose Ballroom here in NYC. We're finishing up our second EP.   All I have to say is just put yourself out there, go to shows and venues and meet people. I had it in my head that it was 201x and that the internet was such a great place to meet other musicians to collaborate with. It might be true to an extent but I've found that good old fashioned personal contacts are the most effective at getting you anywhere. I think this advice extends to just about any aspect of the music business in general."

singing,32fr2o,TranscodedMusic,2,Tue Apr 14 03:10:37 2015 UTC,I think this is the exact right approach. These collaborations typically are easy to come by when you make yourself a part of a local in person community.  I coincidentally just got back from meeting with a vocalist I'm going to make some tracks with. I was introduced to her through a friend who is a DJ. He knew my material and he knew hers so he told each of us that we had to work together. I trust him and sure enough she has a great voice.   Also from a practical standpoint I think vocals are always going to sound best if you understand the personality of the vocalist and can tailor your track a bit to make their strengths shine through. Figuring this stuff out is a lot easier in person than it is online.

Extraordinarily unhelpful.  ""What should the melody be like? Where do you imagine it entering and leaving?"" ""Your call!"" ""What style should it be like?""

I sent them links to the songs, and said ""please don't come to rehearsal unless you can actually sing this stuff"". They all said they could...they couldn't. Singers are also the last to show up, and the first to leave. They have no concept of learning material at home or setting up and tearing down the gear. I hate singers.

There's a lot of cultural influence that supports the concept of ""if you're attractive and can sing in tune, you can be a singer!""  You're not looking for singers, you're looking for musicians.

That being said, there is a really big problem with music education here right now, and a big side effect is that basically the only people with any actual musical training (not necessarily having a nice voice, but actually being able to read music, sing complex melodies and rhythms, etc.) are classical and are current or former students at UH. Which also means they tend to be crazy busy, particularly since the rounds of places that hire UH singers are pretty intense and you'd have to compete in terms of pay (average rate for church gigs is $20-30/hr, for example).   But yeah, I don't blame you. Most of the singers I've met outside of university-trained ones, are utter crap here. It's a really pervasive problem with a lot of variables."
singing,32fr2o,keakealani,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking for someone who can read sheet music, knows theory, etc...they should just be able to sing the songs on the list! They always say they can, but never can! I found a guy whose fairly good, but his wife (who also was fairly good) just dropped out because she's 'too busy'. No wonder all the real good musicians leave here for the big mainland cities! I don't feel like moving, so I'm sticking with it.  So...are you available for an audition? I'm on Oahu."
singing,32fr2o,HitlerWasASexyMofo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:48:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, well, even without expecting music reading, you get a lot better musicianship from someone familiar with those things, like a better sense of pitch and rhythm. And unfortunately, I pretty much only do classical music so probably not what you're looking for. If you're interested in working with UH singers you might want to talk to Kathy at the music office. I'm not sure what their policy is for advertising but you may be able to circulate an email or post a flier."

singing,32fr2o,Zero7Home,2,Tue Apr 14 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"I work in many facets of music, from production to guitar, songwriting, and stuff like that.   There are certain ways I'd be interested in collaborating with people, but I would never just respond to a thread or general request for collaboration, and I would never post one, because I know 99% of the people out there are not people I would be interested in collaborating with.   What would make me interested is the specific person, and their strengths and weaknesses.   If somebody wants me to play guitar on their track or whatever, forget it, unless you pay me. Even if you want to pay me, I might not do it if I don't want my name associated with the product."
singing,32fr2o,wyldwyvern,2,Tue Apr 14 05:16:37 2015 UTC,"Many thanks for bringing this up. On a related note:  I fully understand why a singer wouldn't like to collaborate with my projects: May be they don't like the song, may be my tracks are not good enough, or else. I have been both luck and unlucky with my requests in this sub and others (and the few times I was lucky it turned great!).  I'm a so called beedroom producer. This is my hobby, but I realize there is another reason that singers wouldn't collaborate with me: Recording a singing performance takes the most scarce resource: Time!  So several times I have PMed several singers in this and other forums asking for (offering) paid collaborations. I have had zero success with this strategy.   I'm a so called bedroom producer, and this is my hobby. I have several projects which I want to complete and I'd gladly pay for a singer's time, effort and talent!.   I guess I don't know which is the right way/forum/sub to ""hire"" a singer. So it begs the question: How does a hobbist/bedroom producer hire a singing talent?"

Also, nursing homes, hospitals, and similar are often very supportive (and captive) audiences.   If you want to sing but don't want to do a solo gig, maybe joining a choir is also an option.

""My-Way"" is a example where your slides sound like they could be a tiny bit better but honestly take this with a grain of salt I have a good ear but I don't know the words/have the training to describe anything concretely. I liked it haha I know that simple of advice isn't entirely helpful though."
singing,32flhf,aydiosmio_eseldiablo,2,Mon Apr 13 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"No problem! I want to emphasize - despite singing in a soft style you still did not sound like you were ""struggling for breath."" When you  get a note out most of the time it has a nice clearness. I'm just suggesting stronger breath support work because I noticed you sometimes sounded shaky when you moved from the bottom to the top of your register quickly. With a strong base of support you'd find yourself traversing your range more easily. Good luck man!"

singing,32flhf,Vocalist,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:32:42 2015 UTC,"Some notes you need to hold longer. Either your vibrato or breathing is shaky, either way the vibrato is very unnatural, needs work and should only be used during certain parts/needs to be more subtle."

I'd bet a million bucks the problem with the vibrato is on the breathing like you said, and that probably comes from my rushed pacing.

I can only listen and critique.  work on singing scales up and down with a piano/keyboard and try matching pitch. Initially you probably will need someone with a good ear sitting next to you to tell you when u are on/off pitch since you are not able to do this yourself. Do this until you develop the ability to self diagnose pitch errors.  another thing i just noticed you are going out of rhythym at times.

singing,32fqzu,brumkid100,2,Mon Apr 13 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"Building on what /u/ghoti023 mentioned, I think it's inappropriate for you to be providing musical critique as a non-singer. I also come from a fairly non-musical family, and it's extremely frustrating to have people act like they know more about something I've worked on for a substantial period of time, even if it's ""coming from a good place"". You simply don't know enough about singing to be able to offer meaningful critique. Even if you don't like something as an audience member, you can't offer ways to fix the issue or specific technical advice, so it's not really helpful.   That being said, the fact that you don't mention your sister studying with a teacher raises a big question for me. If she isn't, in fact, studying with a private voice teacher, I think that's absolutely the best thing she could do to further her passion in singing. I would go so far as to say that without formal training, it's pretty much impossible to make it very far in the professional musical theatre world, and it would certainly be very helpful. So if you want to help, consider researching good voice teachers in your area (maybe even attending a demo lesson to get a really good feel), and perhaps offering to offset some of the cost of the first few lessons.   If she is studying with a teacher or has a good amount of previous formal training, another direction would be to work with a vocal coach focusing on musical theatre. This is especially helpful if your sister is preparing for specific roles/auditions, as a coach can help to polish her performance and give her some tips to improve those little stylistic things that make a performance really successful.   Beyond that, as /u/ghoti023 says, a manager or agent is incredibly useful for getting auditions and promotion, but I think it's important to build on the initial skills of performance before going in the business direction."
singing,32fqzu,keakealani,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:34:18 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that success means different things to different people. If your sister loves to perform and can make a good living at in then she will probably be over the moon.   If she's auditioning for West End productions, getting in front of major casting directors, doing a great job, getting callbacks, and booking some shows; then the next step may be to find her a reputable agent and/or manager.  I did theater in NYC and on tour in Europe for many years and it takes up your whole life, but it's also very fulfilling and a lot of fun. You can help the most by being supportive and sometimes just being a shoulder to lean on. A website may be great if she's looking to release her own material; but a good promo package (pics, resume, performance reel, videos online) will be more important when auditioning for shows. She'll need to stay in voice, acting, and dance classes to keep on top of her skills and also do some networking. Showcases and small touring shows may also be a great way to get more experience and exposure (while making contacts for future work offers).  There's really a lot that goes into it, but I hope this helps a little."
singing,32fqzu,terrycotta,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"What is her background/experience level? Does she want to ""make it?"" Does she have any college experience? Do you live in a large city? What is she currently doing to help push herself forward?  Even with a manager or an agent (which is basically what you're looking to be based off of your description), going into music professionally still takes a lot of self promotion, and then the agent/manager can build off of that while having a working relationship with the ""talent.""  You said that your criticism can make family affairs hard. It's important for the singer to WANT help from their agent. Is she okay with you stepping in? It's unclear from your post if the tension is from her/other family members/both. As a musician, you run your own business of marketing and promoting yourself. Everyone else is a member of the team the singer heads."

We are currently looking at getting her a website set up( with her videos and pictures/info ect) so people can view this from anywhere she promotes, and also she has all the current social media and music pages set up.   She has been in front of quite a few people (i.e. - west end people) for example contests ect where they review how you sing and give advice, and most of the time they do not really offer advice and just say how amazing it was? which is great but also sort of causes a issue, because i want to see her moving forward.  Anyway, the family affairs is mainly aimed towards me, as I do not do the usual ""you were fantastic etc etc.. After a performance"" I prefer to say well done, but I think you could have done this or this and this was a bit off, and people/my Family don't feel that is the way react?."

singing,32fqzu,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think she likes criticism off the right people as she can then work on it, however, from her brother that has no experience in anything musical what so ever usually she laughs it off or asks things later on when she is rehearsing. for example, how does this sound.  & currently moving forward she is just looking for local gigs as there is limited time and availability to get into a London school so until that opportunity presents itself its hard to move anywhere without a substantial amount of money. I think currently she is working to save money to get down London as much as possible for auditions."

singing,32dc2i,Iwanttosingffs,4,Sun Apr 12 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Think of singing like  the recorder.  No amount of pressure  is going to solve poor airflow,  and airflow and direction is most of singing.   While playing the recorder should've helped you developed decent support and steady air stream,  I can't say for sure. Unfortunately,  like the recorder,  there's not really any blanket advice one can give.  Tongue position can be too far back or forward,  too high or low,  soft palate can be too low or too high,larynx can be too high or low,   placement can be in back of mouth like kermit, or too forward and nasally. You can be pushing up your chest too much,  having a disconnected  head voice. You can be tense like and throaty and croaky,  or too relaxed and breathy. You can be even use too much support! That's why at the very least you  need recordings to critique or a vocal teacher."

singing,32cdsm,9garden,3,Sun Apr 12 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'm always dissenting on this sub. I have met a significant number of people who have been coached and still cannot sing well enough to impress themselves or others. I think what you can expect to achieve is wildly overstated in this sub. It's super annoying to me. Everyone should sing. If you find joy and passion in it, do it, and don't worry about whether or not you're ""good"". I'm not suggesting you are one of the people who wouldn't benefit from coaching, but to read the comments that invariably say, ""oh barring some medical condition, everyone can learn to sing with a proper coach"". Ugh... No, lots and lots of people cannot. My wife cannot, my sister cannot, about a dozen of my friends cannot. If I told each of them to get a good coach I would be telling them to waste their time and money. Anyone who tells them differently is selling them something.   I hope you keep on singing as much as you can and if you decide to take some lessons, I hope they really benefit you. There is nothing I admire more than someone who strives to improve themselves and someone who has a passion for their instrument. But to answer your question in the abstract or general sense, no, quite definitely, not everyone can learn to sing to their satisfaction with ""a good coach""."
singing,32cdsm,TopherKeene,2,Mon Apr 13 00:07:31 2015 UTC,"I absolutely LOVE your comment, and I'm pretty sure I'm one of the guys you're referencing since you pretty much quote me verbatim in your text!  I actually fully agree with you, the problem is the advice is often ""try hard, get a coach"", and as you said, many many people are very bad at singing and trying hard doesn't help and coaches seem to give up on them or take more and more of their money without any demonstrable improvement. In no way do I deny your first hand experience, it's completely valid.  Remember that there is no qualification for being a voice teacher. Many are just people who've sung most of their lives (and always been pretty good at it) so they never learned what it was like to struggle with singing, never worked with terrible singers, or had top quality coaching from an early age (I've seen kids start on voice lessons at 4 years old!).   I agree, your family and friends who've had singing lessons from these kinds of teachers would be better off throwing their money away.  These teachers are wonderful for a good singer, but they don't know what to do without some base of 'natural talent' to start from.  I would like to share with you that, while I do believe your experience (knowing many people who are bad singers and haven't improved) is totally valid and I believe it, my experience has been the opposite. I've offered coaching (often free) to anyone I've met (online or off) who ""can't sing"".  Some only needed a confidence boost, some needed a few weeks of lessons, and some I've worked with for years just to get a few notes in tune. But you know what? I've never met anyone who truly ""can't sing"". It might take a few years, but they've all gotten there.  That being said, I totally see that you haven't seen anything like that. SO if it's interesting at all I'd happily offer a few months of free coaching to a member of your family or one of your friends who you think is a ""lost cause"".  I live for this, it's what I do, and you'd be doing me a HUGE favor by allowing me to share what I know with them and possibly show you that they didn't have to give up on themselves. If any of the over a dozen people you mention still have a little piece inside wishing they could sing, please consider showing them a little faith and putting them in contact with me, I'd love the chance to show you that truly anyone can learn to sing, or to be proven totally wrong :-)  PM me anytime.  Seriously, thanks again for your contribution, it's so easy to get into an echo chamber here and forget what REAL PEOPLE are experiencing every single day. I really value this discussion."

More than that, I want to tell you how nice a response this was and what a fine example of discourse/intercourse this is. I too am super interested in the discussion, and while I may be on the other side of the fence, I'm not immovable. I think I have the perfect candidate for you and I spoke to him briefly about the prospect of taking on a new teacher.   Going forward, I will see if he is willing to commit. This of course would all be anecdotal, but if you were able to get a marked improvement from him, consider myself a convert.   Either way, consider me kindred in that we have both strived for excellence in our field. I wish for me, as for anyone, that singing brings them all the joy in the world.

The question gets asked all the time and I know the people who respond are probably very well educated singers, and many know more than me, I'm certain. But it's always this same answer and it is just not my experience that it is true much more than half the time. I really like everyone else's input so I don't mean to be aggressive about it, I just really disagree and think it needs to be stated more often that singers are born with an instrument. Not all of those instruments are created equal. Much respect to everyone in the sub."
singing,32cdsm,thogvojdom,3,Mon Apr 13 00:13:20 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree! As you would expect in this sub ;). It's true that there are plenty of people who get lessons and still don't sound good, but that's usually a problem with musical hearing, e.g. they can't precisely hear the difference between in tune or out of tune, and/or they can't hear the difference between a relaxed healthy sound and a strained one, or they're just not practising right or enough. It's almost never about the instrument like you say.  The difference between people who easily learn to sing and those who have a harder time is, in my opinion, A: how well they use their voice normally and B: their ""musicality"" or musical ear, which is much more nurture than nature.  People who are behind in both of these aspects will have a much, much harder time getting to a decent level. Technique is easier to learn than the musical hearing part, but for some people like me who started out with poor vocal habits it can take more than a few years to make a healthy sound and sound decent. Still, anyone can learn it, it's just a question of body mechanics.  People who don't have much of a feeling or ear for music are difficult to teach because that kind of teaching is not really what singing coaches are trained for and it can take thousands of hours of listening and practising, hours that ""talented"" people already spent in their childhood. Still I think anyone can learn it if they invest the time and enjoy it. When I was young I couldn't tell out of tune from in tune at all but now I have a good musical ear, much better than average. I wasn't born like that nor was I musically gifted as a child when I started playing recorder and piano, but it's something that can be learned.  So to the OP: yes everyone can learn it, but don't learn it to impress people, that motivation is too shallow to drag you through hundreds of hours of practise. Don't expect to be good in a few months, it'll probably take years. It's a very fun and rewarding process though if you don't get impatient :)"
singing,32cdsm,MagicRhythmLizard,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"9garden made some very good points but I think you nailed the most important factors to learning how to sing.   The difference between people who easily learn to sing and those who have a harder time is, in my opinion, A: how well they use their voice normally and B: their ""musicality"" or musical ear, which is much more nurture than nature.   I played guitar for years before I started to sing. I was fairly comfortable transcribing music by ear at that point. I consider this a huge benefit when it came to learning to sing.   Technique is easier to learn than the musical hearing part, but for some people like me who started out with poor vocal habits it can take more than a few years to make a healthy sound and sound decent. Still, anyone can learn it, it's just a question of body mechanics.   Gotta agree with that. I started with a very strained voice and unlearned that bad habit to develop a much richer natural tone.   9garden: I just really disagree and think it needs to be stated more often that singers are born with an instrument. Not all of those instruments are created equal.   To some point this is true. But mostly I think its poor technique and musical ear. At least that is my own personal experience. But it is also true that just spending money and expecting to get good from singing lessons will not do a whole lot."
singing,32cdsm,speaksincolor,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"In a word: no. Almost everyone, with very few true exceptions, can learn to sing relatively well provided they are willing to put in the practice time and find a good teacher to help them get there.  Whether or not people are impressed is on them -- I don't think my voice is particularly impressive amongst my other singer friends, for example, but untrained friends have found it impressive."
singing,32cdsm,Murch23,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"Just because anyone can learn, doesn't mean everyone should learn. I'd say with consistent practice, you can be good enough to impress some people. While lessons help a ton, they also cost money, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan on doing something more than just impressing people at social events or you have enough disposable income that it doesn't matter (or you just want to). Singing in the car made a vast improvement for me, and just doing that should get you to the point of turning a couple heads if you push yourself a bit.  Some people's voices are really well suited to party tricks, which impresses people easily. Like I can get really high, which surprises some people, but I don't have the proper technique to pull it off in a super musical context outside of busting out ""Take on Me"" at karaoke nights, plus my tonality in the upper range isn't too good outside of belting notes like that. I'm debating getting lessons once I save up some more money, since I also sing (mostly backup vocals) in a band, but I think that's a level above where you want to go.  Basically, you can learn, but I wouldn't dedicate your life to it only to impress people."

That's a very silly reason to want to sing, and it doesn't require you to be a good singer by a LOOOOONG shot. Impressing people is mostly about singing reasonably in tune (not even exact, seriously) and looking like you sort of know what you're doing on stage. Most audiences are full of completely untrained lay people who are impressed if you open your mouth and anything comes out. It's really not a valuable goal, imo."

I've been a vocal teacher/coach and performer for a bit over a decade now, studied it in college and taught at middle, high schools, and colleges. I'm finishing up a book to show that EVERYONE can learn to sing, shy of a severe physical or mental disability.  I'd be happy to help out over Skype if you like. First, I'd refer you to some vocal exercises I put up for free for my students: www.soundcloud.com/keeneconductor/sets/vocal-technique-1  I love working with highly skilled singers but my favorite is helping people who feel like they ""can't sing"" but really want to learn to sing. So I'd be happy to jump on Skype sometime, I've been taking online lessons and giving them for years now, and they can be very helpful.   A good teacher live is always best, but a good teacher over Skype is worth a lot more than a mediocre teacher live. My first session is always free so I'm happy to jump on and help out with some basic breath technique and give some advice on how to practice to improve your voice. I've helped a bunch of other aspiring singers from reddit who weren't sure how to get started, and I really love helping people in your position.  Your goal is perfect, not everyone can be a rock star or have a voice like Beyonce or Justin Timberlake, but everyone can learn to be good enough to have a great time singing and occasionally impress their friends.

That was my junior year of high school, 2008. I had never had real voice lessons. My mom was filming it with her camera. This is me as of last month. I know I messed up in a few places. I did much better at the actual competition. This is a recording of a recording since I couldn't  figure out how to get the video/audio off of our school's website otherwise.  The biggest difference between then and now is vocal health. In 2010, my voice teacher suspected that the breathy sound wasn't just bad technique and sent me to get a laryngoscopy that showed I had swollen vocal cords from years of singing wrong. Any longer without getting it checked out and I would have ended up with nodules. Instead of completely touching, ll, they only met in the middle where the swelling was, )(. I had to take almost a year off of singing to recover. Once my voice was healthy again, I had to start back at the beginning learning how to sing. A big difference and improvement, I think."

singing,32b3vp,xarahn,9,Sun Apr 12 05:40:01 2015 UTC,It absolutely is normal. Most of the world's famous countertenors (classical male singers that sing in falsetto) are basses/baritones in their normal chest/head/modal register.
singing,32b3vp,ghoti023,2,Sun Apr 12 06:02:52 2015 UTC,"That's reassuring, I was wondering if I was some kind of doomed Tenor or something lol.  Do you know the physical reason though? I'm guessing it's the size of the vocal folds but I don't know the muscle work behind registers enough to tell myself."
singing,32b3vp,AegnorWildcat,5,Sun Apr 12 06:15:08 2015 UTC,I am a tenor that has no falsetto whatsoever. Having a limited falsetto will have no impact on your success as a tenor.
singing,32b3vp,ghoti023,2,Sun Apr 12 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about harmonics on guitars or other stringed instruments? Because that's the analogy I'm about to use, so I hope it makes sense.  When you're playing the violin or guitar, in order to get a solid, clear note, your finger presses all the way down to the fret board before strumming/bowing. It's possible to get notes that are an octave higher by just lightly touching the string and then bowing/strumming. The tone is lighter and has less depth to the sound. While it's not a perfect comparison, the voice works similarly with falsetto vs modal phonation.  With tenor voices, it becomes harder to get the folds to lightly vibrate that high, as they have less substance to lightly touch. The sound is shriller and is more likely to crack. Baritones folds are every so slightly thicker as to produce the deep tones of their modal register. Since they're thicker and are therefore a little bit more easy to maneuver with this light touching sensation, it's easier to manipulate them up higher notes into falsetto. Plus, the depth of tone in a falsetto of a baritone is generally going to be more pleasant than the lack there of in an equally equipped tenor.  Granted, I could be entirely wrong. That's what I remember from my vocal ped class, but my details may be incorrect."

singing,32b3vp,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much fame proves. Singers usually become famous because they have ""desirable"" voices for one reason or another. Could it not simply be that more basses/baritones are encouraged to sing countertenor? Perhaps tenors have a corresponding lighter falsetto than basses/baritones, in e.g. a middle-of-the-road mezzo range, and that this just isn't really a particularly sought-after sound in the classical world compared to the tenor voice - whereas baritone voices are ten-a-penny and relatively unexciting but have a strong falsetto in the alto range?"
singing,32b3vp,ViktorClay,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"It's true, that professionals don't necessarily equate to an accurate reading - but I've known tenors and baritones that have both attempted countertenor training, and the only ones that every stuck with it because they had the range and capacity were all baritones - bari-tenors at the highest. Every tenor I know that's tried has struggled getting a falsetto tone in the D5-G5 area, the high notes of countertenor rep.  Anecdotal, sure - and I'm open to being wrong. No one can be 100% right all the time."
singing,32b3vp,ViktorClay,2,Sun Apr 12 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"It's probably cause you havent trained your falsetto that much, people are usually very quick to blame stuff they cant do on voicetypes when in reality it comes down to skill and training. Im a male and i can vocalise higher then all girls, does that mean baritones have larger toprange then altos and sopranos?"

I would also guess that your breath wasn't as engaged for the lower notes as it was for the highs, and that when things begin to snowball like that, they're really hard to stop in the middle of singing. Generally when I have that kind of problem, I have to stop and start all over again in order to ""reset"" my body and mind (which is a pretty big no-no in an audition scenario).  Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's probably just vocal fatigue from tech week. Morning singing also generally takes more warming up for me than afternoon or evening. So even though it looks like you got up with plenty of time to spare, the warm-ups you chose for the day may just not have been ideal, or you may have gone too high too fast, and tried to expedite the warm-up process.

The reason air will be coming out is because you're going too high too hard and it cuts out, this will be damaging to your vocal cords and will hamper your progress    Try going ""yoo hoo"" at your natural default voice pitch and then gradually raise the pitch a litle every time until you get to your highest comfortable pitch, but don't strain yourself and go beyong your comfoftable limit. That will give you an idea of how high you can go naturally, and then you can know your limits when singing songs and gradually work on expanding your range without straining or damaging your voice.  I find there's a certain technique to it that comes with practice and bad techniques that can damage your voice, but the problem with singing is it's hard to teach and explain since it's all inside. So I always had head voice but it was weak because I couldn't sing from the diaphram, and it took years of practice before I figured it out no matter how many videos I watched or tutorials I read, so everyone has different challenges but it's hard to be taught how to do it since it's all inside, and so easy to do it wrong or strain yourself or pick up bad habits  Just make sure you're not straining or damaging too much and try some range exercises and study technique, and sing along to songs and get to know your limits and try to find songs that gently stretch those limits. Your voice is like any other instruments; it takes years of practice to figure it out and get to a professional level for most people. It's just about being patient with yourself and knowing your limits and gently stretching those limits, focusing on tone and pitch and technique but not straining or damaging your voice and going too far too soon"

singing,328t89,goodtrash,1 point,Sat May 9 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"Search Amazon for a book on rhythm training. You can also use a Melodia but make sure you keep pitch and rhythm completely separate at this stage. I used a rhythm book by Starer at University. Pair that with a metronome and that's basically how it's done. I found that using an actual metronome rather than an app kept me from getting distracted on my phone.   Use a notation program if you can't figure out what a rhythm sounds like and slow it down until you understand it. Once you get it, speed it up on your own metronome and do it yourself. If you practice everyday for two hours for about two months, you'll probably be able to sight read most rhythms in the vocal repertoire and at least have an idea of how to approach complicated modern music as well.   You'll hit a wall for a short period, but once you get over it you will grow exponentially and it's important that you continue practice after that point to solidify your work. Practice with someone that is better than you if possible.  Cheers!  Edit: I should add that it's good to use a percussion training book (like the Starer one I used) because they line out downbeats in their exercises. Sight-singing books normally don't have the hash marks written in."

Most of us aren't, so it's imperative to practice with a metronome so that your brain gets used to hearing a steady pulse. It's common practice for instrumentalists to practice with a metronome but sadly not as enforced for singers.   When I first started singing, I had problems staying in sync with a piano because my brain was too focused on doing only one thing well. You have to get good at rhythm on its own before you can expect to put it together. When I got to college, I had an ear training class that focused just on rhythm. I got addicted to it after I got over the challenge wall like I mentioned, and it fixed the issue.

If you want to sing like Pavarotti, who is a tenor, but has a rich voice(which I have heard people consider 'deep'), then you can train to get that. Most adult men have a voice that is lower than Pavarotti, yet not many have one as rich as his voice.  That technique is based on resonance and proper support, often having a naturally low larynx, raised soft palate, proper tongue position, and technique in high notes allow a slightly chesty sound without the weight, along with years of practice, and being over 30. A lot of those things you can over do and be harmful too, so there's no general advice we can give. You don't want to force your larynx really low, or push it down with your tongue, or sing with a lack of resonance in your head."

Sometime in 1970, Andrews was one of the many actresses considered for the lead role of Eglantine Price in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks, losing the role to Angela Lansbury.  Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer Harry Belafonte for an NBC-TV special, An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center. In 1972–73, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, The Julie Andrews Hour, on the ABC network. The show won seven Emmy Awards, but was cancelled after one season.

singing,323rj7,BlueArtiste,6,Fri Apr 10 09:55:50 2015 UTC,Vibrato is a natural byproduct of a free voice. You don't make Vibrato happen because it naturally occurs when the rest of your body and voice are lined up. It's a natural phenomena that isn't really easy to explain. Keep practicing and let the voice be free of negative tension. :) the last thing you want to do is try to make it happen by adding more pressure and tension.
singing,323rj7,baconvader,6,Fri Apr 10 16:08:54 2015 UTC,"I would add that with proper technique, vibrato will occur unless you act to stop it; it's sort of the default state. If you feel like you're having to consciously create vibrato, there's something else wrong."

singing,323rj7,mwb2,2,Fri Apr 10 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps another way to word it is that improper vibrato (which we call tremolo) is the trembling under tension you describe with the arm, but proper vibrato is a function of and necessity for the release of tension—a natural but fairly rapid pulse/cycle of correct tension and release. For a man singing in full voice (classical voice, I mean) in the upper middle and upper voice, the voice must vibrate (must have strong vibrato) to rapidly release the tension that's necessary to phonate those pitches at any intensity of mf or greater."
singing,323rj7,TotoCotogni,4,Sun Apr 12 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Vibrato is simply an oscillation in pitch of the voice. By ""oscillation"", your voice is literally flipping back between the ""right"" pitch (the note you're trying to sing) and another, slightly higher or lower pitch.     It's really easily seen/heard on an instrument such as the violin. (However, the time at which the video starts is a beginner's violin vibrato - actual vibrato for both vocals and violin is much faster.)     As you read in your article, it comes naturally to those singing with the right technique. It's very hard to be able to say what a specific person needs to do to find their vibrato. If you're serious about singing, look for a voice teacher who can work with you on developing your voice. Vibrato comes naturally as a part of this process. That said, if you can't afford a vocal teacher, I would stress that you don't try to ""force"" your vibrato - don't try to create artificial vibrato. If you're thinking about technique stuff while singing (""how is my breath support?"", ""is my resonance good?"" etc...), and NOT vibrato, you will get vibrato eventually."

singing,323rj7,Turtlepuppet,2,Fri Apr 10 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Vibrato is a stylistic choice and use of it doesn't necessarily make someone a better musician. Actually, excessive vibrato might not be a good move depending on the song. Once you're able to produce it naturally, you can understand when it's it's artistically appropriate. There are plenty of singers who don't exploit the use of vibrato and still successfully perform their songs."
singing,323rj7,nitdus,3,Sun Apr 12 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true. A good vibrato should oscillate evenly around the target pitch, not only below. If the vibrato is only below the target pitch, the singer will sound flat (and effectively they are, as the center of their pitch would be a quarter step flat or so)."
singing,323rj7,keakealani,2,Sat Apr 11 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"Vibrato is an awesome way to add color to your voice. I think it's important to note that there are different ways to use it depending what kind of music you prefer singing, and yes, it will come naturally when you relax and sing with proper use of air and support. I personally don't like when people ""try"" to sing with vibrato because it comes across very forced and takes away from the performance and song. I think it's more important to get your notes and perform the emotion of the song."

I do think that the vibrato is a bit much on your first example, but it really didn't bother me on the second. I also think that the second track is a better fit for your voice. On both tracks, I felt like you had a tendency to rush to the ending consonant on your sustained notes. The effect is that the ends of your phrases sound very closed off instead of resonant. Stay on the vowel a bit longer and sustain the volume, particularly when the pitch is lower.   I am completely new here and you can feel free to ignore me."

singing,3227ya,sleepy_pizza,2,Sun Apr 12 14:15:39 2015 UTC,"I found this mostly enjoyable! I would agree that there are pitch issues. You're often flat on sustained notes and sharp when you jump up in pitch more than a few notes. (EDIT: Just practice.) You sort of waver about a half-step on both sides of the note quickly before finally landing on the right one. In the places that you doubled over your own voice (sometimes harmonizing), the pitch issues are more pronounced.  Also, I feel like you might be too quiet. Granted, this song calls for it, but the intensity of the chorus is lost a bit.  The echo/distance effect you put on your voice at the end of the middle of the song was PERFECT. Nice touch!  I actually really like this song. Did you write it?   Your voice and style are kind of reminding me of Gavin from Dredg. :)"

Agreed, practice.   Quiet, okay that is good to know for sure. I always think, ""okay I am really singing loudly now"" and then I hear the recording and it sounds quite reserved. Very helpful.   Yeah, I wrote it, and played bass, guitar, and organ. My friend did a great job on the production side of things. So I am trying to learn to write songs at the same time as learning to sing.

singing,322hrv,Skwucky,3,Fri Apr 10 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"Singing low is quite a bit different than singing higher. There's nothing you can do to expand your natural range; you can only learn to maximize your access to it. It could very well be that your natural voice includes that note.  Whatever you do, any kind of pushing down on the larynx or scraping to get the note will be unhelpful in the long run. Vocal fry can make a sound that sounds like the pitch, but it's not the same as singing it with true ('modal') voice."
singing,322hrv,mwb2,3,Fri Apr 10 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about that low C much.  As a fellow bass,  techniques not really different,  although you do have to watch out for different  issues,  like trying to lower the lyranx,  squishing the neck with chin,  and not using enough air flow,  and overly darkening your sound.  You can do a few descending scales , often through an octave, on vowels and stuff, but generally  there's a limit,  and more practice per day isn't going to change much.   As someone who has a C2 most but not every day,  getting there won't change anything.  While you'll be able to hit the note,  unless you are very young it's not likely to be powerful. Heck I know tenors with low extensions,  and even though they can hit an G2-E2, they don't have great tone,  and are soft,  even though they aren't fry.   What you can do is keep your E2 strong and pretty,  and keep working  through that. Those notes are worth 1000 C2s. A boss's low notes aren't judged by how dark and deep he sounds,  but how well they are heard and pleasant they are. A bright,  balanced,  yet projected D2 will set you up for a nice C2 if/when it comes. Also just think of your C2 in  the morning after a full night rest, even though I can hit down to a Bb1 without any croaking vocal fry,  it's rough,  not as bright,  smooth,  or nearly as usable as  D2,  which is where your notes would be if you just managed to practice enough  down to a C2, without allowing for a natural voice change over years."
singing,322hrv,Mattpilf,2,Fri Apr 10 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"Range extension at the top of your voice is normally limited by technique, however at the bottom you are dealing with physical limits more quickly and easily. That being your vocal cords are only a certain length.   Most men are going to have to transition into vocal fry some where between A2 and E2. If you are lucky enough to be a Bass you'll have longer cords and hence won't need vocal fry until lower down. You can thicken it up somewhat over time but basically the idea is that once you hit the natural limit you stay connected and keep going down with vocal fry, in other words the vocal cords don't come apart. I have vocalized down to A0 before but my own voice transitions to fry around F2 depending on the day it always has since 2006 when I started singing more seriously.  Carl  https://www.youtube.com/user/cwehden/videos"
singing,322hrv,carlwehden,2,Fri Apr 10 12:46:32 2015 UTC,"Very differemt to singing higher, your vocal chords are relaxing and getting thicker and longer to produce the lower note, rather than getting thinner and shorter to produce higher notes. Relaxation and hydration are pretty key, as the more relaxed you are the lower you can go, but you are limited by anatomy. Sometimes your voice just not meant to go that low. Mwb2's point is also really important, don't push or scrape. That's bad news and could damage dem low notes."
singing,322hrv,DeepBlueB,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"i dunno how singing high is related, as that's about blending musculature at high pitches. Singing low just means singing low a lot :D. one guy I know is a basso profundo and his lowest natural note, last time i heard, was a c#2. So think not having the C2 is normal, but it's definitely something that you can get to.  If C2 is your first vocal fry note, it might take some time to get used to changing from C2 and C#2, but it also means that the C2 should be relatively clear for a fry note once you get it."

Singers can then straighten a tone if they choose. I don't know if this is something you had an issue with before, but the resonance seeming less could be due in part to a bit of a ""knurdle""  sound, which is caused by tension in the tongue root and under the chin."

singing,31yppv,Sleeper256,6,Thu Apr 9 04:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, I totally relate to this! I especially have issues with my tongue ""doing its own thing"" and not always noticing it unless my teacher points it out. But, I do have some tips.  For the jaw especially, try lightly holding your hands up with the back of your hands (fingers down) along your cheek/jaw. This can help you be mindful of keeping the whole jaw mechanism more vertical and open, rather than compressed or moving from side to side. You can also try using your fingers to gently massage your jaw joint/TMJs during a warmup to loosen things up and become mindful of your jaw's movements.   Try imitating really exaggerated chewing motions, like you're chewing a gigantic piece of bubble gum. This can help you just feel all the muscles involved jaw movement, and can also relieve tension.   Practice singing with your jaw really slack, like you've been injected with numbing agent at the dentist. You should really feel like your jaw is just hanging there.     With the tongue, it's a bit more complex because the tongue can move in so many ways and it's necessary to have control over all those things to sing and pronounce things.   I've found that exercises using lots of forward consonants can be helpful for loosening up the tongue. ""Th"" like in ""thing"" is a helpful consonant for me - I do a descending five-tone on ""thoo-dee thoo-dee thoo-dee thoo-dee thoo"" (each ""thoo-dee"" is on a single note), which is pretty good. The tongue-twister ""red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather"" is also helpful for this. Flip the ""r""s for the best effect. If you can tongue trill (roll your ""r""s), doing a scale on a tongue trill can also help a lot.   Similar to the numb jaw trick, try singing as if your tongue was numb (you might want to keep a napkin on hand for drool, but hey, gotta do silly stuff sometimes). It also might help to stick out your tongue as you sing.   If your gag reflex allows it, you can try singing with your finger in your mouth or something like a tongue depressor just to really feel what your tongue is doing. My big problem is here - I just can't feel my tongue most of the time so if it's bunching up or tensing weirdly I won't notice. It's helped me a lot to use my fingers to figure out how my tongue moves in different situations.     Anyway, those are some of the things I do or I've used with students to help them with this. It's definitely not an easy problem to deal with, and I'd wager even professional singers sometimes have problems with jaw or tongue tension. Just keep practicing and try to be very aware of what you feel when you sing so you can start learning how to identify and address problems.  Edit: Oh, also, try singing with a mirror. You can also notice a lot of tension issues visually, so that's a really good resource. That's probably what your teacher is mostly noticing, so you can play that role and help keep yourself on track."

The holding tongue-out thing and slack jaw seems to help the most. Also I never realized how long the tongue is, I think that's actually one thing that makes my larynx move.

singing,31yyjl,Pasty-torso,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:28:18 2015 UTC,"It's always going to be difficult for us to tell you what the problem is unless we hear you. Can you post a recording?  Projecting your voice while singing is difficult and takes practice. Two of the main ingredients in projecting your voice are (1) lifting your soft palate, (2) using mask resonance and 'twang' - are you aware of these?  Of course, you need to be breathing correctly and trying to eliminate tension from your throat / tongue while singing, but this is true in general anyway - if you're not doing these right, it'll not only impede your volume but also tire your voice faster and reduce your range and so on. They are harder to do if you're simultaneously hunched over a guitar.  I know people who sing in tune and with nice-sounding tone, who receive a lot of compliments, but who do none of the above things correctly. In fact, that described me a few years ago, and it probably describes most pop singers to varying extents."

singing,31yyjl,schniepel89xx,2,Fri Apr 10 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"That's definitely possible. I'm not particularly confident in my abilities. Those recordings sounds shaky and unsure and crappy to me. I did look up what /u/purple-pumpkin recommended about lifting the soft palate and mask resonance and practiced with that before I came to work. I noticed a difference right away where my voice seemed like it was going out, rather than up into the top of  my head if that makes sense. But I couldn't sustain it for a whole song. I think maybe voice lessons are the way to go. Thanks for taking the time to listen!"
singing,31yyjl,purple-pumpkin,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't the soft palate supposed to block the air from entering the nasal cavities, and isn't twang reliant on nasal resonance? If this sounds misinformed, it's because it is, and I would like some clarification on this."

If you want to hear better fundamentals from a singer of that era, Glenn Hughes has incredible technique check out his live in Australia show from 2007.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYDEnwg_w8    Technique is king, as you get better you can sing higher and higher for longer and longer.

singing,31x4m4,carlwehden,2,Fri Apr 10 12:35:35 2015 UTC,He's had to adapt from the 80s where he was literally screaming his balls off. Now it's a supported head voice. The rasp you hear isn't manufactured I believe. It's remnants of the damage he did as a younger lad...  As far as achieving that it's learning how to sing in the falsetto range in a fuller tone. More support and resonance.

If you're willing to forgo some for the weight, it's not all that hard or rare. You need a connected head voice. Not falsetto. You should be able to slide from your chest voice to your connected head voice with no 'bumps.' This is something that takes a while, but it's possible for most people."
singing,31x4m4,fishtaco567,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"In his days before AC/DC he used to have some beautiful clean singing, where you could really hear he was a baritone, but he could still go fairly high with ease thanks to a great mixed voice technique. Check out his pre-AC/DC band Geordie's version of House of the Rising sun. Beautiful, powerful clean A4's, as well as some great sounding and controlled high singing topping at E5 (and I'm pretty sure some of the low notes in the ""choir"" parts are him too, he bottoms out at some really strong E2's, so this song alone showcases 3 octaves of full voice by him... wow).   On the first two AC/DC albums with him he sounded just as good, although he pretty much stayed exclusively in his high range and used his head voice and mixed voice pretty much all the time. I guess somewhere along the line he did some damage to it, as he started declining after For Those About to Rock, and he has never sounded that good again."
singing,31x4m4,schniepel89xx,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:17:11 2015 UTC,I think he's using a sort of distorted falsetto. Try singing in falsetto and add some rasp/scream to it and you can kinda get a feel for at least where it starts from.

singing,31sak5,Kryo07,3,Tue Apr 7 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"Have fun. Seriously! If you take competitions/auditions too seriously, you'll be too wound up and tense to sing well. So relax, and have fun! Sing what you know. Don't try and pull out anything extra snazzy the night/week before thinking you'll have it as nailed as something you've been practicing for months. The more comfortable you are with what you're singing, the less nervous you'll be about forgetting words/entrances etc.  Don't do anything you don't normally do for warm ups and voice prep. Seriously. The more things you change, the less reliable you'll be. Do what works for you. Do what you've been working with your teacher. Remember that whoever it is you're auditioning for wants you to do well. They aren't scary harpies looking to rip you to shreds. They don't want you to be awful. No one wants to sit for hours a day listening to terrible singers. They want you to be awesome! They want everyone to do well, because they want to choose from the best. Which brings me to my next point -  ""Best"" is subjective. Just because you didn't win doesn't mean you were bad. Each set of judge likes something else in a voice. Some are biased towards warmer and larger voices, and others are biased towards more flexible and brighter voices. That doesn't mean that one is right or one is wrong, it just means that each judge uses slightly different criteria for ""best"" than the next one down the table. They all try to be as objective as possible, but since no two voices are the same, you can't judge them all on the same criteria in the first place.   So really, don't sweat it. Do your best, have fun, use it as a learning experience as to how to get better at competitions and auditions for you, since everyone approaches them with a different mindset. Don't fret about comparing yourself to others. Again, since everyone's voice is different, there is no 100% method to compare voices in the first place. The only person you should be competing with (and this will be more true over time) is with yourself."

Either way, making sure you are breathing deeply and supporting from the diaphragm won't hurt your singing. Try doing breathing exercises: breathing in for four counts, out for four, in for four, out for eight, etc. Also, make sure you are isolating your breath to the diaphragm and not letting it become shallow. If you see your shoulders move, you're doing it wrong."

singing,31ozyy,purple-pumpkin,6,Tue Apr 7 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"The technical definition of a vocalise is a song without words (a famous example is Rachmaninoff's Vocalise). It's a bit similar to etudes, though, in that there are both concert vocalises like Rachmaninoff's (and concert etudes like Chopin's Op. 10), and literal practice exercises (like your book and Hanon exercises).   To get more to the point, these are exercises designed to handle certain technical issues. Yes, they're best done with a teacher (I wouldn't say it's imperative, but they will be a lot more useful), and yes, you do lose things if you don't do them properly. There are lots of benefits beyond repertoire, which I'll get into in a sec. And even if you aren't a great pianist, it behooves you to at least learn to play I-V-I style progressions in every key as you warm up or do vocalises. And yes, they are both warmups and technical exercises, depending on how you do them.   So anyway, the most basic reason for vocalises existing is because, as I mention, they're designed to tackle a specific technical issue. The reason they're so much better than repertoire for technical work is because they allow you to both isolate that specific issue (more or less) and because they are moveable so that you can learn to address that issue throughout your whole range, not just the key the song happens to be in. Vocalises are also not hindered by text, dynamics, complex rhythms, etc. that are present in repertoire, allowing you to better focus on technique.   This is also why it is important to utilize the specific syllables mentioned, or replace them with other syllables that achieve the same thing (and unless you're a fairly experienced singer, I wouldn't recommend doing this on your own - I know I for one have made mistakes about vowels I assumed were appropriate for a certain exercise, only to later learn in vocal pedagogy that I was fighting against myself). Some exercises, for example, benefit from legato vowels with no consonants between them. Others benefit from using consonants to aid in articulation. Some might be done on one vowel for the whole time, while others use a variety of vowels.   Some exercises may be designed more to develop your ear training than for a purely vocal reason - these are probably the ones indicated to sing in solfege, and yes, it's important to sing in solfege (or use another tonal solmization system). I'm not sure what exactly is confusing about singing in solfege, though. Maybe you can explain.   As far as using them for warmups, certain vocalises absolutely can and should be used for warming up. In fact, the vast majority of warmups can be described as vocalises. Part of the thing about warming up is that it is not just for physically warming your voice up, but also building on technique to get ready to sing. In order to fully warm up the many ways you can use your voice, it makes sense to use exercises designed to address some of those many ways.   Anyway, while I'm not familiar with this specific book, I am a big fan of vocalises generally and I do think they're very important to developing healthy technique. I know some singers who don't do many vocalises, but I think they're really missing out. I am able to address technical issues much more quickly in vocalises than I am in repertoire, personally."

The  exercises later in the book will each have a particular skill that they are focussing on.   You can use them in warm up if you like. I would suggest only working on one or two at a time as a helpful vocal exercise or I you can target it more.

From this information, my gut suspicion is that when you were recovering from your nodes the first time, you developed some problematic speaking/singing patterns, maybe to compensate for or avoid the problem area. This can have a long term effect on your voice. And I think a speech pathologist would be better able to answer your questions about having a voice disorder or something like that - frankly, none of us here are doctors so it's pretty hard for us to say.   I also want to mention, though, that ""pre-nodules"" are sometimes a thing - if you have unhealthy singing/speaking habits, you may have the makings of future nodules that just haven't really become physically apparent yet. Nodules are basically calluses on your vocal folds, and if you think of calluses elsewhere on your body, you can probably note that when they first begin to form, it's not really clear that you have a callus, but over time it can become more clear. Since these symptoms are possible indicative of some sort of vocal damage (also don't forget to check for polyps), I would say it's worth keeping an eye on, even if a doctor can't notice anything just yet.   Anyways, yes, there are other disorders that have similar symptoms to nodules - I don't have my notes with me but I remember learning about them xD And I think probably a voice scientist or speech pathologist might be a good place to turn if you're not seeing anything on the ENT front."

singing,31okfw,A4m1n,4,Mon Apr 6 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well most song choruses are higher than verses because they're more intense.  We'd need more information about your voice to really help, though. You may be doing something wrong but nobody'll know just from reading this post."

singing,31okfw,enjarcher,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"Range can be developed. Good to start by making sure you've got good breath support, are not physically 'reaching' for the high notes, and have a bright, clear tone, placed forward so that it resonates in your face and head as well as your chest.

singing,31lzlw,ViktorClay,3,Mon Apr 6 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"I can sing very high, the key is to practice your entire voice chest falsetto and everything inbetween. Ive got alot of students who also sing this way, correct technique and alot of practice you get results :)  99% of all males use some sort of mix above the D5 can you belt higher Than that? Yes it's possible but it's not that economic for the voice and around that area mix sounds both bigger/better and is easyer :)"
singing,31lzlw,ViktorClay,2,Mon Apr 6 10:19:25 2015 UTC,"it's a mix of musculature, head and laryngeal, but it's not instant for untrained singers. when your at the point where you can start balancing properly, it first takes like 5-6 months to get a good blend, and then by that point your upper resonance will mature and then maybe 1-2 more weeks to get the new resonance working enough to sing very high. Doesn't sound too bad, but the tough thing is actually getting to the point where you can balance; as the laryngeal voice is the heaviest mechanism and a singer can easily overload their voice, even if it doesn't feel strained."
singing,31lzlw,xarahn,3,Mon Apr 6 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"You might like post-hardcore, most singers in this genre go to C5 minimum. I can go up to D#5 myself before starting to strain and can hit up to F5 but uncomfortably.  I usually sing these notes in basically pure head because it's so high but I can get a more mixed sound up to D5.  My falsetto doesn't really go higher, I can get to F#5 in falsetto and my head voice stops at E-F depending on days. It's all about mastering that upper range."

On the note of that mixed clean/dirty vocal style - should I not be doing that if I want my voice to stay healthy?  I'm trying to teach myself to sing, and I LOVE dirty mixed vocals, eg. Every Time I Die, The Venetia Fair.  My voice is naturally super clean and nasally, so, I've actually been trying to develop some grit; but, for a number of reasons, I'm starting to think that's not a super great idea."
singing,31lzlw,AFrawg,2,Mon Apr 6 21:48:52 2015 UTC,It depends on how it's done and how it works with your voice. I've seen a lot try and end up really straining or just damaging their voice overall.
singing,31lzlw,Sleeper256,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"Wow this is the first time I've heard not one but three people mention The Venetia Fair. Good to see they're doing well. I did a video shoot for one of their performances back in college and I thought they were just a small local band. Their music wasn't really my thing while I was there, but they were cool people and I got a copy of their CD ""The Circus"" and it's a concept album, right up my alley. Definitely grew on me and I never realized how talented the vocalist was until I started singing lessons and realized vibrato."
singing,31lzlw,CobraCommanderVII,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"Well, for me, it was a long range expanding process. My voice is about average placed, definitely not naturally high or anything. When I first started, I could barely hit an F4, and it took a very long time to get that consistent. Eventually I found myself being able to get the G, then I had an A, and so on. The way I did it was just singing the notes a lot, which was simple because I like mostly high-placed singers. After a while, the notes just started coming easier and easier. Nowadays, I'm reaching for F5's. From about G#4 to the top, I'm using a mix, which gets headier and headier as it goes. I add a fair bit of distortion typically to give it a fuller sound. As far as my falsetto, it's hit or miss. Typically, It's an absolute struggle even to get to F#5, so you could say my falsetto and full voice are close. However, sometimes I'll just randomly get a pretty good even higher note out of it. No idea how, I guess It just happens when I'm not trying and more relaxed. Anyway, that's the long and short of it, and if you have any questions, I shall answer."
singing,31nmuk,Murch23,2,Mon Apr 6 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"You're right that the voice continues developing into your 20s, and you're right that vocal maturation can play a role. Because some of the muscles involved in the voice develop later than others, you can experience a lack of control in your higher register and possibly an inability to consistently sing certain pitches that when you're older won't be a problem. It sounds like this may be the case for you here.   To answer your actual question, it's tough. Everyone has different sensations when they sing, and one person can describe a feeling that is totally healthy and fine, while another person can describe the same type of feeling that indicates something unhealthy. So there's really no hard-and-fast rule for what is a normal amount of discomfort from just singing in a range you're not used to, and what is an indication of vocally straining.   Instead, I'd say to just be judicious with the amount of time you spend in the upper register. Most of vocal technique is more or less the same in the middle as it is in the top - many top voice teachers and pedagogues feel that you can learn a lot from just singing in a comfortable middle area. It's okay to take a few excursions up to the top and down to the bottom - just touching on those areas in your warmups is definitely a fine idea.   But, even if it sounds counterintuitive, you may find that your high range develops once you are more comfortable in your middle, because that helps you develop breath support and other things without worrying about the separate issues that come from singing higher. Plus, the sensations of singing are often easier to feel in the middle range because you aren't as likely to strain or do something funky.   Also, consider shorter practice sessions. 15-30 minutes per session is okay for a beginner - I am a college voice major and I rarely practice for more than 30 minutes at a time (at least taking a 5-10 minute break after 30 minutes). It's normal to experience vocal fatigue if you've been singing too long, and I find it helpful to focus more on a shorter-term goal than to marathon a super-long practice session."
singing,31nmuk,keakealani,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. My sessions are pretty short (usually around 15 minutes, but probably 4 times throughout the day, more if I'm driving a lot, since I sing there too). It only happens when I spend the majority of the time in that register or am already worn out (I work as a cashier at a fast food restaurant, so I'm talking for at least 4 hours a day most of the time).  Also, I've noticed that when my voice is tired, sometimes it cracks and jumps about an octave up on sustained high notes. One, does that mean I'm doing something wrong with my technique, and two, does that indicate the ability to hit notes that high eventually? I have a feeling it doesn't, but I figured it'd be worth asking."
singing,31nmuk,keakealani,2,Mon Apr 6 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"Ah! Cashiering and retail can also take a toll on your voice. You might want to try speaking with more breath support and a little higher in your range to reduce vocal fatigue from speaking. That probably does contribute to feeling a little more vocally tired by the end of the day. I know when I have had a full day of talking my voice definitely feels more tired when I sing.   With the cracking/jumping, it could mean many things, but frankly, that's probably mostly puberty doing its thang. I'm not that familiar with research on developing voices so I honestly can't tell you if it means anything about your eventual range. It could be a stray overtone or falsetto-type production (I'm inferring you are female from the range you're talking about - female falsetto isn't as common because it usually overlaps with the modal voice, but it is possible to have a similar type of vocal production if you aren't singing with full cord closure).  Anyway, it sounds like you're pretty in touch with your voice and body, so I'd say to just stop when your body tells you to, and you'll be fine :)"
singing,31nmuk,keakealani,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy. My falsetto has always sucked though, and it definitely can't hit that high of a note, so I'm pretty sure that isn't it, unless I'm doing something wrong with my falsetto entirely.  I'll try working on my breath support while working a bit more, and see if it helps."
singing,31nmuk,hardikjuneja,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why you're spending so much time in the treble clef, then. That's really not healthy. At your age I would really recommend stepping back and spending more time developing your middle register."
singing,31nmuk,xarahn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"It's mostly due to a lot of singers I like having higher voices (Devin Townsend, Spencer Sotelo, the guy from Thank You Scientist, any power metal singer), and the fact that it's been increasing so quickly that I kind of want to see how far it'll go. I'm still working on singing in my middle range, and I do so in most cases, but I figured working with the high and low end of my voice wouldn't hurt, as long as I'm not straining myself."

I don't think you could hit those notes healthily one day, but I can't tell without hearing you.  I once played Amnesia (a damn scary game) and once I jumpscared so hard I screamed something in the 6th octave (as a guy). My girlfriend laughed for at least 10 minutes.

singing,31nv8e,keakealani,2,Mon Apr 6 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"Considering you've got probably 8-10 years before your voice fully settles, there's absolutely no way to tell what your final range or voice type will be. And in fact, I think calling yourself a ""high baritone"" at 18 is pretty counterintuitive and potentially harmful - especially in musical theatre, you really don't want to back yourself into a box.   All that being said, what you're doing sounds like it would really benefit from studying with a qualified voice teacher. Musical theatre really is one of those genres where having a teacher is really important because there are so many genre-specific idioms and technical demands that you aren't going to know on your own.   And especially if you're planning on being a professional singer, it's absolutely silly not to get a teacher."

The best way to make sure your voice is as good as it can be by then is to train every part of your range.  I know how it feels to want to to hit those high notes but don't neglect your lower range.  At your age, I think I capped at F4 because I didn't understand head voice yet, now I can go up to D-E-F5 depending on the day and warm up."

singing,31jrqm,drehz,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"It's not all that complicated, really. Mostly I think it depends on the line you're singing - the arrangement can ask for a more choral approach or an instrumental imitation. Your phrasing will reflect that - it's hard to describe, but bass players have a specific way of phrasing their lines, and incorporating that will help your greatly.   Your resonance shaping and articulation is another part. You'll notice that bass singers often have the mic very close to their face, between the mouth and nose. This is because the main resonant space for your dmms is the nasal cavity. I put the tongue very close to the roof of my mouth and open up the nasal cavity - the mouth stays closed. This gives you a sound very different from conventional vocal sounds, and especially if you're going a bit higher in the range (e.g. on a walking bass part) the change in timbre really drives home the imitation.   Finally, as others have pointed out, there's amplification and effects. In any mix you'll assign a certain frequency spectrum to each part (simplifying here), so the higher range of a bass part will be cut off in order not to interfere with the harmony and melody parts. As for effects, often a simple suboctave will get you that beefy sound and make you sound like an instrumental bass.   tl;dr: phrasing, resonance, mixing are the three factors in sounding more instrumental.  This is fairly difficult to explain in text, and I used to coach some of our basses on the techniques - feel free to pm me if you'd like to hear more, or get some demonstrations!"

singing,31iyb2,dannce,5,Sun Apr 5 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"I am a tenor that just graduated High School (19) so take my advice with a grain of salt. Developing vibrato is mainly about the basics of your posture and breathing from the diaphragm. When you breath in, try expanding your belly and sides of the belly as much as possible. Then when you are releasing the air ""singing"" expand your chest cavity and your lungs as much as possible while simultaneously shrinking and pushing the air out with your belly and upper abs. The best way to describe it is to think of your body as a vehicle, and you want the clutch pushed down all the way to the floor, then when you are ready you slowly release the clutch while putting as much gas in as necessary. Keep your feet shoulder width apart, shoulders down, back straight, and chin parallel to the floor. Before you start singing let a little bit of air out of the vowel shape of the first word, while also thinking about the sound of the note you want to produce in your head. Attack every note from ""above"". The rest is all about practice and keeping habits that will help you project and protect your voice."

singing,31iyb2,keakealani,11,Sun Apr 5 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Vibrato is important in the sense that it is a byproduct of healthy, supported singing and a lack of vibrato often (but not always) indicates that your technique isn't allowing for that healthy, supported sound.   However! Vibrato does come with age, and some people don't have much vibrato when they are young. My vibrato didn't really come in until I was 20-21. So since you are young, I would very much include this as a factor.   Also, you mention singing alto in choir. If we're being realistic, there's a high chance that you are actually a mezzo or soprano with a lower extension and a good ear. True altos don't really exist at your age, because the lower contralto voice type is very slow to develop (and mezzos are often slower than sopranos as well). This could also contribute to your lack of vibrato - singing outside your tessitura necessarily means you're making vocal adjustments that aren't necessarily conducive to a lot of vibrato.   All that being said, you simply can't ""train"" vibrato. It happens naturally when you are doing everything else right, more or less. I would say to work on your general technique, especially freeing up your breath (choral singing often tends to encourage a more constricted sound so you have to allow yourself to let go and sing with a relaxed tone). If you are interested in singing at all in the future (not even professionally, but maybe continuing with choirs and hobby singing), I would really recommend finding a voice teacher to work with you as well.   Also, as a side note, I personally think it's poor form for a high school choir director to demand vibrato for solos. There is so much good choral music for which vibrato is inappropriate, and it's very closed-minded not to program that repertoire (or your choir director is making stylistically inappropriate choices). You should not feel at a disadvantage because of a potentially physiological factor. Although maybe as consolation, your issues stem more from your teacher's incompetence than anything you're doing :)"
singing,31iyb2,terrycotta,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! I understand that I may not be a true alto but I am definitely nowhere near a soprano; I can sing most tenor I parts (the ones I've been exposed to, anyway) as well without changing the octave. My director doesn't require vibrato for solos, but she prefers the sound and more often than not a singer with vibrato will get the part over one without. I've had solos before though!"

singing,31iyb2,terrycotta,5,Sun Apr 5 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"I meant in the sense of a definable fach. Obviously there are lots of singers that can hit those notes (myself included, and I'm a pretty clear soprano), but the vast majority develop into mezzos or sopranos and lack the characteristic tone color of a fully mature contralto. If you can point to examples of clearly-defined, fach-consistent contraltos under the age of 20, I'd love to see that."

That doesn't happen til well past 30; and I believe she said she's an alto (not a contralto))). I'm just saying you probably shouldn't use absolutes and get the girl all confused. Her choir teacher is probably very capable and who knows why she isnt getting the solos.

singing,31iyb2,terrycotta,4,Mon Apr 6 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"None of this seems at all relevant to the point I was making. The fact that the choral alto tessitura is necessarily outside the ideal range for most young singers for physiological reasons does lead to less presence of vibrato in some singers, and it absolutely does play a factor here, and unless you'd like to cite information to the contrary, I'm not sure why this argument is relevant. We can get pedantic about the meaning of ""alto"" (it is pretty clear in context that I meant developed contralto), and we can argue about exactly how common such a voice type is in young singers (to my knowledge, there are no such scientifically rigorous, widespread studies that analyze developing voices in this way, although feel free to mention any you know of), but it really seems that none of that in any way negates my point, and in my personal experience the evidence warrants note as many young sopranos and mezzos are asked to sing outside their tessitura in choral settings to the detriment of their developing technique."

My voice teacher made me do these exercises that I hated but they worked for me. I'm not sure how these exercises will work if you can't create vibrato, but it can't hurt, and it might be a good place to start.   One was to make an 'ooo' sound like a ghost. Try flipping back and forth between the two pitches in a ghost 'ooo' as quickly as you can . Also, make sounds like a car engine starting up. Again two pitches, start slowly and then pick up speed like an engine. Also try slowing down again.   Don't forget to breath from your diaphragm. Good luck!"

While it's possible vibrato can result from such an exercise, I would be very cautious about recommending this, especially since it's unclear that OP has a regular voice teacher. Without the other mechanisms of good breath support present, this exercise will not create vibrato, and it could just lead to a tight trill which offers its own technical issues."

A lot of this is about drying out the folds which can be aided with good hydration (which is also important for exercise so I'm sure that's not a problem), but I'd just say to be careful with anything like that. Even so, it's a kind of minor thing that isn't likely to affect your voice all that much.   Also definitely ensure that your abs aren't so tight that they can't relax fully for breathing. Core strength is great, but be sure you maintain flexibility as well, just so you don't clench up when breathing too much.   But the flip side is that being healthy and strong can only help your singing - a healthy body is a healthy voice! Cardio especially can help with your air capacity and stuff like that, which is always nice."
singing,31jpa3,elerico,2,Mon Apr 6 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"Bit of my background: I've been pretty seriously weight lifting for a while, and before that I was a competitive gymnast for 10 years. In addition I've been dancing on and off. I'm also an opera singer, having taken voice lessons seriously for the past 9 years or so.  Working out before singing can change your breath support. It might make it better or worse, not sure--I don't know your voice. I don't think it's going to change it extraordinarily for choir, but I notice it in my voice. If you're doing core work (which you need to do!) your abs will be very tight. You need to stretch out in multiple ways (cobra, pigeon, butterfly). If you hit your back hard (especially if you do squats/deadlifts), your posture will suffer. Not much you can do about that, other than try to not lift so hard your back gets sore. Make sure you're working out your back, as even a slight muscle imbalance can really make your posture suffer.   That's the basic short and long-term effects. Watch out for vibrato that comes from the abdomen--very bad--and shallow breathing. You should film yourself singing exercises shirtless from the front and in profile, both before and after working out to see how your abdominal wall changes. That might be very enlightening.  If any of this gives you pause, don't worry about it. I know a couple professionals who feel like they get much better support after a good workout. It all depends on the person. There isn't much literature on the singing athlete (at least that I'm aware of)."

singing,31gn92,mezzolini,8,Sat Apr 4 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"My best advice, as a singer married to a non-singer who really didn't know much about singing when we started dating, is not to present yourself as something you're not.   It's ok if you are currently ignorant, as long as you're interested and willing to learn. There's no reason to expect anyone who isn't a singer to know all of this, and if she's anything like most of us here, she will be happy to elaborate. You won't have to think of conversational topics for awhile. :-)  I really appreciated my now-husband's willingness to learn. I even had him come to some of my voice lessons, and now he functions as another ""pair of ears"" when I'm not sure how I'm sounding! (You don't have to do all of this, but I personally appreciate it.)  Also, there are some controversial topics and things that people see differently--so if you tell her you don't know much and ask her to elaborate on things, you'll get her view on things, and you don't have to say something and have her disagree and try to talk to you about why!  One thing I'd be very careful about is criticism. Singers can be really sensitive, and sometimes non-singers can accidentally hurt their feelings. Very very often, when a singer asks you how they sound, they want to hear encouragement. So, if she asks you how she sounds, focus on the positive aspects until you know her better. (And even after...I make sure to let my husband know to wait until I am ready to hear a real critique!)  Good luck!"
singing,31gn92,Akoustyk,3,Sun Apr 5 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"You don't ever have to be knowledgeable about the interests of a girl you want to talk to. What you have to be, is interested in knowing more, and asking her lots of questions about it.   If you ask us a bunch of stuff and then go and talk to her about singing, showing off your knowledge or what have you, that will not come off nicely. If you go to her, and ask her a bunch of questions about it, and try to learn as much as you can about her and singing, then you will come off a lot better. You never look dumb if you ask things and learn from them. People like to feel knowledgeable and to feel like they have wisdom to share, so being interested and learning all about it from them is a good thing."
singing,31gn92,keakealani,2,Sun Apr 5 04:18:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, don't try to act more knowledgeable than you are. Ask her questions if you don't understand something. Or look things up on Wikipedia (it's not like there aren't already comprehensive articles about everything you've asked about).   As someone who very much likes to sing (and is pretty into opera), I think I would much rather someone ask questions and seem interested than to pretend they know what I'm talking about if I go into voice-geek land. I think singing (especially opera) is enough of a niche that most of us expect the general public not to be super knowledgeable.   That all being said, /r/opera is a good resource for learning about opera broadly. Here, we kind of focus on the actual act of singing, and since it doesn't sound like interested in learning to sing or talking about the nuances of vocal technique, you may find the threads here relatively less useful for your purposes."

singing,31gn92,purple-pumpkin,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:13:19 2015 UTC,a 15th.  Which is why in piano or flute or tuba you might see 8va for octave or 15va for 2 octaves.
singing,31gn92,haalhorn,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point! An octave jump is a jump from a given pitch to the pitch 7 notes higher than it. There are 7 spaces-between-notes encompassed in this span, or 8 notes if you count both ends. We usually do count both ends, but this system is actually pretty poorly designed mathematically, because counting both ends leads to funny and unintuitive numbering. If a 1-octave jump is an 8th, then a 2-octave jump must be a 15th, a 3-octave jump must be a 22nd, etc. Similarly, a 0-octave jump must be a 1st, an octave jump downwards must be a -6th, etc.  Besides, 'octave' has several uses. /u/xarahn is using a different one to you: piano octaves, i.e. ""the first octave"", ""the second octave"", and so on. (There were 366 days from 1st January 2014 to 1st January 2015 including both ends, but we still always say that a year contains 365 days, because it doesn't make sense to count both ends.)  Another way to think about it: if there are 8 notes in an octave (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C), then that really means there are 13 semitones in an octave (C, C#, D, D#, E, ..., B, C). But (in equal temperament of course) if A is 440Hz then Bb is 440 * 21/12  Hz - that is, ""one-twelfth of an octave"" higher than A.  TL;DR: thinking of an octave as 8 notes (rather than a jump of 7 notes) makes no sense when you start stacking them, because counting both ends is an unnatural thing to do."
singing,31gn92,purple-pumpkin,0,Sun Apr 5 18:16:22 2015 UTC,Please tell me why you are arguing.  I was clarifying the fact that an octave is an interval of an 8th.  Not many people that I have worked with care about the C3 octave vs the C4 octave.  The other use is much more useful in day to day music.

Like /u/ghoti023 said, you're at a great age to start lessons and you can preserve a lot of your voice's longevity by learning how to use it healthily.

singing,31eavy,P8ntballz,3,Sat Apr 4 06:20:16 2015 UTC,"Song choice is a huge factor as well. I'm a professional musical director myself, and when I'm playing I like to be listening to the auditioned and not pulling my hair out sight reading Sondheim.   Try a song that you think suits your voice well on other piano playing friends, and ask how hard it is to sight read. Once you have your song, know it forwards and backwards because while sight reading, every pianist will play it differently.   Once the perfect song is found, your voice will shine even more because you won't be worried about what the piano player is doing! Break legs"
singing,31eavy,mezzolini,3,Sat Apr 4 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"My teacher does lots of exercises at the beginning of lessons, but it's not all just ""warming up"":  at least 20 minutes of the of vocalises are exercises to help me develop different aspects of my technique. So my teacher recommends just 7 minutes of singing warmups for performances. After doing some kind of light physical exercise, then breathing exercises, I try to stick to a basic 5-note scale, something high, something staccato, something low, and something that opens up my resonance. Remember, it's too late to practice your pieces (do it mentally if you must), so you're just getting blood flowing, your breath working, and your resonance going. Pre-audition time is not the time to really give the voice a workout."
singing,31eavy,keakealani,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think audition warmups are a fine line between warming up your voice and over singing. Many people have the impulse to warm up really thoroughly which I think is why your teacher recommends against it. I usually just do some lip trills and one or two scales before an audition or competition.   That being said, I think there are a couple of things you can do to polish an audition. (Btw I'm speaking from a classical perspective but I think these ideas can be adapted for other genres)  First and foremost, really dive into your text. Be sure you have a clear idea about what the text means to you, and practice portraying it through your performance. This doesn't mean to overact, of course, but definitely have a character idea in mind and some ways to communicate that on stage.   Dress to impress. This is probably a given, but just in case, I'm mentioning it. Don't go over the top formal, but look professional and put-together. Be comfortable, but don't be sloppy. And of course, be aware of hemlines and sheerness as far as lights and stage angles are concerned.   Practice your bows, and any other fluff. If you expect to need to introduce yourself to the auditioners, make sure you can do that without mumbling or any other issues. If you expect them to ask you additional questions, prepare some possible answers ahead of time.   Try not to stress. Easier said than done, but really just get a good night's rest and take a deep breath. The more you worry, the more your nerves can affect your performance.   Good luck!"
singing,31eavy,Chriias,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:49:43 2015 UTC,"Auditions are an extraordinary circumstance where you don't always know what to expect. It's imperative for your body and voice to be warmed up to deal with whatever comes your way, whether it be nerves, requests from the auditors, etc.   Yes, warm up. Be kind and gentle to your yourself, especially if your audition is early in the morning. Nobody likes to sing at 10 AM."

There are thousands of different guitars that a guitarist can play to get different sounds, but a singer only has one voice. Sure, they can play with dynamics/resonances to get different tonal qualities, but they're still limited in what their vocal cords and bodies can actually produce.   I would definitely go talk to a singing coach/instructor, first off. I would be honest with yourself and the coach - ""I'm a trans girl who wants to sing in a female range. Is it physically possible for me?"" Don't be surprised if the answer is no. If the coach believes that it's possible, then have them start working with you to develop that area of your voice.

singing,31cge7,xarahn,2,Fri Apr 3 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"It can be kind of ambiguous. Personally, my definition is when there stops being a clearly definable pitch. If someone can listen to you and find a pitch on the piano, it's not fry. But, I think this is a problematic definition, especially for low basses - the ""choral fry"" can be pretty ambiguous since it relies heavily on the overtones of the rest of the choir - you can still pick out what you think is a pitch because of this illusion, but if you listen by itself it's basically a fry. Similarly, you can ""tighten up"" a fry so that it sounds like a pitch but is anatomically produced like fry.   Long story short, I think it's much harder to define than falsetto so it makes sense that you're confused. :)"
singing,31cge7,keakealani,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, I can produce notes down to roughly F2 but they're kind of muddy. Sure you could pitch them with a piano or any instrument and say ""That's a F"", but I don't think you'd say ""You could definitely use this note live"".  I was wondering if there was somewhere we could draw the sharp line between chest and fry. Guess not."
singing,31cge7,enjarcher,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Fry can have a perfectly well defined note, though to actually sing in fry requires very fine breath control. It will just have a more 'crackly' timbre than a note in modal voice. As for where one register switches to another, there isn't a single point really.. fry and modal voice are connected pretty naturally if you don't let your voice get softer as you go down. Modal and falsetto can be connected too, if you use a breathy enough tone.  People often use controlled fry to extend their range downwards. It doesn't project too well, admittedly, but the lowest notes produced by the human voice have been produced using fry."
singing,31cge7,keakealani,-1,Fri Apr 3 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this also raises the point that it depends why you're defining something as a fry. If you want something performable, it matters less that it's a defined pitch, and more that it's loud enough/comes out clearly/sounds good.   But yeah, I think it's kind of ambiguous, especially if you've developed your fry - you can obscure a lot of that ""crackly"" noise /u/enjarcher is talking about if you know what you're doing, but it's still more or less a fry if it's muddy and unclear."

singing,31cge7,Mattpilf,0,Fri Apr 3 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"/u/Enjarcher  is right,  there's no clear pitch,  but there's obviously  a point where you can't hit without vocal fry.  Above that it's very easy to combine with vocal fry,  and so there's a clear mix going on.  That murmur and the throaty feeling of vocal fry is how you can tell. Super low notes,  like below C2 become very complicated  as they all kind of  take a murky and gravely tone,  even if it's modal voice. At F2, it's very easy for low voices to make clean notes though, tenors,  not so much. Normally when doing descending scales and keeping a clean tone, there's a sharp divide,  unless I face low notes and make bad sounds.   What are you trying to do with notes that are mixed with fry?"
singing,31cge7,enjarcher,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:30:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing, I was just trying to determine the low end of my range without including vocal fry into it :P  Starting at maybe A or B2 I can't produce a pure note, it gets this sort of ""rrr"" noise in it, and at around E2 it becomes impossible to tell I'm trying to make an E2."
singing,31cssg,Girlprep,2,Fri Apr 3 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, first of all, measuring your success in singing based on the size you range is WRONG. A certain amount of range growth can be seen in some singers as their technique improves, but it is certainly not a major goal of any reputable voice teacher nor is it a good measure of your actual technique.   Since you are a musician of other sorts, you should certainly expect to see the same changes in technique that you've seen in other instruments, and you should already know that these changes often only manifest themselves very subtly in actual performance, particularly in the earlier stages.   Ultimately, I would say the goal of singing should be to have good control over your voice throughout your entire range, a unified modal register, a pleasant range of timbres (and enough control over your voice that you can achieve a variety of colors), and enough stamina and endurance to take you through whatever singing context you're going for (surviving your way through a gig without experiencing damaging vocal fatigue).   So those are the things I would expect to improve with practice. (Which I think are, for the most part, the same for every other instrument if you change a few operative words).    Isnt the vocal range determined by muscles that doesnt change..?    As far as this... I mean, this is sort of kind of true but it's a bit of a misunderstanding. Different pitches are produced by changing the length and mass of the vocal folds as you phonate. Since the vocal folds are made of muscle (pretty much), yes, these muscles can only stretch and contract so much to provide the range of pitches they are capable of. (But other muscle groups need to help out to get the vocal folds into the right position for each pitch.) But to say that the muscles don't change would be incorrect - all muscles change. You can strengthen and stretch muscles in order to make different movements with more ease. These are very small muscles of the changes are fairly small, but it's no different than building other muscles except for the actual size of the changes."

singing,31cssg,mwb2,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:50:50 2015 UTC,"Isnt the vocal range determined by muscles that doesnt change..?    The amount of your potential vocal range that you can access is determined by muscular coordination. It is largely a precision skill, like archery or golfing, rather than a ""brute force"" skill. You get better by becoming more coordinated, not by changing the physical shape of anything."
singing,31cssg,xarahn,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:30:44 2015 UTC,Ok... Thats a satisfactory explanation... Thanks
singing,31cssg,enjarcher,-1,Sun Apr 5 06:03:32 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  I thought my highest note was F4 because I wasn't able to access head voice (which you seem to be able to since you get to B4). Even when I started understanding head voice, I couldn't go further than A4, then B4, then I finally hit C5 and now I can go up to E5 pretty nicely in a powerful and almost crystal clear sound.  Vocal range is NOT determined by muscles, otherwise as you trained those muscles your range would change, which isn't exactly true. Vocal range is most likely determined by the shape and size of your vocal folds, which are not muscles.  The muscles just help you project and use your voice properly, developping muscle memory on every single one of the notes in your range will make you more consistent as a singer and definitely more confident, too.  If you learn to better support your voice through proper breathing and regular exercices etc... notes you thought unattainable or only reachable through extreme strain may become effortless to sing.  Anyway, your range is beyond 2 octaves already which is pretty damn good for someone who barely had any training."

singing,31cssg,enjarcher,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"If you can properly use head voice and mix, you should be able to sing without strain, at any volume, in any part of your range. Note - don't confuse strain with tension - notes that are high and loud will require more support and effort, but will still be easy to reach. I.e. they shouldn't feel uncomfortable.  Some things to try: sirens (sliding up and down between your chest and head register without a break or change in tone), and transcending tone/messa di voce (starting very quietly on a note, smoothly increasing the volume to maximum, then smoothly back to quiet). Particularly in order to find the various parts of your head/mix voice, you should try singing a falsetto note and doing the transcending tone. Make them louder by making the sound brighter, not by pushing it."

There's also a wide variety of different effects if you want to do more than just mix your vocals. If you're familiar with guitar effect pedals, you can find vocal equivalents if that's what you're looking for. Also, you can use guitar pedals for vocals but they run a hotter signal and you'll get a lot of line noise (also, your sound guy will probably hate you.)

(True tenors, once trained, can often hit the famed 'high C' in chest). Most baritones top out their full chest voice at around G4. However these barriers are easily surpassed by learning to mix voices. As a baritone I've been able to extend my full voice (chesty-sounding) all the way up to D5 and sometimes higher depending on the day - as high as my falsetto. With proper technique you should eventually be able to sing in full voice as high as you can sing in falsetto right now :)"

singing,31bvss,ViktorClay,5,Fri Apr 3 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"There certainly is a limit to that flexibility, though we agree that it is very flexible. It's why Callas' and many other classical singer's careers are cut short. (Honestly, I don't think Anna Netrebko is going to last much longer either.) Consistent working against the natural flow of your voice in operatic singing (which is very highly demanding) will cause you more trouble than good in the long run. You don't hear big voices like Jonas Kaufmann or Linda Watson singing smaller-voiced flexible roles like Adele or Tamino because it doesn't suit them, and if they sang roles like that over a long period of time, it would cause damage.  I don't quite understand your point about Jussi - because he did only sing things that fit him, so he actually proves my point. In classical singing, if you're not a tenor, you won't be singing tenor repertoire. This isn't necessarily so true for other genres."

The reason why i think many strong classical females careers is Cut short is alot of them probably never train their groounded chest register. Is that what happened to Callas I dont know it's just something ive noticed alot among many Female singers, males usually get the oposite, everything is chest chest chest and then they run into trouble as they get older.  My point with Jussi his instrument was like any average joe's and still he was regarded as one of the best ( by some the best) tenor. Take any average Joe out in the street  even though he has the same instrument and train him he's not gonna get to that skill level, because it's hard shit.

It had nothing to do with not having a chest register, it was about singing things that were too large for her voice - she was singing things outside of her fach.  Yes - anyone can learn to sing operatically. We definitely agree there. But Jussi sang within his voice type - which is why he was successful. This is where we disagree.  The fact that you find singing to be unnatural is something I can't agree with whatsoever. So, we're just not even on the same page."

Here's something I recorded today, I'd love to have some feedback, and any song suggestions that fit my voice would be awesome!   I'm aware of an issue that occurs when I sing this song, but I'm not sure how to fix it. My volume goes up during certain parts of certain words, and it sounds off. Will consciously trying to control it help over time or is there a specific thing I'm doing wrong?   Edit: Vocaroo mirror"

Make sure to work on your breathing. If you have enough breath at the end of a phrase, you will be more apt to put the power behind the note, sustaining its correct pitch. Standing up straight while recording also helps.  Also, open your mouth more. Rounder vowels warms the tone.   Hope that helps some!  If you get a chance, I posted my own vid in this thread for a critique and I'd love to get some back. Thanks. :)"

singing,319561,birdizdaword,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"Well technique-wise, I think it would help to almost do pulses with your diaphragm when you're jumping around so much. You should feel your stomach kinda bounce with each note. That should help your support to be more effective. Also, familiarity is important. Not saying that you don't know the notes (you obviously do), but knowing exactly where to put your next note and falling right onto it is something that comes with tons and tons of practice. And lastly, hold that last note! That's where you give your listener their final impression of the piece. I hope this helps!"

I don't know specifically what I should be working on besides say, my head voice, which is a chord I just have to keep stretching my voice up to. Now that I think about it, I suppose I first have to decide what style of singing I want to achieve.   I'm a big fan of indie pop in general, but think my voice is far too nasal for it. Are there ways to work on perhaps clearing my voice out? Or am I stuck with it?"

I am not quite good enough to give a good set of feedback, but I feel like 75% of the time you sound like a great singer. The other 25% is minor, but you drift out of pitch just ever so slightly. It could be the allergies.  Keep with it. The vibrato sounded lovely. I would say that the other thing I would want to hear is a bit more passion. Like actors, singers have to really over-act to get across a feeling to a listener. I remember doing some of my lessons and the teacher would always say ""more energy!"" and I was like what? That was so energetic! But I listen back and she was right. Just something to think about.   All that being said, if you sang in front of friends or other people I think a lot would be impressed.

The screen is probably making the song robotic because it gives cues as to when you sing and when you dont. I think it is not doing you any favors. You should set the pace yourself. Maybe you will choose to make it more dynamic by singing verse one a bit softer, or differently somehow, from the chorus. This way the chorus pops out more and gives the listener something new to hear."

Be warned it will be abrasive so you may want to start with the volume down. I'm well aware this is not a great performance, and you'll definitely hear specific parts I grit my teeth listening to, but I didn't re-take cause I wanted an accurate representation of my ""typical"" singing.

singing,319561,ghoti023,2,Sun Apr 5 22:37:41 2015 UTC,I would practice singing on lip trills. The pitchiness happens because your breath stops flowing as freely as it should.

Any critique is welcome, be honest please!"
singing,319561,birdizdaword,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:12:26 2015 UTC,"To be entirely honest with you, the breathiness of your head voice will go away with age and practice. Since you're only 16, your voice has another 10 years of puberty to deal with.  Have you looked into dabbling classical singing? Not because I think it'd be your passion, but because classical singing is strongly rooted in the head voice, and can teach you a lot of tricks that are then easily modified to other genres. Most pop/rock music focuses on the chest register, so it can be difficult maneuvering to head when you never spend any time up there. Classical helps build that head voice, but in a healthy way (if taught right anyway). Even if you just join choir, I think you could find some improvement.  ""Get a teacher/join a choir"" suggestion aside, your head voice will improve if you continue polishing your breath technique. Pop/rock music has a tendency to stop airflow in the throat in order to get a belty/yell sound. While that is one way to create such a sound, I'd encourage you to see what happens if you have some follow-through with your breath, not unlike a follow-through in pitching a baseball/throwing a football/shooting a basketball."
singing,319561,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:51:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've been working on my head voice for a while, and I'm definitely gonna keep practicing. All advice aside, how did I sound? I know I sound breathy to an extent but how bad was it?"

Because my choral director seems to think I'm a Baritone because of how low I can go and that I never really get a chance to demonstrate my higher notes in the songs we sing, but I think I lean more towards being a tenor. Based on this what do you think?"
singing,319561,ghoti023,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"Choral singing and pop singing are two different skill sets. A baritone with a high end can sing tenor pop songs no problem. Voice types in terms of pop music are a lot less important, and a lot more flexible.  Plus, you're 16, so any voice type you are now is probably not what you're going to be later. Chorally, you very well may be a baritone. I don't know, I haven't heard your classical technique.  Have you tried singing the choral tenor stuff on your own time and seeing how that feels?  She also may just have you as a baritone in choir because she needs baritones, and you can sing baritone. I sing alto in choirs, but I'm a soprano. I wouldn't take that too seriously whatsoever."
singing,319561,klondikebargirl,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"All right thanks! Just to clarify, I do sing tenor in the chorus because we need tenors and even though she doesn't know I can sing above an A, she put me in the tenor section (even though I started as a baritone). I think maybe it's because she doesn't count our head voice because no one in the chorus is really trained to sing in it correctly and there's too many of us to teach.   Also, why is it that it seems to me that it's easier to sing pop songs with high notes than it is to sing choral songs with them? On the rare occasion that we do have a note above an A, it sounds weirder than it does when I sing the same note in a pop song. Could it be because I'm singing with a large group so the sound I hear of myself gets distorted or is there a real reason for this?"
singing,319561,ghoti023,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:36:08 2015 UTC,"Classical singing takes a lot more breath work than pop. You're not crazy, it is harder. It takes more work to have a more open sound. Pop music is generally more closed off, sung in reinforced falsetto (often times), and doesn't need to be as loud because it uses amplification. It's just not so with classical."

If you try to use the same resonance spaces/internal feelings that you have on the high g on the low g, you'll have a much smoother leap.  Then, when you start on the low g, have the space ready for the high g while you're singing the low. The leap will be a lot easier the fewer things you have to modify mid leap."

singing,3193h7,IAmAustinPowersAMA,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"The process is still the same, though - jumping large intervals requires connecting the resonance space as much as possible, so less adjustment has to take place as you're doing the jump."

singing,3193h7,keakealani,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:39:20 2015 UTC,"Try singing down the ninth, to F#, and then resolving the leading tone. For one, it forces you to jump more than you think you need to (which is definitely an issue for large leaps), and it also grounds you in some harmonic context.   Also, try starting with an intermediary jump before doing the full octave. Maybe a descending major arpeggio, or maybe just the fifth. This can give you a sense of the shift more gradually, and then you can take out the middle notes.   And of course, support. It's easy to let your support go for a lower note because it's easier to sing, but try to keep your body in the same supported configuration you use for the high note, even for the lower one. This can also help you maintain balanced registration if that's an issue for you."

I'd obviously bring my own music and music stand and things like that, but weddings/events are usually in two situations: Indoors somewhere that has an existing sound system or outdoors where that stuff is going to get rented anyway. I mean, if they're going to already have mics for the emcee/officiant/etc., they should provide mics for the musicians too if they expect it.

(why the hell does the microphone not come USB ready, I mean come on. WHY!!!)   Because mics aren't always just plugged straight into a computer, and in fact it's kind of rarely done with the SM57.  It would be wasteful and needlessly expensive to have every SM57 come with its own built-in USB interface.  For simple recording a USB mic like the ones from Blue might just be easier."
singing,3189wu,maestro2005,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"An audio interface is the perfect thing for recording vocals to a computer. Will act basically as an external sound card. Completely removes latencey issues, will include headphone monitoring and will sound much better than a usb mic. Plug the mic via Jack or XLR and then it's own Usb into your computer. Google search some products and shop around for a good price! Alesis Core1 for £39.99 seems to be the cheapest and looks great for single track vocals."
singing,3189wu,Sedgers12345,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:20:04 2015 UTC,Completely removes latencey issues   That's not true. Any time you convert analog to digital you introduce latency.
singing,3189wu,brute-squad,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"Input signal is split. One goes through the Audio Interface to be converted to digital, then to the DAW. Other is played back through headphones. You can mix the levels between playback and and input."
singing,3189wu,Sedgers12345,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:06:05 2015 UTC,My understanding is that the audio is converted to digital before its split. Still not completely removing latency.
singing,3189wu,brute-squad,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:06:14 2015 UTC,Input latency is removed as the input signal when monitoring is not being converted to digital. Do you have one of these?
singing,3189wu,Sedgers12345,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:11:34 2015 UTC,An audio interface? I've owned a couple. Is there a specific one you're referring to?
singing,3189wu,brute-squad,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"Per my understanding:  The x2u-XLR is essentially an external, high-quality, well shielded sound card.   It turns the analog microphone input into very high quality digital input.    You could buy an XLR to 1/4 inch cable, attach a 1/4 to 1/8 converter on it, and plug it into the analog mic slot on your PC's built in sound card (Most motherboards have a built in sound card. Do you have a pink 1/8 jack on the back of your computer?).  This would probably cost you about 10/15$, but the conversion from analog to digital will take place in an environment full of electronic interference, and on probably lower quality components.  I do not know how big the difference would be between the two options. I imagine you would be able to notice if you have a trained ear and/or were really concentrating on listening to the recording.  The only thing I can say for certain is that you would not need to buy a sound card to work with the X2u.  The microphone's signal undergoes ADC (Analog to digital conversion) within the X2u."
singing,3188ex,SupaSplendid,2,Thu Apr 2 19:54:29 2015 UTC,The way my chorus teacher told me to breath when I was just learning is to fill your stomach with air rather than your chest. From what I understand it does help with taking your voice out of your throat.
singing,3188ex,Thatscuzuralesbian,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:51:44 2015 UTC,Well that's what I have been doing but she told me I need to breath deeper to the point where it is in my pelvic floor
singing,3188ex,Fallbourn,2,Fri Apr 3 05:20:22 2015 UTC,"Would not listen to the cigarette guy, as cigarettes are terrible for your health, vocally and otherwise. While it may SHOW proper technique, it's not something I would recommend to anyone...  The ""proper"" technique can be gotten with a little bit of practice. The main pillars that I was taught are:     1) ""Superman"" your chest. You don't want to overdo it. Just keep your chest high and don't strain your shoulders.     2) Keep your neck/head high. If you put the back of your feet and your butt against a wall, you want the back of your head against the wall too. The goal is to get the head to sit straight on top of the spine.     3) Breathe from your diaphragm/pelvic floor. To teach this, my instructor had me rest my thumb over my bellybutton and drape my fingers downwards over my lower stomach. If you're feeling lots of movement under there, you're good.     Your instructor wants you to engage your pelvic floor muscles. If you're a guy, next time you use the bathroom, try to stop the stream. (Can't speak for girls.) The muscles you're engaging to do this are your pelvic floor muscles. When you stop your stream, you're tightening the muscles. When you're breathing to sing, you want them to stretch. It will feel like they're not really moving as much as you think they should. In this case, any muscle action down there (that's not ""flexing"" like I described earlier), should be good.  Hope some of that helps."
singing,3188ex,Fallbourn,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:56:46 2015 UTC,Actually this is really helpful  The third point is what I needed mostly. and I am a guy. I stopped the stream actually I tried that online and I got that muscle engagement I know what it is now I can identify it and mimic it the issue is how do I get my breath to go into those muscles? Does that make sense?
singing,3188ex,daturapiss,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"It's hard to kind of put into words, as it's more of a feeling inside your body. Might want to try the technique in my 3rd point. Like I said, low belly movement coupled with a slight stretch in the pelvic floor means you're doing it right. If you feel only a little stretch, you're still probably doing it right."
singing,312usi,CatsForLashes,4,Wed Apr 1 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Depends where you got the instrumental and how the instrumental was made. Some instrumentals are simply just the middle channel taken out which affects the song quite a lot fundamentally.  Another reason could be how the original vocals were doubled up, harmonized, mixed, and mastered to the track.  When I do most of my vocal covers on instrumentals I often re-master the tracks otherwise my vocals sound completely out of place because well, they are, contextually.   But all of that stuff is an art form in itself."
singing,312usi,Pray4Plagues,4,Thu Apr 2 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"My guess is that you're a little out of tune and that you need more air support.  But I can't access the recording, so that's just my guess."
singing,312usi,xiipaoc,3,Thu Apr 2 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Get a teacher if you can, and practice more. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with your voice that proper practice can not address.  Things like sloppy timing are not as noticeable solo, but will show up a lot more clearly when singing over a track.  Also, if the quality and processing of your vocals do not match the backing tracks, it will show up as sounding odd due to the mismatch of quality. So, you could be blaming your voice when it is really the production that is a big part of the problem.  And, finally, making your voice fit into a track is a skill in itself that needs to be developed. But, sometimes getting too hung up on sounding good can be a hinderance. Many of my best vocals takes have happened in joke tracks where I was trying to sound 'stupid'. And instead I am like, ""whoa, I didn't know I could sound that good. Who is that really?"" So, don't be afraid to experiment and try lots of wacky stuff. (as long as it is not so wacky that it hurts).  Go on youtube and search for 'some song name karaoke' and trying all sorts of different songs. rap, metal, hiphop, musicals, jazz, rock, etc. You will start to figure out songs that you currently have some idea how to sing, and ones that you don't really have an idea for yet. Also, you will find that even for the same song, the quality of the karaoke track has a huge impact on how fun it is to sing -- even though it is the exact same song. Try to come up with a character for each track. For example, if you are going to sing a metallica song, end every phrase with ""-ya"". Sing some elvis presley songs with your best elvis impersionation or some garth brooks, sing like a musical theater major, etc.  I'm not suggestion that you aim to be a copy of some existing singer -- but rather that you should have fun make all sorts of mouth shapes you wouldn't normally try until you have enough experience that you can really develop your own style.  A good teacher is invaluable as they will be able to identify problems that may take you years to unlock yourself. Additionally, they can identify improper techniques which can be very damaging to your voice  While opera and (healthy) rock vocals may sounds worlds apart, the fundamentals of breath control, support, formants, etc, are the same. But within the parameters of proper technique there is still a huge amount of room for personal taste and style. And while some aspects of your voice have been fixed by genetics, there is still tons of potential which remains available to be unlocked.  And, lastly, don't expect to get great fast! To sing well you need to develop a large number of muscles. You wouldn't expect to go from wimp to mr. universe overnight, and the same is true of voice. A scrawny weakling that goes to the gym regularly, lifts with proper technique, and eats properly will bulk up. It's just a matter of putting in the time. The same is true of voice."

I've had the same problem as you, the answer comes down to two things. The MOST important thing is your singing, I would highly recommend getting lessons. Even if your hitting the notes, your tone could be unflattering. The second thing is mixing, a dry vocal over an instrumental doesn't sound good. There's plenty of tutorials out there on how to mix a vocal track. I went to school for music production and still couldn't get my vocals to sound good until recently, and that's because of my lessons. You can't polish a turd, even with auto-tune and effects. That being said, I haven't listened to your track because it wouldn't load so I can't give you a solid answer."

singing,312usi,Akoustyk,3,Wed Apr 1 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"Have you ever listened to song stems, or just isolated vocals tracks of established artists? Some of them do sound fantastic, even without accompaniment. But some sound quite weird on their own.  And by doing this, you can also get a sense of the kind of effects people use on vocal tracks. Some type of echo / reverb is the most basic, and practically ubiquitous.   Also, production / mixing is an art. One that has to be learned. If a beginner threw a raw vocal track over an instrumental and it sounded amazing the first try, I'd be very surprised."

singing,30zi2c,keakealani,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"To answer your question more generally, you should bring a piano reduction to your audition if you expect a pianist there to play it (you're not really clear about whether this piano/conductor score is reduced). You should never bring an open score to an audition unless told otherwise.   Also for future reference, musicnotes.com is a great place to find scores for many pieces at a pretty inexpensive rate. You can also look in your local library and/or school libraries for scores. It looks like you're covered now but these are some good tools to think about for the future :)  Good luck on your audition!"

singing,30x5ab,joej15,5,Tue Mar 31 12:52:15 2015 UTC,"When I'm singing in the same note as some of the other singers, my voice sounds much higher.   This is normal, and depends on the timbre or quality of your voice.  There are some singers who will sing a certain note lightly in their head voice and it will sound like a really high note.  But then another singer comes along and sings that exact same note in a big open chest voice and all of the sudden it sounds like it's not so high.  But if it is just your ""effort"" or ""squeekiness"" that is making the note sound like it's  a high note, then practice and training can help that.   Is it possible to improve voice ""quality"" (is this called tone?) [....] For example, if two people are singing with correct technique at the same note, what is it that makes one sound better than the other? Is this something that can be learned?   Absolutely.  Totally.  Without a doubt.  ""Sound better"" is of course subjective, but lessons will teach you how different things you do affect the tone you produce.  They will also ""work out"" various muscles and mechanics that cause these changes, and give you more conscious control of them.  Lessons will also ""train away"" whatever bad habits or body mechanics that you might have unknowingly developed that are keeping your voice from sounding it's best.  It sounds like lessons are definitely the way to go for you.  They will maximize whatever potential you have in your voice, and give you the control and .. (crucially) .. give you the confidence needed to produce a good, nice to listen to, sound."
singing,30x5ab,Tychonaut,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. It's reassuring to know you can be singing ""higher"" in the same key. I think it is just my effort hitting some of the high notes, which doesn't sound awful for hitting a one off note,  but for sustained high singing that my genre requires it just sounds squeaky.  I definitely want lessons at some point. My initial plan was to do what I could online to pick up the basics and then move on to lessons. Is this realistic or would I be better just going for lessons? Confidence is definitely an issue so that would be another positive."
singing,30x5ab,Tychonaut,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"You could always start that way.  No harm.  But the trick is that you always sound different to yourself than you do ""from outside"".  It's really common, especially if you are going for a more hard rock or metal ""wailing"" kind of thing, to be doing things with your body, tension-wise, that are getting in your way.  So in that respect, having a coach can really help.  There are vocal teachers that specialize in that kind of stuff too .. so maybe look for someone like that.  There are online guys who specialize in that material as well, who do live lessons via Skype, so that could be an option for you as well.  But IMO at the very least, even if you start off on your own, record yourself all the time.  Become comfortable with listening to your voice as an observer.  And if you are going for the high material, don't be afraid to do silly stuff and sound weird in the interest of becoming comfortable moving around in a certain range.  It's just like athletes, who do all kinds of silly drills involving stuff that they would never actually do when they are playing, but that gets them exercising muscles and movements that don't get targeted if they were just practicing by ""playing the game"" naturally over and over.  When I was in my rock phase I did all kinds of squeals and screeches that sounded terrible, and I did that consciously (really helps if you are sure nobody else can hear you!), but they kind of opened up certain areas and sounds for me.  Like .. if you are trying to sing ""orange"", sometimes you go for ""red"" and sometimes you go for ""yellow"" .. and then slowly ""orange"" gets more and more in you comfort zone, instead of just trying to sing ""orange"" all the time.  If that makes any sense at all. :)"

Still, I really wanted to at least learn to sing better, so I set out to do so.  What I did was simply sing with a guitar every night. I did cover songs of all kinds - even some that didn't fit me so well. I tried to find songs that had lyrics that really resonated with me. I spent about 1 to 3 hours every night singing with guitar and microphone.   I noticed improvement every month and eventually became a better singer than I ever thought I could be. Surprisingly so. My range expanded, my voice started to oscillate, and I even got to the point where I could hit occasional falsettos.   In the end, it just takes time and practice - regular practice.

singing,30wk2p,Okulay,2,Tue Mar 31 07:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but the general rule for stuff like this is vocal rest. Sounds like something in your neck was overexerted. Try to stretch your neck muscles out, and give your voice a rest for a few days. Should find you'll be better relatively soon."
singing,30wars,hctiwsblade13,3,Tue Mar 31 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think it would be worth your time to develop a workable straight tone. As a tenor, you should have full control over a D natty.   I think a lot of this has to do with what you like your voice to sound like. You've got to trust that these kinds of sounds are going to sound ugly to your ear at first, probably for a few weeks. If you try to belt more, you'll get more comfortable, and you'll feel the space you in order to belt. I do think you need to develop a straight tone. You may lose roles because you don't have this skill. Spring Awakening explicitly said ""do no use vibrato"" in their audition information. Other shows might not say it, but it might still be desired. At the very least, the ""musical theater vibrato"" practice of starting straight tone and moving to vibrato 2/3s of the way through the note is valuable, even in more traditional musical theater.  On the other hand, specializing isn't terrible. If you're getting work now and you don't feel the need to sing more contemporary work, don't worry about it. I do think you're going to miss some contracts. That's a price you are paying right now."
singing,30wars,elerico,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, youze right. I should man up and just work on it.  Just to clarify, it's not that I don't belt or that a D is in any way too high for me. In some ways straight tone is easier for me the higher I go. What's annoying me is that on what should be a super easy note for me to sustain, the pitch quavers a bit, or I just really suck at smacking right on the center of the pitch.   Any tips?"
singing,30wars,DerpTheGinger,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:51:37 2015 UTC,"There's the standard relax the throat, lift the soft pallette, drp the draw stuff, but I suspect you already at least kind of know that.  The key is to do it when you BREATHE - if you do it when you're singing, it's too late.   Make sure all of your energy/power is getting pushed from your abdomen - your abs should definitely feel engaged.  And don't forget, just because it's a sustain/belt, doesn't mean it shouldn't go anywhere - unless it feels very wrong for the song, you should usually crescendo through the note at least somewhat."
singing,30wars,keakealani,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:47:13 2015 UTC,"I was actually just discussing straight tone today, although in the context of choral music and not musical theatre. But I think my opinion is pretty similar.   Even though it sounds silly, I think straight tone and senza vibrato don't actually mean the same thing. I likened it to hair textures - my hair is stick straight, won't hold a curl, you could use it as a ruler. That's senza vibrato. Not even a little tiny bit of spin. My husband's hair is a lightly wavy/curly texture. Not full blown ringlets, but it'll make a single ring when it's in a ponytail. That's straight tone. Mostly straight, but has a little texture. Shirley Temple curls is full vibrato (and I suppose you could get more specific but I won't).   In this case, I think for most scenarios, the wavy idea (especially, as /u/elerico pointed out, stylistically adding a little more vibrato in the end of a long note) is just fine. It's straight enough to allow you to add character and give it that classic musical theatre tone quality, but it's not so straight that it lacks color or sounds tense.   All that being said, yeah, you should be able to do straight tone reasonably healthy if you expect to be a well-rounded MT singer. You don't have to make it your mainstay, and you can definitely play around with it to see how straight you need to be to sound best for your own voice, but I think not being able to straighten at will (to some extent) is also a sign that you don't necessarily have as much control over your voice as you should. Particularly since I'm assuming you mean D4, which shouldn't actually be difficult for a tenor."
singing,30sumn,Fallbourn,4,Mon Mar 30 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"The key to developing an ideal tone, which has depth and roundness and also a clear-ringing resonance, is breath control. Many singers breath shallow, only using the muscles of the shoulders, ribs, and mid-abdomen. True breath is controlled in the pelvis, by the deep core muscles. You need to find a teacher to demonstrate this concept, as it is very easy to waste time practicing inefficient techniques. Since a fully-""supported"" sound penetrates in all directions, I do not think that your cleft palate is the cause of your muddy tone."
singing,30sumn,Deepblueish,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"I've worked with my teacher on breath support before, and I have a pretty good idea of what you're talking about. However, I'm not sure how ""athletic"" this breathing should be. What happens currently is that my lower abs (and the area just above my pelvis) are pushing outward and are activated/tight. This outward push continues up to my diaphragm, and around to my back/sides slightly. Is this correct?"
singing,30sumn,Deepblueish,2,Mon Mar 30 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"This is basically correct, with two important points. One, the feeling of muscular effort is brought on by the ""weightiness"" of the exhale. Think about a big sigh, and how it courses down the body, through the pelvis and legs towards the floor. This insures that breath support is as low as it can be in the core, and is not just a lateral activation of the abs. Two, all activated muscles are released COMPLETELY at the inception of the new inhale. This insures that tension is not carried over from one phrase to the next, and invites a full, oasis-like breath into the body, which feels deceptively small and underengaged. It is critical not to over pressurize your inbreath by tightening muscles. The feeling of effort only comes into play at the turning of inhale to exhale, but again, like a sigh (down), not a squeeze (in). Have fun practicing!"
singing,30sumn,hookandpush,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! Thanks a bunch. Was definitely trying too hard on the inhales, but I think I have a good idea of it now."
singing,30sumn,elerico,4,Tue Mar 31 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"If you are singing with an ""open"" voice, as you say, then the main issues that need to be addressed in order to have a clear tone are phonation and vowel tuning.  Breathy phonation greatly inhibits a clear tone. Great ways to teach yourself to have more efficient phonation include lip buzzes, tongue trills, singing on voiced fricatives like [v] or [z], starting vocalises with voiced consonants, and vocalizing through a straw.  When singing in the Classical style, there is a definite tendency to overdarken the vowels, which makes them sound muddy. Singing with brighter, or at least more balanced, vowels will also make the tone clearer. In addition, clarity of the vowels will help with the clarity of the tone. Singing [a] when you're supposed to be singing [a] instead of ""uh"" makes a huge difference."

singing,30t918,purple-pumpkin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:30:18 2015 UTC,"MIDI octaves are numbered differently to piano octaves, and how they're numbered varies with the MIDI device / software. The MIDI specification says that middle C should be called C5 (whereas on a piano it's called C4), but if your particular software decides that it doesn't want to bother going below MIDI C2 (piano C1, the lowest C on a piano), because that's ridiculously low for any piece of music, then it may just subtract 2 from every octave number, so middle C will be called C3, and the note you were singing (piano C3) will be called C2. Basically, don't trust MIDI stuff."

I'm saying that based on the vowel distortion and tendency to sound a bit like the Swedish Chef.  Also I don't know if there's  any mixing.  There's clearly some shouting on the higher,  indicating at least some none mixing at the high notes.   Perhaps you are pushing your larynx down with your tongue and your tongue is too far back.

singing,30sd6q,P_as_a_Variable,9,Mon Mar 30 08:21:15 2015 UTC,Probably not the best idea. Can the band perform it at a lower key for you?
singing,30sd6q,sabbathan1,4,Mon Mar 30 09:21:02 2015 UTC,this is the way to go--many bands tune their instruments down a half step or a step from the recording to make sure the vocalist can hit the note live.
singing,30sd6q,MattTheGeek,2,Mon Mar 30 11:33:03 2015 UTC,"Well that's one way to do it but sometimes a half or whole step down isn't enough. If you've got to take a song down a major third or a fourth, say from E-C or to B, then tuning down without replacing strings is going to leave you with very slack, flabby and poorly intonated strings. In cases like this it's generally better to rely on transposing into a different key altogether, and keep the guitars in standard tuning."
singing,30sd6q,davef,5,Mon Mar 30 13:05:18 2015 UTC,"OP stated she (I assume ""she"") could hit the notes, so obviously changing the key by more than that would be silly.  Also, many songs, especially songs that are iconic, would sound very strange, and/or are difficult to impossible to play on the guitar in anything but the original key--and this song is definitely one of them--you could maybe go from E to an A, play everything a string up, but as soon as the guitarist gets to the chime after the main riff, they are out of luck--those only work in certain positions.    So, sure, changing the key entirely for some songs is the way to go (I do it all the time in my role as worship leader at my church) but in this case, with the information the OP has given, would not work.    Also, the bassist and guitarist should have a back up guitar anyhow if they are gigging, so just keep one a tuned down a half or whole--that's how we do it."

People are used to hearing it in a certain key, and even non-musicians will notice that something sounds off. It's a hard song to sing, but in my experience, it does get easier.  If you can hit the note after some good warm-up, give it a shot and keep practicing.  But if it's still not comfortable, I'd give it a pass.  There are probably other Heart songs you could cover that aren't quite so rangy.

However, C2 sounds at about 65 Hz, which is getting to the point where the ear can detect the individual granulation of the tone, so there's a hard limit to how smooth it can sound."
singing,30rz2l,dekigo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, any low bass can produce a smooth and woofy C2 but it doesn't sound good in a choir or ensemble or even solo, in general you want to make low notes sound as bright and clear as possible, not smooth like high notes, that mixes better in a choir and will sound more clear in solo singing."
singing,30rz2l,thogvojdom,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"no. at some point the voice has to use the vocal fry function. The muscles for normal low notes can only extend so low, then the vocal fry kicks in. The important thing for those low notes, is to maintain a sound wave that's still recognizable as a note.  a contrabass can say that it's not fry, but to them, fry occurs in a normal range."
singing,30pvkl,freedomfan,26,Sun Mar 29 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"I really, really, really don't understand why people think range is some sort of metric for how good of a singer you are. It's literally a penis-measuring contest, and it's literally about ""how well you can use it"". Having a big dick or a big range changes very little about your actual skill.   That being said, to a certain extent, range issues are about breath support so it would probably benefit you to work more on breath support. In the higher end especially, you may also want to think about registration - a lot of guys think they can't sing as high as they actually can because they don't know how to properly adjust for a lighter (head voice) sound.   Also, age might be a factor here, since if your voice hasn't fully developed that can contribute to range fluctuations.   But yeah, I think it's just about the stupidest thing to worry about range as opposed to actual technique and sound. I can't think of a single situation where people would rather hear someone sing terribly with a humongous range, than sing well with a limited range. (And I also wouldn't call two octaves limited)."
singing,30pvkl,keakealani,3,Sun Mar 29 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Right on all accounts.   I really want to stress what /u/keakealani said about head voice. So many guys have NO CLUE how to use it, and I swear it increases your range by leaps and bounds, not that that's even what's important for singing."
singing,30pvkl,YourFavoriteBaritone,9,Mon Mar 30 00:12:58 2015 UTC,"Plenty of very famous singers only sang about 2 octaves, some even less. Seriously, it's how you use the range, not what is the range, Also  if you are under 25 or have only singing for few years, yeah, your range is probably not at it's peak yet. Also stop complaining about being a baritone. Yeah your voice isn't in the extreme in ranges, but that doesn't mean it can't be special, unique, exciting or beautiful."

It seems like you have almost no access  to your head voice,  which is limiting  your range.  Do you have a voice teacher you see semi regularly? If no,  you have zero right to complain about having a limited range,  because it can be that important  for learning head voice. Second if F4 is the last note you can hit without turning going into falsetto,  or tensing up,  you might even be a low/dramatic tenor.  Pretty much everyone can sing in their head voice,  barring extreme damage to the cords."

singing,30pvkl,The_Ebb_and_Flow,7,Mon Mar 30 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"Two words: head voice.  Try singing in your falsetto (the light, airy, hooty voice you can use to imitate a woman). Although not the tone you're going for, it will go a fair bit higher than the top of your chest range. When you find your head voice and mix it into chest, you should eventually be able to sing all those falsetto notes in full voice.  In order to find your head voice, first sing in a very forward, nasally tone (exercises for finding this tone include quacking like a duck, making a crying noise, or just singing 'eh' as bright and as obnoxiously as you can manage). Once you have that, start on a comfortable note in your chest voice and slide upwards, not reaching or pushing as you go higher but instead letting the bright, nasally tone carry the voice upwards. You will want to use a lot of breath support and volume, at least initially. As the pitch ascends you should not feel yourself straining or reaching upwards but instead feeling the resonance of your voice gradually move from your chest into your mouth and face and finally your head.  With this you should be able to get several notes higher than you could before. However it's not as simple as then going straight to songs to use these new notes. You first need to get comfortable with doing the sliding exercise on various vowels, then eventually consonants (they can be particularly tricky to add in when you're starting out).  Throughout this, you'll need plenty of breath support and maintain an open throat. The notes themselves shouldn't take too long to get; actually using them in songs will take somewhat longer, since the consonants are tricky in that range. Just keep practicing and with any luck you should be able to whack a half-octave or possibly even more onto the top of your range."

He had a great voice teacher show him the proper things he needed to do. If you are serious about expanding your range get a singing teacher and you will be amazed how things progress.   and one more thing... fuck labels man. Unless you're going to go do opera don't worry about what your voice is labeled. I know plenty of baritones who can sing with the tenors.

Each voice is unique and can sound pleasant in its own right. Learn to use what you've got, and as your technique improves, your range might grow with it. If not, at least you'll become an awesome-sounding baritone.  Personally, I love listening to lower voices, but I'm not really upset that my range doesn't extend that low. I just use what my body developed and learned to appreciate what other people's developed."

What experience do you have/how many years have you studied voice? What is your experience with each of these genres?  That being said, I can comment a bit on the classical side. I would strongly recommend singing any classical repertoire in the original language unless there is a strong musicological reason for singing in an alternate language (such as some Handel being written both in German and Italian). This is pretty non-negotiable in the classical world, and I think in most contexts an audition would not be taken seriously in translation."

Also, how are you training this? I would recommend applying the basic rules of voice leading here, rather than trying to pick out parts at random. For example, play a normal iii-vi-IV-V7-I type progression and practice singing the bass line.   In addition, be very secure in how you sing intervals - if you're working in the Western paradigm, I would focus specifically on fourths and fifths since those are the primary intervals by which bass lines move in standard progressions.   As far as improvising and singing harmonies, again, be very secure in your knowledge of standard progressions and be able to detect voice leading (particularly leading tones and auxiliary chromatic neighbors). Mostly everything else will fall into place once you can get those goalposts down.   I don't know that I can help you on this specific issue, though. It sounds like you just need to focus more on training your ears to hear the low end of harmonies. That's just a practice thing."

singing,30ojmp,Nebuchadnezzar-II,7,Sun Mar 29 09:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I've told you this before, but maybe repetition will drill it... the fach system only applies to classically trained voices. As far as I'm aware, you do not have substantial classical training (I'm talking probably 5+ years of dedicated lessons - I've been taking classical-oriented lessons for about 6 years formally and am just now dabbling in trying to figure out my fach, if that's any guideline), so it's literally impossible to determine your fach without that background.   This is why you're confused about things like timbre, weight, etc. - these things are all described in the fach system when assuming a classical (indeed, opera) trained voice, because this style emphasizes specific characteristics in the way the voice works. You can change your voice to sound like any range of different fachs - in fact, I know people who have done this because they were classified too early, taking an extremely experienced teacher to step back and really figure out what's going on. Even classical singers mess up with this all the time.   And all that being said, yes, the ranges are very ""average"". Another way you could look at it is that those ranges are the ""safe"" ranges for operatic writers. As /u/Mattpilf points out, opera singers can only claim to use notes that will at least sort of carry in a big hall without amplification. Similarly, a composer is most likely to write notes that they think a large majority of tenors (or whatever) can sing in this context. Lots of tenors can sing higher than tenor C and lower than bass clef C, but not always consistently and not always in a way that carries without amplification. Unless the composer is writing for a particular singer that has a different range, these are the guidelines they'll follow.   And yes, these ranges are fudge-ier when you think about the different sub-classifications because those sub-classifications are often (not always) associated with a different tessitura. But yeah, light doesn't necessarily mean high and dramatic doesn't necessarily mean low - it's a generalization based on the other factors used to determine these sub-classifications.   For the record, while I can't comment at all about tenors, I can comment and say that I would consider a C6 to be within my tessitura as a soprano - I do sit on the higher side but C is not at all uncomfortable or difficult for me once I've warmed up sufficiently. So I'm guessing yes, there are probably tenors that have a C5 in their tessitura."
singing,30ojmp,keakealani,4,Sun Mar 29 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yes operatic range is not total range.  Opera singers have to fill a house with their sound and can all sing below those listed ranges,  often by a fourth or so,  but can vary widely. Tessitura  is hard to compare outside of classical singing,  because a pop singers tessitura  with a microphone might be very different  than an opera singer.    The one thing that won't change much is the passaggio,  although poor technique  can cause some confusion,  overall it's fairly stable if your second passaggio is G4, then yes you are a average tenor, which outside of Opera,  and given your age,  and especially without a recording is all one can say (assuming that is your passaggio).   Your face,  as determined by your tessitura,  agility,  stamina, proper vocal weight,  timbre,  passaggio,  range  and such all require years of training within the classical context.  Terms like Verdi Baritone,  heldontenor,  and such don't really  mean anything outside of Opera,  and they have use because of how much opera singers push themselves. Knowing you are a tenor can give you an idea of where you voice might be able to be,  but within the context of non classical music,  more specifics fach like dramatic,  lyric  and such don't mean much.  Flexibility,  stamina,  and a more mature timbre will all come with time, don't be so eager to pigeonhole  your voice yet."
singing,30ojmp,Mattpilf,0,Sun Mar 29 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks, I sadly love classifying things :/  Just to make sure, is the second passagio the first note of head voice, or the last note of mixed voice?

singing,30m8jj,singing_ta,6,Sat Mar 28 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"1) This FAQ article is really meant to address this issue. You need to be comfortable not only with pitch matching, but relative pitch via intervals and tonal center, before you can comfortably sing a piece by itself. I think this is absolutely a requisite skill before moving on too much, so I would really recommend stepping back and developing this skill.   2) I really don't think this is a particularly good method of practicing. The main reason is because it can easily reinforce mistakes - by not noticing and correcting mistakes immediately (waiting until you listen back for pitch matching), you are effectively already drilling them into muscle memory. It's WAY harder to fix a mistake than it is to just avoid it in the first place. In addition, it sounds like you are using your guitar and recordings as a crutch in place of actual aural skills. You shouldn't need to listen back to tell you if you're not singing in tune - you should notice it immediately when it's not the correct note. This is also true of guitar, so I'm not sure why you're treating singing differently - surely you don't intentionally play wrong notes and then only notice when you're listening later.   3) There is absolutely no reason to be able to sing a given pitch without a reference. This is a process called perfect pitch or absolute pitch. A small minority of people are born with this ability, and another number of people use what I call ""false perfect pitch"" or ""long-term pitch memory"" to ""teach"" themselves the sounds of various pitches with the intent to recall them by memory. I think this is a completely useless party trick skill that for the most part is actually detrimental to the development of relative pitch and aural skills. Many people use perfect pitch as a crutch not to learn how notes actually relate to each other, which is stupid and short-sighted and leads to terrible musicianship.   I am not completely sure what you're referring to in your process with Carry On My Wayward Son, but I think you're on the right track. It is definitely useful to be able to use the keyboard as a learning tool for singing. However, I would toss out a couple of suggestions to improve your use of the keyboard.   I would recommend not reading with words. Start with a neutral syllable or just the vowels. From a technical standpoint, this encourages continuity of breath which is highly important to singing. It also allows you to focus simply on the pitch, rather than also worrying about text and diction. This allows you to be more secure with pitch, and also allows you to be more thoughtful with diction when you build it back in.   I would also say to divorce pitch from rhythm if you are not able to read at tempo. Research generally shows that practicing with rhythm at a tempo unrelated to the goal tempo is not helpful for reinforcing rhythmic skill, and can distract you from pitch and other factors. So if you need to slow things down, just go note-by-note without accounting for rhythm, and add the rhythm back in at tempo (or half tempo if it's really fast).   4) Four 15-minute sessions is great! I am definitely a proponent of shorter sessions because I think it allows you to be more focused. Besides vocal fatigue (which isn't just strain!), mental focus can be an issue. As soon as your mind starts to wander or you start mindlessly doing an activity without actually thinking about it, your practice session stops being as useful and it's probably time for a break. 30 minutes is also fine, it's just that a lot of folks here try to marathon 1-2 hours and that's almost always going to be too much time unless you're a serious professional who has built up a lot of vocal stamina.   5) This is definitely one way of practicing, but there are limitations. I'm not really a sound tech person but in my experience, some mics are better than others about picking up all the overtones (and this also has to do with mic placement and some other things). Here is one article that talks about some of the limitations with recordings and here is one that gives tips for using recording as a practice tool. The same things generally apply for immediate feedback - making sure you have the mic placed properly, have good acoustics in the recording space, and have the right equipment can greatly inform how helpful your setup will be to your practice.   But, one note for practicing with headphones. This can be an interesting way of checking your progress at time, but I would also practice without the headphones, especially if you plan on ever singing without headphones on. The sounds and sensations you'll get without headphones will be very different due to the bone conductivity of sound and other factors. These clues are really important for developing your singing and understanding how your own voice works - you'll want to be able to adjust your vocal technique based on feel and sound without necessarily having a feedback monitor to rely on. So definitely find a balance between these options."

singing,30mfbj,CobraCommanderVII,3,Sat Mar 28 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"My guess is your quick fix is energizing the tone. To make sure you've got the right space for the high notes, do a big siren (sliding on ooo) to open up.   When you're singing these notes, your brain is probably doing too much work, though, and that can get in the way. Try doing jumping jacks while you ascend or bend at the knees. My voice teacher encourages rubbing your hands in a circular motion in front of you like you're doing so on a desk. It hooks up your core, as the movement makes you engage to balance, and the constant movement gets your brain out of your voice's way.  Try it out! I'm a vocal performance major for opera, these have been helpful for me and for colleagues."
singing,30mfbj,holden-on,2,Sat Mar 28 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Head voice is key here. Most young male singers try to yell their way to the top of their range, essentially using the heavy ""chest"" mechanism as high as possible. Not only is this not really healthy, but as you're discovering, it's not a particularly pleasant sound. What you need to do instead is to incorporate a lighter mechanism, something this is generally known as head voice. In men, we sometimes speak of the ""mixed voice"" because the majority of the time, you'll be using a noticeable combination of chest and head mechanism simultaneously.   As far as how to get there... I think this is easily one of the most difficult technical issues for young men, and I don't think there is much of an easy/quick answer because it often takes completely retraining your current muscle memory to allow for that lighter mechanism to take over.  I'm also not male so I can't give you as direct advice, but I think space is a really important factor here, especially soft palate lift and pharyngeal space. Your impulse that the sound is ""compressed"" is probably correct, and it's probably due to not having enough space in your mouth and pharynx for the sound to resonate properly. You may also want to think about tongue position - that's another major issue that can cut off resonating space for higher notes.   It might simply help to think ""lighter"" and more gentle. Try not to feel like you have to ""brute force"" your way into a note or a sensation of ""pushing"" or ""clenching"". Instead, let the note come out naturally and focus on relaxing your neck, throat, jaw, and other areas that might instinctively tense up as you sing higher in your range.   And it should go without saying that breath support is absolutely crucial here - you need to have enough air to support the pitch without your throat or jaw kicking in to squeeze it out. Focus on controlling your lower breath mechanism as you move higher, rather than trying to shout."
singing,30mfbj,keakealani,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"In regards to the compression, my mouth is actually pretty open, the compression is all back in the throat. It feels like im pulling my cords together and then pushing the note through it. I think it's called ""twang"" cuz its the same feeling as making a duck quack or a witch laugh, which is how I found it.  Maybe the head voice is key, because while I do think I'm using at least some head resonance, because I've tried just pulling straight chest and it's a totally different sound, maybe I'm just not using enough."
singing,30mfbj,keakealani,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"Well, note that I'm specifically talking about soft palate/pharyngeal space. Are you certain you're using appropriate space in those areas for the pitch you're singing?   But yes, those pulling and pushing sensations, without further description, sound wrong to me. You really should not be perceiving much effortful action in the vocal folds themselves - although muscular action takes place, I can't think of a way those sensations could be describing healthy production.   Anyway, adjust your registration, first off. It might be less that you're using full chest and more just using an imbalanced mix that leans too heavily toward chest voice."

It sounds like you are singing, and then adjusting your voice to the right pitch as you sing. Practice thinking the pitch before you sing, and coming it immediately on the center of the pitch.  I can hear your larynx raising up when hitting the high notes. It is creating all this tension in the throat. When going up for the high note, make sure to keep the larynx down, keep the tension in your gut but try not to let your throat, jaw, or face get tense. Also, make sure you are keeping a lot of air flowing across your vocal chords on the high notes, it should make them easier. It sounds like you are closing off your sound. It should feel like you have an apple in the back of your throat (back, not front). Also keep your tongue out of the way on the open vowels. Speaking of which, the word rain is a diphthong, which is where you go from one vowel sound (in this case 'eh') gliding to the next (in this case 'eee'). You are going to the 'eee' sound way to early. It is closing down your sound. Stay on the open 'eh' and just close to the 'eee' at the last second with the 'n'.   Hope that helps."
singing,30mqep,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"The pitches are scooped to/from the high notes because my voice breaks if I don't scoop. There's something funny going on here and I'm not sure what it is.  I didn't notice my larynx rising, and I can't feel it rising if I sing the part again. Are you sure about this?  The apple thing helps, thanks! It doesn't fix all of it though, my timbre is still really breathy and weak around the D4. Yes the diphtong issue is a classic for me, I normally try to think about it - but here I spend all my brainz on reaching the higher pitches properly.  Thank you so much!"
singing,30mqep,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 10:14:41 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about this   No. That is what it sounds like, but it is hard to be sure listening to a recording. It definitely sounds like there is tension there.  The voice breaking if you don't scoop on the high notes could be because you are unsure of the pitch, which makes you tentative, which can cause problems on high notes. Just practice the first jump until you can do it without scooping."
singing,30mqep,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"There is definitely tension somewhere! I can feel how I have to pull/push something, but as far as I can tell, not the larynx. :/  It could be pitch uncertainty... hmm. An octave isn't so odd though. Couldn't it be a passagio-related thing?"
singing,30mqep,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Could it be passagio related? Maybe, but I don't think so. The scooping pitch thing is indicative of using your body to find the pitch, rather than your mind. Once you get to the higher notes, adjusting like that becomes more and more difficult and it causes you to tense up. I think if you practice thinking the pitch before you sing it, then it will help with the high notes. Hear yourself, in your head, singing that pitch before you sing it for real."
singing,30mqep,AegnorWildcat,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm. But say I do this and hit the note without scooping. If the timbre remains similar to that in the clip, I'm still screwed :["

singing,30mn0q,vonniel,5,Sat Mar 28 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"What are their backgrounds in vocal pedagogy?   I think it's important to remember that learning to sing and learning to teach singing are really two separate things. Vocal pedagogy is the study of teaching singing, and it involves lots of things like understanding the anatomy of the voice, learning to identify and fix vocal faults, how to properly care for the voice and notice symptoms of vocal disorders, etc. These things are typically not directly addressed in lessons, so someone whose only training has been taking lessons would not necessarily know the things that are necessary to healthily train the voice.   Which is to say, I think if you're going to learn from someone who has some singing background but no pedagogy/teaching background, it's effectively the same as being self-taught. They can listen to you (which you can also do, through recordings) and make some comments (which is also what the critique thread here and other sites do), but they probably don't have enough background to be particularly effective teachers.   It's also worth noting that singing is very individual, and there's a much higher chance of getting valuable comments from someone who has a similar voice type to you, because they're more likely to have addressed similar vocal issues in their lessons that you may struggle with. If they don't have prior teaching background with your voice type, it's much less likely they'll know how to address your issues.   Of course, none of this might matter to you very much. If you aren't planning on singing much in the long-term and don't really care about getting very good, then obviously there's nothing wrong with enlisting a couple friends to help you out. You just need to be aware that there are serious drawbacks here, and that it's not equivalent to studying with a qualified voice teacher."

It's possible to learn the notes to an easy song in probably 5-10 minutes by plunking them on the piano, especially if you have some previous music background. It can easily take 10-15 years of weekly lessons to become a professional-level classical singer. So without more information, I can only really say between 10 minutes and 10 years."

You have just the right amount of darkness, and if you get the riffs down, it would be SICK!  This said, I think you hit an interesting point when you said ""I never can figure out what music is best for me to do..."", I never considered how that might be of concern because I've never dealt with that, but I can totally see how that can be frustrating, because your so versatile in my opinion. Is there any specific style that you gravitate to as a music fan/listener?

If you want to increase your range, there was a tip somewhere on here a few days ago. The gist of it was to sing scales up to the highest note you can hit.  In your case, you'd wanna work up to an E major scale that starts at E4, with the highest note being that E5. Don't try to sustain the note - treat it like any other note in the scale. This will work to drill the coordination needed to get your cords to shape up for the high note. Eventually you should find you have the coordination/strength to sustain it.  Like I said earlier, be careful. If something hurts, DON'T do it. It might be your range naturally ends at D/D#5, and that's just the way it is.  Edit) Just realized that you may not have had any vocal training/teaching before. If you need some more explanation on what I'm talking about with the scale thing, let me know."

I'd actually say that they require a different skill than singing something fast. I actually find fast songs to be more challenging because the consonants and constant note changes interrupt my breath flow far more than a sustained note. ( This pretty constantly boggles my mind.)  So you're definitely not wrong, it's easier to see what's wrong with a technique on a slower song - but I actually think the reason people sing slower songs for critiques is because they're more satisfying to sing in the first place. You have enough time to try and listen to yourself and feel great about what you're singing. I've also found, especially with beginners, that they emotionally connect more with slower songs before they connect with faster pieces. Most people (especially those of a younger age) have more angst and sorrow they want to sing about rather than happy and upbeat things."

What finally helped is when I stopped thinking of making sure every note was beautiful and really made sure I was playing the needs/wants of my character.

I had always had a classical sound, and though I have always loved musical theatre and the singing that goes with it, I didn't know how to get a more contemporary, belty sound.   My main tip of advice: find a new teacher!!! I went on to college and was put with an INCREDIBLE vocal coach. I told him flat out that I wanted to be able to do musical theatre, and we worked on it. I made sure too keep my semester repertoire balanced, because I didn't want to lose my classical training and still wanted to build that too. I kept working and working, and eventually, after years of vocal growth and practice and good teaching, I would now be considered ""a belter"", though I also can rock out an aria when need be.  I would like to emphasize though that your voice still has a LOT of developing to do. It may take you years to be able to belt where you want to, but with patience and work, it can happen!!  TLDR: 1. Find a good voice coach who is willing to put in the work to help you achieve your goals.   Slow and steady wins the race. It won't cone over night, but you should be working every day on exercises your coach hopefully will give you. Make sure you keep developing the rest of your voice too. Continuing to classically train as well as adding musical theatre training will help you grow as an overall vocalist, and help keep you flexible, healthy, and versatile.   Good luck!"
singing,30iyr5,padfootnprongs91,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would definitely agree that you may never be a belter - I'm also a classical soprano who has dabbled in musical theatre, and I just don't think belting is very important for soprano roles. Frankly, you're more competitive being able to handle those higher roles compared to the millions of people who can only belt and have no real access to their head voice.   Also, as a soprano I think it would be valuable for you to think about resonance and timbre when it comes to musical theatre. You can ""imitate"" the sounds desired for MT with a slight amount of nasality or ""twang"" and a bit heavier registration without actually changing much of your base technique.   I also kind of think saying that a 16-year-old has a ""classical sounding"" voice is kind of ridiculous. Classical singing is really based on a pretty mature sounding voice (particularly in opera, but even in other classical styles), and at 16 your voice still has so much developing to do it would be pretty hard to tell how your voice is actually going to turn out. So I wouldn't worry about that too much - you have just as much potential as the next person to turn out sounding ""classical"" or ""musical theatre"" or whatever.   Plus, most of the sound we actually end up with is more based on training than on some sort of natural propensity - it's possible for pretty much anyone to study pretty much any style and learn the technique to sound like that. It's great that you have a classical foundation to work with, which hopefully focused on being vocally healthy and getting to know your voice. Those things are helpful no matter what genre you end up singing!  Finally, if you haven't already, check out Kristin Chenoweth as a good example of someone who trained classically as a soprano and also has seen a lot of success in musical theatre (perhaps most notably as Glinda in Wicked). There are many more examples, too. It's definitely possible to cross between these two genres so you also don't have to feel like your classical training and any interest you have in classical singing is gone forever if you decide to move a more MT route."

Teachers aren't just for learning technique, but also giving you structured things to work on throughout the week, and a concrete goal for your next lesson. Those are really important for the learning process.   Second, please read the FAQ. In particular, this article would probably be helpful for you.   There are also a number of articles online that tackle this issue - here is one fairly recent article I liked. Here is another article discussing some of the science of practicing. And finally, here is a really great article on how to handle mistakes.   So with those things in mind, I really want to emphasize efficient practice, not long practice. In fact, I have consistently felt that more than 45 minutes in a single practice session (and really ideally, more than 30 minutes) is waste. The voice is pretty easily fatigued, particularly for beginners, and an hour is way too long to be practicing in one go. It almost guarantees that you are practicing beyond your voice's fatigue point which just leads to bad habits and damage to the voice.   What I think is particularly critical to practicing is to listen and to feel. Singing is tricky because what we hear internally may or may not have any bearing on what the outside world hears, due to bone conductivity of sound and other factors. Even so, if you practice in a resonant space (actually, this recent thread comments on this issue), you should be able to hear enough to identify any technical issues. From there, you also need to think about how your voice feels when you're executing something correctly versus incorrectly.   Then, it's important to really isolate down the issue and approach it directly. A lot of people here seem to think that generally singing scales or something will help - this really isn't true. Just singing scales achieves very little, technically speaking. What helps is actually conscientiously isolating and addressing specific issues.   The problem is, there are a lot of ways to approach many issues, and quite frankly it takes some experience to really know what vocalises are appropriate for what issue. If you can comment about specific issues you're having, I and others may be able to give you some advice there, but it's a pretty complex process (at least for me) so I'm not going to try to detail out all the different options.   All that being said, I do want to caution you to be careful practicing too much before you have a teacher. There's no point in just developing a lot of bad habits a teacher will have to work to undo. Be very sure that whatever you're practicing, you're doing it healthily and accurately. And quite frankly, I'd stray away from doing any real technical work just because that can be pretty difficult for a beginner to figure out on their own.   You might consider doing some non-singing preparation, too. If you can't already read music, learn! (Edit: just saw you have a degree in music so obviously this is not necessary). Maybe learn some basic IPA or a common singing language (if you plan to sing in a style that uses other languages). Listen to performers you admire and identify particular skills or qualities you like. Practice your music theory and aural skills. Practice healthy breathing and get to know your lower breathing apparatus.   Best of luck! :)"

It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of the sounds of oral language.  The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators, and translators.    The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation, and the separation of words and syllables.  To represent additional qualities of speech, such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft palate, an extended set of symbols called the Extensions to the IPA may be used.   IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types, letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter ⟨t⟩ may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter, [t], or with a letter plus diacritics, [t̺ʰ], depending on how precise one wishes to be.  Often, slashes are used to signal broad or phonemic transcription; thus, /t/ is less specific than, and could refer to, either [t̺ʰ] or [t], depending on the context and language.  Occasionally letters or diacritics are added, removed, or modified by the International Phonetic Association. As of the most recent change in 2005,  there are 107 letters, 52 diacritics, and four prosodic marks in the IPA. These are shown in the current IPA chart, posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA.

At this point I kind of made stuff up - I don't know that I can genuinely describe any music as ""strange"".   That being said, by the end I got the feeling that you weren't aiming for classical musicians. It's kind of odd not to see any classical, jazz, etc. genres on your list but so many different pop genres (most of which I've never heard of!)   I also would say that country is a poor descriptor for associating music - I had to really think about the countries of origin for most of the music traditions I thought of, and I'm afraid my answers could be easily misinterpreted. (For example I indicated Japan as a country, referring to the Taiko tradition, but it could be misinterpreted as referring to Gagaku or Jpop without any further qualification).  Also, may I ask your school and degree area, as well as for contact information with your supervisor? I believe this information is required for studies in the US (although I infer that you are based elsewhere), and I also think it's good practice generally. Have you verified your credibility with the mods?"

I'm doing this as a part of a class on marketing research in The university of Iceland, if you want i can give you the contact information for my teacher but i'm hesitant to leave that information out in the open. this is not common practice in iceland. the research is a simple audit on the attributes associtated with icelandic music.  You're right in assuming that the survey isn't targeted to classical musicians. it is targeted to the very loosely defined ""music enthusiasts"" i.e people that are actively discussing, creating, experiencing or being a part of the conversation about music and would therefore be more ""knowledgable"" about music in general and more willing to take part in a survey like this.  Country can be a bad descriptor for music and i hope you felt you had a chance to convey that feeling in the survey. nevertheless it is not meant to objectively describe what icelandic music is like because that is hopeless. rather it is meant to find out if there are any common attributes that people feel icelandic music has. if half of the people say iceland when asked about a country that has mysterious music, that is incredibly significant and interesting. the perception can often be more important than actual reality and if you feel that music from one area is ""natural""  then you are likely to find those influences there.  I hope i'm explaining myself  correctly and if you have any further comments or questions, please feel free to ask me here or in pm. i will answer and i do appreciate the input."

In the moment, it seems like you're really in touch with your emotions and it makes you a better musician, but the fact is, when you are healthy (mentally and physically), you can invest more into your craft and you can really enjoy what you're doing. Singing should be fun! If it's something you associate with depression and struggle, it won't be very fun.   And yes about the acoustics of your practice space. I know not everyone has access to a perfect practice room, but bedrooms are almost always not the best space to hear yourself. Not to mention, it's hard to focus when you've got a computer nearby or you have laundry to do. I love the idea of using the bathroom if that works for your life. There is a reason singing in the shower is a stereotype - we all sound great in there!  Of course, it can go too far, too. It's important to get use to feeling what you sound like even in a less resonant room. And too much echo can lead to weird feedback and just not really hearing yourself accurately (this is why I think practicing in a car is usually a bad idea - last time I sang in the car, I heard so many overtones I almost went insane).   And of course, my mantra - practice smarter, not longer. Honestly I really believe that 45 minutes is more than enough time to practice just about anything. I've never felt the need to practice any longer than that before feeling vocally fatigued or just mentally not as focused. I find if you have a smaller amount of time, you also keep focused on your goals better. It's kind of like giving yourself a time limit to learn something."

Of course, I'm also a choral singer so I have a tendency to read vertically for harmony, which I think is more unusual for solo singers.   I definitely don't think of pitch as explicitly vertical, though. If anything, it would be ""backwards"", where I think about a downward motion as I move up in pitch to neutralize any tendencies to strain upward. But really, it's more that same horizontal or even ""stationary"" approach - I try to think of all pitches as coming from the same basic place, with the only difference being space and obviously what my vocal folds are doing."

So you need a teacher that can help you find your head voice and how to train your head voice, so that you can start balancing your muscles.  From the point where you can properly balance your muscles, it'll take at least 4-6 months to get to the point where the laryngeal voice is in sync with your very highest notes.

First, I'd refer you to some vocal exercises I put up for free for my students: www.soundcloud.com/keeneconductor/sets/vocal-technique-1   I love working with highly skilled singers but my favorite is helping people who feel like they ""suck"" but really want to learn to sing.

Because of the genres I like (metal) to sing in, I always cast my notes one octave higher (think A7X or Ozzy) and sometimes, if the song is really low, I might stylize some of the lower notes 2 octaves up.  I have sang with a lot of baritones for that reason and the usual tuning or transposition was baritone -1 octave, soprano +1 octave which can really work with any song, even when using the original instrumentation. Keep in mind this gives off a much more classical or opera sounding tone.   I also dig swagging along with Josh Groban an octave up.

The good news is that a voice teacher can help you with all of that, and make a much more accurate assessment than us. that said, getting a professional opera gig is HARD, and you would be competing with people with a bare minimum of 5-6 years serious vocal training, generally at the collegiate level, and probably an average of 10 years of study.  they are skilled, tenacious, and not at all shy (generally). You would NEED a good voice teacher, several years worth of practice, the ability to read music, and to learn The International Phonetic Alphabet.  you'd also need some way to get regular stage experience (so you'll be less shy about your voice, which does take time). given those things and a lot of dedicated work and you'd certainly have as good a shot as anyone."

This was a fantastic response that is encouraging.  I think the things you list are reasonable commitments for any profession.  Until I get private training what can I do?  Shall I try accompanying myself and learn to sing better?  your reply is encouraging especially becfause of what you write there is decent space/sound - yes, the intonation is really bad.  But someone with perfect intonation but not so much space/sound may always be limited.  you are certainly right about my being extremely shy.  I wonder how I can make slow steps toward this goal.  Would it help if I tried practicing with someone who already has learned for ten years? (But is not a singing coach per se; also perhaps this person's technique is one that I think falls short in certain spaces.)"
singing,30fgga,keakealani,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points with /u/accidentaldouche, but I also kind of want to say... it's great that you're enthusiastic, but I think you're approaching this from kind of the wrong direction.   Opera is an art form that has developed over centuries to highlight very specific vocal demands - it's like the acrobatics of singing. And trying to achieve that without the proper training is just a good way of hurting yourself or learning bad habits.   I would say to maybe step back and think about building some basic foundations of technique before trying to actually sing an aria. In the classical world, we typically start with art songs for exactly this reason - it's very, very difficult to jump into opera straight off without building up your technique for it.   But yes, I think you (and mostly anyone who has an interest) has potential for an operatic style of singing. As /u/accidentaldouche points out, a lot of it is more about your commitment to the professional training and life you'd need to accomplish to be successful.   So to start, definitely get a private teacher (not coach) ASAP. With other styles, you can kind of futz around on your own, but with classical music you really do need to have a qualified voice teacher guiding your progress. There are so many musical idioms and details that you need to work on for classical music that really do need some sort of actual training.   Consider applying for a vocal performance/opera program at a local university or college. At this point, the majority of professional opera singers have degrees in voice, and you should pretty much expect to need the same types of qualifications as a degree-holding professional singer if you want to be competitive. Even if you don't enter a degree program, plan on being at that level in terms of theory, aural skills, history, etc.   Good luck! :)"

It is super interesting what you say about being at that level in terms of theory, aural skills, history, etc: I certainly think it is nearly impossible to be an autodidact and not miss something.  Given the fact that true talent and teachers are so rare, I wonder if there are any online programs that are respectable at all?

Here's a thread where I talk about the differences. The main issue is that teachers focus on developing technique and coaches mostly work on polishing your performance once you have a pretty good handle on technique. Because you're more of a beginner, a teacher would be much more useful for your needs imo. :)   What do you think about someone who had studied singing themselves but isn't a teacher/coach?   This really depends on what kind of background they have. Studying singing can mean a lot of different things. I would say generally to stray away from anyone who hasn't had formal instruction in vocal pedagogy (basically studying how to teach singing). Vocal pedagogy is different from just learning to sing - you learn about the anatomy of the voice, how it functions, how to identify and address vocal faults, and how to properly care for the voice in terms of health and hygiene. Typically just taking lessons doesn't really address these things, so someone whose only training is taking lessons would not be qualified to teach singing, unless their lessons include a lot of that material (which is really uncommon).    One thing that I want to highlight is that I agree with you 100% that opera had developed over centuries. When I listen to old professionals, however, they seem to show aspects of style that newer singers simply don't know.   Would you be able to elaborate on what this means? I'm actually not really an opera person so I'm not the most well-versed, but I don't know what it is that modern opera singers don't ""know"" that older singers do. On the contrary, major advances in research over the past couple of decades have vastly improved the knowledge about the voice that previously was subject to metaphors and conjecture.    I've sat through operas where I thought none of the singers (none of them) produced any notes as I would have expected them to.   I'm also curious as to what you mean by this. I don't want to come off as confrontational, but as someone who is obviously a beginner and not well-trained, what makes you think you know all the idioms of classical singing? Is this just a preference issue, or is there some specific technical problem that you've noticed? Can you provide specific recordings? I'm here to learn, too, so I'm very curious as to why you hold current singers in such disdain.    It is super interesting what you say about being at that level in terms of theory, aural skills, history, etc: I certainly think it is nearly impossible to be an autodidact and not miss something.   I mean, I do think a lot of this stuff can be self-taught to an extent (actually, way easier than self-teaching singing itself). I started out very self-taught in theory - my first formal theory class was in college. But yes, I do think having a good grasp of those ideas (at least equivalent to someone with a bachelor's degree in music) is really important just because it informs so many other elements of a professional singer's life. If you struggle to read music, you won't be able to rehearse as efficiently. If you don't know the basics of era and composers, you will not have a good understanding of stylistic needs particular to a certain piece or style. It's not like you have to master the intricacies of Schenkerian analysis (although I've heard it helps), but I do think you'd be at a disadvantage if your theory and history skills aren't up to snuff.    Given the fact that true talent and teachers are so rare, I wonder if there are any online programs that are respectable at all?   I don't believe in talent, and I don't think good teachers are that rare. I live in a small, isolated area and there are dozens of very good classical vocal teachers in my area, including all the faculty at my university. I personally don't think online programs are, in general, reputable and I definitely don't think they're a good choice for classical singing (again, the specific idioms and techniques are pretty difficult to explain without in-person teaching). I won't rule them all out because I don't know them all, but I really don't think that's a good idea if you're serious about opera. I think being willing to invest in lessons upfront does say something about your overall motivation in such a competitive and harsh field.    I really didn't plan on physically attending music school unless/until I was much better.   You may want to reconsider this. At my local state university (and its accompanying community college system), we get a lot of voice majors with pretty minimal training before college. They come with enthusiasm and some bare bones, but the majority of their training happens in college. I only had two years of lessons before college myself, in fact. And I was ahead of most of my peers in that respect.   Sure, you may not get into a conservatory without much training, but a community college or smaller state school may actually be very helpful for you. And if you go that route for an associate's or bachelor's degree, you do have the option of graduate school or post-collegiate programs to finesse your skill. I think as long as you meet the audition requirements, it's worth considering.    do you think programs in italy would have some kind of edge? Or will any old school do, really?   I don't know that traveling internationally is really worth it for a beginner. At this point, well-trained, reputable teachers exist in most major cities and even some smaller towns. If you live in a very small town, I would say relocating to a larger city is a good idea, but I don't think it's important to go international.   There are definitely advantages to the Italian school of singing generally (it's the most widely respected style in the US, as far as I can tell), but there are many Italian-trained singers around the world these days, so you don't necessarily need to move there to get that kind of training.    find the best one (that I can get into)   I know I'm giving you lots of semi-unsolicited advice, but I want to caution you about this mentality. A lot of young (or inexperienced) musicians believe that going to school is about an arbitrarily ""best"" school. In my opinion, there's no such thing. The ""best"" school is the one that's right for you. I would say, rather than trying to just get into a top school (especially since the top conservatories are extremely competitive and expensive to attend), is to try to develop relationships with faculty at your prospective school, and to enroll in the program that fits your needs the best. For performers, this first and foremost means securing a slot in the studio of a faculty member that fits your needs and interests. You can go to the very top rated school, but if you're assigned to a bad studio, it won't really help you in the long run.   I would say to start by researching schools in your local area and contacting the voice faculty at those schools. Maybe arrange for a trial lesson. If you click with them and you get good vibes, that's a good choice of school. In general I think that approach is more helpful than just trying to get a conservatory training, and it's especially helpful for people who are getting a later start because you don't waste time studying with a teacher that's not right for you.   That all being said, of course there are advantages to European programs over North American programs, one of the largest being that classical music is more likely to be state-supported, so there are more opportunities and you can interact more with working musicians. And of course, immersion in one or more of the major operatic languages (Italian, French, and German) is a great way to improve your language skills. So if you are planning to go in that direction, that is awesome too. I just don't know that it's the most expedient choice for most people."

One thing that confuses me, that I'd like some context on before I respond to the rest of it -- what did you mean where you wrote:   I'm actually not really an opera person so I'm not the most well-versed   It's really confusing!!  (Because I thought it was the whole context of our discussion).  If I say I'm not an xy person, for me it mean I don't have any opinions on, e.g. surfing at all.  (I thought of an example, surfing, and I literally do not have a single opinion, none at all, never surfed, never tried to, never viewed it as a spectator, I'm just not a surfer person.)  But since it's obvious that this is not exactly what you mean, based on detailed feedback, questions, opinions, and a conversation, then what did you mean when you said you're not an opera person?  I don't understand why we're discussing opera in this case, or why you ask about what opera idioms I meant, or are advising me about opera education.  I think I am really missing something here!!

I've seen operas all my life (I've been to almost every season of my regional opera company since I was 9) and I've studied classical voice pretty extensively (I'm currently pursuing a BM in vocal performance), so it's not like I don't know anything about opera, but it's not my focus in terms of style and I'm not as well-versed as some of the other posters here or as professional opera singers.   Which is to say, feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt! It's based primarily on what I know about classical singing generally and what I've learned from teachers and peers who are heavily involved in opera. And I do think that there's a lot of overlap, particularly in the beginning stages, with other styles of classical singing. The technique is basically the same, and I'm doing just fine in my opera scenes class this semester, but I can't honestly speak from the experience of, say, actually performing a principle role in an opera production or anything like that.   But yes, I should clarify - I'm not interested in opera as a career choice for me. I'm totally interested in opera as a listener and as a general classical singer, it's just not the first thing I turn to for my own repertoire, generally speaking."

I know I have perfectly good pitch (I have sung in high-level choirs and as a soloist for years and years, and am pursuing a degree in vocal performance from an accredited university), and I'm using a pretty high-quality mic (as far as portable mics are concerned), and yet it's still reading me some pretty iffy readings for no reason (maybe ambient noise?)  So yeah, overall, I don't think this is very helpful and I can see it having a lot of issues in terms of timbre and technique. I suppose it could be fun but I don't see it as being a particularly good long-term tool, and it's much more of a crutch than just using a piano or another instrument to learn pitch by yourself. You're essentially letting a computer do what your ears should do by themselves.   Edit: Yeah, I did another level singing straight and it was better, but that kind of indicates to me how bad this is for actual vocal training, because aiming for straight tone is usually going to result in a lot of added tension and other potential bad habits."

In your experience, is there typically at least two or three of you who can hit such a low note at all?   Depends on the choir; I am the only person in my choir (well, one of two, but the other guy never turns up) who can hit Db2 with any reliability, and you certainly won't get it forte! Eb2 forte is more doable for me (depends what f means in the context of the piece I guess), but again I might be one of few - there are plenty of basses in my choir whose lowest reliable note is E2/Eb2.   This goes for any voice, but I have the tenors doing it particularly often; do you prefer to have ""falsetto"" written out, or will you use it naturally where necessary?   As someone who sings bass, I generally expect not to be using my falsetto, and I would imagine the same was true of the sopranos and altos, so that question probably is just directed at tenors! I've never seen anyone write out 'falsetto' in a tenor line. If the choir has baritones singing as tenors they'll be used to switching into falsetto where necessary I guess. Again, depends on how good the choir is! But for what it's worth, I'm really a low baritone, and I can comfortably hit an A4 at piano in falsetto, so I imagine anyone singing tenor probably can."
singing,30bwvx,purple-pumpkin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"Considering most bass 2 tend to be full of bass-baritones I agree.  As a bass baritone,  I can hit a C# 2  almost every day throughout the day.   However since it's near the bottom of my range,  it's not loud,  certainly not at a forte  by any means, it also can be hard to stay on pitch if I don't have a C2 at the moment.  It's about indoor conversational levels at best. Similiarly  I can hit an Eb2, but it will only be loud some days.  I think an E 2 could get a solid sound,  and Eb 2 would require a very solid bass section for a decent sound,  and a Db 2, is not likely with a normal bass 2 section to get a reasonably strong full sound. While many can hit it,  it will be drowned out and poor sounding at most choirs."
singing,30bwvx,Mattpilf,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a composer too! And 15+ years of experience as a choral singer, so this is something I know a lot about. Let me try to answer your questions, and also feel free to message me if you have more questions :)   I have a solo soprano jumping from an E5 to an F#4. This is at 46 bpm with quarter notes. It's the most awkward jump in the whole piece, but I would like it to stay. Does that seem reasonable?   With jumps, there are a couple things to think about. Remember your counterpoint rules (just because you're self taught, I'm assuming you still know the basics). How does the jump resolve? It almost definitely needs to resolve in the opposite direction, and in this context, I would say the surest resolution is by half step.   You also need to note the harmonic context - jumps into dissonance are really hard (like my high-level auditioned college chamber choir struggles with it). Check the level of consonance. And on this note, keep in mind that thirds are not always consonant, particularly if there are a lot of inharmonic overtones. So be very conscientious of your voicing here.   Also, from a straight pitch perspective, I think this particular seventh is a bit iffy because F#4 is traditionally the passaggio for sopranos. This somewhat depends on the specific person (my passaggio is higher, but I'm also a high-set coloratura-in-training), but as a general rule, you don't want to jump into or out of the passaggio. A half step up would be surer.    Is it possible to sing an F#5 at ppp for an extended duration?    Not really, no. It would take an exceptionally talented professional to do it, and it's very dependent on a lot of other context.   Also keep in mind that female falsetto effectively does not exist - it's a possible mode of production but overlaps totally with the modal voice and the vast majority of women don't use it and wouldn't know how if they tried (myself included). It's not a practical register and it doesn't sound good, so it's really not something to consider for any reason, particularly if you're not extremely well versed with vocal/choral composition and the accompanying anatomy.   If so, can it be hummed in any way?   This is actually way worse - it's acoustically impossible to hum above a certain pitch level without severe compromises to the amplification (and it's physically extremely unhealthy). Read up on vowel formants if you haven't already, but the gist of it is that above a certain pitch level (for most sopranos, this is about F#5-G5 or so) certain vowels simply cannot be pronounced because the acoustic space needed to pronounce the vowel is inconsistent with the amount of space needed to project the pitch. To address this, we use what's called ""vowel modification"" (sometimes called ""covering"" for male voices) and it essentially means that pure vowels won't happen at certain places. If you don't care as a composer, that's fine (again, unless you're really experienced, I'd leave the modifying up to the performers), but it does mean you have to make considerations for what is physically and technically possible.    In your experience, if there are multiple soprano solos, is there usually one who does all of them, or do you split them up? I suppose it depends upon the range and your director, but this is mostly just out of curiosity.   This really depends on context. Most typically, you will have one soloist for the whole piece unless there are specifically two simultaneous solo lines or the parts are written as explicitly different solos (such as different verses of a strophic piece with an indication of different solos). It's important to keep in mind that professionally, soloists are typically paid (it depends on the context as some choirs hire full-time section leaders who double as soloists, and some choirs just hire a soloist for a specific gig). Most choirs don't want to hire a bunch of different people for budget reasons, so unless there's a really good reason to have multiple people singing solos in the same piece, it's unlikely they'd want to hire more than they need to.   Even for choirs that don't pay their soloists (school choirs, for example), it typically takes a bunch of extra work to coach the soloists and it doesn't really make sense to get a bunch of different people. Some choirs who use internal soloists just go with the ""anyone could be called"" method, where the whole section learns the solo and the director just chooses one person to do it in concert. This isn't as common, though. It's more a strategy used in children's choirs and some high schools for fairness and educational reasons.    Is it difficult to hit a G#3 with substantial sound? It doesn't necessarily have to be forte, but I do need it brought above the rest.   There are two issues here, actually.   One is a pragmatic issue. Because true contraltos are pretty rare (and don't develop their full range until like their mid-30s or so) and even mezzos develop a bit later, you're going to see a LOT of crossover sopranos singing alto (I've sung alto in nearly every choir I've been in for the past 5ish years, despite, as I mentioned, being a high-set soprano in my solo life). There are lots of musical issues where typically directors will put any soprano that can read in the alto section because alto parts are typically harder to read, and lots of other crap like that. Strictly speaking you don't have to worry about this, but if you're working for the greatest range of people, you just have to know that this is an issue.   With that in mind, part of the issue about the low area of altos is registration. By definition, in all female voices, that area is going to be in more or less pure chest voice. It's possible to bring head registration down there to an extent, but it's really soft and not very healthy vocally. In chest register, though, the timbre is very different and not as blendy. It's also harder to control and there can be pitch issues in some choirs. So you kind of have to make a decision about how important those things are. And if you're working with the ""sopranos-pretending-to-be-altos"" choir, you might not get much sound there at all. In general, the low end of anyone's range isn't very loud, so unless you want literal yelling, it's not going to be substantial.   Also, think about acoustics here - low female range means minimal ability to access the singer's formant, which means next to no natural amplification. Higher sounds cut better, too. So you're just looking at fighting against nature the lower you go.    Are C#5's reasonable at a loud volume? How about pianissimo? I'm fairly certain they are for the most part, but just making sure.   Yes, that's fine. And like I said, if you have sopranos or mezzos singing alto, even better. Pianissimo might be a bit of a problem for the same reason as with the sopranos, since you'd really need to float it and that's actually a bit low for floating for a choral alto. It's possible, though.    do you prefer to have ""falsetto"" written out, or will you use it naturally where necessary? There are a couple of occasions where I have the tenors go as high as A4 at piano.    An A4 will only be falsetto for young tenors. By college and professional level, there's no reason to be using falsetto there. If you specifically want that sound, you'd have to notate it. Keep in mind, though, that the sound of head voice at that pitch is much more pleasant than falsetto and is also more likely to be in tune.    How low can you go? As I said, I'm a baritone, so I instinctively write relatively low for tenors. There are a couple of times where you might go as low as a C3 (both tenor 1's and 2's). Is that reasonable at a lower dynamic?   Typically, below around E3 or so you're going to start losing out on sound a lot. Most guys have a lower extension that goes into the bottom of the bass clef (something like G2 or), but it's pretty much inaudible for a true tenor and even a higher-set baritone. It's just not a pretty part of the tenor's range, and it sounds much better for a baritone, so I wouldn't recommend spending time down there.    I believe I have you singing an Eb2 at forte or fortissimo on a number of occasions   Good luck with that. Like all the other parts, you're fighting heavily against natural acoustics. Low notes are audible because people will hear the foundation, but they won't be loud unless you have three times as many basses as every other part. I just sang a piece with a bunch of low Es for the basses and we have a pretty well-rounded crew with Ds and Dbs, and it was tough for them acoustically, especially in cathedral spaces and stuff like that.   It's not to say most basses can't hit that - they can. It's just that it's not loud and it's something to be treated delicately. Also it might involve whiskey, so you should probably consider how sober you want your basses to be =P  (comment got too long so following up in another...)"
singing,30bwvx,keakealani,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"Anyways, I'm also going to throw out some general comments that might be helpful.   A lot of beginner composers don't really understand how tessitura works, and how the vocal instrument works in general, and that leads to some really bad writing that is miserable for the performers and doesn't sound good.   So in general, understand tessitura and be judicious when you leave the tessitura. Not only is it technically difficult, but it's very fatiguing to sing outside of one's tessitura for long periods of time. Plus the level of control and nuance the singer can achieve is highest within their tessitura.   On the other hand, avoid repeated notes at all costs. I don't mean two eighth notes to fit the beat, but like, forcing a part to sing the same note for 48 measures. (Take a look at William Schuman's ""To All, To Each"" from Carols of Death - my choir is currently singing this piece and the alto/tenor 1 line is literally E4 for about 3 and a half pages. It's brutally difficult and the intonation is really spotty even for a very good choir.)   Be very very careful about your text setting. Bad text setting is infinitely worse than basically any other compositional sin (except perhaps a gross range mistake) because it causes so many other problems. Text is pretty much what makes singing special, and it's what singers spend a ton of time thinking about about working with. Unintuitive text setting will take a lot of time to learn and be uncomfortable to sing. Not to mention having to work out things like consonant placement, vowel modification, etc. (Also on this note, please be careful with page turns, particularly if it makes the text ambiguous. In English, a very common issue is ending a page or system with the word ""the"", where the following word could begin with a consonant or a vowel, changing the pronunciation of the word.)  Don't treat singers like instrumentalists. It's really annoying, and it also tends to show yourself as an amateur. In particular, be mindful of breaths (and note that our breath movement is very different than wind or brass instruments - we have a much softer vibrating material than a brass mouthpiece or reed, so the air pressure is much lower and the corresponding air speed is slower.) Note that our registration is different than instruments as well.   One specific point worth mentioning because it happens so much - please do not put unnecessary ""courtesy"" accidentals that correct an alteration that happened in another part two measures ago. While a good choir will read vertically at times, I guarantee you none of the sopranos noticed that the basses had an Eb two measures before they have a normal E natural in C major. Putting an accidental, particularly if it's not in parentheses, indicates to us that you've changed something. If you haven't, it really slows down our reading.   Remember that singing is a relative pitch instrument. The vast majority of your singers do not have perfect pitch and will be reading based on a tonal center and the pitches around them. We do not read like keyboardists where we see a chord and then make it happen. In fact, in very atonal/chromatic pieces, choirs can be genuinely surprised to land on a major or minor triad if it's not part of the previous harmonic language. This makes the choral instrument really flexible, but you do have to read like a singer, not like a keyboardist or other instrumentalist.   Finally, sing every single part. Every measure of it. Even if you have to transpose it or sing it in falsetto or whatever. If you can't sing it, don't write it. Even very talented singers are not magicians - we're not going to be able to jump around by 10ths or do some crazy tongue twister at 32nd notes with consonants. You can pretty much immediately tell if something is going to work based on your own ability to sing it.   Anyway, sorry for the wall of text but like I said, this is something I have a lot of experience with. Please feel free to ask questions or send over a score - I'm a full-time student so I can't promise timeliness, but I'd be happy to look through and give additional pointers."

singing,30c68x,musicaltheatrelover,2,Thu Mar 26 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"Part of this is where you're singing relative to your natural tessitura. She's not singing insanely low, no, but she is singing on the lower side for a soprano or higher mezzo (and the color of her voice sounds more like that than a genuine contralto). So relative to that natural range, it is fairly low and you're getting that sound quality.   Another thing is just the amount of breathiness in her voice. This is a ""technique"", I guess - if you want to sound more like this, you do have to maintain a slightly breathy quality. (Not making a comment about the health of doing that - it's not really healthy in the long term but in moderation a little breathiness isn't that bad for you.)   But this is also just a personal voice thing. Some voices are just darker and more chocolatey than others. I personally have a super bright voice, and no matter how much I try, the only way I could do this is through severe modification that wouldn't be very good for my voice. It's just like (natural) hair color or height - you're kind of born with a specific set of traits and you can't modify it much.   Lastly, I want to note that she is singing into a mic. This type of effect is most successful with a mic because it's not very loud naturally. So if you're trying to oversing while doing this style, it's going to be much harder."

singing,30b5m2,august_first,2,Wed Mar 25 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't really an exercise but something I think is essential in getting the most from your lessons. When I take lessons with my teacher, the focus is never on just doing exercises but rather to get me to understand what the exercises are there to accomplish. Usually that means getting me to recognize, for example, exactly what it means to keep a neutral larynx, to place my voice correctly or what it feels like to mix.   If your teacher is just running drills and not getting you to understand and physically feel out what's going on with your voice, then he/she isn't doing their job well.   Practice is to enforce that understanding and feeling that you get from your lesson so that the next time you see him/her, you can work on the next step to building your voice.   Anyways, regarding your question, I really think it's a matter of how well the teacher can get the student to understand the feeling of good technique so that what you focus on and what your objectives are in your practice are clearly defined to you so you know exactly when you mess up or when you're doing it right. I've had many teachers in the past and this to me seems to be the most defining aspect of a good teacher."
singing,30b5m2,the_snugglebear,2,Thu Mar 26 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"Your instinct is right - practice is crucial to really learning. You simply can't solidify skills if you only do them once a week. You do need to build in some kind of daily practice regimen.   That said, I completely agree with /u/the_snugglebear that it's important to understand why you're doing something, rather than just going through the motions. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a pro, you will learn the most by focusing on a specific task and practicing it efficiently.   I have a couple of pieces of advice, though.   If your teacher is okay with it, record your lessons. Just set up a memo on your phone if you don't have a portable recording device handy. This is important so you can review what you did in your lesson, and work on those same things in your practice session. It also might be a good idea to specifically ask in your lesson about things to worry about when practicing at home, so you have that information all ready to go. Also, just keep a pencil and notebook handy so you can jot down exercises or parts of your music to work on at home.   Record your practice sessions. On the same note, you can learn a lot by listening back to how you practice. Don't underestimate your own ears - you may not have as much experience as your teacher, but you can probably hear if you sound strained or just don't seem to be achieving what you're trying to do. Use these recordings as benchmarks for your progress throughout the week. You might even be able to bring in a problem recording for your teacher to review, and she can provide feedback (or tell you it's fine).   Ask your teacher to give you some practice guidelines. If you don't get a chance to record your whole lesson, make sure you at least record or write down (shorthand is fine) the exercises you do in your lesson, so you can do the same ones at home.   Beyond that, though, while most folks here do stress the bad habits that can accumulate over time, you can't do much damage in just a week. The reason a teacher is so valuable is because you can check up every week and see if you are moving in the right direction or if you're developing a bad habit. The learning process can be messy! You may find that you have to undo some things you've done, but overall, you're still learning and becoming a better singer. But trust that your teacher will tell you if they're noticing something really dangerous. If not, try not to worry about it. Seriously, you're not going to destroy your voice by tensing up once in a warmup.   Finally, listen to your body. Start to become aware of what it feels like when you're doing something correctly. As you get to know your own voice, you'll get to know its limits and the signs of strain, tension, or other badness. You'll also hopefully get to know what feels good and is healthy for your voice. Everyone's sensations are different, but you should start to notice what your voice feels like and be able to adjust if it feels wrong.   Oh, one actual final point. Practice smart, not long. A focused 10-15 minute session is actually more valuable than an hour of screwing around, especially if your voice starts to get tired. And holding yourself to short practice sessions helps keep yourself on-task and gives you a tangible goal. Don't try to marathon everything in a week - these things do take time to become muscle memory and it's best to do a couple short sessions than a big long one. And it's okay if you didn't put in 10 hours between lessons! (Nobody does, that I know of =P)"

singing,30aotw,Masklin,3,Wed Mar 25 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"A few points:  ""Darkness"" and vocal ""weight"" (dramatic vs. lyric voices, for example) are not the same. Many singers (Nathan Gunn, for example) have darker, rich timbres, but smaller voices.   Secondly, true operatic singing tends not to blend well with a choir. The whole point of operatic singing is to stand out--it's solo singing. An opera chorus is what a choir of opera singers sounds like--far cry from, say, the Danish Radio Choir.  You get more color and darkness in the voice by elongating the vocal tract, which means lowering the larynx and widening the pharyngeal space. Most people do this by depressing the tongue root, or they constrict the throat and mistake those sensations for widening it.   Having a proper, easy chest connection in the voice, an ""open throat"" (loaded subject too large to deal with here, but you can think the inhale like the beginning of a yawn), and the right ""support"" (i.e. well-managed and not excessive breath pressure that would push the larynx higher) contribute to this.  The idea that you patently ""don't"" make the voice darker is bunk. Opera singers aren't born sounding that way. Well-trained voices will, of course, be brighter or darker based on a person's natural features, but the darkness is developed. This is further evidenced by (usually older) opera recordings from different ""schools"" of training that favored darkness more (or less). Compare pre-1950 recordings of German-trained and French-trained singers for an example of this."

If you don't want to lower your tongue root you can raise the sides of the back of your tongue against your molars, but I don't know if this fits classical style or not. One method to darken sound sometimes used in classical singing is to compress your tongue lengthwise."

The tip of the tongue lies flat down in the oral cavity, the tongue arches in the middle and at the back it pulls into itself. With the tongue in this position, the vowels become more classical.""

You're Swedish, right? There's a lot of good to be done vocalizing on the ü sound. You can try singing it falsetto, with a sensation of width behind the upper back molars, and then slide down on a glissando to the bottom of your range, maintaining that feeling of width and staying in falsetto as long as possible (but eventually crossing over into full voice, ideally with no audible break)."

Widening these, on either side of the uvula and at the height of the soft palate, should not distort the vowel at all."

singing,30aotw,Bodyfreak_,2,Thu Mar 26 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with /u/mwb2 here, but I just want to add that vowel can also contribute to a darker sound without actually having a darker sound overall. Think about the difference between a standard American ""ah"" vowel and, say, a bright Minnesota ""ah"" (or German ""a""). The same person can create all those sounds and they aren't changing that much about the actual vocal mechanism, just the vowel shape. This can be taken too far if you get the tongue too involved, but it is possible to simply use a darker version of each vowel to approximate the sound of a darker voice. I think this varies a little bit for each person so I can't give you a straightforward tip that will make this happen, but experiment and see if you can produce a range of vowels that gives you the color you're looking for."

singing,30aotw,pale_green_pants,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:55:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Thinking different vowels modifies the position of the tongue and pharynx in a subconscious way, and for many people can be more effective than thinking of the actual anatomy.  [u] is a great example: a true ""oo"" sound (tube-y and hooty, NOT like ""eww"") raises the back of the tongue and lowers the larynx, naturally."
singing,30aotw,pale_green_pants,3,Thu Mar 26 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"You don't. Each voice has it's own unique timbre, and the goal is not to create a more forward (brighter), or pressed (darker) sound, but one that is centered and unique to you. Blending in choir is more so about creating the right vowel shapes and matching them to those around you. Depending on the kind of school you go to, the choral blend may call for straight tone, which is not you manufacturing a timbre, but rather maintaining a clean, 'pure' sound."
singing,30aotw,pale_green_pants,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Interesting view!  How sure are you about this though? I feel quite convinced that there's more darkness/space to be gained in my voice.  Perhaps I'm mistaking ""Raise soft palate"" for ""push root of tongue down"" ??"
singing,308iqm,Wcran7,4,Wed Mar 25 09:46:58 2015 UTC,"The only real ""trick"" is that you must have correct information, and apply that information correctly and consistently.  The reason why people struggle to develop range is because they are either training with bad information, or training with good information but misinterpreting it and doing it wrong.   The way I teach people to extend their range is by the following: First blending chest voice and falsetto smoothly so that the flip between them is seamless and hidden. Use staccato and edgy sounds with a very buzzy pharyngeal resonance so that the falsetto can start to become stronger and ""sound closer"" to chest voice. Then you learn how to use buzzy mmm sounds legato and go from bottom to top, the falsetto should feel different now, it will feel more ""connected"" to your chest voice and will sound also like one voice.   There is more but basically the end goal is this:  Instead of blending to falsetto, eventually you are able to take your REAL VOICE (chest voice) and take it up and it just thins but doesn't leave your real voice.   Applying range into songs is also a process because you must get good at moving from one vowel to the other without any feeling of choking in the throat.  I know all this sounds complicated but it is actually pretty simple - but it isn't always OBVIOUS.  There is more, but I think the first 3 steps are probably what you need at the moment judging by your post.  None of what I wrote will help if you do it wrongly though."
singing,308iqm,philmoufarrege,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:40:12 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate a bit on the part where you use staccato and edgy sounds to strenghten the falsetto? What does that mean?
singing,308iqm,macroexpand,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"Staccato is a powerful tool because it doesn't give your voice a chance to ""grip"" in the chest.  It will teach your voice to release and thin out and then over time you can start lengthening the duration of the notes.  Once you are at this stage you will notice you can smoothly go up and down with one voice.  If however, you were asking if I could teach you this in the form of text, that unfortunately is impossible. Singing is not so much about WHAT you do but more importantly HOW you do it.  All the suggestions here only work if you do them right, if you do them wrong it doesn't work, so HOW becomes the critical component."

singing,308iqm,frenchtugboat,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:52:39 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of answers to this, but one thing that has worked for me and many others is vocal exercises, particularly arpeggios/scales in which you slowly work upwards and downwards to your maximum non-falsetto range.  This will let you hit a high note for a very brief moment so that you do not wear out your voice when hitting it, but help strengthen those vocal chords by working higher and higher (for instance if doing a major chord scales you could work up to singing G3-B3-D4-G4-D4-B3-G3 as a scale).  Maybe your voice isn't able to sustain a G4 very long, but in this scenario you do not have to.    If you do these scales and warm-ups often, then you will notice that maybe the highest note you can reach without switching to falsetto would increase to a A4, and maybe a Bb4, etc.  As that happens, you will likely notice that the G4 is now more easy to sing sustained without straining.  It's not unlike trying to increase your bench press.  You need to work on your form doing what you can already do and slowly increase little by little."

If you can arch you pitch to someone's voice(at least somewhat accurately to someone of similar voice  type),  then you aren't completely  tone deaf, and should make it easier. Some of us have easier times finding a fundamental pitch then others, but I'm sure it can be trained.   You are probably going to need a good bit of work with a guitar or piano/keyboard  to get the hang of it. Also some work on recognizing intervals so you can sing on pitch.  Not an expert,  but maybe doing some scales while the piano or whatever plays the individual note in unison,  then try to see how your voice sounds when you sing harmony with the piano.  Like you sing a middle school and the piano plays a fifth higher.  Stuff like that. A vocal instructor could probably speed things up too."

It all really boils down to getting as close as possible to learning whatever you're performing to the point where you can perform the whole set without even thinking about what you're doing.  Edit: Let me clarify, that the 75% telling a story is the same as entertaining the audience, depending on what you're singing. If you look calm, confident, and cool, the audience will most likely overlook any slight errors you make because you're drawing them in.

It always hits me AFTER I get off the stage (Like, really body/mind? How is freaking out NOW useful at all? The performance is over!)  I agree with the posters who said to just get out there, and things like karaoke can be really helpful since there are so many people and they are generally super supportive if you have even a semblance of singing ability.  I do a lot of Skype coaching with people around the world. If you'd like, I'd be happy to offer you a free lesson to go over your technique, see if there are any simple improvements to your singing that may help you feel more confident, and go over some stage-presence tips and exercises so you feel more comfortable performing.

If someone slightly misses a beat, the others are instantly there to make up for it. If someone needs an extra bar's rest before coming in, the band will play an extra bar. I find playing to a click-track a bit soulless, because it doesn't respond to you. Either you are bang in time and tune with it, or it goes wrong. Try getting a friend to play an instrument while you sing, and see if that helps (if it doesn't, ask why)."

singing,3051c9,castleofglass,4,Tue Mar 24 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"What are you auditioning for? I don't think there's a generically good audition piece - you should choose music based on what you're auditioning for and what you think the auditioners want to hear. The piece you'd choose to audition for a musical theatre role is different than what you'd choose for a talent competition or for a conservatory audition.   That being said, from listening here are a couple of points to consider.  I would have to hear more of your voice with different vocalises and such, but from the the sound of your voice, I don't think this piece sits in a good tessitura for you. Your voice sounds very strained and it basically sounds like you're yelling the whole piece. I think this is due to an overly heavy registration, which I think has to do with the fact that the piece sits fairly low and your voice sounds like more of a medium or high voice.   Pitch is also an issue here. Because of the registration and also possibly just the piece itself (I know it's pop, but do you happen to have a score handy?) there are a lot of repeated pitches and your intonation is spotty for many of them. For this reason, I also wouldn't choose a song like this for an audition - it doesn't really show off your aural conception of pitch or tonality, and in fact kind of shows the opposite, that you don't seem to have a great sense of the harmonic movement and voice leading in this piece (no idea whether or not this is true, just what this performance reveals to me).   I'm not sure if you're looking for other critiques besides the way the piece fits your voice, but I would just quickly mention that you may want to evaluate your vowel choices. They're kind of all over the place and that really affects your overall diction. Consider being more specific and consistent with your vowels. I think fixing the registration issues would also help here, since I think you're losing pharyngeal space due to a raised/strained larynx, which reduces the amount of vowel resonance you have access to.   Hope that helps!"

This sounds really pleasant to me :)   I don't want to sound like I'm overdoing anything.   I didn't get the  feeling. I thought there was a nice balance of different dynamics and hitting different parts of your voice. Maybe the only thing that caught my attention was a ""yea"" at at 1:47. I feel like it might not have matched the emotion of the phrase exactly... but maybe could work in another place better :)   Does this piece match my voice?   It seems to work pretty well for your voice IMO. I do think there are a couple places where it sounds a bit pushed, but I also thought that was probably intentional. I guess it probably depends on what you're auditioning for? Maybe you could add that to your original post to let other's know  Best of luck!"

singing,301s4r,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Well sometimes when I practice I sing ""Hey Jude"" by The Beatles,  and in the verse I am reaching for an F4, which is out of my comfortable chest voice range.   When reaching for it, I have tried pushing the larynx down, and having the sound resonate sort of around the throat, and it worked OK.  I have also tried to force the sound higher up and out the nose, which also worked OK.  Both of these methods give a little tension, but is one more right than the other? Or are they both wrong?"
singing,301s4r,ghoti023,2,Mon Mar 23 20:36:28 2015 UTC,"Neither are ideal, though I doubt you're in any immediate danger of harming yourself.  I would focus more on your breath, and not being afraid of your head voice. You may not perform the song in your head voice on that F, but strengthening your head and falsetto voices will strengthen and help risen your chest without working as hard. Plus, if you smooth over the break, that F may not sound too shabby and then also not feel tense."
singing,301s4r,Marnell_Sample,3,Tue Mar 24 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the perspective of a guy who has trained in this falsetto route, I found it never did anything for my full voice. It made my falsetto stronger and more efficient, but left the full voice untouched. The only benefit I can say it had is it helps you to see how the larynx can remain free, but you still have to relearn that free position in the context of full voice (which feels different than the free larynx in falsetto). A lot of guys I've talked to have gone through this same experience.   Strengthening the head voice (meaning still full voice, but just resonance in the head) is a must, though."
singing,301s4r,ghoti023,3,Tue Mar 24 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"For sure. A lot of younger singers here mic up falsetto and head voice to be the same thing, as an untrained head voice can sound similarly weak.  I've found working with my falsetto to be really useful in regards to eliminating tension (as well as choral singing), which is an important feeling to bring down to the modal register. In this case, I stand by recommending both to OP, though clarification should have been presented.  So yeah, we're on the same wavelength.  :)"
singing,301s4r,ViktorClay,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:07:42 2015 UTC,I think this is usually something widely debated. For instance scientists put falsetto/classical headvoice for females as the same register(m2) only diffrence is the closure of the folds. It's no diffrence for males and females. Modalvoice refers to the chest register(m1) wich is mostly sung by females in pop/rock. The thing is with a strong singer the diffrence between the two registers is minimal and overlap
singing,301s4r,Marnell_Sample,2,Tue Mar 24 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"/u/Frozime Key words you used here -- force. That's a big red flag you're doing something wrong. The voice should not be forced to resonate anywhere. It is allowed to resonate in various places, depending on how you shape the vowel and color the voice. You will notice that it resonates in a different place. Normally when people force their voice to resonate in a certain spot, they do it through tension.  You shouldn't push down the larynx either. The larynx will relax itself into a low position by itself if you allow it to let go before the breath. I cover that in this video.   To me, based on what you write, it just simply sounds like you haven't yet learned how to approach your upper range. Are you working with a teacher at all?"
singing,301s4r,xarahn,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"Sound shouldn't resonate around the throat. It should resonate in the mask of your face (mouth and nose cavities) and you should force from the diaphragm down below, never up in your throat.  Try to lighten up your tone at that F4, don't try to keep too much of your chest richness or you'll hurt yourself, lighten it up, you can even make it a bit nasally if it helps you, nobody will really notice."
singing,301s4r,xarahn,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"I see, thank you for your insight"
singing,301s4r,ghoti023,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"By the way when I said sound should resonate in the mask of your face I forgot to specify this was mainly true for higher notes, your lower register should resonate in the chest and the overall upper body, hence it's richness."
singing,301s4r,Marnell_Sample,6,Mon Mar 23 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"While that's true, if you use mask resonance on lower notes, they'll carry farther and still contain that richness. If you're using amplification that's not as much of a problem, so do what ya feel, but in an un-amplified setting, you still want to use mask resonance, even on lower notes. Using a bit of mask resonance in each area of your voice also makes your breaks less noticeable."
singing,301s4r,xarahn,2,Tue Mar 24 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"/u/xarahn I agree with /u/ghoti023 here. If you can get your lower notes to still resonate in the mask, that's when the voice has developed much more, and become much more free. The absolute lowest notes of your range -- maybe the lowest half octave of your range -- are the notes you won't feel in the mask (the bones of the cheeks and skull).   Also, even though the mask/head is the central point of where you are focusing the resonance, as it gets more developed, you will feel the entire body vibrating. When I sing a high note (or any note for that matter), I primarily feel it in my skull, but people have touched me and told me they can feel my entire back vibrating! I often can feel most bones in my body vibrating, from all the vertebrae in the neck and back all the way down to the pelvis and the femurs. But your primary goal is to get your larynx free and focus the tone properly in the skull -- the rest is a byproduct.  Believe it or not, the only time I ever feel the sound resonating in my chest dominantly is when I'm in falsetto! A big, hooty, falsetto OO."

singing,301s4r,heyitsliz,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:10:01 2015 UTC,Pushing larynx down doesn't help reaching high notes. Depending on what's the neutral position of your larynx and the sound you're aiming at it might be better idea to keep it still or even raise it slightly if you have problems on achieving high notes.

Up until 0:45 or so I could've believed you were the actual, professional singer for this track - you have nice tone, and your phrasing is great. What blows your cover is your tendency to go out of tune (generally sharp) as you approach the upper register, which you do almost every single time. I think if you maintain that relaxed attitude you display so well the verse as you sing higher it should fix that.  Also, your little turnarounds are well done, but that run at around 3:20 was too ambitious and really stuck out to me."

Very clear voice and you don't slur syllables together, which is great. I also agree with the sharp pitches as you hit higher registers, but in the grand scheme of things this isn't a big problem. You definitely aren't tone deaf, as you proved that in the early stages of the track, but if you can, try figuring out the pitches of the notes on a keyboard or something, and then playing the melody on the keyboard, then mimicking. That's what I would suggest at least (A keyboard can be substituted for any other instrument if you play guitar or something, doesn't have to be keyboard!)"

singing,3004yu,Hillo1212,2,Thu Mar 26 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"I've never read ""Music for Dummies"", so I can't give any advice on that I'm afraid, but what is definitely helpful is the ""AB Guide to Music Theory"" by Eric Taylor (There's two parts, so get part 1 obviously). It gives a complete breakdown from stuff like what the notes are called, and where they are on a piano, to more complex stuff like scales, harmonies and what not. Having an understanding of music theory will definitely help you, as being able to analyse a melody, and knowing how to pitch intervals (distance between two notes) will enable you to understand how a melody is constructed, and sing it that way, instead of just memorising a song.

singing,3004yu,loveandwars,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think, if I'm not wrong, head voice is more of the ""upper range"" of your chest voice, essentially. So with your chest your singing from your ""chest"" area literally, and/or your lower part of your voice (below the nose), and your head voice is resonating more around or ABOVE your nose if you're thinking about where the sound is coming from. I don't think I heard any FALSETTO in this ""silly"" cover, all your high notes are sung with head voice moreso I believe. Maybe someone can correct me on this if i'm wrong. 0:25 is a great example of a ""chest"" sound, and 0:20 on the high note ""try"" might be termed head voice I believe. Again, you didn't use falsetto at all in this I believe. Lastly, I think you could probably sing any song. You have great control and are on pitch, no need to limit yourself :D. And definitely don't worry about ""bass"" vs. ""tenor"". Those descriptors are used to describe a WHOLE voice en total, not specific registers of someone's voice (i.e. head, chest, falsetto).

singing,301c9z,enjarcher,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"What vowels are you using for your exercises? Different vowels require different adjustments, so it's important to practice on all vowels, since obviously actual words use lots of different vowels.   Also, on the flip side, practice with many different consonants, too. Words also have consonants so it's important to learn how to navigate through consonants.   I will say, though, that it's completely normal to be able to do things in a vocalise context that you can't do in performance, especially when it comes to range extremes. You just have lots of other things to think about when you're performing an actual song, and that can distract from the balance you need to really nail a high note or whatever. Best thing you can do is keep practicing until it's fully in muscle memory and you can focus on things like text and harmony."

singing,301c9z,keakealani,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the placement of ""g"" and ""k"", especially in English, is really far back. Try placing them closer to the front of your mouth on your hard palate, rather than on the soft palate the way we do in speaking. This will help your tongue come further forward which is in a more ideal place for singing on the vowel.   You can also try practicing releasing your consonants more quickly. One of my voice teachers always said that consonants must be ""quick, clean, and crisp"" - basically, you want to minimize the amount of time you're pronouncing the consonant so you can get back to singing on the tone, which is vowels."

The best way to learn grit is to not seek it, but to simply hone your belting game.  The way this is done is your folds get better at resisting air (feels like holding the breath - but you mustn't constrict yourself by ""trying"" to do it overtly) and thus you can sustain more weight into the sound higher up. You want to get good at this and then over time you will notice you can ""lean in"" more and more like gain on a guitar amp and get that distortion.  Best advice I have for you is this: Once you get it, it will probably feel very mild and small.  You will immediately WANT MORE AND MORE because you'll say ""damn it's not strong enough!"".  Don't do this.  Take what you can get and just take what you can get!

From the National Center for Voice and Speech's website: Q  Actresses like Demi Moore and Kathleen Turner have gravelly-sounding voices. They can't have laryngitis ALL the time. What gives? A Some actresses are well known for their low-pitched and slightly hoarse vocal quality and want to maintain this quality. This kind of chronic hoarseness or a gravelly-sounding voice quality is often an indication of chronic abuse and/or the presence of a vocal fold mass(es) like a polyp or vocal fold nodules. I have heard anecdotal evidence of an actress screaming daily just to maintain the husky voice and nodules. As a voice pathologist, I do not recommend trying this at home.  I've never seen/heard of a technique that actually isn't damaging to your vocal cords. There might be something out there, but the point is, if your singing is causing you even a little bit of pain, you are doing something wrong and shouldn't do whatever it was that caused it.

singing,2zx611,Entershakira,8,Sun Mar 22 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"When they aren't sensitive to the musical context.   I think there are a couple things that need to be specifically considered. One is the genre and performance practice. Some styles are very improvisatory by nature (da capo arias, jazz, R&B) and most of the time, adding a little riff or run is appropriate for those styles. However, other styles (straight classical, some musical theatre, others) are comparatively more rigid and adding extra notes would be inappropriate. This is why 99% of popular renditions of the Star Spangled Banner annoy me - it's not a pop song, it's an early 19th century classical tune (essentially - it was pop for the day, but we've absorbed those styles into the classical tradition in modern times). It was absolutely written at a time where improvising to that level is grossly inappropriate, and I still feel it's disrespectful to the original context of the song to turn it into a pop dick-measuring contest of runs and high notes.  The other important note is harmonic and structural context. This is probably the most guilty candidate when people do ""distasteful"" runs. It primarily has to do with harmonic rhythm. Because most runs exist within the same harmonic area (usually a dominant function), they must exist proportionally to the rest of the harmonic rhythm. You simply cannot add 6 beats of dominant with a half beat of pre-dominant prep and a short cadence and expect it to sound good. Again, this is style-dependent as some styles have much stricter expectations for harmonic structure, but the principle remains. Ironically, most pop music has significantly stricter harmonic rhythm than classical music (this is why the classical cadenza is a thing), so I think this actually applies more to pop music even though it's a more improvised tradition per point one.   Beyond that, of course, actual technical execution is important. A failed riff is never really pleasant. If you can't pull it off, don't do it. Otherwise it just looks like you're trying to distract from some other lack of skill."
singing,2zx611,keakealani,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"/u/keakealani While I think everything else you wrote is spot on, I must disagree with the point about the national anthem. Yes, it's a piece that was traditionally performed in a classical style, but music continues to evolve over time, and this song is no exception. You sing it in a way that appeals to the audience at hand. (I mean, they are your employers!) At most sporting events nowadays, most people don't want to hear the national anthem sung in the traditional way -- it puts people to sleep. At a more formal event, it would be more appropriate to sing it traditionally.   With that said, for the modern interpretations of the national anthem, I think it should still reflect some of the original feel and emotion of the song while being allowed to be updated for the 21st century. Many pop artists I hear do not do this well, and indeed, it just becomes a showcase of high notes and runs instead of enhancing the original piece of music. It's a hard balance to achieve."

I believe Simon Cowell used to tell people they were being ""indulgent"" when they did this. If you are singing O Holy Night, for example, you don't need to fill it with so many riffs/runs that nobody but you can sing it and the only way anyone can tell what you're singing is by the lyrics, because that's annoying."
singing,2zx611,gazork_chumble_spuzz,2,Sun Mar 22 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"Being ""tasteful"" with melisma really depends on the taste and abilities of each individual. The most important thing to think about, imo, is does it add or take away from the general feeling of the moment. If you're singing something and your instinct moves you into a lil riff then it's probably alright; but if you're doing it just because you can and you're losing the melody then it's probably gone too far.  Some ppl love Christina Aguilera and others think she's way overdone. Both are probably right because each is listening from their own point of view. I think sometimes she's great and other times she's just way over-indulgent.  Find what works for you and your style."
singing,2zx611,terrycotta,2,Sun Mar 22 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"In addition to what has been said, there are a few things that go into a run becoming distasteful:   It should not detract from the overall mood of the song. If you're singing a song about something sad, then you would tend to use more subtle runs and only have a big run as an ""exclamation point"" to capitalize what you are saying. It should flow with the instrumentation/arrangement. It doesn't matter how wonderful your ideas are, if they don't go with the chords that the musicians are playing under you or if you end up destroying the beat of a song to finish a run, you're doing it wrong! We should still realize that your song has lyrics. This is a trickier one to handle, because the more runs you do, the less attention you pay to the words. This really needs to be judged on a situation-by-situation basis, and it's something that you learn as an artist through trial and error. If it's a song where the WORDS are very integral to your message, then do fewer runs; if it's a standard song that people have heard a million times and will get bored with the traditional arrangement, then it's fine to add in some runs to keep your audience awake. In this latter context, it works well because you're throwing an element of surprise at your audience, and thus giving them an entertaining show. A run should add something to the song. You shouldn't do a run just to do a run and show off how fast you can move your voice or how many tonalities you can hear. It should add something to the music, either melodically or from an interpretational standpoint. For instance, doing a run on a melodic minor scale when you are singing about something involving angst or grief sounds great!  It should be relative to your audience's expectations. This is what /u/keakealani was hitting on. You need to gauge whether or not to do runs based on your audience at hand. For instance, in a musical theater or classical context, runs are generally not appropriate. In pop, you can do runs, but at the same time, you shouldn't do anything too complex because the average person listening to mainstream music doesn't have an ear developed enough to ""follow"" a complex run. If you're doing R&B, improvisational jazz, or gospel, runs are expected, especially more complex runs where you change tonalities, play with the rhythm, use large interval jumps, etc. Also, if you're performing for a crowd of young people, they generally like more runs than an older crowd. So, sing for your audience at hand. Runs should flow naturally into the next line of music. This goes back to not doing doing runs just because. Initially when you're doing runs, you're going to have to plan them out before to make sure they flow with the music well. This is part of developing your ear. A good run sounds like it could be a part of the natural melody. It accents the melody, kind of like using spices when cooking; it should not be the meat and potatoes of your performance. Sloppy runs are always distasteful. You should know precisely the notes and tonalities you are trying to sing. It should be clear as day in your mind. If not, it means you need to practice more, and practice more acapella at that.    Here is a clip I made for someone else where I go over some of these ideas about embellishment. You can hear how I took the standard melody as my foundation, and then added to it, like icing on a cake."

If I feel like it would have been in poor taste on an instrument,  it's poor taste to sing it.  How do you determine that?  Listen to music.  Too many singers don't actually listen to musicians to help develop of sense of taste.  Don't do much improvisation and melisma if you don't listen to a lot of other musical instruments besides singers,  or you'll end up sounding like a self absorbed Christina Aguilera."
singing,2zx611,keakealani,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:54:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is necessarily wrong, but I think it's a little misguided. Different instruments have different strengths and weaknesses, and what might sound good (or tasteful) in one instrument doesn't necessarily translate to another. Plus, I feel like there's a lot of inherent elitism in implying that listening to instrumentalists is inherently more musical than listening to singers. There are a lot of amazing and very musical singers, and a lot of shitty unmusical instrumentalists.   I definitely do agree that listening to music is a good way to curate and develop taste, and I very much advocate listening to a variety of different music with different instruments.   However, I feel that applying an instrumental standard to vocal music is not idiomatic and isn't a very good way of making a judgement call about something like improvisation or melismas. I think the ultimate guide for singers should be singing, and specifically with a similar instrument (i.e., similar voice type)."
singing,2zx611,Mattpilf,0,Mon Mar 23 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely  think a singer should listen to both.  While a singer and a saxophone can have different  licks,  the general taste of what's acceptable and what's distasteful and cheesy. If a riff is cheesy,  it's cheesy for  sax or voice. Technically  a lick  of an instrument might not work for a signer, but  that's a technical issue in which ones you can actually do.   Instruments are not some how superior,  but it's important to have a wide breadth of music to listen too if you want to make a judgement call on taste.  Like when I learned to improvise on the flute,  though I definitely  listened  to more flute playing than average,  I still listened to a bunch of saxophone,  trumpet,  guitar and etc....  All of which helped give me ideas of what to play, some of which were easier than others to emulate. There's a lot of cheesy stuff people do that some groups don't realize are considered in poor taste by many. There's a lot of great singers with good taste who have strong  influences by both instrumentalist and singers,  and that what one should strive for.  I just think there's a lot of famous singers who have poor taste than famous instrumentalist who have poor taste, and the best way to get a feel for that is to listen to a lot of types of music."
singing,2zx611,Marnell_Sample,2,Mon Mar 23 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"/u/Mattpilf Great points made here! While I do think it's good for singers to listen to many styles of music and also instrumentalists to help expand their musical ear, when it comes to doing runs from the perspective of a singer, I find that what an instrumentalist plays doesn't always transfer well to singing.  For instance, if you're scatting, you can normally copy most of what an instrumentalist does and it will sound good. However, trying to do the same things on runs often doesn't work. I had to learn this through trial and error, because I find myself thinking half like an instrumentalist, half like a singer. The big difference with singing vs. instruments is words. As soon as lyrics enter into the picture, things that worked on an instrument don't sound good on the voice, because you have to work around that. In general, I find you can copy the overall tonality with the voice and some of the rhythmic things instrumentalists do in phrasing, but beyond that, the voice is just different."
singing,2zx611,keakealani,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're making some pretty major assumptions. Idiomaticism really shouldn't be underestimated. And just saying that more singers have bad taste than instrumentalists reeks of prejudice.   It just doesn't follow that singers can rely on the judgement of instruments. We have our own needs and those needs are best observes directly, not haphazardly through a glorification of instrumental needs.   Then again, taste is subjective.

Unless you're not happy with the sound. I also think that the position of the larynx has more to do with the sound color and doesn't cause any damage as far as you don't keep it too low on your high notes or too high on your low notes."

If I may ask, how many degrees from accredited universities in vocal pedagogy do you have, and who are your principle instructors? What papers have you published/presented, and where? I would only be confident seeing such a method being advocated by someone with significant experience and respect in the field.

The trouble with something like singing is that literally everyone is different. The reason this sub tends to encourage every newbie to seek out a voice teacher is because that teacher will be able to work with that specific student's needs.  That's not to say that a ""singing app"" isn't a good idea, but the obvious inclusion (pitch stuff) is already done through the various ""tuner"" apps.

singing,2zw03b,PulpDood,2,Sun Mar 22 11:33:08 2015 UTC,It sounds to me like you take a note one or more octaves lower than the original singer. Transpositioning is common within music.
singing,2zw03b,RadishOnHardBread,1 point,Sun Mar 22 11:53:54 2015 UTC,"Hey there! As others have said, it definitely sounds like some type of harmony. See if you can't get next to a piano and figure out what notes you're singing compared to the actual song. If you play the two notes at the same time, you should hear that they still sound ""nice"". If they do, that's good harmony. (Most commonly, you're probably hitting an octave or a fifth lower than the original note, but which type of harmony you're using depends on the song, I would imagine.)   As for cigarettes/ecigs... Transitioning off of smoking is definitely a good idea, as your lungs won't get more damaged from smoke and have the ability to heal a little bit. Obviously your lungs are used for singing, so this is a good thing.  With ecigs, though, it depends. While the ""smoke"" may just be water vapor, I would still imagine that there's some type of chemical/flavoring compound in them. (Especially the ones that contain nicotine.) Depending on the chemical, it could have all sorts of weird effects. Drying out your mouth/throat, causing mucus to build up on vocal cords etc... - almost too many to mention. You said ""(ecigs) should be better for my health, but are they at all beneficial?"" I would say they're better for you than cigarettes, but probably aren't beneficial. Similar to those rock singers who drink/smoke to get their sound... Best bet would be not to smoke at all, but that's your decision.  Have fun singing!"

singing,2zuo41,Fallbourn,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the long-term effects of a cold can last quite a while, particularly if you weren't diligent with preventative measures.   If you haven't done so already, I'd recommend doing 24-48 hours of complete vocal rest (absolutely no talking, singing, whispering, humming, or making vocal noise of any kind). After this, gently and slowly warm up with gentle vocalises. This almost always brings my voice back after I've been ill or overworked my voice.   I also recommend this tea - there are lots of different home remedies, but this is the one that works best for me. But if you prefer another type of tea/soothing beverage that's fine too.   In any case, though, try to be gentle with your voice until it's fully recovered. Trying to keep singing when it is still swollen/sore is a good way to just cause more damage, so just take it easy on your voice and be very sensitive to discomfort or pain that might indicate you're doing something wrong."

singing,2zqfgm,YourFavoriteBaritone,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like I reference athletics a lot when talking about singing, but I think there are a lot of similarities. Quite frankly, athletics are just something we see more in mainstream media and culture, as something that requires a major lifestyle focus, dedication, and hard work. Maybe it's easier to see this process when it's more physical, like bodybuilding.   At any rate, though, I agree. I think it's important to take the focus that singing is a skill, not a ""talent"" - it's not something that you just turn on and become an expert in a day. And you're absolutely right that the process can be challenging and messy and frustrating, but those are also why singing can be such a rewarding process. If it was easy, then what fun would it be? Everyone would be an amazing singer and we wouldn't find it interesting or special.   Thanks for providing this perspective, though. I love hearing from singers who also have other hobbies/skills - I know that since I'm pretty much a ""music only"" person I don't have a lot of ways to relate to people who specialize in other areas, even though I think it's useful to approach things from different perspectives.

singing,2zq6ku,Marnell_Sample,4,Fri Mar 20 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"/u/indigolala Ok, it's like this. You have your real voice and your falsetto. Your real voice is what you speak in and also what you would use to call out to get someone's attention. It feels grounded, anchored, and connected. We can call this your full voice. Your falsetto feels like the polar opposite of that -- light and weightless. Correct head voice will still feel like your real voice, just that you will feel the resonance in the head. It might also feel like a slightly thinner version of your full voice.     So test #1 is does it feel connected. Test #2 is whether you can swell the volume on a given note without flipping or breaking. And I don't mean just swelling the volume of a hooty falsetto sound, but swelling the volume all the way into full voice. If you break or flip, that means you were in falsetto the whole time and suddenly had to transition into your real voice. If you can crescendo without flipping, it means you were in your real voice the whole time. This test will be very revealing in the range of your first bridge of E4-G4.     Hope that helps!"

My falsetto always feels like I'm relaxed and basically doing nothing to produce the sound, but with head voice I have to work a bit harder. I'm still working on my head voice stamina, because if I sing at a high volume then after a while my voice wants to relax into my falsetto, so I can definitely identify which is which."

singing,2zr669,MegaSuperAwesome1214,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, please (re)read this article. Being ""cut out to be a singer"" is 100% about perseverance, practice, and self-understanding, not about how good of a singer you are right now. I can speak for most of this subreddit when I say that most of us sounded pretty terrible as beginners. The worst thing you can do for your singing career (hobby or professional as it may become...) is to quit now and psych yourself out about it. In fact, this current thread also has some great advice.     That being said, I think you're at a really good age to consider looking at studying voice in college, at least if you think you're serious enough to want to pursue it on that level. You probably won't get into a tippy top conservatory as a beginner, but you could look into a community college or smaller university to get some training before trying to apply to a higher-level program. I currently attend a small state university and our community college system trains many people who have zero formal training to get into the university and earn professional-level degrees in music. You may need to expect a longer haul for college to get the level of training you'd need for a degree, but if you're willing to go through that, you may be able to get some very high level training at an in-state tuition rate. Financial aid and scholarships are often available, especially if you are financially needy, so your personal cost may be extremely low for a very good education.   I also want to point out that you're not that far behind, as a singer. I started formal lessons when I was 16 and I know a number of people who started lessons as late as college. Singing is not like many other instruments where you start learning at 4 or 5. In fact, because your instrument doesn't fully mature until your late 20s or so, there's not a lot of benefit to learning many aspects of vocal technique before that process is well on its way. Most voice teachers that I've talked to don't take students younger than 14 or 15 exactly for this reason. So for the most part, people have a maximum of maybe 3 years of lead time.   And that all being said, there are other resources to take advantage of, and I would recommend that rather than trying to self-teach and give yourself lots of bad habits.   The biggest is choir. Nowadays choirs are increasingly popular. If your school has a choir, definitely join that. Look for community choirs in your area. Many are free other than maybe purchasing music and basic concert attire (things like black slacks and a black top, most of the time, which you probably already own or would find useful). Even if you're not religious, churches and other places of worship often have open choirs that will welcome you as long as you can commit to their schedule.   Also, consider studying other elements of singing that are important later. If you don't already know how to read music, learn! Check out /r/musictheory and musictheory.net for some other music theory topics that are extremely helpful for singers.   Learn a language (or several). If you plan to study music at the collegiate level or go into any kind of classical singing, a working knowledge of French, German, and Italian is pretty much requisite. Memrise and Duolingo are two online-based resources for language learning. You can also consider learning IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) - the Wikipedia articles are fairly comprehensive and there are other resources online and in books. This is the main system singers (and linguists) use for communicating diction concepts, so it's worth knowing at least a little bit!  Most importantly, though, please keep in mind that a positive attitude can go a long way. Age is not an issue for you, I promise. My university has many students who are much, much older than you who came to singing at a later time and they're still toughing it out and doing great things vocally. I think it's a uniquely teenager phenomenon to believe that your life's prime is at 18, but let me tell you, that's not true. You have 80% of your life ahead of you (at least!) so don't cop yourself out by thinking you have to be perfect today."

First off, so I don't repeat myself too much here, thank you in particular for your encouragement in the third and last paragraphs of your post, they really helped me! Replying to a couple of points now;  I am going to university in Ontario, Canada, and while training lightly at a CC with the intention of future advanced studies intrigues me, my options are a bit more limited. There are two other colleges/universities in the town I'll be moving into, and neither offer an applied music program. I've looked into what's offered around town and can either: go for private lessons if I end up having extra cash (not that likely); or go into an applied music program that my university has for non-music students. They recommend RCM grade 8 in voice, which I'm a bit worried about, but it might be my best shot at professional training in university. I've been told that it's a little bit flexible anyway, but as an aside, do you happen to know how advanced RCM grade 8 is?  Thank you for all these alternative suggestions! I'll stop trying too hard to self teach myself now. I'll look around and see if any nearby churches have some choirs, since my school's choir director is very laissez-faire about technique.  I'd actually consider myself already well-versed in music theory already. Not sure how justified this is, but I read/write sheet music and haven't often found myself lost in technical music conversation with friends (concerning intervals, chord structures and harmonies, specifically). Thank you for putting this in, though, because it really helped to remind me that I'm not totally lost.  I've got a functional understanding of French (Canadian woo) and had been learning German on duolingo a couple months previously, but gradually fell out of it. If it's something I can do to further my singing, I'll pick it up again! Learning the IPA sounds like a really useful thing to do, too!  Your whole last paragraph is great, but   I think it's a uniquely teenager phenomenon to believe that your life's prime is at 18, but let me tell you, that's not true.   this made me chuckle. Thanks again and again. I'll be getting back on the positive pony now. :) Sorry for any strange wording/incoherence, it's late."
singing,2zr669,keakealani,1 point,Sat Mar 21 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm really glad you're on your way - and I do hope you find a college situation or some other way to pursue your singing.   But seriously, don't underestimate the skills you do have! Being strong with music theory and already knowing French is a big deal. Definitely both things I would have killed to have when I started college =P   Anyway, I get that it's easy to become discouraged if you can't pursue your dreams right here and now, but I think if you search around, you'll find a way. Best of luck, and please feel free to ask any more questions you might have :)"

Singing is a lot like getting in shape, if you go to the gym as a beginner and try lifting way too much and show off rather than doing the right things you will see no results. Good technique does not happen over night, and it will not always sound good. The key is to relax and move on, figure out what was wrong and don't get frustrated. If you keep listening to your teacher and practice you will see improvement. Don't get down on yourself for things like: not having the range you want or not singing as well as you want, those things will come with time and practice. If you find yourself in a rut while practicing, take a few minutes break to refocus your mind and come back to it or move on to something else. Record all of your lessons, that way you can track your progress. I know a lot of times I get caught up in the grind of practicing and those tapes are a good reminder of where I came from and how much progress I have made. Finally always keep those long term goals in your mind. The people who are truly successful at things that take a long time always have that long term goal in mind. If you focus too much on your short term failures you will never see your long term progress. Stick with it! Happy singing!"

singing,2zp7cv,WayFastTippyToes,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"It happens to everyone. I've just recently had a series of ""off"" lessons - between midterms piling up and some personal stuff going on, I've been anything but my best the past couple of weeks. So I totally feel you.  That being said, if possible, I really recommend trying to connect with your teacher on a personal level. Not in a creepy way, but develop good enough rapport to be open when you're feeling unconfident or things just aren't coming out the way you intended. I promise you, voice teachers (at least, all the ones I know) are not horrible people who want to make you feel bad - they're rooting for you to succeed. Hopefully by 15 lessons you've already determined that your teacher is not a monster and is a pretty good fit for you.   But teachers are also not mind-readers. They sometimes can't tell the difference between you having an off day or losing confidence, and just an unprepared student or a misfit in the student-teacher relationship. I know this is really, really hard for a shy person (I'm a total introvert so I do get this), but try to open up and just say ""you know what, I don't feel like I sang my best in my last lesson. How can we find ways to help me be more confident?"" If you can, maybe shooting an email is a good way to communicate this without having to physically talk to your teacher (I know for me that's often much easier and less stressful).   I think your teacher would love to find ways to make you feel more confident and help you address any performance anxiety issues, but you do need to tell them."

singing,2zn8a7,abletoinconceive,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Cool song, you sound quite a bit like Gorgol Bordello. Seems like you're really trying to bring the resonance forward which is good. You are a bit nasally, but that is definitely ok and can be a good thing. For some reason you are pitchy in a lot of places. This may be stylistic but it seems like you may have developed a tiny habit of ""sliding"" to find the pitch. I would suggest on focusing on your vowel, you seem to accentuate the consonants which can really squeeze the sound and make it easy to go off pitch. Dug the song though man good luck in the future!"

It sounds like some problems are coming from they way you shape your vowels. Listen to ""but i want you""... 2nd verse: ""and i can't go back"", stuck out to me among a few others. Now listen closely to your chorus. You have a good sense of pitch but seem to ""slide"" around to get there. A good example is ""you'll make it now"". Sliding around like this can be a cool effect, but it has to be done very confidently and forward. But honestly, all of this could have been on purpose to sound more like the original song, whose male vocals I'm really not too impressed by. You have an excellent voice I look forward to hearing more."

Judging from your voice, the tone is definitely suitable for ballads, and maybe by really knowing the language will help you enunciate better (Korean vowels can be tricky).

If not then maybe use vowel modification for your ""eye"" (defy) and flavor it with ""ih"" as in ""it"".

If something hurts, feels bad or makes you hoarse then the technique is wrong. It's also important to always ensure that you can sing with clean voice too so that the grit doesn't get permanent. If you want to sing with grit, it's safer to use distortion than creaking as it's made with false cords, not vocal cords."
singing,2zoa9j,ViktorClay,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:00:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree, creaking is not more dangerous that distortion(falsefolds) It all depends on the singer, falsefolds are dangerous because there's alot more effort going into pushing them together. If you place that effort wrong(you push on the real folds) it's when you see the singers coughing ect. So it's all about the affinity of the singer wich one is more suited.  In terms of danger neither one's of these are harmfull if you follow a good routine and know how to train it. The problem occurs when people just try and have no clue"

There are some people who are naturally gifted with the ability to really accurately hear pitch and match it. You're not one of them, and that's ok. What we call ""the ability to sing"" is really a bunch of little talents that all add up to a good voice and I am a firm believer that anyone willing to work on those talents CAN acquire them.  With that said, a proper voice teacher will work wonders. Other people will be able to recommend good online courses, I'm sure, and you can certainly improve drastically just by learning a few basics and practicing them- but a voice teacher will be able to tailor their classes to your abilities and fields of interest, and help you with things that you otherwise wouldn't know you're doing wrong. They can explain concepts in different ways in case you don't get it the first time.  If you truly don't want to shell out the money (I know it can be a lot, depending on your income level), then keep coming to places like this sub, get feedback, post video and audio.

If it doesn't feel nice and your voice starts to crack, don't force it. Resting can be good, too. I sometimes wait until the symptoms are lessened/gone before I start singing, resting every other day or a few days until I feel better, or take anti-histamine pills (these can dry out your vocal chords). The best tip for any singers, I think, is to keep yourself well-hydrated (lots of room-temp water or warm herbal tea with no sugar), and that applies the same to allergy sufferers. Don't shout, and don't whisper too much. Most of the basics of singing are covered in the FAQ section, and if you could afford a singing lesson and a competent vocal coach, please do so. Even with some physical limitations, you can still learn proper singing techniques and vocal manipulations -- as your body as a whole is the body of your wind instrument. If you're serious about singing (professionally or not) you can start training at any age. The younger you start the more time you can learn to become a more experienced singer. I wish I had started sooner as well."
singing,2znv6i,Terransloth,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"I am a life-long allergy sufferer. (Like, so bad the last time I was tested at an allergist, they were actually surprised a single person could be so allergic to so many things.) My best advice there is to get your allergies under control from a medical standpoint - I take a daily antihistamine and I'm looking into allergy shots (but can't afford the time/money right now) and that's probably the best you can do. It's possible to sing with some allergic symptoms, but as you know it doesn't help to be constantly suffering and the better you can manage it, the more successful your singing will be.   Puberty is rough on everyone, from a vocal perspective. And the voice is one of the last things to finish maturing - most people's voices don't fully settle until the late 20s or early 30s, so don't be surprised if things continue to shift and change over the next several years.   But because of this, there's no sense in waiting until everything is completely settled - if you want to start singing more seriously, I would definitely recommend starting lessons ASAP - I started at around 16 and that was just fine for me even though my voice was going through some major shifts at that time. A good voice teacher will understand how to healthily work with your voice and still let it grow normally. Basics like breath support don't require a fully mature instrument anyway.   The best singing technique I recommend is the one that works for you. That might sound silly, but everyone's voice is different so I don't believe there's a ""one size fits all"" approach that works for everyone. The best thing you can do is work closely with a qualified voice teacher to learn about your own personal instrument and use it in a way that is healthy, sustainable, and beautiful. How you get there is as varied as stars in the sky.   I would recommend not worrying about voice type or range right now. As I mentioned, your voice has a long ways to go before it will be settled, and range can change drastically while it's still futzing around. Just sing in whatever you consider a comfortable middle range and adjust as your voice changes.   Sounding groggy can be a combination of lots of factors. Allergies can be one, and colds and coughs are another. Environmental factors like weather (holy crap the vog in my area is completely insane right now and destroying my voice) and pollen/pollution/air particles can definitely affect how your voice sounds and feels. Ultimately, you just have to learn to respond to your body's needs and rest your voice if it is tired or inflamed. Grogginess could mean anything from mild vocal fatigue to the beginning of a cold to actual vocal damage, but it's usually something to just monitor and contact a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist.   As far as pursuing singing - do what you love! If that's singing, then do it. Definitely evaluate what you want to get out of singing - do you plan to major in voice performance in college, become a professional singer, or sing as a general hobby? This can affect how you approach things, but in all cases I do think it's worth exploring lessons and other ways of getting better guidance. If you start early you can begin developing good habits rather than having to break years of bad habits if you get serious down the line. I really wish I had started lessons earlier for this reason, so I can't help but pass along that advice.   Anyways, best of luck in whatever you pursue! :)"
singing,2znpqe,TheSkylsFalling,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"That's basically the function of breath support. A lot of people think breath support is about the inhalation, but it's really about controlling the exhalation.   The trick is to use those lower breath muscles to control the amount of air that comes out. If you think about the muscles you use for a low, controlled exhalation, you will basically use the opposing group for exhalation.   I like to think of breath support as a balance of inhalation and exhalation, with the balance tipped slightly toward exhalation. In other words, even though air is leaving, you should still feel like you are expanding your body like an inhalation, as much as possible, with a relaxed, suspended rib cage and a feeling of gentle buoyancy. You should never feel like exhaling involves pushing or clenching the air out, but rather letting the air come out naturally.   There are other visualization techniques and I'm sure folks will be around here to post other options, but that's what works for me. Hope that helps! :)"
singing,2znpqe,keakealani,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:37:28 2015 UTC,"Huh? Compare it to holding your breath. When you ""hold"" your breath, first you inhale and then your muscles contract on the hold. Breathing is just like this except you are phonating instead of holding, and your NATURALLY tense abs are slowly deflating. This is extremely simple when you understand it.  Also, you should never try to forcibly expand or push out your stomach. All that does is use muscles that aren't related to breathing.  The fact that your having to ""try"" to breath properly, means your doing it wrong. The mechanism is universal, all your learning is how to inhale fully and then only sing while you still have air from that inhale, and never to sing without having a full breath."

As far as ideal practice times, I'm hardly an expert, but I would start with 20-30 minutes total per day, doing enough warm ups to feel loose and using the remaining time singing. Then slowly build up length of time to an hour or so a day (if you want to make your practice time longer) paying close attention to how your voice feels. If it starts hurting or gets tired feeling, stop for the day."

Be silent and sleep well."
singing,2zj273,mistacorn,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:19:08 2015 UTC,"When I first discovered my mix, I was very confused as I started hitting notes I normally couldn't, but I didn't feel the normal strain that came with it.  It was confusing.  I also didn't have the the vocal coordination yet to keep it together and my mix was very raspy and broke apart a lot.  I knew about mix voice though, and kept singing through it in the hopes that that's what I was discovering.  Over the next few months, I kept working on it, and the tone got clearer and clearer, and the raspy-ness started going away (unless I wanted it, in a Stephen Tyler kinda way).  As I got more into it I realized that one thing I was doing really wrong was using too much power and breath to sing in mix.  At first it's really hard to keep the notes together, but you can kind of offset that by pushing the air through really hard (this is why your belly and chest hurt).  If you want to keep expanding your range, you have to do so with the compensation of losing a little bit of fullness in your voice.  A lot of vocal instructors call this ""dropping the weight"".  If you hold on to that weight from your chest register and lay it on thick in mix, yeah you get a nice thick mix sound, but you also have a hard time maintaining it or driving it higher.  If you listen very close to some of your favorite artists, you'll notice their voices thin out a bit as they go higher as well, and it's perfectly normal.  I know it sometimes can feel like you want that huge sound up really high, but it's very demanding and you won't be able to do it for very long if you don't compromise a bit.  The great thing about mix, is that when you learn to use it, you'll never strain your voice anymore, so you can practice every day and be fine.  This helps tremendously in building a great vocal sound in only a few months as opposed to when you first learned to sing in chest and the strain from the high notes caused you to need to rest for a few days to heal or made you lose your voice.  It's different for everybody, but it sounds like you are on the right track."
singing,2zj273,FrannehR,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:53:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is a little random. I have a question.  I'm kinda new to singing and I'm not too sure what mixed voice is supposed to feel like. I can do a higher range than my chest voice, and it feels like a hollow version of a chest voice. However, it's really weak and airy. It sounds and feels like I'm whispering while singing. Is this mixed voice or head voice? Male btw."
singing,2zj273,Nght12,2,Fri Mar 20 01:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's probably neither.  It's hard to say for certain without hearing, but it seems to me like you're just singing in falsetto.  Your head voice is similar to falsetto, but in head, you sing in a way where you compress your vocal chords so that ""airy"" sound goes away.  This also helps build up strength and more tone.  Mix is a mix between chest and head (and activating your pharyngeal gland).  You need to experiment with your voice.  I think a major thing about mix is that when you first start to learn to sing in it, it's very loud, and a lot of people are afraid to belt it out like that or don't have a place they can do it without bothering other people.  You'll know when you find mix for the first time because it will be much louder than you normally have ever sung in your chest, head, or falsetto, and it will feel uncontrollably loud at first until you learn to start using those muscles better."

singing,2zitlw,Piano_Freeze,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"All I can say is breath support, breath support, breath support. Also maybe mixed voice, but that's generally used for adding chest-voice power into head-voice, not the other way around. I'm sure there's a way to make that work, too, though, hahaha.  My problem area is right around F-F#4 (in a choral setting) depending on how puberty decides to treat me that day, and at 15 I'm sure you're familiar with that feeling! hahaha  I don't know what settings you're singing in (Choral, solo, a band, etc.), but I do know that my chest range tends to vary solely based on the amount of breath support I can use and not be inappropriately loud or solo-y for the setting. For example, I top out on chest voice at an A4, but in a choral setting, the amount of air I have to use to reach that note healthily is unacceptable for blending into my group.   I don't know if that's your problem, but I know that what I described is certainly what happened to me when I was getting used to singing Tenor voice parts.   I know this reply is all over the place, and I'm sorry. Exams have me kinda scatterbrained, hahaha. One last thing, though- practicing that area will help so much on its own. Your throat has (basically) muscles which can be trained (hopefully the right way) and allow you to hit notes reliably. Just be CAREFUL and don't strain yourself. Forcing yourself when you're at a problem spot in your range is SOOO unhealthy! Good luck!!"
singing,2zitlw,YourFavoriteBaritone,2,Thu Mar 19 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, this, D or E4 are probably OP's second passagio and the transition to head voice isn't smoothed out yet. This is probably the hardest part of one's range to master.  I have the same problem at G4. Something that helped me is doing exercices with the ""gn"" sound. You can usually sing fine up to near that second passagio, and still sing fine past it as well. Try to ""place"" that note in your nose, make it a bit more nasal, it won't really be noticeable unless you make it super obvious, but to me it really helps make the note less shakey and, usually, easier to maintain.   With time muscle memory will kick in and the bridge will connect smoothly. Keep practicing the correct way and don't strain yourself. Time and efforts will reward you."

When your voice breaks like this you're suddenly relaxing the old muscle group, and shifting all the effort to the new one, which causes this massive contrast in sound.  In my case it helped to start off really quiet, and keep doing sirens until I was able to eliminate the break. This didn't take me too long, but translating that into singing without breaks took much longer. Now, after many months of practicing songs that lie around this break I'm getting pretty consistent at doing it, and now I'm seeing that I can increase the volume of my singing quite a bit."

singing,2zgb9g,A_Freudian_slip,8,Wed Mar 18 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"It's really the base of how you should breathe when you sing. Basically, if your shoulders are moving up when you inhale, you aren't taking a deep breath and you are tensing your neck/shoulder muscles for nothing. You have to take a deep breath in and feel/see your belly and your lower ribcage expanding.   Now, the anatomical way this works better is because your lungs don't really expand or deflate on their own. Instead, your body changes the pressure on them to make the air flow. When you inhale, your body needs to lower the pressure by increasing the volume of your lungs. The way to do that is by contracting your diaphragm, a muscle that has the shape of a long stripe under your lungs and above your abdomen. It is straightened and pushes down on your organs, which is why you see your belly inflating. Other secondary muscles help expanding your lungs further, like the ones between your ribs. when all these muscles are working, your lungs expand and air passes through your trachea into them. Exhaling is the exact process but in reverse. Muscles relax, lungs' volume decreases, air flows out."

I can say a few things, though.  It seems like the vast majority of science claims that the dairy -> increased mucus is a myth, and there haven't been any good studies that show any increase in mucus production, although there are a ton of other factors and some people could still be affected.   By contrast, the two biggest actual factors that are important for singing are hydration, and acid reflux, on opposite sides of the spectrum. Dehydration does greatly affect singing, primarily because it affects the viscosity of the mucus membranes that surround and protect your vocal folds - overly thick mucus can reduce its ability to protect and lubricate the folds, leading to excessive friction and therefore irritation.   Acid reflux can cause big issues if the acid actually reaches the larynx, but even irritation in the trachea can have an effect on the vocal folds. Basically it's just important to control gastrointestinal issues because once it gets to true reflux stage you're kind of in a bad place.   Beyond that, it's entirely personal preference. Some people do have issues with other various foods for whatever reason, so it sometimes just takes experimenting to figure out if you react poorly to certain foods.   Also caffeine and alcohol deserve mention for their actual mental alteration properties. It really depends on the context and how you react to them, but they can be problematic in performance. I know personally too much caffeine makes it difficult for me to control tempos accurately because I get a little bit jittery. Alcohol can also create issues for performance. I would personally recommend staying away from both during a major performance, but it is really a matter of preference."

They had the same discussion: playing sober or not. They decided to test it 'scientifically', so they played two gigs after each other. The first one absolutely sober and the next one on all the alcohol, weed and drugs they could take. Then they listened to recordings of the concerts, and agreed that they were actually equally well performed. Conclusion: It sounds just as good, and it was much more fun on drugs, so that's what we'll do. After wasting 15 years as an alcoholic and drug addict my friend got sober, and started a new life. He was lucky, many of the other band members do not live today.  Well, I am the last to preach against alcohol, as I do like a beer or two and good party times and everything. But my advise to everyone is: Find another cure for nerves, and another method to come in the right mood for music, than drugs and alcohol.

I come from a classical tradition where signs of intoxication on stage is absolutely not appropriate. But again, I'm not saying it's always bad, I just think it's important to make smart decisions.   All that said, I do think many people use alcohol as a crutch to deal with stage nerves, and justify it by saying it makes them perform better. In my experience, this is not true or helpful. There are exceptions, but it does concern me to see people going to great lengths to justify that crutch. And for the record, I feel the same way about the use of beta blockers and other performance-enhancing drugs, even those used in classical contexts.

I actually have ""silent acid reflux"" and only was getting it while I was sleeping because I'd go to bed right after eating. I was also eating stuff like pizza and sweets, which can cause more acid to be produced.   As far as dairy goes, I've been eating it lately, I really don't notice a difference at all. My doctor said some people are allergic to it which causes phlegm production, and that it's not an allergy that can be tested for, it's not like being lactose intolerant.   In general, avoid getting acid reflux, which will cause throat/vocal cord inflammation and possibly even cancer. You'll need to figure out if certain foods cause it for you, everyone is different. Making sure you're not overweight and in shape will help."

They're simply missing one of the most important factors in singing, which is reacting to your unique voice.   Not only is everyone's voice different just in terms of sound, but everyone comes to singing with different issues. And while there are some general principles of good singing, how to get there is different based on where you're coming from. If you tend to have a breathy, unsupported sound, you'll need a different method than if you tend to push your voice with tension. And for many issues, it takes an experienced ear to even identify the exact problem, much less instruct you on how to solve it.   In other words, particularly if you're planning on spending money on a program anyway, getting a few lessons from a qualified voice teacher (not a coach) would definitely be your best bet and would give you a much better foundation than a program.   And from a cursory overview, those programs mostly seem to range from dubiously helpful to downright scammy, to me.

Ofcourse, I could try and find someone online that might be cheaper, but that feels like an even bigger gambling since it's way too easy to perform a scam online, but if anyone knows of a good source for online voice/singing teachers I'd happily accept tips! :-)    Yeah, I agree with your statement about the feeling they give off, Singorama especially feels just like one of those TV-sales-shows where they just talk a lot of crap and giving impossible promises ^    I have been testing out the demo of listening singing teacher and while it would greatly need someone who speaks english better for the instructions, it still feels like it actually could contain something of help/use (even for one such as myself), though it's way to early to tell yet :-)    Once again, thanks for your input!"

singing,2z86rc,Marnell_Sample,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"/u/s4mur4j3n     I would have to second what /u/keakealani said here. I know self-study programs are becoming more and more popular in this do-it-yourself age; I've used many such singing programs myself. However, I will tell you that you will save yourself a LOT of time and frustration if you just simply took a couple of lessons with a good voice teacher. Even if you just took one lesson a month, that would be better than nothing, because you're getting REAL TIME feedback on your habits, which is something that a self-study program cannot give you.     The big problem with self-study programs is that you won't know when you're doing the exercises wrong! Even though they give you demonstrations of the incorrect way in the programs, you will still think you're doing it correctly, even though it's wrong. I've seen this happen to countless students over the years who have been using such programs, myself included.     If doing lessons infrequently with a teacher, then at least try to find someone who is familiar with one of the programs you want to get. Take at least one lesson with that person before you start the program, so that they can tell you what your specific problems are and the best way to use the exercises in the program. Then after you've worked with the exercises for a bit, say maybe a month or two, check in with that teacher for another lesson as a progress update, because as you develop your voice, new habits (some good, some bad) will arise, and they need to be addressed.     If you're looking for an online teacher, I teach lessons online. You can learn more at Vocal Liberation or just ask questions here. I could also recommend you to some other online teachers who are good if you like. By the way, I am currently offering a free vocal assessment, so take advantage of that if you like."

The others look okay, and might help, but I would just suggest getting a vocal coach for a bit to get the basics down. I know this doesn't answer your question though. I did a dvd program for singing that ran me $300 and I didn't improve much. Then I got a vocal coach, and the immediate feedback of what I was doing wrong has helped so much. I'm still taking lessons, but now when I read tips and tricks on the internet I can apply them because I have my basics down.  Whatever you end up going with, good luck!"

What we seem to lack is a (group of) developer capable of writing a application interpreting the sound of different voices based on the knowledge that voice-teachers possess. I wouldn't be surprised if most voice-teachers are reluctant to assist in the development of such software since most people are lazy and would rather stay at home rather then get their sorry asses to a class if they can get what they need from a software.   So keep on shaking that head of yours ;-)    edit: It's not magic that voice-teachers are doing, if it was, then I would accept it being impossible for a computer to replace a voice-teacher."
singing,2z86rc,Marnell_Sample,2,Tue Mar 17 11:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid it doesn't make sense.   Computers are good at lots of things. They are notoriously bad at other things. ""Contextual intelligence,"" perhaps the most crucial skill for voice teachers (among other coaching, teaching, or mentoring professionals).  Interpreting data, a critical component of contextual intelligence, is also not a forte of computers.   Voice teaching is not a mystery--the best practices have been handed down for quite a while. There's not much truly new information published each year.   There is a reason that all athletic coaching in solo sports is done by people and not by computers. You're not going to get to any remotely professional level of swimming, archery, cycling, etc. etc. through the interpretation of a computer. Technological tools can aid in the perception part, as you've pointed out--but that's not the hard part.   So yes, I will continue to shake my head when people who know little about both singing and computers confidently proclaim the latter can fix the former."
singing,2z86rc,WayFastTippyToes,-1,Tue Mar 17 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be a difficult task for a computer to solve, the hard part is that we often overlook things needed to solve something (things we do subconsciously or we do more out of reflex rather then focusing our mind on) and computers only do what we tell them to do. A human doesn't need to be told to take something into account when figuring things out, if we know it we can apply it, whereas a computer must be told explicitly what to do or not.    One of the reasons why athletic coaching is done by humans is also that there are a lot of holes in our knowledge about it so a lot of it comes down to the coaches trying different things out until they find what works for the different individuals. Could this be done by a computer? Well... yes. But it all comes down to one thing; A computer can only do what it is told to do.    And one of the largest issues in programming is that the programmer him-/herself might not understand the issue and the solutions to the fullest and only makes the application do what they've been told to make it do. And the amount of misunderstandings and bad communications that happens (daily) between the developers and the ones ordering the code is terrifying, resulting in applications doing far less then what it was supposed to do. This is one of the reasons why many underestimate what you can and cannot do with a computer.    Which is why singled out issues (such as pitch/tone and strength) are easy for a developer to provide tools for since there really isn't that many variables they need to understand/know of."

If you're looking at a beginner choir, reading music will probably not be necessary, although I completely agree with /u/TheChurchofHelix that it's very helpful if you have the chance to brush up on the basics. At the very least, just be aware of how music notation works (the dots moving up means the pitch gets higher, going down means the pitch gets lower, that kind of stuff) so you can follow along with your music even if you're not super comfortable reading music.   I would also just say to really get familiar with your voice and be willing to do a variety of things with it. Just doing some sirens sliding around your range and basic scales can help you feel comfortable singing and know what it feels like to sing.

I'm a novice too, but from what I can see the style of the piano and the key it's in doesn't match your voice well. You would sound better accompanied by a strings instrument. I think that you could benefit from the ""CAROL"" warmup. You try and say carol without pronouncing the r and then overemphasize the l. The middle of the tongue should be up and touching the roof of the mouth. You should sound very country and a little wierd. After this try constricting your throat slightly and making short and quick animal chirps and laughs(it shouldn't take much effort).

Your voice goes in and out in some parts, it gets really low. I can't see you, but I suggest you drop your jaw more when you are singing notes that feel uncomfortable for you.

singing,2z82rl,gandlethorpe,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"25M  Really trying to figure out how to properly use my upper register. I feel very insecure when singing around E4-F#4, but above that, I can get some pretty strong resonance. However, I'm still not sure if I'm actually achieving head voice, or if it's just strong falsetto. So I have two issues:  1) When I sing higher, is it actually head voice? 2) If it is, how do I get there from my lower register? My voice seems to want to either strain/yell or flip into a weaker breathy voice when I approach E4.  I have two recordings. The first is Lately by Stevie Wonder, at least the final chorus when he goes to a higher key. This is generally what my higher register sounds like when I can stay above F#4. The part where I go flat on ""my eyes won't let me hide"", is me trying to stay in chest voice.  The second is Everybody's Changing by Keane. This one spends more time straddling the uncomfortable area. It was pretty exhausting constantly shifting."

The barely there whispering part of your voice works for that, but there needs to be more parts with strength to emphasize those parts. Volume helps, but also you need to sing below your lungs and above your stomach, not your head . Try pressing your diaphragm and solar plexus when you get to parts where you want more power."

The second verse is sung more freely and confidently, and the outro ends with the mother nodding off.  https://soundcloud.com/steve-smith-69/panis-angelicus  EDIT: 48 Male.

It's hard to give you comments because it all depends on what exactly you're trying to improve. Many singers have this type of voice and make a living out of it so it's hard to tell.

To start off singing you should envision your voice as a resounding and echoing tool. Start by standing stright with your shoulders back, feet straightly planted, and body stretching as far up as possible. Breathe up and out of the pit of your stomach. Your chest should not move for this. Next try to speak with your tongue stiff and sticking completely out off your mouth.  It exercises your throat.

Some people can and some people need to work to do it. You want to exercise your stomach and diaphragm so that they become stronger and more stable. Work on putting your body in different positions and taking slow and deep breaths. See where you feel it. Try to access feelings in different organs and core muscles. This should help you get used to the origin of different sounds."

When I heard it I envisioned a cartoon and then you multiplying with the cartoon as you added the backup vocals. It's not terrible at all. You need to know that the only places you need to fix are the parts with hard ""I"" sounds like cry and mine. You start sliding down and up the scale and it throws everything off. You are correct in analyzing your mistakes. Your tone is... different. Good different, because I really liked it. I don't hear this song being covered that way usually and it was really enjoyable. You made it sound more lighthearted and playful. I will offer one warning though, some might not like it that way because this is supposed to be a emotional song. So a tip for that is on the ""cry""s split it into two notes and on each note descend half an octave(make it deeper)."

singing,2z7nqq,randomusername76,3,Mon Mar 16 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. Voices are classified in a few different ways, depending on style. In most of the CCM (contemporary commercial music) world, voices are defined by range, if at all, but it's not particularly important. In the classical choral system, it's by range.   In the classical solo singing world, it's by range and timbre, and there are several subdivisions within a range (lyric baritone, dramatic baritone, etc.). In this context, having a timbre that doesn't match any type (or ""fach"") within your range is not typical, and almost certainly denotes some technical problem or other."

Forgetting to make this distinction is almost always counter-productive."
singing,2z7nqq,ottentj1,5,Tue Mar 17 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's technique. You simply havent learned to use your upperrange yet, regardless if your a baritone or tenor with good technique you can atleast have up to an octave higher in fullvoice(chest/belt). So start getting a Grasp on technique it's certainly worth it.  Also if you havent tamed your toprange it's no use speculating if your a tenor or baritone."

singing,2z7nqq,enjoysinging,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yes it is possible, because that's how my voice is. My range is clearly a mid/high tenor but my phonation is more of a compressed/belty sound that a baritone has., vs a floaty tenor.  There are other types of mixed voices. A bari-tenor that's closer to a low tenor, and baritones that have lighter qualities."
singing,2z7nqq,Mattpilf,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yes,  but there's a lot to consider.  Age,  and training are two huge ones.  If you are under 30, you probably will sound lighter and bright,  if you are not significantly  trained,  you could be doing something  wrong or atypical. It's true the lines aren't  clear for some.  The difference between a a high lyric baritone,  and a heldontenor do have some blurriness. That's one reason though passaggio is so important  to help understand the voice.  It's  not an iron law,  but particularly  in young or only mildly trained people,  it's helpful to determine voice type.    Other things like recording are important.  One thing to keep in mind with voice classification  early  on is not being too specific or complicated. There are tenors who have a very nice mid range over high stuff,  but there are a ton of tenor who haven't had much training on high notes,  and baritones who haven't  developed a deeper sound."
singing,2z5l1r,Mylastnameisaverb,5,Sun Mar 15 20:01:14 2015 UTC,It sounds like whomever told you that is getting their words wrong. In key you're just matching a note in the scale. In tune (which I think they meant) is about how precisely you're hitting the note.   I recommend you get ahold of a chromatic tuner and try singing into it. It will tell you when your pitch is perfect or off by a bit.
singing,2z5l1r,manamachine,2,Sun Mar 15 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"I'll try that, thank you :D"
singing,2z5l1r,FallJacket,5,Sun Mar 15 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"Better yet, find a pitch generator and practice matching different pitches. The most important aspects of good intonation happen in the brain, not the voice. You need to hear the note and be able to ""hold it in your head,"" so to speak."
singing,2z5l1r,Akoustyk,2,Mon Mar 16 01:08:10 2015 UTC,"The key is the framework a song is built around. It is basically the 7 ""good"" notes. But you are not limited to playing those. It is better understood if you hear it.   When someone says ""You're singing off key."" What they mean is that you aren't hitting the pitches correctly. You are hitting pitches between the pitches, like if you were singing notes that would be in between the keys of a piano.  I'm not sure there is much you can do about that. It's something that is very obvious to some people. If you have trouble hearing whether or not you're singing on pitch, it will be very difficult to learn to sing properly. It would be along the lines of being a painter and only being able to see in black and white. You could maybe put more effort in and find a system to overcome the limitation, but really what you want is to be able to see how the colors interact and paint based on that perception."
singing,2z5l1r,Akoustyk,2,Mon Mar 16 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not tone deaf. I know when I'm off, most of the time. I was confused about the word usage; I thought ""key"" was a different term completely."
singing,2z5l1r,ianinthecave,2,Mon Mar 16 03:54:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, well it kind of is. If you sing Do re mi fa sol la ti do, that's the major scale in Do, or in 'C'. So, it is C major. A song in C major will use mostly those notes, and those will most of the time all sound nice or ""inside"".  If you can tell whether you're on or off pitch, then you're good to go. You can try a tuner to be sure, if you want. There can be a few reasons why staying on pitch can be tough, but if your hearing is good, then all you need really is practice."
singing,2z5l1r,Little_Ball_of_Fur,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"A song usually has one key, it can have more, but usually one.  I bet that the person who says you are singing out of key, really means that you are singing out of pitch (frequency of the sound wave).  **  Notes on the keyboard correspond to different pitches.  Scales (or chords) are formed from combinations of pitches or notes.  An example of a well known key is C major. Which, starting on middle C on the piano, uses all the white keys until the next C. That is a C major scale.  In GENERAL, to sing in a C major key, you can only hit the notes in C major. There are exceptions to this rule as pretty much every rule in music.  **  But if you are not singing the right pitches, spend a little while with something that can give you the right pitch of notes, like a piano (there are online pianos btw), and just practise matching the notes."
singing,2z5l1r,GrandAce,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"A ""key"" is a set of notes in which a song lies. To be ""in key"" means to be singing the correct notes for a particular song. It is sometimes colloquially interchanged with singing ""in tune,"" which is somewhat different. Singing in tune is like singing in key, except at a much more nuanced level. I can sing a ""C,"" and be ""in key,"" but not be singing it exactly in tune (""out of tune""). Pitches are very specific, and if we sing just a fraction lower (flat) or higher (sharp) than the pitch, we sound ""out of tune.""  In other words, even though most people use singing ""in tune"" and ""in key"" interchangeably, they are notably different, technically. If you are singing ""out of key"" - someone might mean you are singing the wrong notes completely, or that you are singing the ""right"" notes, but your vocal control is weak and you're singing the notes slightly off of where they're supposed to be.  TL;DR - It either means you're singing the wrong notes, or not accurately on the right pitch."

It's why you can't just smash your hands onto a piano and expect it to sound good, some of the notes don't really blend together very well in certain combinations.  Most songs are in one key, one grouping of notes that sound good together. If you end up singing a note that doesn't fit into that grouping of notes, it can sound really bad."

My general advice is -  Look around before you start - so you are aware of everything, and how the audience feels, and all the little sounds that come during the performance won't worry you (subconsciously).  Then go into a bubble, and concentrate purely on making the sound come out nicely, for their benefit. Focus your whole mind on that. Listen to every note as you sing it, and remain optimistic.

singing,2z1dbo,terrycotta,7,Sat Mar 14 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"lol, I just wrote this in response to the thread farther down on weak head voice, so I'll copy/paste and add the muscle names:   There are muscles that (cause the thyroid cartilage to tilt forward and) stretch the vocal cords (cricothyroids), and the muscles inside/of the vocal cords themselves (thyroarytenoids). The vocal cord muscles are the most active in your lower range. As you get higher, they tense up and make themselves thinner in order to vibrate faster. There's a point where they can't get any thinner on their own, and that's when the cord-stretching muscles come into play. In falsetto, the cord-stretching muscles are active, and the cords themselves drop all their tension. There's not much resistance to the air, so the sound is more breathy, without any ""core"". For a stronger head voice, the cords have to learn to keep some of their thickness while being stretched.  Hope this is helpful! I'll watch your video when I have a moment, but I've got to go for now."
singing,2z1dbo,mezzolini,4,Sat Mar 14 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Head voice refers to the point in the full voice when head resonance becomes more apparent than chest resonance.  It's pretty subtle and until you develop a certain awareness of what's going on, it probably isn't going to feel any different than chest voice, except in the far reaches of you upper range, but even then, it's not like a different voice.  I've been taking lessons for almost three years now and I've not found any use for the concept.  It might be more of a pedagogical term.  annnnd, that's according to some people.  My coach, on the other hand, calls what I think of as reinforced falsetto head voice, and everything in the regular range full voice.  If I were you, I would just sing, and if there are points in your range that you want to remember, find a word or concept that makes sense for you and use it.  Worry about the singing before you worry about the words.  I think that method works because singing is more intuitive than the concepts are.    If I sing a 5 note scale on ""ah"" starting on on Gb3, the final Db4 has considerably more head resonance.  I don't know if it's enough to be considered ""head voice,"" but it certainly feels like the resonance has moved up into my ears.  Yet, I've done nothing that feels like a ""shift"" into a completely different voice.  If I ended on a falsetto Db4, it would feel completely different, like I ""let go"" of the groundedness of the note.  Even on my highest note, I never let go like that.    I'd worry more about vowel modification and mouth shape."
singing,2z1dbo,ViktorClay,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:24:23 2015 UTC,Have you also been working on (defined) a place for your falsetto? Can you feel the difference?
singing,2z1dbo,ViktorClay,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"I naturally have a pretty strong falsetto.  There was a point when I was trying to expand my falsetto range and strengthen it, and I was able to, but it didn't seem to do anything for my full voice, so I gave up on it.  Yeah, it feels different, but I don't know in what way it feels different.  In developing it, I never focused on the feeling.  Start in full voice and sing higher and higher without straining, and eventually you'll naturally go into falsetto.  You'll know exactly when it happens.  It's very obvious.  You'll have to ""let go"" of your full voice and a much thinner, yet more relaxed sound will remain.  Try to maintain that way of singing and descend.  Then, try to just go straight into it.  It doesn't feel like it's in a different place than full voice.  It feels less dense.  It's hard to put a word to it because it's just a feeling."
singing,2z1dbo,ViktorClay,3,Sun Mar 15 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"The problem is the defenition:  Headvoice/falsetto can refer to:   A vocal register(m2) wich is capable of million diffrent sounds and soundcolors A vocal setup used in all registers: for example Male headvoice in classical refers to a certain setup in your chestvoice(cover) while Female headvoice refers to a certain setup in the female falsetto wich is still reffered to as headvoice A certain soundcolor: be it falsetto/hooty heady ect   In the end the defenition does not matter that much, whats important is it's used by the coach/singer that is benefitial to the singing. If it sounds apropriate and awesome for the genre noone is gonna give a crap if it's head/falsetto chest or whatever.

To actually explain what that's saying, already proven scientifically, every human brain is wired slightly differently, such as motor skills and logic ability. So...  For example, Your dad might suck at playing piano, but you could play it really well.  So basically they are writing shit about the obvious. And it's NOT accurate either, because, muscle memory and such is a universal function, which means, if you try to play an instrument, you can still learn it properly regardless of what level you start at. Depending on how bad you are, it could be discouraging, but the muscles themselves can still learn to control the proper neurons. So if your coordination is bad, and you spend 2000 hours practicing piano, you'll end up good at piano, but maybe still suck at other things. If you spent.. 10,000 hours, which if you break it up as an hour a day, thats 27 yearsyears, which would make anyone an expert.

singing,2z1ygr,Gibbinsly,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that soft palate lift is only one of many tools you can use to inform resonance. The soft palate should be at least somewhat lifted, most of the time, but that doesn't mean you should restrict oral resonance or even nasal resonance (depending on the style).   It's also important to note that the soft palate isn't a black and white ""on/off"" mechanism - it has a whole continuum of movement. So learning exactly how much lift you need for a specific sound at a specific pitch can help you find the right balance of resonance."

However it's something thats crucial to have control over specialy for the highrange in all genres. In metal for example on the very highs you want a lifted palate, but then you want to have a very raised tongue so you dont loose the sharp "" bite"" quality in the voice. In classical you have other ideals as an example."

singing,2z0ey7,mistacorn,3,Sat Mar 14 11:44:45 2015 UTC,"It can get stronger to a point, but it's probably not the effect that you're looking for.  When most singers sing those really high powerful notes that you assume they're in head voice on (Bruno Mars, Adam Levine), they're actually using a mix voice, which is technically head voice, but they never disconnect from a particular configuration their chords are in when they are in chest voice.  They're just ""mixing"" head voice in to chest to create that powerful sound.  Finding your mix voice is the hard part.  I don't know two people who have done it successfully in the same way.  It seems to find people differently.  When I finally discovered how to do it, it was after watching a ton of videos on it and seeking out advice from multiple vocal instructors.  When I first got into my mix, it felt very much like chest but instead of straining to hit those high notes, I felt like I was pushing down to hit notes that were well above my chest range (much like head voice), but at first it was very raspy, and broke apart easily, and I thought I may have been doing damage to my chords, but eventually as I worked the muscles up, the tone got clearer and more controllable, and the best part is that I could sing like that for hours and still feel like I could go a few more.  I think the biggest indication that you're doing it right is that you will sing higher (also louder and fuller) than you ever have with the power of your chest register, and you will feel no strain.  It's actually almost an exhilarating feeling after you've been singing for a while like just after a great workout."
singing,2z0ey7,OxenRan,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:45:59 2015 UTC,"This.  Practice your blend and transitioning from chest to blend to head.  It will sound ugly for a while.  Get a voice teacher. If you can't do that, get a microphone so you can properly hear yourself singing."
singing,2z0ey7,mistacorn,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:04:58 2015 UTC,So is mixed the blending of falsetto and chest or is head actually something different? Such confuse.
singing,2z0ey7,ViktorClay,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"They call it ""mixed"" voice because it's supposedly a mix of the chest, head, and pharyngeal registers.  Though, you will find much debate over what is actually happening in mixed voice and there will be different terminology depending on where you learn about it.  Some call it ""blend voice"".  Some just describe it as keeping the chest voice connected as you get into head voice.  As I said before, it's usually different for everybody how they ""find"" it, so there are a lot of schools of thought about how to go about it.  Check out some YouTube videos based on the terms I've been throwing at you, and you should find some direction.  There are also some decent programs out there if you google those terms that can help you as well if you're serious enough to invest some cash in learning.  The best thing you can do is experiment with your voice.  If your voice starts hurting for any reason, you're doing it wrong, and you should stop and rethink your approach."
singing,2z0ey7,mezzolini,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think your teachers was on the right track. You need to practice your falsetto it's crucial to good singing. headvoice usually has two defenitions either people refer to When you being closure and vocalmass into your falsetto example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZV3zvF9KPw  Or they refer to a laryngeal position in the chestvoice, both is something you need to train. Both of these require a strong falsetto, so you have not wasted your time, but it's benefitial to practice the entire voice. Also you describe this new ""headvoice"" as weak wich is usually not a good sign IF we talk about full sounds. So please post a simple of your strong falsetto, your chestvoice and this newfound headvoice"
singing,2z0ey7,mezzolini,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the physiological explanation (without all those pesky anatomical names):  There are muscles that stretch the vocal cords and the muscles inside the vocal cords themselves. The vocal cord muscles are the most active in your lower range. As you get higher, they tense up and make themselves thinner in order to vibrate faster. There's a point where they can't get any thinner on their own, and that's when the cord-stretching muscles come into play.   In falsetto, the cord-stretching muscles are active, and the cords themselves drop all their tension. There's not much resistance to the air, so the sound is more breathy, without any ""core"". For a stronger head voice, the cords have to learn to keep some of their thickness while being stretched. That takes time. It sounds like your cords have learned to keep a little of their thickness in head voice, but they aren't used to it, and currently can't get much thicker.  Edited to add *Advice: make sure your soft palate is raised, your tongue is forward and relaxed (not pushed down), and that your breath is functioning properly (if you've had teachers, you probably know what to do, just make sure you keep doing it). Try a crescendo when you're in head voice; that will let you know how much stronger it's getting.   Good luck!"

singing,2yyrux,mezzolini,4,Sat Mar 14 04:10:58 2015 UTC,"The ""preference"" or ""settling"" that you're referring to has to do with the thickness and length of your vocal cords once your voice has fully matured physically. Everyone should do exercises that encompass their whole range on a regular basis, smoothing out breaks and making sure all the registers are functioning well. When your whole range is as efficient as it can be, then you can figure out where it has the best tone quality, flexibility, and power.  Lower voices (basses, baritones, altos, mezzos) tend to have thicker or longer vocal cords than higher voices (tenors & sopranos). You don't have to get too scientific if you just think of rubber bands (although this only works in one sense). A thicker rubber band will have to stretch a lot more to produce the same pitch of a thinner rubber band. The thicker rubber band will have a much ""bigger"" sound on the lower pitches, and there will be a point where the thin rubber band simply can't relax enough to produce lower notes.  I've read several accounts by singers who tried, with practice, to influence where their voices would end up. Sometimes, you get a ""mismatch"": someone will have really thick cords that aren't actually that long. So their tone will sound like a baritone, and teachers will train them as a baritone without considering anything else. But they don't have enough length to really get power out of the lower sounds, so if they try for a fully operatic sound, they will only get so far. Because their cords are shorter, they can get to the really high notes with ease, but the thickness will add a richness to their sound that tenors with short and thin cords will not have.   I hope that makes some sense!"

But interesting, I didn't realize it seemed like it was not true to me or fake, thanks for the outside view!   Between the two, I would probably say that higher voice seems more strained, my jaw is a bit tighter and my throat is a bit tighter.

singing,2yxsrs,dksa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:36:09 2015 UTC,"I personally like to lay down with heavy books balanced on my diaphragm and do breathing exercises on my back ( I actually stack weights onto the books now because fuck it).  The exercise I do in this position is at a slow tempo (60-80bpm) I start to breathe in for 8 counts and then out for 8 counts, really reinforcing the expansion of the air tank, watching the books rise and fall. Then, overtime and depending on how frequently i've been doing this exercise, i'll shorten the breath count in and will double the breathe count out.  So i start 8 counts in for 8 counts out.  then 8 in for 16 out.  then 4 in for 16 out.  then 2 for 32.  then 1 for 32.  and if i'm ready, 1 for 64.  It doesn't always go exactly in that division set but the goal is to easily hit 1 count breathe and to hold it out for 64. I've also been doing this for years so i might be desensitized to the actuality of practicing it for the first time.  This is something i learned when playing brass instruments for building strength and breathing endurance, realized it translated just fine to singing and builds fantastic singing strength breathing/air wise.  Obviously, ration the air you blow out correctly. You should be blowing as if you're cooling down hot food or blowing dandelions, lips slightly puckered, but with more pressure and in a constant focused stream, power coming from your stomach, not your chest (books are on your stomach to make you realize this)  When you take the books off and breath normally, you can feel the benefits instantly. Easily my favorite exercise."
singing,2yxsrs,dksa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"That's actually an awesome idea.    I do something similar now but not on my back.    I'll usually play a song on repeat so I can keep a steady tempo.    I'll breath in for 2 counts, hold 2 counts, breath out 2 counts and hold 2 counts.  I'll slowly increase the counts as such  2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and then I'll try for 24 (don't always succeed).  I do this around three times a day...always getting my air from my stomach and not my chest.    I also do separate exercises where I'll grab as much air as I can and make a ""ssssss"" sound.  I push hard but make the opening in my mouth small so there is pressure.    The last thing I do is sort of a ""lip flutter"" someone taught me.  The only way I can explain it is I try to flutter my lips when breathing out....but...not flutter my lips at the same time.  It's weird but I feel like it helps with my ""head voice.""  Would that make sense?"
singing,2yxsrs,dksa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, very similar. Doing the exercise on your back allows you to monitor air expansion by visually seeing the heavy books move up and down. Its a good psychological add-on to the breath.  The lip flutter technique is another favorite. Its good for warming up and erasing breaks between the chest and head when sung with scales."

Don't compare yourself to mixed recordings--live recordings are much more indicative of what people are actually like. ""Studio magic"" is REAL and POWERFUL! The biggest misconception about vocal power is that it has any relationship to force. Not true at all: the most powerful resulting sounds are the most coordinated, and often less forceful, sounds.    Have you ever pinched the neck of a balloon and made it squeal? If so, you may remember that there's a ""sweet spot"" where the squeal becomes much louder and more penetrating. That's basically what you want to do with your vocal folds--find the optimum relationship between a consistent airflow and the closure of the folds. If you were to suddenly start pushing or squeezing the balloon, the squealing wouldn't really work, and that's basically what you do when you force or push sound."

singing,2yufl6,keakealani,5,Fri Mar 13 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"Two things: breath support and resonance.   Breath support is really necessary not just to have enough air, but to keep it controlled at the proper speed. It's important to keep a consistent stream of air going - when it cuts in and out, that's when you experience cracks or your voice sounding like it's giving out.   Resonance is arguably more important, though. The actual decibel level that can be created by the human voice is not that loud, but we can change the way it's produced to cut through an orchestra and sound ""fuller"" than other sounds that are objectively just as loud or louder.   In any case, you don't achieve carrying power by yelling, but you can very easily hurt yourself, so resist that tendency and build a solid foundation first."
singing,2yufl6,phaletus,3,Thu Mar 12 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"Overall it didn't sound extremely loud to me, but especially the last words of each line in chorus had that loud and shouty tone that's called Overdrive-mode in Complete Vocal Technique.

singing,2yufl6,stillcasey,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:07:15 2015 UTC,I've heard this a lot.. but some of the most intense singers end up hoarse after performing. Why is this? Are they doing it wrong and just saying screw it?
singing,2yufl6,mwb2,2,Fri Mar 13 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.  ""Wrong"" means different things in different contexts. Kurt Cobain sang ""wrong"" in the sense of ""unhealthily."" He didn't sing ""wrong"" for the style he was singing, of course. Nevertheless, you don't need lessons to sound like that, and teachers won't teach you to scream like he did, because he's actually just screaming, for the most part, and years of doing that will cause vocal damage for sure. (Have you heard some of his live recordings? Many takes are much rawer live than they are on the studio recordings.)"
singing,2yufl6,phaletus,2,Fri Mar 13 02:52:19 2015 UTC,It is possible to scream healthily without damaging your voice and there are people who can teach that. If you want to do that but it hurts or makes you hoarse you definitely need to get lessons/instructions how to do it properly without damaging yourself. Many of the effects (for example distortion) are not done with vocal cords so they do not damage your voice if you do them correctly.
singing,2yufl6,mwb2,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"First, from what I understand, it is possible to scream somewhat healthily, but not completely so. You cannot do things to the ventricular folds without affecting what happens at the true folds. This isn't to say that it's going to be the world's most destructive influence, but the constriction that allows the false folds to touch isn't exactly going to be a healing balm for the true folds.  Second, many of these singers have experienced significant vocal damage. Listen to how they sound at 22 and 62. Now, if they're singing a style in which having a gritty sound is good, that may not be a problem, artistically; but the vocal cords are not as healthy as they could be, in a medical sense. Take Steven Tyler as an example--his speaking voice is not 100% clear. For the style of music he sings, this isn't really an issue, but it's not as if his physiology hasn't been affected by how he uses his voice.  Finally, vocal damage doesn't necessarily manifest overnight. It can seem like things are fine for 5 or 10 years, and then suddenly ""vocal problems"" begin to appear, problems which have been gradually building up for years and only seem sudden.  Of course, there's lots of money to be made telling people they can scream away and suffer no long-term consequences."
singing,2yufl6,phaletus,2,Fri Mar 13 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"You are right, it has some effect on true folds also. Here's a study about intentional distortion that concludes: ""Vocal folds continue to vibrate but by increased frequency, amplitude and contact quotient perturbations possibly induced by false fold vibration"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2zAdvW1wgk&t=15m  What they don't mention is that do the changes seem to be in healthy limits or not, and I'm not educated enough on this field to comment it either. I suspect though that if the results were outrageous they would mention it.  Here's an older study by same people where they claim that the vocal folds vibrate regularly under the effects and that they can be done safely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJu_BQrfk3E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqqXYR07WgE  I also agree that we don't have any studies for long time periods. But we also can't rely on anecdotal evidence on singers that have had problems, because we can't know if they have had right technique and whether their problems are linked to the use of distortion or is it because some other flaw with their technique unrelated to the distortion.  I'm also a little bit skeptical that vocal problems could appear completely sudden without any previous hint like hoarseness indicating that something's not done right. But I'm not professional so I could be proven wrong here."

But I'm not professional so I could be proven wrong here.   It depends on the problem, and I'm also not talking about something insanely different (perfect one day, completely hoarse the next). But some issues like, say, loss of high notes can sometimes seem to appear rather quickly, when in fact the processes that have made the high notes harder (say, tension in the tongue root) have been building up since long before the singer knew there was a problem. That said, a vigilant singer and teacher should be able to catch things early. (I'm also basically talking about professionals, so people who are already nearer to their ""peak"" of efficiency.)"
singing,2yufl6,phaletus,2,Fri Mar 13 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about bad technique, then I agree that it can develop insidiously. But if we're talking about actual damage to vocal folds, then one would think that there should be some symptoms of hoarseness before anything irreversible has happened. But I could be wrong.

singing,2ysqky,mwb2,3,Thu Mar 12 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"It doesn't  need to be that way.  Your tessitura is roughly your second passaggio to an octave below in Opera.  To sing there consistently  take years of practice with a stable voice,  so it's  no surprise  there's trouble. In time you can sing a large chunk up there.    Choral music also tends to be a bit lower per voice type,  by maybe a whole step. So let's say you are a baritone where your  second passaggio is at E4,  then I'd expect you singing mostly in D3- D4. This would mean really only a third of the stuff is the passaggio  but rarely  would you expect a male to sustain more than half of their notes up there.   You say you're always mixing.  Do you mean a  you never go into your chest voice,  or every song involves some mixed voice?   The former is bad,  the latter is fine.  Roughly  how much of your singing is above the passaggio?    And do you feel you sound weak,  as in damaged,  or merely you head voice feels unsupported  and thin?agaim the latter can be fine,  as you are very young,  it will takes time to develop,  so long as you aren't  straining to hit the notes. Singing like that is tiring,  so you should feel like you've sung a lot.  You shouldn't be pushing so much it hurts though. If you actually feel it being damaged  you should ask your choral teacher make sure your technique is good,  and if so,  maybe take some lower parts until you can sustain the high notes better."

singing,2yqxiw,Splortched,3,Thu Mar 12 06:33:51 2015 UTC,"I had my deviated septum corrected and it really changed the quality of my voice. I'm a lurker here (very amateur) but I felt like I could offer some input. Even my speaking voice has changed pretty drastically. Much less nasally and I don't speak from the back of my throat anymore (if that makes sense).   I suffered from sinus infections my entire life up until I was 26, always on prednisone and antibiotics. The actual procedure, once you're under, takes all of 20 minutes and recovery was fairly straightforward. The first day after surgery is a little uncomfortable but from there it's better and better. I'll never forget the first day they took the stints out and I took a full breath of air in through my nose. Seriously life-changing. I can't believe years prior to that I actually trained for and ran a marathon, several halfs and 18Ks breathing at 40% capacity. It's crazy, looking back.   I recommend the surgery to anyone who has a deviated septum. My insurance covered almost all of the costs. I think I ended up paying like $18 out of pocket.   If anyone has any questions, ask me anything! I had a sinus surgery years prior to my septum surgery as well so I am quite experienced in the sinus department lol."
singing,2yqxiw,L3aBoB3a,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:42:14 2015 UTC,"This has no relation to the OP, (sorry) but is septum correction the one where they cut abit out of your nasal septum, then break and reposition your nose? Just curious if not, what do they do?"
singing,2yqxiw,DeepBlueB,2,Thu Mar 12 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, so imagine a CAT scan of your head where they take a pic of your head from above. My septum was ""S"" shaped. I had issues with breathing my entire life. I was so addicted to Afrin nasal spray that I had ulcers in my nose and couldn't breathe without it. I would wake up several times every night to spray. I live in the midwest where we have long winters and not a lot of fresh air so the circulated heating in my apartment didn't help.   Basically what they do is go in through the nostrils and snap your curved septum and set it straight. There are several really good explanations if you google it. Tiny little balloon stints are put up your nostrils for 24 hrs and then they are taken out along with the packing. During that first day, you're heavily medicated. After about a week, you get the stints taken out. For 6 months, you really have to watch out for contact towards your face/nose. I had a new puppy at the time and got a couple head buts but I'm ok. Also, protip: if you're a side-sleeper (like me)- get used to sleeping on your back or your nose will heal crookedly. Overall, the surgery was life-changing for me. I was so oxygen and sleep deprived that I was a depressed person. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from sinus issues. i will never take prednisode or an antibiotic for a sinus infection again...and I am so grateful for that. PM me if you have any more questions, I am more than happy to answer them!"

That being said, I think your recording very much illustrates why it's extremely dangerous to attempt to classify untrained voices. This isn't a commentary about you as a person or as a singer, but frankly, your voice sounds very untrained. As a result, there are some pretty apparent registration issues (extremely common among young women) which could cause some big mistakes about passaggio and range. Again, I'm not commenting about your voice specifically, but a more general observation that because of the technical issues, it's not possible to accurately determine your voice type. I would strongly advise that you worry about other matters and come back to it later (or never - it sounds like you're not really interested in classical singing, and for other genres voice type is significantly less important)."

The more I've seen and read in this sub, the more I find myself convinced that even the smallest bit of advice, no matter how well-intentioned, can end up doing more harm than good. You just can't tell how it's going to be interpreted by the singer. It's difficult enough to explain these things to someone in person when you can see and hear what they're doing. Any amount of critiquing in this limited format when you don't know what level of training or understanding of terminology the other person has, not to mention being unable to give/receive instant feedback on your suggestions, seems not only ineffective but unwise."
singing,2ylzzt,nemesmith,5,Tue Mar 10 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"Amen to this! I was initially trained in a choral context, so a lot of technical information I got was through these kinds of ""buzz words"" (simply because it's impractical to try to instruct things like resonance to 30 people at once in the course of a choir rehearsal). And, in fact, I did learn lots of these bad habits due to misunderstanding what my well-meaning choir directors meant. It's not that they were wrong, but that these types of metaphors can only go so far without followup instruction.   I know it sounds insane to get a private voice teacher. People imagine this exorbitantly expensive professional you meet with for three hours a day and think ""holy crap, I can't afford that!"" But that's not what a voice teacher is for most of us. I charge $25/hr for my theory lessons, which means $50/month for half-hour lessons. This is similar to the rate for voice lessons in my area (a very high cost of living metro area) although I don't currently teach voice. If you're willing to spend hours a day reading articles on reddit, I don't think it's unrealistic to ask that you spend $50 a month doing something that will net ten times the benefit at much less risk.   I'm not saying that you need lessons to sing in your shower, but considering most folks here do seem to want to gain a fairly high proficiency level, I just don't understand the resistance to at least trying some lessons."

singing,2ylzzt,latenightrage,3,Wed Mar 11 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"That's completely fair! However, part of my point is that you can't expect to succeed at anythings without some investment. What frustrates me, and probably many other posters, is that we simultaneously see people saying ""lessons are out of my budget"" and saying ""I don't understand these things and sound bad and don't seem to be improving"". If you aren't willing to invest in something, then not improving seems like a likely consequence.   I am not here to comment on people's financial situation. I can say that my husband and I are both poor, underemployed musicians and I'm an over full-time college student who tutors part-time on top of that, we live in a high cost of living metro area and are currently paying back student loans, and we still scrimp and save to pay for our respective lessons (including bartering services). I also get that I am probably more financially well-off than some folks here, although I have a hard time believing that I'm 1000% more well off than every single poster here. If people don't want to invest in lessons, that's fine. However, between the misconceptions about how expensive lessons are (and a while back someone also posted a blog post itemizing the costs involved in teaching a lesson) and unrealistic expectations that someone will master a complex technical concept in a matter of weeks without any instruction, I hope you can understand why this comment feels like a cop-out at times."

I have tons of friends both smaller and deeper vocies who can do it both ways. My voice is probably baritone if we talk classical and i can do it both in mix and in Chest.  What defines a Tenor is not the ability to blast out a C5 it's the timbre and tessitura wich are the most important parts.  Also what counts in range is pretty simple, if it sounds good and apropriate for the genre include it. What coordination your in then is highly irrelevant"

singing,2ynjsk,Mattpilf,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed with  Victor clay.   Not all tenors are the same and some are significantly  lighter.  If you were a low tenor vs a high baritone,  both would probably be using a reinforces head voice, maybe a skilled tenor has a slightly connection  some of the time for effect, but if so it's more adding chest to the head voice than the other way around.   The big difference  if both can hit a C5,  is where they sound best. A baritone has a often a very limited expression and color at C5.  It may sound powerful,  bright and rich,  but the versatility  won't be there like at all,  and more importantly  won't be in the Range where tenors sing most often.    There's no clear definition,  especially if you are  or fully trained, hitting a C 5 is  not needed for all tenors.   All this assumes good technique and proper cord closure.  You might very well be a tenor."
singing,2ynjsk,ViktorClay,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"Also, since you're a rock/metal coach, you can probably answer this.

Grunge usually more chesty, but you can have guys like chris Cornell who has a mix that sounds just like chestvoice. At that point does it matter? ;)"
singing,2ynjsk,mwb2,2,Wed Mar 11 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"What kind of singing are we talking about? Classically? That's a very heady mix voice, definitely. But If I need to, I can belt around there in a tight, controlled mix belt. This is more appropriate for musical theater and some other larger singing in various genres.  Bringing your chest voice that high repeatedly is a terrible idea. It's just so exposed and raw. You can get away with this in rock and a few other styles, but at the end of the day it's going to do a number on your voice if you practice it this way.  I think you might be confused as to what mixed voice sounds like. It can have a lot of the qualities of a chest voice, and sound extraordinarily full. If you're singing in chest above G4 and you're singing classically, something has gone horribly wrong.  Ninja edit: Also it's very common to sing up there in falsetto in pop styles (think Justin Timberlake)"
singing,2ynjsk,ISawACloud,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"This really depends on how one defines ""head"" and ""chest"" voice.  An operatic tenor hits C5 with fully-closed vocal folds, in a mode called ""crycothyroid dominant"" (CT dominant), which is a position of the larynx that is used for ""head"" voice. Moreover, the operatic tenor's larynx will remain slightly lowered as this happens, and the space above the larynx will be wide (something you can't really feel), which creates a lot of intensity in the ""singer's formant"" (the overtones around 2,800-3,500 Hz).   Metal singers, as far as I can tell, have raised larynges and do not have the pharyngeal widening that would create the operatic ring in the voice (they've got mics and don't need it). I suspect their vocal cords are slightly open at the back as well, as they would be in falsetto, but the compression on the vibrating part of the cord is strong, not loose. The best metal singers have fantastic breath control.   Some classical singers call this intense, CT-dominant singing with a gap in the back of the cords ""reinforced falsetto."" Some even call it ""voix mixte"" and consider it the ""mixed"" voice, and Broadway/pop singers often refer to this sound as ""the mix,"" as opposed to what a classical male singer will call ""mixed voice.""  The larynx posture in singing other than CT-dominant is thyroarytenoid dominant (TA dominant). The TA, aka vocalis muscle, is the muscle at the innermost layer of the vocal cord itself (the rest is layers of mucosal tissue). Strictly speaking, what most people call ""chest voice"" is TA-dominant, and comprises the speech range. It can be extended up to around a perfect 4th by shouting, which isn't particularly healthy.  TA dominant means that the TA is primarily responsible for regulating pitch; CT dominant, likewise but for the CT muscle.  Clear as mud?"

singing,2ynbz5,alexwillreddit,4,Wed Mar 11 05:04:14 2015 UTC,"First it's helpful to know that ""bass-baritone"" is a term that gets very much overused today. But in the real sense—the true sense—a bass-baritone is simply a very, very heavy baritone. An enlarged baritone. It operates basically like a dramatic baritone voice, with the only difference being its passaggi, which are at A and D, instead of the regular baritone's Bb and Eb. The true bass-baritone should have a definite bass quality running through the voice.  Today, however, the term is often misused and misapplied to singers who do are simply lacking the technical development to be able to sing the literature that their true voice type ought. A large majority of professional opera singers—even some famous ones—who are calling themselves ""bass-baritones"" are simply baritones and would in fact be dramatic baritones (""Verdi baritones"") if they had been properly developed and trained.  As for your own voice part or voice type, it would be virtually impossible to know without hearing a recording of you singing exercises or phrases across a fairly wide range, from the bottom of your voice to what you believe is the top of it."

singing,2ynbz5,dxfifa,1 point,Sun Mar 15 08:36:32 2015 UTC,"Wow - I have a lot to dicuss with my voice teacher. Thanks!  I cannot currently provide a recording, as I'm on mobile, currently. If you're willing, perhaps later on I can provide one."
singing,2ynbz5,dxfifa,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely agree it's overused. When I went to voice lessons my voice teacher said I'm a bass-baritone but I checked my passagi and they're either a bass or a high bass (at least a semitone below bass-bari). I think it's because my voice wasn't trained and my low notes weren't done well. Probably also cos my high range is larger than most (not my tessitura at the time though). I stopped the lessons because she was getting me to sing high baritone pieces, assuming that i was going to sing baritone classically. Some others have critiqued me and said i sound like a baritone on higher notes but I think that's because I've been singing with high baritones in my favourite bands and i lighten my voice out of habit. I was annoyed because all bass-baritones sound like they're higher placed than me! Oh the joys of voice types!"
singing,2ynbz5,Mattpilf,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:56:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's... convoluted. I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Any tips on assuring your voice teacher is developing the correct range? I trust my teacher, as she's had 30+ years of experience in operatic training & performing, but I, as any sane person does, still have minuscule (although still existent) doubts. I've not yet reached the age necessary to have my voice settle, but it would still be beneficial to know.     According to the teacher I'm seeing, bass-baritones are not too entirely common - would you say that true ones aren't very common, or just in general?"
singing,2ynbz5,dxfifa,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"I would say that people who can sing bass (or almost) and sing baritone are grouped in as bass baritones when most of those are true basses (high or low) with a good high range. So yes, I agree with that. most teachers can tell a baritone with a good low range better but i think it's the rarity of a bass that can sing high that gets people confused. I feel that bass-baritones actually cannot sing bass competently, they tend to hit the lowest baritone notes (E,F) well with a deeper timbre but peter out on the Eb and D. I'm a higher bass and I can produce A1 but peter out in that way around C (+ or - 1 semitone). That's the way I see it, because I can sing full to around G4 which makes people assume I'm a baritone. High notes are what is focussed on by a lot of people.  TL;DR Most teachers train higher tessitura basses as bass-baritones and bass-baritones as dramatic baritones"
singing,2yn7bd,temporarysteve,10,Wed Mar 11 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"You don't count falsetto as part of range, people with actual four-octave ranges are very rare.  Your passagio is also not a full octave, that's just impossible. On your chart, the yellow zone is the passagio, or what a lot of people call ""mixed voice"". I have no idea what you mean by ""movable"" but your passagio doesn't change.  If you can sing ""Bass"" and ""Tenor"" chances are you're a Baritone who thinks his falsetto is a Tenor's ""head"" voice."
singing,2yn7bd,xarahn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:27:03 2015 UTC,"The passagio is a normal 4th, but I can push the tenor up quite a lot, and on the way down, stay in head quite far down. In either direction, I still get the slight jump as it changes. My top tenor note is about G4 (very strained).  Thanks for the distinction between falsetto and head, I don't really understand that. The soft upper range has only come through practice - it was there originally, but uncontrolled."
singing,2yn7bd,xarahn,5,Wed Mar 11 04:38:46 2015 UTC,Very strained G4 is most likely a Bass or Baritone.
singing,2yn7bd,keakealani,3,Wed Mar 11 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons range isn't a really good indicator of voice type. I'm most definitely a soprano, but I have a big lower extension that can get down to Db3 or so (first thing in the morning I've vocalized C3), although my usable range for solo singing starts about an octave higher. That doesn't mean I'm also an alto, but it does mean I can pretend to be an alto in choirs and things like that.   Similarly, I know a baritone who can sing Bb-B4, right below the ""tenor C"", but the meat of his range is much lower and he sounds fullest in the traditional baritone area. That doesn't mean he's actually a tenor, but it does mean he sometimes sings tenor in choir.   Anyway, that's all to say that tone quality, tessitura, and other factors are extremely important in determining voice type. This article gives a more thorough explanation.   Also, yeah, if you could indicate your actual modal range, that would be great - as /u/xarahn points out, you don't normally include falsetto as part of your range unless you are a countertenor (in which case you don't include your modal voice). That can be a factor, although not the only one as I said."
singing,2yn7bd,Mattpilf,2,Wed Mar 11 05:04:22 2015 UTC,"Heh, one of my friends sings down to D2 as a bass, but he naturally has a tenor tone.  Why don't you post a recording?"

singing,2yn7bd,elerico,3,Wed Mar 11 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"Here's where it gets confusing. Your lowest note doesn't indicate much. Those ranges in the chart are more for opera, and deal with very loud notes.  First how old are you? You sound like maybe 30 or so, or at least near there that your voice seems mostly mature.   Your E3-E4 becomes incredibly light. Are you having cord closure through there? It does seem like it too me. No bass will sound like that with cord closure in it, and your low notes don't sound particularly rich and with the weight like a bass.   When you sang in you song, you didn't get very high, but you did seem to have cord closure. I think there was some depth that a tenor wouldn't have, but if you were a bass would have been either really heavy or very bright.  It seems like your going for a light style approach when singing, which is fine, but difficult to asses, which is why cord closure is so important for something like this. I do think if you kept cord closure, you'd probably notice a shift starting at Bb3 or so, as you also seemed to have in the recording. You sang an A2 with some fullness, but if you were a bass or even bass baritone that would have been shouty or bright, which I don't hear.  It would also be highly unlikely that if you were a bass, and choral director would mistake it for a tenor.  Anyways some baritones(even tenors) can hit C2, and that's fine, but none can sing like a D2 that's nice rich and loud enough to carry though things. I think you sound like a baritone though."
singing,2yn7bd,elerico,2,Thu Mar 12 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"It's all very confusing to me ;) I am 48 by the way, but youthful in spirit and physiology. I have never over-exercised my vocal cords - always been a quiet talker, and mostly a listener - so perhaps my voice is younger and more pure for my age?  Strange also, that I've always had that girly falsetto, although it's only recently that I've trained it, and joined it up. I sing the E3-E4 lighter, anticipating the break. I can sing it heavier and richer, but then it breaks and the change is abrupt. To join the chest to fasetto, I have to relax and lighten the chest voice. Coming down is easier.  It never gets shouty. It always sounds a little hoarse, or velvety as best. Due to phlegm and asthmatic lungs. But I like that, as a starting point for a distinctive sound. I don't want a cookie cutter voice. One of the few classical singers I really like is Daniel Rodriguez, who has a similar patina (eg. Youtube - Panis Angelicus with Rodriguez and Lea Salonga).  In pop music I like Matthew Belamy, Thom Yorke, etc. I can hold a pub rapt with a rendition of Vincent, in the lowish range you heard for Scarborough Fair.  When  I sing in choir, I frequently go into falsetto rather than strain the high notes, and I would like to develop a really beautiful tone up there. In a choral setting, it adds a very nice sound to the mix. As a solo voice it isn't there yet.  If I can, I will record something with more volume. But anyway, keep chatting if you like."

singing,2yn7bd,ViktorClay,3,Wed Mar 11 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to use Miller as a reference here. First of all, the soprano passaggio is actually wider than the mezzo-soprano's, with points at ~Eb4 and ~F#5. Soprano's upper flageolet range starts more at a D6. Mezzo sopranos are often expected to sing much lower, around D3, and contraltos usually bottom out closer to tenors, around C3. The passaggio for tenors should be more like D4-G4, because most tenors are lyric and not heldentenors. In general, the passaggi for the men are too low. There isn't really a ""4th register"" to the male voice. And why would there be an extra range available only to sopranos, tenors, and mezzos? That makes no sense. There ""registers"" are ill-defined at best.  So, I hate that chart. If you're going to get that specific with using 6 voice types, do it with better detail."
singing,2yn7bd,elerico,2,Wed Mar 11 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Male and female voices work the same way, males do have as many registers as female. However this is very rarely experienced because males in general dont spend much time at the edge of their falsetto/head register."

If you have a hard time hitting a note but can hit notes BOTH lower AND higher than that note with less effort AND not in either vocal fry nor falsetto, that note is probably a passagio."

It may also help you pinpoint where exactly the issue is taking place.   Edit: also, can you hear speech accurately? My understanding is that people who have neurological problems preventing them from processing pitch information also tend to have problems perceiving speech patterns. For example, would you be able to tell the difference between your mom's voice and a random stranger? This may sound odd but it can help to diagnose medical problems related to pitch perception."
singing,2ylxw5,keakealani,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"You mean playing notes and singing them? I´ve tried it, but missed half the notes pretty badly (I record my vocals and let my computer analyze it to see what notes I´m singing). I can replicate notes from voices more easily than instruments.   Yeah, I have no problem identifying different people. I do have really big problems replicating dialects and stuff though. I lived in the north of Norway for ten years ( 10 - 20 yrs ) and still speak like I´m from the west."
singing,2ylxw5,keakealani,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"I mean the whole thing. Do you understand intervals? Can you hear the difference between playing C and playing G?  I'm also thinking having a computer analyze pitch is a terrible idea. There are tons of issues with that, particularly if you're not using professional-quality equipment. Keep in mind that the vocal tone is a complex sound with a very complex range of overtones (this is how we produce vowels). That, plus the fact that healthy singing will involve some natural pitch variation due to vibrato and the fact that the voice is not an equal tempered instrument, means that software isn't a reliable way to identify the pitch you're singing, again especially depending on what software you're using.   Also, I'm not sure exactly how you're testing out with yourself, but that does matter. I would strongly recommend working diatonically and essentially following the rules of counterpoint - mostly stepwise, properly set up jumps, and resolutions in the right direction. Also since you are a pianist, you could try playing a harmonic foundation in the left hand while playing melodies in the right hand to sing. Again, stick to tonal, diatonic progressions here. Also obviously a reasonable tempo.   I would also say to record exactly what pattern (if any) emerges when singing the wrong pitch. If it's consistent, you may just have to retrain your ear to the correct pitch level.   You also need to be sure this issue isn't just a technical one with singing, rather than an aural issue. How are you with transcription? Also, can you transpose basic melodies by ear? How is your sight reading, by the way. I also can't imagine a pianist having such poor aural skills just because I would imagine sight reading would be an issue for harmonic reasons."
singing,2ylxw5,keakealani,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"I understand invervals. I can recognize perfect 5´s, minor thirds and stuff like that, if I REALLY focus and listen to them beforehand. No, I can not hear what notes are being played. If they are played after eachother, yes then I can hear it.   I used Cubase 7.5, so it is pretty reliable. Of course not perfect, but pretty good.   I´ve tried several things. Playing chords and singing over it. That went alright. I missed some notes, especially when I sang higher notes and long intervals. Playing C, D, E, F, G and singing over the notes didn´t go so well. I think I sang A#, D, E,E#, G or something.   I can not for the life of me transpose music after hearing it. My sight reading is subpar, but I was playing classical piano for 3 years and I can read, just slowly."
singing,2ykxgg,ej1994,4,Tue Mar 10 17:52:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is exactly why so many folks here advocate studying with a qualified voice teacher. It's not just because we want voice teachers to make tons of money or something, but because complex and personal problems like identifying and addressing tension in the voice require long-term solutions and often a trial-and-error process to figure out what's going on in your exact voice.   For the most part, the way one person addresses tension won't necessarily work for you, and probably the things that do work for most people are things you've already read about in the FAQ and elsewhere. For example, generally breath support is a crucial factor in reducing strain in the throat and jaw, but how to actually achieve appropriate breath support can be very individual and difficult to explain beyond what's in the FAQ.   So while I realize this can sound like a cop-out, I simply don't think you'll find a solution to your issues online, and I think the safest and most efficient way to approach these concerns is through regular lessons with a qualified voice teacher."

singing,2ykxgg,Girlprep,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"Hm. It can kind of depend. Yes, most university-trained music students tend to be doing classical, but many also study other styles at the same time. You may also find that your previous bad experiences have less to do with genre and more to do with just a teacher that didn't work out for you. I don't know what your exact situation is, but I do think a good foundation, built with the right teacher, isn't really a genre thing anyway. Basics of breath support, resonance, and the like are pretty much universal. And especially since you mention jazz, there is a rapidly growing field of jazz music in university settings so I wouldn't rule that out."

I'm not sure where you read you can sing for as long as you like with proper technique, but the vocal muscles need time to rest and can't handle hours of use at a time, even for professional singers with years of training.   Your enthusiasm to get better is wonderful, but instead of focusing all of that on vocal technique, spend just one hour on warmups, voice exercises and music you're working on, and the rest of the time devoted to ear training, theory exercises, and practicing piano if you have access to one.

singing,2yhmg7,Existential_Rolaids,3,Tue Mar 10 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"I've sung opera for over a decade. Here are a couple of important things to know:   You should be using your diaphragm to control the flow of air, not your throat or mouth.  When you feel low on breath your abs should not be clenched inward or upward - you should push them out.  In fact, if you are able to press the ab muscles outward, the diaphragm has more space to expand downward to bring in quick, deep breaths.  When you're singing properly, there isn't the same wear and tear on your vocal cords because if feels ""effortless"" and ""relaxed"" in your throat. Yes, you SHOULD rest your voice if it feels scratchy or tired.  Women's vocal chords do not finish forming until age 28-30, and men from 30-35.  If you do not care for your chords you can cause permanent damage.  A quick easy ""chord check"" is to quietly sing a vowel and start as low as you can comfortably sing and slide up as high as you can and then back down - notice where your voice ""breaks"" or ""skips.""  If it is completely smooth then it's usually ok to practice but when you have those breaks and skips it usually means that your vocal chords are swollen from overuse and tiredness.  Sometimes a little warming up or marking is ok if they're tired but no full volume or straining.   Hydration, hydration, hydration.  It takes approximately 2 hours for water that you drink to spread through your body and properly hydrate your instrument.  Drinking water while practicing is great but you need to make sure that you drink enough water before you sing.  Also, to some people it makes a difference and others not - but you're using muscles to create that sound and some people swear that drinking room temperature water during practice helps them keep things ""warmed up.""  I've never seen too much of a difference myself but whatever works for you. Your actual vocal folds that vibrate and cause pitched phonation are not like other muscles in your body - pushing through when they're tired to try to ""condition"" or ""toughen"" them does NOT work.     Hope that helps you some."
singing,2yhmg7,keakealani,3,Tue Mar 10 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"I just want to clarify a few things here. You can't use your diaphragm to control your breath. It lacks independent nerve endings and can't be controlled directly. Rather, it is a skeletal muscle that moves when it has space to move, which is created by coordinated movements in the abdominal, intercostal, and lower back muscle groups.   Also, I don't think that vocal slide is a reliable measure for beginners. Although professionals with mature voices have likely worked out kinks in the passagios, the same cannot be said for the average poster in this subreddit, the majority of whom are college-aged and relatively untrained. There are lots of reasons to expect ""breaks"" in the register besides vocal fatigue or irritation, not the smallest of which is improper navigation of the passagios."

singing,2yhmg7,MattTheGeek,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"Let your abs do the work! Seriously, that's where the 'wind' should come from. If you're singing, pay attention to your stomach muscles, they should be sore after a practice, not your voice.  Try just clenching your abs really quickly (pretend you are doing a sit-up or a crunch - or a sneeze!) and notice the breath that comes from you, almost involuntarily. Then ignore your abs and let your lungs alone squeeze the air out. Feel the difference? It is night and day. If you aren't using your abs as your power source, your voice will fatigue from overworking to compensate."
singing,2yhmg7,MattTheGeek,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:23:36 2015 UTC,Interesting. I have been trying to squeeze from my back. Problem with clenching my abs is that it tenses my neck and shoulders in a sort of chain reaction. Any tutorials online maybe that show you how to do this?

singing,2yhq3a,Gibbinsly,5,Mon Mar 9 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm going to try to explain some things about resonance that might answer your question (because I'm a little confused about what you're asking.)     Resonance is what makes our voices carry/cut through. Ever heard an old lady singing in church? It's sort of throaty, muffled, etc. That's NOT a resonant style of singing. Ever heard an opera singer? That is very resonant-- opera singers use resonance to make their voices carry over an orchestra.     All sound, as you know, is created by vibration. By placing the sound toward the FRONT of your face, it can vibrate in your nasal passages, your teeth, your cheek bones...all of the hard surfaces. Vibrating off of a HARD surface will help your voice carry better. (If you are singing in a lower register, you may also feel it in your chest, as you were saying before.)    To achieve this forward resonance, practice singing on an ""nnnnn"" or an ""mmmm."" You may feel a buzzing in your nose. Try opening to a ""nnnnaaaaa.""  Think nasal. As far as tone goes, if you get good resonance AND breath support it should do wonders for your tone quality.    I hope that helps? Please ask if you have any more questions!"

singing,2yhq3a,Masklin,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"For men, it typically does feel more like your speaking voice when you sing than it does for women. And it probably WILL sound like your speaking voice somewhat, and that's fine. The main thing to focus on is to not push from your throat--that's the main difference. The two things that I would recommend you work on are:     1.) Lip trills, panting, sustained ""sssss"" sounds...anything that will work your breath support. This is what helps you to not push from your throat. (Make sure that you look up/ask about proper breathing.) 2.) Exercises that help you get that nasality I was talking about before. ""Nnnn"" ""Mmmm"" etc. Sometimes doing it a little over-the-top at first can help you find that buzzing sensation.    Edit: When you asked about a ""physical confirmation"", for right now, just focus on not feeling tightness or discomfort in your throat. If you are singing in a supported way, your throat should feel free! Singing in a healthy way feels good."

That being said, if it hurts to sing, it's probably best to let it rest. Ideally a couple days of rest should let the muscle repair itself. If you continue to experience pain, I would definitely go see a doctor just to be sure it's nothing more serious.   But anecdotally, yeah, I've yawned or coughed particularly violently and experienced a minor feeling of strain in one of my neck muscles. But usually rest and some gentle massaging is enough to make it feel better."
singing,2ybgdo,gawddamnson,7,Sun Mar 8 06:53:42 2015 UTC,"To a certain extent, yes. This is a gross generalization, but basically higher notes mean thinner, tenser vocal folds, and lower notes mean thicker, more relaxed vocal folds. Considering that a good night's sleep means ~8 hours of full relaxation and rest for your vocal folds, it makes sense that the more relaxed vocalization (low pitches) will happen more easily than the stretched out vocalization. Ultimately, there's not much you can do about this - as /u/xarahn points out, your only real option is to get up earlier so your voice has more time to acclimate to the needs of those very stretched out vocal folds.   However, there is some benefit both to warming up properly and to developing your technique. Although pretty much no singer will be able to sing the tippy top of their range right after waking up, with a reasonable warm up you can probably expect to get somewhat close to that tippy top if everything else is happening properly. That means good breath support, resonance, posture, etc.   But yes, these are muscles we are talking about. You also probably can't run a marathon right after you wake up, without stretching, nor can you likely bench press your highest weight. In all cases, yes, a basic amount of warming up and limbering up is pretty important, although if you know what you're doing, you can probably warm up efficiently and get to near your capacity within a couple hours of waking up."

Also examples would really be helpful in this situation."
singing,2yagqe,FluffyWuffyVolibear,0,Sun Mar 8 05:17:34 2015 UTC,"You can't modulate the speed of your vibrato. If you can, that's a sign that you're cheating and using your throat muscles to produce the vibrato - it's weaker and sounds forced to those who know what good singing is.  And you can't target vibrato for improvement. Vibrato is just the characteristic of a good, well-trained voice - it's not the desired end result, but it's an indicator of what is. One step removed. As you become a stronger singer, your vibrato will develop naturally."
singing,2yagqe,Hithard_McBeefsmash,3,Sun Mar 8 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I completely agree with that. I've heard lots of very good singers modify the speed/quantity of vibrato for effect. It really all has to do with breath pressure (which can be controlled with the lower breath mechanism and not necessarily the throat). Of course, this all still falls into a continuum that is based on your natural vibrato's characteristics, so this change is pretty minimal.   Completely agree with the fact that you can't specifically target vibrato, though. It's all about good breath control, and from there you can play around a little to change the exact speed and quality of the vibrato, but it can only come from good breath control."

singing,2y9p1r,kricketr,5,Sat Mar 7 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of your questions are addressed in the FAQ, so my first advice is to actually take advantage of existing resources rather than expecting constant hand-holding. Quite frankly, professional music is s competitive industry, and if you aren't even willing to look at basic resources I can't imagine you'll survive long at all.   At any rate, I also agree that you need to be more specific about your goals. What you need to do to be a professional pop singer is really different than what you'd need to be a professional classical singer. It's important to follow the appropriate path or you will end up doing more harm than good.   However, in any case I would NOT recommend self-teaching if professional music is your goal. Self-teaching almost always involves lots of bad habits, some of which can cause serious physical damage to your voice. It's one thing to fool around on your own as an amateur, but if you thrash your voice when you're young, you can say goodbye to any sort of career in singing."
singing,2y9p1r,keakealani,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you like to sing. If you're into classical music I would definitely recommend joining a school/church/community choir. It's a great experience for learning how to read music, and it develops your ear for pitch and good vowels.  If you like popular music find a song that fits your voice and you like to sing and practice that. Then, listen to recordings of yourself and ask your friends or one of us for tips and advice. As for somewhere to start to perform, karaoke is always fun. Youtube has a ton of karaoke tracks you can practice with.  Just don't get discouraged! You're at an age where you're voice won't always do exactly what you want it to. It takes a lot of time and practice to develop your voice."
singing,2y9p1r,bcows827,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"The first important question you're going to need to ask yourself is how much work you're willing to put in. It's one thing to say you'll do whatever it takes, and quite another to actually do that. Expect to make no money for multiple years. Expect to put in way more than you get back for multiple years. Expect to cry. Expect to get so stressed you stop eating and your hair falls out. Make peace with the fact that you're going to lose people you love. It's about so much more than being able to sing. You need to have solid business skills and be ready to market yourself as a product. You need to appeal to people from a marketing standpoint. If no one can make money off you, you won't get anywhere. You pretty much have to be under 30. There's exceptions to this but they're rare. Being physically attractive helps. You need to learn to be not only a singer but a performer. That's harder than it sounds. That's been the hardest part for me. You have to get used to working with flakey people and micromanaging. You will get screwed over. Everything is always more expensive than you think it is. You're going to have to dig through a lot of people before you find the ones that can help you. Connections are key. You need them. Come up with a clear marketing strategy with steps and clear goals (get someone who knows what they're doing to help you do this). Learn to write songs. Make friends. If you're weird around famous people get over that right now. It won't serve you because if you seriously enter the business you will work with/be around them and you don't want to creep them out (they're mostly pretty nice people if you're normal around them). I could go on. There's a lot of rewards but you're going to have to work harder than you ever knew was possible and in convinced you need to be a little bit insane because I don't know what same individual would subject themselves to this. At the end of the day if you decide you can deal with all that it is worth it. The more you learn the more you realize you don't know and the more you realize how hard it is to actually make it. But there you go. If you still want to be a singer after seriously considering that, power to you. You're fucking nuts, but you're going to find yourself in good company :)"

I think this is a really good example of where online resources and CDs can be a helpful supplement when you are taking lessons, but also can't really function as a standalone self-teaching method. Certainly any good teacher would acknowledge that having things explained in another way is beneficial to the student. And from everything I've seen, there's no reason to believe that David Jones isn't a very helpful, qualified, and experienced professional teacher. But of course, it is really most helpful when you have someone actually working with your actual voice who can help address things as they come up and just keep an eye on things to be sure that you're understanding correctly and not making mistakes based on something you heard on a CD. They can very much work together.   I would very much encourage you to note the things that really resonated with you in the CDs, and share that with your teacher. It might help your teacher better understand your learning style and reference concepts that already make sense to you due to the work you've been doing with the CDs."
singing,2y7btb,777XXX,1 point,Sun Mar 8 09:03:27 2015 UTC,"David Jones is really such a fantastic teacher: he's very knowledgeable on technique, he's got a hell of a lot of experience, and he's got a great reputation for flexibility and kindness. His website  is full of articles that, with at least a basic knowledge of vocal anatomy, are beyond resourceful for any singer, beginning through advanced.  I think that's enough ass-kissing for now."

singing,2y8d57,schniepel89xx,2,Sat Mar 7 11:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, singing through the passaggio is (almost by definition) one of the most challenging areas. In general, the best advice is to keep strengthening breath support and control - you'll really need to fine-tune that mechanism to do these precise adjustments.   That being said, start from above. As /u/EisaKashu mentions, it's all about your head voice. Strengthen your head voice and try to bring it down with you into the passaggio, rather than pushing up from below. If you even need to start in falsetto, that's okay too. The point is to really feel the light, open sound you'll need to sing those higher notes."
singing,2y8d57,keakealani,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"You don't. The mix/laryngeal voice is the heaviest vocal pattern in the voice, and it's not something you improve by itself. The proper way to sing is by training your head voice till it can support your laryngeal voice without it pinching off.  If you can't figure this out on your own, get a vocal coach to help you. I started off with only one octave of range, so that made me a very heavy voice, but i guarentee you, focusing on your laryngeal voice alone, will not improve anything"

I suggest matching pitch and finding some exercises to help with your ear. Before doing this, warm up. The scales alone will help.   Find a keyboard/piano (if you don't already own one) select a note and match it as best you can. Do not hurt yourself, stop if you feel any discomfort.   Record yourself and pay very close attention. If it's not a problem with pitch you'll have to troubleshoot and do some workaround.   Something else you may like to try is an ear training program. I haven't tried them and I'm not sure how effective they are but I have friends who swear by them. Read the FAQ and best of luck!"

singing,2y69gj,backwardinduction1,2,Fri Mar 6 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Pushing more is usually not a good idea when it comes to rising larynx tension. What I would do is when you start to feel a rising and tense larynx is to try to swap to a relaxed high larynx pharyngeal, small, whiny sounding voice. You'll sound ridiculous but it teaches your body how to place your resonance and relieve the tension in your throat.   One thing to get is that if you ever do push your voice, you should visualize the sound travelling upwards and to the back, not outwards through the mouth. Might take a while to get it right but once you get it it works wonders."
singing,2y69gj,the_snugglebear,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting. My teacher has me sing a short song like Steve erkel to essentially do that when warming up,  if that counts as the small whiny voice.  Upwards and to the back.. hmm I haven't heard that before,  mainly I try to aim it at the facial mask and the area around the nose When I go high."
singing,2y69gj,the_snugglebear,2,Sat Mar 7 05:51:36 2015 UTC,"It's pretty subjective imo. To me it feels like it goes up and back and others would probably describe it just like you would. I know for sure that of it comes out the mouth, it'll be tense and strained though."

What you want to do is feel your lungs expand as you inhale, then as your lungs contract and release the air, your diaphragm should stay pushed outwards as much as you can. This will make you ""force"" from the diaphragm and not the throat.   Obviously you can't make the highest single note in your range perfect, otherwise you could probably hit the note that comes after it not so badly and so on for an infinite range loop, but it should help."
singing,2y69gj,Cant_Handel_my_swag,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah G4 is my top note that I can consistently hit, except on hard vowels.

You want to keep that diaphragm pushed out yes, but think of it more like actively pushing, rather than putting it out there and holding it stiff. Thinking about it being tense will probably cause you more problems than good."
singing,2y69gj,bluewolfcub,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:37:46 2015 UTC,Alright that makes sense with what my teacher tells me. She says basically to push out my diaphragm on each note whenever I sIng like a D or above. For me I guess it's a matter of relaxing and pushing harder as I go higher.
singing,2y74ac,Girlprep,0,Sat Mar 7 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"I have a deviated septum, but it hasn't impacted my singing, and from my understanding, the worst it can do is just make nasopharyngeal sensations feel strange.  But if you can't sing past g3, I'm guessing it means you have excess mouth tension with each note, which will impede your cricothyroids movement so you can't sing a larger range. To fix it, sing scales while keeping your mouth relaxed.  Sorry if my prognosis is incorrect. I've known people with really messed up nasopharynxs, but  in theory, only minor variations shouldn't effect your phonation"

singing,2y5b29,Dlanemusic,2,Fri Mar 6 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"Seconded. If I were to train someone to sing harmonies, I'd start by having them learn the melody they're harmonizing with perfectly. From there, it's a matter of being secure enough with your ear that you can start on a different note in the chord and sing it while ""feeling"" the way the key is different from your starting place. It's hard to describe, but it's the way I improvise harmonies and it works well with every musical form I've improvised harmonies for."
singing,2y5b29,MarvinLazer,2,Sun Mar 8 01:05:20 2015 UTC,"Practice and getting used to hearing harmony  while you sing.  You have to know what you plan on singing, and where your notes fit in the harmony so you don't have a tendency to jump and match them.  If you have a specific part,  maybe you can record them separately  so you can try and harmonize,  practicing so you get used to being comfortable with the slight dissonance."

I'd imagine it's just like starting a new job, you feel a bit awkward at first until you get used to the routine and your new cohorts.   We singers are experts at being really hard on ourselves, which I'm sure stems from the fact that one has to be intensely self-critical in order to improve at this.

It'll help your songs sound much clearer and thus help you hear yourself better.   -Try annunciating your words with more distinction, especially at the end of the words. You tend to let them kind of dissipate.  -Do you sing more with your head voice? I feel like you are capable of a lot more power with your voice, but you may need to work on breathing techniques a bit.   Otherwise I really like your voice and i think you'd do a killer cover of Vermillion, Pt 3 by Slipknot! :)"

The pushes the sound into the back of your head and into your face. It requires a lot of pressure and is very loud though, but it shouldn't hurt at all. To make a weightlifting analogy, it feels like, to me, when you're lifting that weight that is on the extreme of what you can physically lift without hurting yourself. Every muscle is working hard, but it's not painful. Doing it a lot will probably hurt you unless you build up to it though."

singing,2y390l,MagicRhythmLizard,2,Fri Mar 6 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"Not exactly sure but I could hazard a guess... In order to talk when you're hoarse, you're having to send a bit more air pressure through your vocal cords in order to get them to make sound. Making a clear (non-breathy) sound under normal healthy circumstances requires a focused, efficient stream of air to be coming through the cords. My guess is that when you're hoarse you're forcing yourself to use more air than you normally would when you sing. It really isn't healthy to be doing this when your voice is fatigued. Wait until you're healthy again and experiment with expelling your breath as a focused, steady stream of air, in a similar way as you've been doing while hoarse, and see what difference it makes."

singing,2y39l3,Knorikus,0,Fri Mar 6 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  So,  just to be sure.  ""higher"" baritone means a ""higher pitched"" baritone ? And similarly a lower tenor means a low pitched tenor ?. Is this what alto is ? Or is that completely different ?"
singing,2y39l3,DeepBlueB,2,Fri Mar 6 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"Alto is a women's classification.  Bass is the lowest male voice, followed by baritone, then tenor. A high baritone is somewhat of a mixture between a baritone and a tenor."

singing,2y39l3,keakealani,0,Sun Mar 8 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"Then there's absolutely no way a voice type could be even remotely helpful to you. The only point of voice type is for near-professional singers to converse about the details of technical needs that are associated with different voice types, and to select repertoire appropriate for someone's voice. If the terminology in that article is beyond you, absolutely nothing that relates to voice type would be at all helpful to you, and it's significantly more harmful to inappropriately classify your voice than to, like normal people, go about your life without a classification."
singing,2y0wgy,hustlayo,13,Thu Mar 5 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"The saying, ""everyone can learn how to sing"" is true; but it doesn't mean that they are going to be great or even good. If you can speak then you can sing. Singing is sustained speech.   It's very difficult to teach yourself to sing esp. if you don't have what some my call a natural talent for it. It's also not advisable but it can be fun and there are all kinds of mental and physical health benefits. Stop worrying so much and enjoy the process.  I've sung as a child, studied in high school and college, taken private lessons while auditioning and performing; and there are still things I work on constantly. Like someone said below, it takes years to get great at anything. It also may take years to get good at controlling an instrument that you can't manipulate with your hands; try to enjoy the process."
singing,2y0wgy,terrycotta,-2,Thu Mar 5 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"""Natural talent"" - the most vauge phrase I've ever heard.  I'm enjoying it. Just had a bad day today and had to vent, that's all. Thanks for the advice."
singing,2y0wgy,SplotchEleven,3,Thu Mar 5 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, ""natural talent"" is definitely a nebulous term, but it is a round about way of saying that either physiologically or psychologically, some people are better equipped to become good singers.  For instance I've worked with people who had perfect pitch and others who had perfect rhythm. I don't think those things can be taught, so they then fall under natural talent. You can be taught relative pitch and rhythm though. I certainly had to be.  I parrot the ""anyone can sing"" mantra because my voice coach, who is also a brilliant vocal therapist, believes this is true. Much of what holds potentially good singers back is not receiving effective training. There are a lot of voice coaches out there who were taught classically and think of singing as an art that has to be described in silly, flowery language because they don't truly understand the physiology related to sound production. What's that saying? Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.  Don't feel bad that you aren't as good as you want to be after a year of trying to teach yourself. I've been at it for almost 15 years and there's always room for improvement. I highly recommend finding a coach to help set you in the right direction. If they are good at what they do, they'll be able to give you simple exercises that will set your body up for success. And remember it's a life-long pursuit with a lot of peaks and valleys. Don't be too hard on yourself :D"

singing,2y0wgy,frankalliance,2,Thu Mar 5 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Seconding what /u/SplotchEleven wrote.  I've been seriously singing for about 7 years or so, and I still improve pretty much every day.  That's the beautiful thing about the voice when compared to other instruments - I am always finding ways to improve and noticing subtle changes in my technique.  Some are for the better, some... aren't.  Honestly, more of the latter these days as I recently moved across the country and haven't yet gotten around to joining a choir again or finding a serious practice space other than my car.    What is important is that you keep working at it.  After a year, I certainly wasn't ""good"" by any stretch of the imagination; heck, even today I am constantly blown away by people who have been at this far longer than I have.  I'd be willing to bet /u/SplotchEleven would far outclass me on the same piece and given a similar amount of time to prepare - just because he's been at it a lot longer.  What matters is that you are better than you were before.  And yes, finding a coach to at least get you set up with the fundamentals of technique is well worth it.  True, a lot of singing can be self-taught or learned by listening closely to other singers (particularly if they're your voice type), but learning from someone who knows the above - and more importantly, how to teach the above - will help you get to another level than just trying on your own.  Think of it this way: driving is a pretty common and relatively ""easy"" thing that loads of people do on a daily basis.  And yet, you don't simply know how to drive after watching a parent or someone else do it for years and years.  I mean, sure, you might be able to have the basics down if you've paid attention, but there's a reason you hire an instructor to teach you how to do it before setting out on your own.  Singing is much the same way."
singing,2y0wgy,SplotchEleven,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for the response. It makes sense. Although I don't agree with one thing. Just because someone spent more time learning how to sing than you doesn't automatically mean they're better than you. Some people learn faster than others and can learn in two years what others would learn in five. Some people just ""get"" some stuff easier and faster. It applies to most skills really."
singing,2y0wgy,frankalliance,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree about not being able to teach perfect pitch. If you ever heard a note and it reminded you of a song, you have the potential to learn. If you knew the notes in the song that came to mind, you'd have a pretty good idea of the name of the note you heard."
singing,2y0wgy,YourFavoriteBaritone,2,Thu Mar 5 23:30:02 2015 UTC,What you're describing is what I mean by relative pitch. Perfect pitch means you can discern any note without other reference.  Most of us use relative pitch and get along quite nicely.

singing,2y0wgy,TheSingingThrowaway,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree, based on personal experience. For example, I have the starting pitch for Baritones (G3) in Sicut Cervus memorized because I had to run the song a billion times about a year ago. I have to think of the song to know the pitch though. Relative pitch definitely doesn't have some sort of time limit outside of one's own ability to remember."
singing,2y0wgy,frankalliance,0,Fri Mar 6 09:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  That's better described as pseudo perfect pitch. It tends to take years to develop though.  There have been studies though and they show those who get it innately and pick it up almost immediately have a level of precision  unmatched by those who developed by singing for 20 years.   It's not even always a good thing.  Most people with perfect pitch don't do well with key changes.  Dropping it a half step or worse a quarter step really changes it for them,  while  even those with pseudo perfect pitch are basically unphased."

Someone is great at math before they even start school. Someone is dancing almost before they walk. Someone else can sit a piano with no lessons and pick out the melody of songs they've heard on the radio. That's ""natural talent"" which then takes study to improve."
singing,2y0wgy,ottentj1,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"In the case of music, there's pretty good evidence that most of what we call ""natural"" talent is actually tied to early exposure. Children whose parents exposed them regularly to a wide variety of music tend to develop stronger pitch recognition and retention than those who weren't exposed to music when they are young. I'd challenge you to find many studies that back up a wholly ""innate"" type of musical talent whole controlling for those factors.   It does happen, such as in the case of savants, but it's extremely rare and frankly, almost none of it applies to singing."

I'm a singer. lol   Doesn't matter to me how someone came to have natural talent; not even how I came to have natural talent. I could look around my family and everyone was in church. Everyone sang. It's just something we do.
singing,2y0wgy,randomusername76,0,Sun Mar 8 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
singing,2y0wgy,randomusername76,7,Thu Mar 5 23:03:28 2015 UTC,"To put it very simply, the idea that anyone can sing is based on the fact that singing is not something you're born with, but a skill. So anyone can learn to sing the same way anyone can learn to play an instrument, ride a bike, cook, swim, etc. Like any skill, some people catch on fast, and for some it takes more time and practice. And not everyone is going to be great, but everyone is able to do it if they are willing to learn.    I will add though that singing is a VERY difficult skill to cultivate yourself without a teacher (which you may have read already by the FAQ and how often it comes up in this sub.) It's just the nature of it. Sometimes you can't trust your ear or need some guidance trying to figure out what is happening inside physiologically. That being said, everyone hits walls and plateaus. Everyone. So, easier said than done, but don't give up and try not to get discouraged!"

singing,2y0wgy,ItchyIrishBalls,7,Thu Mar 5 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you hit a roof. Same thing is happening with my guitar playing right now. I just feel like I'm doing the same things over and over again, and I'm not actually getting better. And it really sucks. And the worst part? The only solution is to keep at it. You've just got to keep going to your lessons and keep practicing. It sounds like you've already gotten a lot better. Give it another six months and you're going to realize you're way better than you were half a year ago, and nearly unrecognizable from the way you were when you first started. And sorry you're having a bad day, hope it gets better for you."
singing,2y0wgy,august_first,2,Thu Mar 5 15:20:27 2015 UTC,I'm not taking any lessons at the moment. 90% of the stuff I learned I learned on my own.
singing,2y0wgy,throwaway185733,3,Thu Mar 5 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty impressive then. Most people I know who can  even hold a tune either have vocal teachers or are in choirs. Still, I would recommend going to a vocal teacher if you really want to bring your singing to the next level. Again, to reference my guitar playing, I did the same, and it really helped me out. Still, it won't be an immediate thing, but if you do decide to get a teacher, you should see results pretty quickly, especially if you're in a rut right now."
singing,2y0wgy,deadby100cuts,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I can ""hold a tune"" cause I still have a lot of problems with hitting the right notes (getting better at it but still a lot of work to do) but I managed to learn how to sing in different registers, learned how to ""bridge"" the ""bridge"" without any cracks, how to do it fluently and how to sound more or less pleasant. When I started year ago I was so terrible (mostly because I literally had no idea how to sing and how to do anything related to it) that I sounded so bad I can't even find words to describe it. And my first and only (so far) vocal teacher (who is also my friend) said we'd have to focus on notes first and we won't focus on anything else until I get them right so we didn't practice anything else. I don't go to her anymore (she moved to another town) but I'm saying that to tell you that almost everything I learned was on my own.  I'll get a teacher soon but I want to achieve a certain level of singing on my own so I'll feel more or less comfortable around her with my singing. I have a feeling that tension is what holds me back the most. Sometimes I manage to sing without tension and it feels so good, easy and right. I just need to change that mental attitude that tensing muscles matters when singing. And of course notes. If I get those two things right I'm on the best way to becoming a singer."
singing,2y0wgy,Heirrress,3,Thu Mar 5 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, I have great pitch and a sort of impressive range, but I still haven't managed to perfectly blend registers and so there's a small hole in my upper range that I hate to death."
singing,2y0wgy,heart_of_blue,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well it sounds like you know what to do, so don't be so hard on yourself. The fact that you know the areas you need to improve on and even an idea on whats hindering you and how to fix it means you're already on your way to getting better at singing. But, and sorry if it sounds like I'm nagging, that desire to achieve a certain level of singing before you go to a teacher is something that is holding you back. Why? Because, chances are, you'll never achieve that 'certain level'. Whenever you get to the level you were aiming for originally, you'll say 'I can get a bit better' or 'I'm still not good enough' and you aim for a next level on your own. Rinse and repeat. What you've got to realize is there are very few professional vocal teachers out there who haven't experienced just about every level of student, from full blown operatic singers who just want to fine tune a few things, to beginners who can't sing in anything other than the chest. And it sounds like you already have an advantage over them, what with being able to sing in different registers and do a smooth bridge. While its up to you to decide what you want to do, I would highly recommend just taking a lesson or two to see what the teacher is like and to get some feedback. And if you like it, great. If you don't, then there's no need to keep on with that teacher. You can find a different one or continue with singing by yourself, but with a few little snippets of information to help you out. Food for thought."
singing,2y0wgy,heart_of_blue,0,Thu Mar 5 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds reasonable and it makes sense. I'll probably do it soon then.  And I'm always hard on myself. I'm always unsatisfied with everything I do or achieve. I always think I can do better and I constantly consider myself ""not good enough"" at everything I do (even though facts prove the contrary and people tell me that as well) but that's who I am. I'm a perfectionist. It's a curse, man, let me tell you."
singing,2y0wgy,heart_of_blue,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"There is a term for that, I forgot it.  But basically you hit this roof as you said and stay that way, then all the sudden you bust through it and get better.   That's how a successful person explained to me about business too.  Every company hits a certain spot where most give up, but if you can bust through that you're solid."

singing,2y0wgy,xarahn,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"what are you stuck on with guitar? Often, when people get stuck, it's because they have bad form, or a poor grasp of theory. Another thing to remember is that noodling is not really practice. You need to actually study new techniques, songs, riffs, concepts, tunings, and generally advance your skills as a musician in order to get better. Picking up the guitar every day and improvising over the radio is great but if that's all you do you're going to find that you just play the same stuff over and over"
singing,2y0wgy,keakealani,5,Sun Mar 8 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Have they sucked and learned how to be great? I sincerely doubt it. Have they seen people who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket go and become famous singers?    I would not call myself great, but I went from having about 5 notes in my range and a complete inability to match pitch to having over 2 octaves range and the ability to match pitch and sound decent. So yea, I say anyone can learn to sing."

singing,2y0wgy,JayceCantor,3,Thu Mar 5 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"It take years to get great at anything. If it was really easy to be great at stuff, everyone would be great at everything. You have to work through a long time of failing at something over and over, in every way you can discover, before you can do a fantastic job.   If you love this thing, stick with it, suck at it constantly so you learn how to not suck, and later you'll be good. Or stop doing it and do something else, but it will be the same process."
singing,2y0wgy,SevenSixtyOne,-1,Thu Mar 5 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"Some people seem to ""get it"" very fast though."
singing,2y0wgy,keakealani,5,Thu Mar 5 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"But it's just like anything else that requires ability - some people are born natural athletes. One of my friends is like that, she can pick up new sports easily and has been nationally and globally ranked in a couple of different sports, and has competed professionally. Others have to train and practice for years and years to get even halfway to her starting level.   Is it fair? No. But neither is any other god-given thing in life. People are born rich or poor, smart or dumb, but it's what you do with your lot that matters. My friend the phenomenal athlete had heaps of ""natural talent"" to start with, but she also works harder than anyone else I know. She took her potential to its absolute max, and that's what makes her so impressive to me... her determination and drive.   You are working hard to become the best you can be, and that is admirable. You may never be great, but it's a worthwhile pursuit so long as you are enjoying yourself. Most of us will never ever be truly great at anything, but achieving greatness for greatness' sake is poor motivation. You will keep improving as long as you keep practicing. It may be very slow going, your learning curve may look very different from that of naturally great singers, and you may never see a record deal, but there is still value in your training. You're only a year into it, mostly practicing on your own. Of course you still have a lot to work on. Even professional singers can continue to improve - listen to Rihanna from her early days, and how much better her voice is now. Maybe a new vocal coach is what you need to get out of your rut?"
singing,2y0wgy,SevenSixtyOne,-1,Thu Mar 5 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"""Most of us will never ever be truly great at anything.""  If so, only because we don't want to. I strongly believe anyone can become great at SOMETHING. All you need is determination, practice and love for what you're doing which'll drive you forward. I know it's somewhat a contradiction to my original post but I really believe that. Just having a bad day today.  And yeah, I'll get a teacher soon. Thanks."
singing,2y0wgy,keakealani,2,Thu Mar 5 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"If so, only because we don't want to.   Well, even if I were to agree with that, I don't believe that anyone can be great at the specific thing they want to be great at, or the thing that they love. Most of us are very lucky to be good enough at doing something that pays the bills, and we do what we love as a hobby.   I'm not trying to rain on your parade - just saying that focusing too much on being ""great"" isn't necessarily healthy. I think there's a lot of benefit to separating greatness from personal enjoyment."
singing,2y0wgy,SevenSixtyOne,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"If everyone had the same opinion as the one stated above then most people who are considered ""great"" would never become ""great"" because they'd be stopped by such beliefs. I'm not saying that everyone can be great at something he/she wishes, I agree with that but everyone should try. It'd be stupid not to.  I remember back in the day when I was just a kid everyone was telling me that my skills regarding english language suck. My private tutors were telling me that I shouldn't even consider studying this field and going to the university because ""I won't manage"". Well, if I listened to them I'd never aquire such skills as I have now and I'd never be a fluent English speaker, translator etc. English is so natural to me now that I speak it even more than my own language (Polish) and I even think in English. All because I decided to keep at it with passion, dedication and persistence. There was love there too, I really like this language and studying it was a pleasure (well, still is, I have one year left at the university and then I'm done).  There are also other examples but I think I made my point ;) Never listen to people telling you what you can or can't do. Do what you want and what you love and always strive for perfection. That's my take on it."

We actually agree then. I'm not saying don't try, I'm just saying there's no point in being unhappy or disappointed if you don't turn out to be great. Learning a language and becoming proficient in it is not the same thing as learning an art form such as singing. Knowing the rules and vocabulary of a language doesn't make you a poet, you dig?"
singing,2y0wgy,Masklin,-1,Thu Mar 5 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's very similar. Both require a lot of practice, patience and dedication. Speaking different language and being fluent in it is a skill. Singing is a skill. Both can be learned."

Learning is always good, I would never discourage anyone from learning. And I'm not disagreeing with you - clearly learning English was worthwhile and beneficial for you, and that's fantastic.   But you're talking about being GREAT. Fluency is not greatness. I have a degree in English. Objectively, I know I have a better grasp of it than most speakers, even most native speakers, but I don't consider myself ""great."" Further, I don't see the point in making that kind of declaration.    You seem really, really preoccupied with becoming a great and famous singer. I wish you luck with that, I really do."
