CableManagement,3e4x5e,RockTripod,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:27:49 2015 UTC,yeah i figured based on the indentations of the side panel visible. For i hated how there is technically two fan mounting positions in the front but the fan pushing air into the drive cages is incredibly restricted. Im so much happier with my new case.

CableManagement,3dydgj,SuperNinjaBot,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:57 2015 UTC,I would justify it as an upgrade so you can eventually pick up a newer GFX card.  You dont even need to get the GFX card.  Just so you could.

CableManagement,3dydgj,senses3,8,Mon Jul 20 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"One thing to always consider, when a PSU goes, it can take EVERYTHING with it..."
CableManagement,3dydgj,Cr1ms0ngh0st,4,Mon Jul 20 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"If you aren't able to get a new PSU (which I seriously recommend), keep the wires even with each other so they overlap as much as possible. Zip tie the wires at the psu as tight and straight as possible so they look very neat. Remove the cpu cooler, turn it 90 deg ccw then fold the wires coming out of the fan onto each other about 3 times so it ends up being about 2"" long then zip tie and stuff them as close to the mobo as possible. The 4 pin power should be laid parallel with the top of the mobo as much as possible. You might actually just want to run it taught right back to the psu wires where you will zip tie all the wires together so it will always stay in the place you leave it. Always put a zip tie around the wires at the PSU so you keep them neat and straight.   Run the usb straight down to the bottom of the case and either use some zip tie pads (if you have them) to secure it to the bottom of the case. Do the same with the fpanel connectors, optimally you would tie all the front panel usb/led wires together to make it as clean as possible.   Definitely take all the sata cables and tie them together with either a ziptie or velcro tape. They will look very neat if they are put on top of one another. You should probably get identical sata cables too so you don't have a bunch of ugly colors in your case. Don't let the sata cables bunch up like that, stuff them behind the mobo tray as much as possible but don't let them bunch up behind there so there will be any problems because of it.    If you want to you could also either get some plastic wire housing stuff and wrap it around your power cables or wrap them in something else that will make them look much less ugly, because it looks pretty damn ugly.  I know a lot of people here hate zip ties in favor of velcro, but a lot of people aren't going to be going back in to their computers to move stuff around so zip ties work just fine. They actually end up being better in my experience because they hold tighter and are less bulky.   TL;DR: read the whole thing, I'm not summarizing it.  Good luck and have fun!"

I am really excited about putting together a similar Mini ITX build in the near future, and I have one quick question regarding your fan direction.   I've seen a few builds now where the builder has chosen forced draft through the radiator (good imho) but then the discharge from the radiator is into the case (bad imho). My thought is that induced draft through the radiator (flipping your fans around) and subsequently pulling warm air flow out of the case is better than the more efficient forced draft and blowing hot air onto your mobo and the back of your GPU.  I saw the temps you posted, and they look good, but I just wonder if they could get even better with the alternate arrangement.  tl;dr Can you give me your reasoning behind the radiator fan arrangement you chose?  Thank you!"
CableManagement,3ddrao,ISkypeWithMyCat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"I have 2x120mm fans pulling air in from the side and 1x120mm pulling in from the front. The only exhaust is the 80mm in the rear. I really wanted to keep positive air pressure in this case because of the amount of vent area, especially on the left next to the GPU. If the side fans were configured as exhaust then there would be masses of dust pulled in. The sides and front are also the only vents that came with fan filters (besides the psu).  In terms of temps; I could get them much lower, but I set my overclocks/voltages to make maximum use of my cooling potential. Also note that those temps were at prime95 style loads."

CableManagement,3ddw8d,Skytoucher,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:21 2015 UTC,Thanks mate! Haha I think its funny no one else had commented on the name yet. Maybe not many people know what it means.. Who knows. I am just impressed it hasnt even come close to catching on fire yet.
CableManagement,3ddw8d,encaseme,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:17 2015 UTC,Awesome work! What guide did you use to sew your cables?
CableManagement,3ddw8d,redgator12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:53 2015 UTC,I couldnt even tell you tbh. It was one of the first to pop up on youtube...
CableManagement,3ddw8d,redgator12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:40 2015 UTC,Do you use it to run vagrant?
CableManagement,3ddw8d,redgator12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"No that would be pretty clever though. I named it vagrant because the definition of vagrant is ""a person without a settled home"" and its home is made of cardboard so it isn't really settled..."
CableManagement,3d9ju8,megarayj,20,Tue Jul 14 15:46:19 2015 UTC,I hope your friend gets better.

CableManagement,3d9ju8,jahrefar,8,Tue Jul 14 16:00:41 2015 UTC,I knew cabletherapy was the cure. I'm glad you are ok.
CableManagement,3d9ju8,kellisamberlee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:57 2015 UTC,I think you guys need new accounts
CableManagement,3d9ju8,jahrefar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"lol, why?"
CableManagement,3d9ju8,kellisamberlee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"I would prefer to keep my account secret, but maybe that's just me"
CableManagement,3d9ju8,GuestVeea,4,Wed Jul 15 19:41:09 2015 UTC,That was a fantastic improvement. looks beautiful

CableManagement,3d9ju8,DCPL,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"Nice cable management, the only thing that bothers me a little and would make it perfect would be matching the GPU shroud color with the RAM and CPU cooler."
CableManagement,3d9ju8,h0uz3_,2,Tue Jul 14 20:31:40 2015 UTC,Don't see many Cosmos 2's on here glad to see another person who actually owns one with me :)
CableManagement,3d9ju8,Pyldriver,2,Tue Jul 14 20:32:00 2015 UTC,Your post did not give me cancer!
CableManagement,3d9ju8,jangobotito,2,Tue Jul 14 20:40:25 2015 UTC,only thing left that i would do is spin the rad 180 degrees
CableManagement,3d9ju8,hollow3k,2,Wed Jul 15 03:16:39 2015 UTC,I'd be happy if mine looked like the first picture.  So difficult getting anything good out of my Antec 900.

CableManagement,3d9uux,yaboyy1120,2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the 4 pin CPU power plug or the 24-pin main mobo plug? The r5's have a fairly large cutout to route the cpu cable and the only way I can see you are not able to get it to fit there is that either your mobo its self is blocking part of the routing hole, if you have fans mount to the top exhaust vents, or the cable for that CPU connector has no more slack in it and cant stretch to the length needed to route that way."
CableManagement,3d9uux,Barracuda420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"4 pin CPU power. The connector has enough length, and it seems like I'm the only person who has this problem, so I guess I'm just a doof. The thing is, because of the DRP3, I can't even really see if the motherboard itself is blocking the hole. sigh Guess I'm taking my motherboard out tonight. Thanks for your help!"
CableManagement,3d9uux,Barracuda420,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yea just save yourself the headache of trying to get it to work as is and just unmount the mobo while leaving as much on it as you can. Then route the cable through and put it all back together. The extra practice is always a plus, still a bummer."
CableManagement,3d9uux,Barracuda420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:55 2015 UTC,Did you ever figure it out?
CableManagement,3d82u4,kevzhu,2,Tue Jul 14 06:19:26 2015 UTC,Very nice. Got a link to those combs?

CableManagement,3d82u4,XSerenity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:45 2015 UTC,You could probably sell those...very useful.
CableManagement,3d82u4,BstoneArch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:01:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, that looks awesome! I have access to a laser cutter (from the pics it looks like it's the same model). I'm an architecture student so I know how to use cad and all that jazz. Any chance you could send me the template? If not, what dimension did you use for the diameter of the cable sleeves?"
CableManagement,3d82u4,BstoneArch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, and nice case btw! Just bought the same exact one"
CableManagement,3d82u4,BstoneArch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"Here you go - have at it. Just post up pics after :)  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwPewZAtvWiJdmpKQklibjhrcGc/view?usp=sharing  I used a sleeve+wire diameter of 3.5mm. These are cut from 1/8"" acrylic, but I would like to go thicker next time for sturdiness (maybe 3/16"")"
CableManagement,3d82u4,Rawriamjohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll see if my school has any 3/16"" in stock and use that. I'll let you know how it turns out. Have you had problems with the 1/8"" being too brittle? Also, are your sleeves 3mm and you added .5mm for tolerance?   edit: added the last sentence"
CableManagement,3d7rgy,Thebananamanstan,7,Tue Jul 14 04:22:08 2015 UTC,son why are you blowing hot air onto your GPU?
CableManagement,3d7rgy,gaveasky,2,Tue Jul 14 07:44:21 2015 UTC,"Pulling air from top of case out the back, if i put it on the bottom its gonna pull from the gpu, cpu cooler only mounts this way :/"
CableManagement,3d7rgy,gaveasky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"Well I guess it comes down to what temperature you value most, a cool GPU or a cool CPU."
CableManagement,3d7rgy,alabastercandymaster,4,Tue Jul 14 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"Both the Cpu and Gpu are AMD, they're both gonna be little balls of fire anyways."
CableManagement,3d7rgy,Soltra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:46:14 2015 UTC,Is that a 212?  I thought you could mount those to face the back.

CableManagement,3d7rgy,Barracuda420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:28:45 2015 UTC,Not bad at all for a budget build.
CableManagement,3d5sqb,jahrefar,4,Mon Jul 13 19:19:43 2015 UTC,"No modular PSU, custom sleeved cables or anything crazy, just simple, well done cable management. Well done. Just seeing all the cables from your PSU go straight through the hole and out of sight is very nice.  Too many builds here and in /r/buildapc where people don't seem to understand how to use the grommeted cable management holes."
CableManagement,3d5sqb,KrazyBacon,3,Mon Jul 13 20:14:21 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Appreciate it :)
CableManagement,3d5sqb,bitingaddict,2,Mon Jul 13 20:27:56 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that bad to begin with, but still improved. Nice!"
CableManagement,3d5sqb,SimmaDownNa,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:58 2015 UTC,What changed? All I see is some fans got moved around.
CableManagement,3d5sqb,auron_py,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"1st picture is all about airflow. Tucking shit away so air can flow smoothly, and doing so regardsless of the visuals.  I did my current build having aesthetics in mind, without buying anything other than a pack of cable ties. I refitted the cables to the GPU, bottom cables in the motherboard and a little bit nitpicking here and there. The main job was the back of the case, which still isn't good enough imo"
