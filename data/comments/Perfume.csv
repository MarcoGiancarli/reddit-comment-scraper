But only music videos. So, additional stuff can't be watched without proxy. And actually, no one is using MyVideo anyways...  I think most stuff on YT is music. I once read that 60 % of all youtube videos are blocked in Germany. And streaming is blocked, too. Also because of licensing... but other licensing than the music thing...  Still, Youtube is the most popular video site in Germany... for streaming, we can use Twitch at least..."

Perfume,3cq94d,The_Vince_McMahon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:19:22 2015 UTC,It is hard to tell who is who since it has been so long.  I personally am not into their earlier music.  2:50 That is Nocchi  2:52 That is A-Chan  2:54 That is Kashiyuka  The shape of their faces stays the same over the years unlike k-pop stars.
Perfume,3cq94d,SecretCatPolicy,4,Thu Jul 9 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"Are you serious?  I think they're instantly recognisable.

The prevalence of plastic surgery being done in Korea is Fascinating to me as an american because they shape of there faces change so much over the years. Michael Jackson for example is kind of amazing because he changed so much. Kpop stars don't change nearly as much but they do to a point where it becomes quite hard to tell who is who if are watching a video from many years ago.

Perfume,37p47g,christianinkorea,6,Fri May 29 08:05:13 2015 UTC,"For the most part, they switch between hand mics and their headsets due to the choreography of whatever song(s) they perform.  Some songs can only be performed one way, while some songs can be played either way.    Contrary to the previous commenter, I noticed that they tend to speak to the audience using both whenever they can.  I assume it's to show the audience that both types of mics are working and to diffuse the notion that they're lip syncing (although my guess is as good as yours)."
Perfume,37p47g,Aerisu,3,Fri May 29 12:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think mics are part of the choreography but are not connected to the general sound most of the time. They almost never use mics to speak to the crowd, they use the headset instead."

Also there are No ""goodies"" like in the Japanese PTA.  I've been a member since day one and it's nice to support Perfume and all but this might be the last year that I'm paying for.  Edit: if your still curious you can try a year its only $15."
Perfume,36rqzf,Habieru7,1 point,Thu May 21 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was thinking about testing it. However, for students like me, even $15 can be much... For this money I can also buy the World Tour 2nd DVD..."
Perfume,36rqzf,erly,3,Fri May 22 08:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. I definitely think so. I entered the Meet & Greet drawing for the WT3rd in LA and won.  I have hugged all three. I made A-Chan cry. But now I am kicking myself for not signing up for the Japanese PTA, because other folks I met them with got the DVD with the footage and I haven't seen it yet, except for a picture one friend sent me of A-Chan and I hugging."
Perfume,36rqzf,erly,1 point,Fri May 22 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"Nice. Is there something like a community forum on their website?  Do you mean the PTA Vol. 7 DVD? It's the DVD with the Kashiyuka tennis scene... Are these DVDs free for all Japanese PTA members?   I dunno if I am a person who should go to a meet and greet. When I think about how easy it would have been for me to see Perfume live and that I didn't use any of these chances... And I don't speak Japanese... Next time they will come to Germany or Korea, I will go there if I am in the specific of these countries at that time. Or I go to Japan... I guess I have to go to Japan anyways somehow and visit some old friends...  Actually, what seems pretty nice about PTA is the ticket offer before non-PTA members, however, actually I think outside of Japan, it still wouldn't be that hard to get a ticket even when not PTA member..."
Perfume,36rqzf,erly,2,Fri May 22 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was the Vol. 7, those DVDs get sent out to all Japanese members free, the price of membership is around $50 USD/year.   All I've seen is that they do Meet & Greets (so far) when they visit a new city on tour. I speak some Japanese, but not enough to really have a conversation. A few folks spoke really well, but some spoke none at all, and there were translators helping out.   I'm not in Japan, so the concert tickets aren't something I am able to utilize, but I was really glad I was in world PTA when I won... I really was not expecting to."

Perfume,35g762,Strokavich,3,Sun May 10 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to be brief because I've been following them for awhile now.  A~chan: In my opinion, she's the essence that brings Perfume together. The absolute core member of the group. She's the most verbal one in interviews. She also seems to be the most conservative member. She has a girl next door vibe and is very emotional.  Kashiyuka: She seems to be the most soft-spoken in Perfume, but outside the group, she's a completely different animal. Her musical taste and style is the most eclectic out all the girls. The girls also joke around that she is probably the biggest party animal out of all of them.  Nocchi: She's quite an interesting woman. She appears very awkward at times, but is a blast to have around. She has a very peculiar taste in animals, especially alpacas. She seems to be conservative, but not as much as A~chan. In my opinion, the best dancer in the group."

Perfume,35g762,velvetprotein,6,Sun May 10 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Kashiyuka is perhaps the ""party girl"" of the group - I've seen her in clubs at Nakata DJ events and her boyfriend is (or at least was this time last year) 2Boy, a regular DJ at house/electro events here.   Nocchi is the most enamoured with other countries.   A-Chan is the most standard Japanese woman possible."

Perfume,35g762,ridingontherocket,3,Sun May 10 05:19:24 2015 UTC,"Taking a swing at this for fun, could be wrong though. From what I've seen, A-Chan is the most outgoing and talkative, no that there is necessarily a ""leader"" but I guess I'd consider her the leader if I had to pick one. Kashiyuka is more quiet than A-Chan and maybe more quiet than Nocchi, she's definitely more soft spoken than both of them. Nocchi is a bit of a mix of Kashiyuka and A-Chan in regards to being a mixture of outgoing and quiet. Again, this is what I've picked up from interviews, live shows, etc., I could be a bit wrong. This was rather fun to type out."
Perfume,35g762,Jonesgrieves,1 point,Sun May 10 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm, thank you. That will be useful."
Perfume,35g762,Jonesgrieves,2,Sun May 10 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"A~chan: Very outgoing, bubbly and talkative. Pretty much dominates any interview the girls do. Loves children. Girly and sort of the motherly type among the girls. I agree with the other posters that she's sort of the ""leader"" in the group.  Kashiyuka: Sort of quiet. Loves animals. Any time there is an animal in a tv show they appear on she's the first to hold it and play with it. She often says her favorite hobby is eating. The group says that on the day of a concert,she'll eat 5 or 6 meals. I've also heard that she's a bit of a party animal. Her dancing is very natural and flowy!   Nocchi: I think she's the goofball of the group. On their fan club videos she often takes the camera and films the other group members. She jokes around quite a bit with the girls. She's a little boyish. She doesn't wear skirts and her Japanese isn't proper ""girly"" Japanese like how the other two talk. She also seems to be really well liked among their staff so I assume she's really nice in person!"

It appears as a track on the group's debut album, Perfume: Complete Best.  Since their 2005 major debut, the original single has been difficult to find and can be found on auction sites for more than double its original price. In February 2008, it was re-released and included in the ""Fan Service -Prima Box-"" CD+DVD boxset.  The cover of ""Jenny wa Gokigen Naname"" became one of Perfume's staple songs, being performed on many of their major tours.

I especially like the video game sound in the bridge between the chorus and the second verse.  Overall, it looks like a fantastic release, and I cannot wait for the single to come in the mail.  And yes, I got the Relax Room edition.  Because reasons."
Perfume,349mec,Legend_of_El_Barto,3,Wed Apr 29 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Best single since LEVEL3 came out in my view.  Sometimes it takes me a few listens to get into songs but these three were all first-listen 'yeah, I like that' material.  I've been avoiding all threads to do with this as I like to come to new releases totally fresh, so I have little idea about these songs other than the first is used in a beer ad and the second is somehow linked to Isetan department store (and presumably the Dance Heels - now that's good marketing).  Is Toumei Ningen just a third song or is it also used somewhere else?  Good videos too.  Strange and creepy horror vibe throughout Pick Me Up, quite a new direction for Perfume.  Is there a full-length Relax In The City video?  Maybe with some city?  Toumei Ningen is great.  I looked up the kanji and found it was also a Pink Lady song - is it a cover of that?  I feel like both this and Pick Me Up, but Toumei Ningen in particular, are like film soundtracks with their strong, recurring and versatile main themes.  I got the standard edition, because I don't want a box and I like the art better.  Shame about the photobook but I can stand that.  Couldn't get there on release day but I went by Tower Records the next day instead; asked if there was a poster (I got one for the last two singles) and the guy presented me with a coaster instead.  They also gave out 'Perfume Anniversary' stickers with the CD."
Perfume,349mec,SecretCatPolicy,2,Sat May 2 00:52:17 2015 UTC,透明人間 is a very exciting dance number and I have been looping it since yesterday. Can't wait to see the LIVE.  Overall I am very pleased with this release. The video location for Relax in The City was a bit odd but the chorus is really catchy. Pick Me Up is amazing in all aspects! I dare say this release outshines Cling Cling and Sweet Refrain singles which felt like they were a bit of a disappointment.  Ordered the Relax Room Edition from Amazon JP!
Perfume,349mec,emrphy,2,Wed Apr 29 12:04:39 2015 UTC,Definitely the best release in a very long time. I'm loving all of the songs.
Perfume,349mec,skyforgers,2,Thu Apr 30 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, and I decided to comment because I don't see others sharing my view, I like the outfits, choreo, videos, designs etc. a lot more than the music itself. If it wasn't for that I don't think I would have liked the single as much. I love all the songs but I guess they just fell short of my expectations and none of them could give me that emotion-stirring feeling that I got from many other of their songs the first time I listened to them. They have certainly already grown on me at this point and they are really catchy but I feel like I'm still waiting for the real moment I will love this single. Probably when I see Pick me up performed live.  I bought both versions though.  Edit: I misread the date, PMU will be performed tomorrow~!"

For better continuity and flow, I would have translated the first verse as:   Whenever I pause and slowly stand up,  I confirm my existence  Since I'm certainly here.   For the chorus,   No one pays me any attention  Because of free will  I want to bask in the same light (or to move further from literal, ""I want to be seen"")  Too many gain (yes, that's the actual lyric...)  Only the wind runs through  and leaves it all behind  This invisible world, too many pains   I'm not really comfortable with the second half of the chorus translated as is.  I'll have to think about it more.  Nothing really different to say about the final verse.  Nice work!  This song has some seriously deep implications in Japanese that aren't really the most simple to translate into American culture (can't speak to UK culture).  Yasutaka has got a great track record of taking what could be interpreted as light-hearted lyrics and pairing them with great instrumentals into nice dance tracks which can make you seriously introspect if you actually think about them."
Perfume,347dkb,Xiratava,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"As a preface (and more as further commentary to anyone unfamiliar with the language), your last paragraph is very true and very important when considering a translation of a Japanese song. Artistically, Japanese tend to be heavy on contextual imagery and metaphor. This compounded with the often vague nature of the language and cultural norms very different from the West can make lyrics translations quite difficult and heavily influenced by the sensibilities of the translator.  I respectfully disagree with 'Invisible Man,' since ningen is human in particular, and I'd say mienai works better for invisible. But Invisible Man certainly isn't incorrect either, so it's a matter of personal preference.  I like your translation of the first verse. I'm curious how you got pause from hito kokyuu though; is it a colloquialism for pause? Did I take it too literally?  I had a very difficult time with 'jiyuu no sei', so I'm glad to see your interpretation more or less lines up with mine. Also, I really wasn't getting the meaning of 'bask [better choice than bathe, thanks!] in the same light,' but interpreting it as wanting to be seen (correlation between the 'mei' kanji in toumei and shoumei?) really makes it clear.  I do stand by my original translation of run through the wind / I'll leave the world behind, primarily because I don't see a conjunction between hashirinukeru to the next clause.  I certainly agree about the second half of the chorus. Not really an easy way to put it.  Thank you for the different interpretation! I feel like I can get tunnel vision, as it were, with translations, and seeing other takes on it is very helpful."
Perfume,347dkb,Xiratava,2,Thu Apr 30 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"I went with Invisible Man due to several cultural references that already exist, primarily the novel by Ralph Ellison and even Hollow Man, the film.  Transparent man is certainly a valid interpretation, it just seems a little foreign in context.  一呼吸 is indeed a colloquialism.  呼吸 by itself means breath, and with the counter ""一"" then 'a breath' is a valid translation.  Like in English speakers, if someone says 'take a breath' it can also mean to pause for a second.  Translating lyrics across languages really has multiple layers of complexity, as sometimes the original writer uses some artistic license to manipulate phrases and grammar to fit the piece.  Recognizing those liberties isn't easy, but after a while you get to know certain styles.  In terms of avoiding tunnel vision, sometimes I read through my translation to see how it flows and if it fits the mood of the song.  Often times I find lines that seem out of place given the surrounding lyrics, and that's when I go back to the source to see how else it could be interpreted.  Keep an open mind, and always remember to step back, lest you venture too deep into the trees to see the forest."
Perfume,347dkb,shb117,1 point,Fri May 1 00:51:45 2015 UTC,Are you sure its 'too many gain'? It still sounds like toumei ningen to me...
Perfume,347dkb,shb117,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, copied this from a scan of the page with the lyrics. I can triple check when my copy arrives.  I agree it sounds a lot like toumei ningen though."

Perfume,31s5c9,Xiratava,3,Tue Apr 7 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"Did a by-ear transcription and quick translation from the Perfume LOCKS! broadcast of RITC.  Some notes:   Did the transcription by ear so there may be differences from the released lyrics.  Please forgive! As noted, komorebi has no literal translation in English.  Side note, this Wong-Fu video is about komorebi as well as other untranslatable words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsSyQfi218. Overall this song is very light and joyful.  Unlike Pick Me Up, I don't think there are too many deeper undertones that could be picked out.  Then again, I was never very good at literary interpretation. As with my PMU translation, I tried to maintain Japanese meaning while maximizing flow in English.  If you're trying to learn either language in either direction, be careful! If people ask for it, I can include Romaji as well (or at least Furigana).  Otherwise I'll keep it simple with just the two languages. Please message me before using the translation in any projects.  Feedback welcome!"

When the second verse comes in, Nakata adds a second keyboard track that adds great dynamic to the song. The little changes and subtle blips and bloops are a nice touch. Laser Beam is simply full style and flair. So cool to listen to.  Second is Dream Fighter and third is Clockwork. Honorable mention is Polyrhythm just because it's their breakthrough song and it hardly ever gets repetitive to me."

Perfume,318aby,HanabiOAgeruNo,2,Thu Apr 2 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it could just be random stuff, but knowing Perfume, it might just have some sort of meaning behind it.  It has the lines 'Pick Me up', 'Jump Lightly' and 'towards the sky' which could explain the orbital velocity, acceleration, gravitational PE and [KE+PE] equations. Buoyancy force equation because they 'levitated' into the mannequin world, hence you'd need to find out how much air they displaced or something I guess. And there is a line (according to /u/Xiratava's post) that goes 'As timings slowly/gradually converge' which could be referring to a singularity, hence the breakdown in the laws of Physics? This could be the point in the video where the mannequin world gets destroyed (Nocchi jumps, Kashi is cornered, and A-chan is trapped).  Taking the MV at face value, there seem to be three main 'versions' of Perfume. The normal ones, who are unwittingly sucked into the mannequin world, the mannequin versions, who are trapped with nowhere to go, and the 'blue' (evil?) Perfume, who seem to be controlling everything. I personally love that this MV can be interpreted as simply or as complexly as you want to."
Perfume,3177tu,Xiratava,4,Thu Apr 2 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Amuse has a block up currently on YouTube where I have the translation timed with the MV.  So as a stop-gap, figured I'd just post the translation/transcription as an image.  This is not strictly a literal dictionary translation (ie. not copypasted from Google Translate like others out there).  I tried to convey the original meaning in a coherent manner while maintaining flow in English.  Since Japanese sentence structure puts verbs at the end, several of the lines have been switched from their Japanese placement.  Feedback is welcome and might make it into a future translation or the MV version (might upload elsewhere as well...).  Please message me before using my translation elsewhere."

Perfume,3101l3,Joviyan,2,Wed Apr 1 09:38:45 2015 UTC,"Perfume is suddenly teleported to another dimension by the ""dancing mannequins"", the overseers of space and time (they are conjuring and manipulating holograms of physics formulas so I can only assume that's what they are) to free their mannequin twins and save them from the army of evil mannequins, but what's the deeper meaning? Maybe this dimension is a physical world reconstruction of the girls' minds or psyches created by the overseers. And they're saving themselves from a general feeling of being trapped, or maybe something as dark as a mental illness of some sort. I dunno, since it's Perfume it's probably safest to stick with the most light-hearted conclusion. After all, it's just a 4-minute long ad for a Japanese department store. But definitely one of their more interesting videos! I kind of think this will be their first #1 single in a long time."
Perfume,3101l3,Xiratava,2,Wed Apr 1 03:49:51 2015 UTC,Or....it's about the clothes on display (tie-in with the Itesan fashion line that just released) wanting to be picked up off the rack and worn to add some energy to their otherwise meek existence on a mannequin.

Perfume,3101l3,SpendingAllMyTime,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"The ""Pick Me Up"" during the chorus sounded odd to me during the first listen, but this has definitely grown on me, thanks to the girls sounding the best they have in a long while. Nocchi and A-chan sounded so good! Kashi got a few lines in here and there, but I liked her parts as well. And it's so nice to see them rocking something other than the mini skirt- dress - shorts triplet."

Perfume,30h1uo,shb117,2,Fri Mar 27 08:48:36 2015 UTC,Hope the box doesn't ship pre-assembled.  Or I hope CDJapan packages it really well and FedEx doesn't mishandle it.
Perfume,30h1uo,Xiratava,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:11:26 2015 UTC,Why don't you order from Amazon Japan? It seems to be about the same overall but Amazon actually gives priority shipping.
Perfume,30h1uo,Xiratava,2,Fri Mar 27 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"Same concern applies.  That box looks fragile.  I have reward points with CDJapan to use up, plus I've seen how they've shipped my posters from previous First Press bonuses.  Also ordered from YesAsia before but I found CDJapan to be better at how they package things.  Never ordered anything from Amazon JP - how is their packaging?  And what carrier do they use for shipping?  CDJapan uses FedEx Int'l Priority for fast shipping but you can choose lower cost methods as well."
Perfume,30h1uo,Xiratava,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:01:12 2015 UTC,Amazon JP only uses FedEx or the other really fast company I can't remember. They say 2-4 day international shipping so can't get faster than that.  I was considering CDJapan but I saw that this was 2400 yen + minimum of 700 yen for Air mail so 3100 yen.  Amazon has it for 2000 yen + 1300 shipping (only 2-4 day shipping available) so total of 3300 yen.  Getting upgraded to fast air mail from basic for only 200 yen more? It was a no brainer for me.  I have never used Amazon JP before but I am confident they will pack everything as well as Amazon UK does.
Perfume,30fbos,skyforgers,4,Thu Mar 26 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"More solo shots - yay!

I had very little time before catching my flight out but I did manage to walk around and catch some of the Perfume costumes and recommendations scattered around the place.  In particular I bought the Sentaro collaboration mochi called yoru sakura.  It is delicious. One of the best examples I have tasted. Yum.

Perfume,2zn7k5,perfume00,3,Thu Mar 19 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"As their popularity grows, they'll have more ""normal"" fans.  Before they switched to Universal, they really didn't do any promotion or fan support internationally. So the casual/relaxed fans would have difficulty staying interested when it's hard to buy CDs, the music isn't sold digitaly, there's no MVs on YouTube, none of their friends know about the band at all, there's no official online accounts or fan clubs, etc. Over time only the ""extreme"" fans are left because only they're focused enough to keep being a fan despite all that.   But now that they're promoting internationally and have things like WPTA and the social media accounts like all the other international groups do, it'll be easier to keep normal fans interested. :)"
Perfume,2zn7k5,the320x200,6,Fri Mar 20 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"Perfume are still a very 'niche' group in the west. I'm sure they do attract a lot of creepy internet weeaboos because of this. Unlike in Japan where they're a massive group with a huge fanbase, the creeps probably stand out more over here. Japan certainly has creeps too just like every other country so it's pretty unfair to write off an entire fanbase."
Perfume,2zn7k5,qop666,5,Sat Mar 21 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're describing Perfume threads on the /jp/ board of 4chan. That stuff isn't serious it's just a bunch of people acting up for a laugh.   When you have a 5 page thread about Kashiyuka's armpits with everyone posting the best armpit shots it's not because they're actually attracted to her pits (well not anywhere as much as they pretend to be), it's just a bit of fun. Likewise when they argue constantly about which Perfume is the best wife. Nocchi's hair is a very common topic and many insults are thrown, this isn't at all serious.  In fact I'm almost 100% sure you're talking about Perfume threads on /jp/, am I wrong in thinking this? It's the same thing across a lot of the different threads on 4chan. You go to a Fire Emblem thread and they'll be arguing about who's the best waifu. Heck go to a hip-hop thread in /mu/ and they'll argue who is the best hip-hop husbando. It's just a thing that's done, wallowing in your own crapulence."
Perfume,2zn7k5,bone577,3,Tue Mar 24 11:04:54 2015 UTC,Ugh I didn't know they had perfume threads on 4chan so I just checked it out. Impossible to find anything good with all the crap. Every 5th post is a Kashiyuka armpit pic. Glad our subreddit doesn't have shit like that.
Perfume,2zn7k5,shb117,2,Tue Mar 24 13:53:55 2015 UTC,"Bahaha, it's not so bad just don't take it serious. It's the only place you can talk about how it feels to know you'll never be smothered by Yuka's armpits. There's also a lot of resources at the top of each thread and they're really good. Already have Clips but it was nice to get real high quality videos of their newer music videos."
Perfume,2zn7k5,bone577,3,Tue Mar 24 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"The reason for this is because Japophilia is a thing outside of Japan. There are people who are obsessed with Japanese pop culture and consider themselves of good taste, while actually being ignorant of the other aspects of Japanese culture (such as its history, language, classical Japanese culture, etc.). The term ""weeaboo"" or ""otaku"" is probably the best word I can use to describe these people, even though it's not completely accurate in this context.  As others have mentioned, the more popular Perfume gets, the more fans they will get. Some of those fans will be creepers. Others will have anxiety or mental stability issues. Every single celebrity has ""those"" types of fans, and the best thing you can do is ignore them. I've learned that engaging these people will never have a positive result, whether online or in real life."
Perfume,2zn7k5,dangersandwich,3,Sat Mar 21 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel. I mean some things are alright. But I get really uncomfortable when people start drooling over their bodies. It seems really perverted and reminds me of idol groups in Japan and their fanbase. I like to think Perfume has evolved beyond that status. I've heard some people even jokingly say they're going to marry this member or that member. That just seems disturbing to me even if it's not serious. Or when someone posts on the facebook group about ""their 1st dream with Perfume.""  I met several western fans and some have been really cool people. But I am pretty worried about how many western fans come off to the Japanese crowd."
Perfume,2zn7k5,King_of_Tacos,2,Fri Mar 20 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"I understand your sentiments. I don't know what other's perceptions of me are, but I really enjoy Perfume and their music always lifts my spirits. I have learned a lot in terms of Japanese by listening to Perfume LOCKS and various things on YouTube (which is how I found Perfume in the first place), but Perfume is one source of many for listening comprehension practice. I think that I really like Perfume because they are so down to earth, and are very professional. I relate to them easily, and maybe live a little vicariously through their adventures... but it is more of an appreciation for them realizing their dreams and enjoying it with them.   I also attended the LA show, but I didn't camp out in line, and I was content standing towards the back of the venue where I could still see and not be pushed around. Though, for now I will have to second /u/the320x200, a lot of people in the US at least that are aware of Perfume are either otaku or have strong interest in Japan in some way. Perfume, and even Capsule are still pretty niche over here."
Perfume,2zn7k5,erly,2,Fri Mar 20 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"Most of the offensive fans are kids. They don't have much experience behind their short years so it comes off as immature (which they literally are). As Perfume becomes more and more popular, they will attract more and more fans of this nature. They will also attract fans much worse than this.  Take the time to know all of these people who share the same excitement for Perfume as you, but don't feel obligated to force a friendship if you don't share the same views."
Perfume,2zn7k5,phych,3,Wed Mar 25 06:51:19 2015 UTC,Can you really preach about how weird it is that westerners look up to perfume as 'gods' when you have idol groups in Japan that are specifically marketed for that reason?
Perfume,2zn7k5,milly2020,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"I've read a few unpleasant post/comments here and there but i try not to take them seriously (don't feed the trolls).  As a long time fan I have nothing but respect for Perfume/staff,  But unfortunately there will always be obsessive fanatics who only make other look bad, I guess my only advice is to ignore them and hope it doesn't get out of hand."
Perfume,2zn7k5,Habieru7,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:09:57 2015 UTC,"I think when you combine the two dangerous forces of a typical one-upping Internet-centered fanbase (that has only each others' extreme statements of attachedness to judge each other by) with the special brand of escapists known as Japanophiles (who think they're any better than Harry Potter-obsessed types because they take refuge from adulthood in a foreign culture instead of a fictitious universe), you get the Perfume fans you're ashamed of. As others in this thread have said, as a segment of the fanbase these poorly socialized zealots will be diluted by more normal people as Perfume's popularity expands beyond Western ""otaku.""  tl;dr: Don't worry, Perfume will outgrow them"
Perfume,2zn7k5,Arael15th,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Can I ask, what were the London fans like? Why were you embarrassed?"
Perfume,2zn7k5,katakatakara,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:54:08 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I think its a larger issue with young people who become obsessed with Japan and get caught up in trying to be a bigger ""fan"" everyone else. This is why there is such a big problem with Western folks who consider themselves otaku. They have a misguided view of Japanese society and its culture. So because Perfume is a big act, people have become obsessive about them too.  I find it odd that people think of the women in that way, unlike all the AKB type groups, expression of sexuality has been very muted in their performances and videos. This is one of the main reasons I don't consider them as idols. And because I don't see them as idols, the depth of the obsession many Westerner's seem to have seems bizarre.  At the same time, many westerner's act this way about domestic musicians, Taylor Swift, Justin Beber, etc. Perhaps, in this case, it seems more strange because Perfume is Japanese and the majority of the fan base in Japan doesn't act like that.  Going to see them live had been a goal of mine for years. I went to the LA show and was actually pleasantly surprised, I thought the fans were going to be much much worse based on my own history as and previous experience with Japanese subculture obsessed folks."

Perfume,2wjlra,Strokavich,3,Fri Feb 20 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"How often do they sing live, instead of lip synch?   During their live shows in Japan they sing live a lot. The DVD/Bluray releases however are mixed very differently to heavily favor the backing track.   Are they the sole creators, or is there a company that makes the songs for them?   Their music is created by Nakata, their choreographer is Mikiko and their effects/visuals are done by Rhizomatiks.   Is there a ""uniform"" of Perfume, or is the only constant thing their hairstyle?   Although it's less true now, there was a motif where Nocchi wore shorts, A-chain long dresses/skirts and Kashiyuka shorter dresses/skirts. Also a consistent thing is that (unless they're doing a collab) their performances are just the 3 of them on stage, no backup dancers/musicians.   I think me favorite member is Kashiyuka, although I wish her stage name was shorter and easier to remember like A-Chan and Nocchi.   For what it's worth, when people cheer her name during shows they say Yuka-chan. :)"

Perfume,2wjlra,HoneyShaft,2,Thu Mar 19 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"I can remember Yuka-chan a lot easier :P  So it looks like they don't write the songs? Are they just performers, or is there some creative input? Yeah, i have watched a couple live performances, and it's always just them, which is nice."
Perfume,2wjlra,the320x200,3,Fri Feb 20 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"So it looks like they don't write the songs? Are they just performers, or is there some creative input?   Yeah no, their songs are written by Nakata. I'm sure they have opinions about the music and choreography which they voice, but their main role is the performance. It takes a team to create Perfume. :) Their TV hosting and radio shows would have more of their sole input."

Perfume,2wjlra,gingangguli,3,Fri Feb 20 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really know the answers to some of your questions, so I'll just answer what I can.  1. Most of their songs are lip synced, since it's difficult to recreate all the processing done on their vocals. It's also pretty hard to sing while doing all their dancing, so I like to think that they make up for the lip syncing with their choreography.  2. Their writer/producer, Yasutaka Nakata, is, in my opinion, pretty much the reason why their songs are so great and so different from other idol groups. I think that Nakata allows them to sing the songs however they want though.  5. Nocchi wears shorts, and A-chan wears skirts and dresses that are longer and more frilly than what Kashiyuka wears."
Perfume,2wjlra,Arael15th,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i noticed that they seemed to be a pattern to the clothing style, but good to know it's basically each ones style."

Perfume,2wjlra,Teinei,1 point,Mon Feb 23 11:07:31 2015 UTC,I I think that Nakata allows them to sing the songs however they want though.   He's quite strict in having them sing as flatly and tonelessly as possible when recording because it's easier to autotune/process.
Perfume,2wjlra,lunarcrystal,3,Thu Mar 12 05:13:44 2015 UTC,"Kashiyuka also has an alter-ego who hasn't made an appearance in a while, JK Kashiyuka.  See this video and this one.  The girls do have some input on the lyrics for the songs though it's very minimal.  You can see their earlier performances and singles from when they were still in high school (early 2000's).  Since 2003, their music comes all from Nakata.  He is also the producer for his own duo, Capsule.  Check out some of their songs if you like Perfume's style.  Perfume's major break was from a 2008 recycling campaign run by NHK.  A well known artist (Kimura Kaela) liked a previous release, Chocolate Disco, and played it on her radio show.  This led to NHK picking up Polyrhythm for their campaign and gave Perfume the boost to nationwide levels.  Since then, they have been a prominent artist with multiple releases reaching #1 on the Oricon charts (all their albums did, plus other singles), though other groups (AKB48, Morning Musume, etc) still garner greater popularity.  Much of what Perfume is today is quite different from their humble beginnings.  Even compared to the GAME and Triangle era, you can definitely tell that Perfume is much more ""pop"" versus the more EDM/techno sound from back then.  The girls have definitely changed with their music as well.  Go and watch some older iconic videos (Chocolate Disco, Macaroni, Dream Fighter), some middle ones (Glitter, Laser Beam, etc) and compare with the more recent 1mm, Sweet Refrain, Magic of Love, Cling Cling.  If you go even further into their Beehive era, you'll see even greater changes.  Their performances are always the winner for me.  They are perfectly synchronized, dance in heels, and have even learned their choreo backwards (see the Magic of Love video, the sequence beginning around 2:24).  That effort and dedication puts them at the top in my book - very few other artists really show that level of passion."

Otherwise I will have to just hope there's still wristbands in stock by the time I get to Austin.

Perfume,2s56qd,shb117,7,Mon Jan 12 07:13:50 2015 UTC,Wish they would have used a better video than Laser Beam. It is a bit nonsensical compared to the others. Neat though.

Perfume,2s56qd,therationalpi,2,Mon Jan 12 18:07:52 2015 UTC,Yeah that's exactly what I thought. If they had used something like Glitter or Kasuka na Kaori the reactions would have been way different.
Perfume,2s56qd,gingangguli,3,Mon Jan 12 16:01:17 2015 UTC,Glitter might have bored them. Fushizen na girl would have been a good choice. Also i noticed that the link to the music video in the descripion will direct you to the incomplete video in the perfume channel. Makes you wonder if they actually have the copy of the pv or used a different link when they showed it to them

I can't think of anything that might be going on between Universal and Astralwerks, but all things are possible.  Or, maybe someone screwed up at Apple.  I think I get why Game isn't fully available; Tokuma and Disney probably made some kind of deal when Polyrhythm appeared in Cars 2.  Edit: a word."

Dunno why the albums don't appear anymore.  I do know Polyrhythm has only been available on the Cars 2 soundtrack for quite some time.  You can create an iTunes Japan account to buy the albums, but the songs are more expensive, especially since you have to purchase an iTunes Japan gift card from a third party."

Perfume,2mebth,canadianEJ,1 point,Wed Nov 26 02:20:32 2014 UTC,"did anyone take a video of the special encore of everyone singing, Dream Land? i wonder if the audio is going to be included at the end credits of the BD/DVD just like WT2nd"
Perfume,2mebth,canadianEJ,1 point,Sun Nov 16 18:26:56 2014 UTC,Honestly it was not... Impressive. There were maybe 15 very hoarse fans who got out the first verse and chorus and some of us (self included) didn't know the verse well. I would not call it a special encore.
Perfume,2m9qgk,EvaUnitO2,3,Fri Nov 14 08:59:18 2014 UTC,"From doors til finish, about 3 hours. From the opening to the end of the show about 2 hours from what I remember. Started at 8pm and finished around 10 or a bit past it."
Perfume,2m9qgk,polyrhythm7,2,Fri Nov 14 09:25:53 2014 UTC,"8 to 10:30, according to the Hammerstein ballroom website (don't have the link atm)  EDIT: Technically this is how long the NYC show is, I assume that's why you asked."
Perfume,2m9qgk,darkshaddow42,2,Fri Nov 14 12:18:22 2014 UTC,Official show started around 8:30 and ended at 10:30
Perfume,2m9qgk,rrrr224,2,Fri Nov 14 15:07:31 2014 UTC,And the double line around the block took about an hour and a half :)

Perfume,2m9qit,donshorty95,2,Fri Nov 14 10:25:30 2014 UTC,love when this happens
Perfume,2m4if9,tombsg75,5,Wed Nov 12 23:31:59 2014 UTC,Nocchi looked amazing all night. Best show ever!!!
Perfume,2m4if9,qop666,3,Thu Nov 13 02:28:09 2014 UTC,Looks like I was about level with you but on the other side of the room (row P) so I had a perfect view of Kashiyuka who was closest a lot of the time. This was perfect as I am very much enamoured by her. I loved the show and it was great to see them all so close unlike in the larger venues. I got so excited I cried when they came on stage and have been super happy since seeing them. Definitely going to see them again if I get the chance (had to travel from another country so maybe not so easy).
Perfume,2m4if9,actuallyanorange,6,Thu Nov 13 21:56:13 2014 UTC,"Yep, I never thought I'd see them and I saw them twice in three months. Once in Japan and one here in LA. They are great entertainers with so much energy and a show full of fun."
Perfume,2lzf2w,DapperDandy,3,Tue Nov 11 17:36:28 2014 UTC,Yes http://www.asmart.jp/Form/Product/ProductList.aspx?shop=0&cat=100106 you can order from anywhere with the tenso feature (look at the left sidebar) Enjoy! <3

Perfume,2lzf2w,MischievousCommando,1 point,Tue Nov 11 21:14:28 2014 UTC,Does anyone who did make it through the line know if these prices are roughly equivalent to concert store prices? Shirts on the site are $30 + $15 shipping... it would be worth it to me signed but that's about it...
Perfume,2lzf2w,darkshaddow42,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:57:58 2014 UTC,"Prices are the same. T-shirts were $30, tax inclusive. Towels were $16, tax inclusive."
Perfume,2lzf2w,DamnRandall,1 point,Thu Nov 13 08:16:07 2014 UTC,"Was there a seperate lined for signed goods or was it just one long line? Going to the NYC show in a few days, not sure if I should buy something ahead of time to get it signed."
Perfume,2lzf2w,darkshaddow42,1 point,Wed Nov 12 18:38:00 2014 UTC,It was bassicaly one big line
Perfume,2lyp4d,chocokeroppi,2,Tue Nov 11 13:29:11 2014 UTC,SOLD!!
Perfume,2lyp4d,iminanothercastle,1 point,Sat Nov 15 11:58:55 2014 UTC,How much??
Perfume,2lyp4d,iminanothercastle,1 point,Tue Nov 11 13:31:41 2014 UTC,90 + paypal fee. Or I can sell through ticketmaster but they have their own fees. let me know as most GA tix start at 150
Perfume,2lyp4d,iminanothercastle,1 point,Tue Nov 11 13:35:42 2014 UTC,"I'm in MD. I can transfer the ticket through ticketmaster. As far as I know it's free of charge. And this is my ticket, couldn't get off work so why not give another fan a chance. My friend is still going though."
Perfume,2lyp4d,iminanothercastle,1 point,Tue Nov 11 13:37:05 2014 UTC,"Ah, well my issue is not having someone to go with. I would buy it, but to go from GA to NY alone is a bit much for me. Good luck in finding a buyer!"
Perfume,2lyp4d,jihyo_running,1 point,Tue Nov 11 13:41:31 2014 UTC,Yeah I know wat you mean. I really want to go but can't leave my job for it. Though it is a one time thing. Hope they come back again like KPP did D:
Perfume,2lvr12,ubersuperduper,1 point,Mon Nov 10 18:33:32 2014 UTC,"This is the rough order of what songs I remember them playing, stuff is more than likely out of order. Some songs are definitely missing, as I've got huge gaps in my memory too.  That being said, I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM LIVE. Good god, not over how awesome it was. A tad bittersweet, however...who knows when they'll be back? Or if they'll even be back at all. But I feel like we made a good impression, they got the message that they DO have passionate fans in the US/North America.  (TO THE MODS: if you feel like this should be removed/deleted, feel free to do so. I know Perfume and their staff request that some info not be shared...)  1) Enter the Sphere 2) Spring of Life 3) Cling Cling —Introduction/Greeting the audience— 4) Ijiwaru na Hello ???) Spending All My Time (Some remix, don't remember if it's the Dimitri Vegas one) ???) One Room Disco ???) Game ???) Chocolate Disco —PTA Corner— ???) Party Maker ???) Polyrhythm ENCORE) Fake It ENCORE) My Color"
Perfume,2lvr12,MischievousCommando,6,Mon Nov 10 19:17:42 2014 UTC,Found on setlist.fm:    1) Enter the Sphere 2) Spring Of Life 3) Cling Cling 4) One Room Disco 5) Ijiwaru na Hello 6) SEVENTH HEAVEN 7) Hold Your Hand 8) Spending All My Time 9) GAME 10) Dream Fighter 11) Party Maker 12) GLITTER 13) Chocolate Disco 14) Polyrhythm Encore: A) Fake It B) MY COLOR
Perfume,2lvr12,DamnRandall,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:50:02 2014 UTC,There we go! Totally forgot about the middle it looks like. Hahahah
Perfume,2lvr12,MischievousCommando,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:50:04 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to add that the MC segment was after One Room Disco and PTA Corner was after Dream Fighter.  I was in the balcony (writing an article about the show) and the crowd was hyped for the older stuff, especially the GAME, Dream Fighter, Party Maker section, as well as Chocolate Disco, Polyrhythm, Fake It.  On the other side of the spectrum, Cling Cling by far was one that the crowd was not into as much."
Perfume,2lvr12,dramamineboy,2,Tue Nov 11 15:22:49 2014 UTC,"Cling Cling does seem like a very ""forced"" single by the label. They decided early on that they wanted to promote it so it now has to be popular.  It didn't seem to excite in the 5th tour show I attended, either.  I like the song but only after a lot of plays. And it doesn't seem to be composed for a concert setting. It doesn't make you want to dance.  At the very least, newer songs seem to be too new to have synchronized movements yet, so the older ones are more fun. But I noticed some synchronized waving during Ijiwaru Na Hello, which IMO is better than the other tracks on the single.  This is my vague correlation to undoubtedly prove that Cling Cling isn't a hit and that I like Ijiwaru Na Hello better.  But I'm glad that I'll likely see Polyrhythm, Dream Fighter, and One Room Disco at NYC, all favorites of mine absent from the 5th tour."
Perfume,2lvr12,commentsomehow,3,Thu Nov 13 12:44:45 2014 UTC,I'm there with you about it being bittersweet. Life seems far less exciting now. I couldn't believe the turn out. I brought a friend and made a convert out of him. Also by far the loudest concert I've been too. I wish the show never ended ahah.
Perfume,2lvr12,MischievousCommando,2,Mon Nov 10 19:42:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the more I think about it, the more sad I get. Never woulda thought a girl group singing in a language I don't speak would have such an emotional impact on me, much less an emotional impact at all. And you're right, the turn out was amazing. ""Unbelievable!"" as they'd put it, hahaha"
Perfume,2lvr12,polyrhythm7,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:58:50 2014 UTC,"I also took a friend and she's from Japan and didn't know much about them or what to expect but she thought it was a fun concert! Party Maker brought the house down. Actually every song did, so awesome :)"

Perfume,2ltm0q,AlisaLolita,2,Mon Nov 10 03:03:57 2014 UTC,"THIS LINE IS HUGE!!!!!  I heard that people started lining up at 4am this morning.  The line started moving a half hour ago, and we're still not in!"

Perfume,2ltm0q,DamnRandall,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:23:45 2014 UTC,crazy awesome...how big is the venue/how many people will be attending? What venue is it?
Perfume,2ltm0q,secretkashi,2,Mon Nov 10 03:38:37 2014 UTC,"The historic Palladium in Hollywood. Capacity is around 4,000."

I couldn't get there super early because I had stuff to do before the show, but I got there around 1730, and the line had wrapped all the way around the block, and at the time, the end of the line was at Argyle and Selma."
Perfume,2ltm0q,DamnRandall,1 point,Mon Nov 10 09:16:43 2014 UTC,Insanity. How did people have energy to dance?
Perfume,2ltm0q,MischievousCommando,3,Mon Nov 10 15:43:08 2014 UTC,Its perfume   How could you not
Perfume,2ltm0q,erly,0,Mon Nov 10 16:19:03 2014 UTC,The concert was awesome. The people who were recording with their phones the whole time instead of enjoying the show... not so awesome.
Perfume,2ltm0q,DamnRandall,1 point,Mon Nov 10 20:48:42 2014 UTC,"From what I saw, it wasn't that bad. I only saw a couple of people recording the show, and none of them blocked my view.    Now when Babymetal played here, THAT was bad. Pretty much everyone had their phones up the entire time, and I ended up watching the show through their screens since I couldn't see anything. I'm not even short!"
Perfume,2ltm0q,dyableg,2,Mon Nov 10 20:51:18 2014 UTC,"I agree. Seems like a lot of people took the pre-show request/instructions to heart and didn't record. Those that did, did so modestly and weren't up for much longer than a song.   On a related note, lots of people seem to be complaining about the pushing/crowding. I can only guess that those people haven't been to many shows, or to venues of that size. I can only speak for my experience, but the pushing was at an absolute minimum considering the number attending. Lots of people were pretty courteous, if you ask me."
Perfume,2ltm0q,DamnRandall,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:29:02 2014 UTC,"I have been to plenty of shows, and totally expected that. Which is why I stood behind the popcorn machine on a raised part of the floor towards the back. Personal space, no tall people in front of me, other people nearby dancing and being polite. I could see the whole stage, and I got to dance in place and sing along with all the songs. I think it was a good choice for me."
Perfume,2lkl04,donshorty95,2,Fri Nov 7 11:37:33 2014 UTC,"Instantly, I simply chose the print-it-yourself option."

Perfume,2lkl04,shb117,2,Sat Nov 8 10:53:09 2014 UTC,I used the Eventim website to buy my ticket and they emailed it straight away.
Perfume,2lkl04,Headpuncher,2,Sat Nov 8 09:10:32 2014 UTC,I got mine in the live nation pre-sale so I had to use ticketmaster.
Perfume,2lkl04,soupman2001,1 point,Sat Nov 8 12:04:34 2014 UTC,Key difference I think is Eventum versus Tucketmaster. My autocorrect seems to like Us more than Is.
Perfume,2lkl04,californiapearls,1 point,Sat Nov 8 10:55:01 2014 UTC,I contacted them a couple weeks ago because I don't live in the UK and wanted to make sure I get them on time. They arrived 3 days after I sent the e-mail.
Perfume,2lkl04,Onyx218,1 point,Fri Nov 7 12:56:46 2014 UTC,"I had issues too, actually. I bought my tickets back in August and Eventim charged me for them immediately, but never gave me the option of printing them out online. They should have sent them to me by mail, but I never heard a single thing from them and for some reason despite multiple tries couldn't log into my online account, so had to contact customer service. They also couldn't help me with the account and said it's too late for them to mail out at this point, so now I have to pick them up from the box office as well. Annoying."
