puns,3e3hlr,bibbleskit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:05 2015 UTC,I vote yes.
puns,3e3hlr,JRSof,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, a pun is ""the humorous use of a word or phrase so as to emphasize or suggest its different meanings or applications"" and you imply two meanings to the phrase."

puns,3e1bii,jayDon123,52,Tue Jul 21 04:59:27 2015 UTC,oh boo :(  As a math teacher I'm offended.  A circle is actually defined as an infinite amount of points equidistant from a center.
puns,3e1bii,Snaaaaaaaaaake,15,Tue Jul 21 07:04:43 2015 UTC,"It also has no points because there should be no straight line along it's side.  The world changed when I learned to divide by ""might as well be zero but isn't""."
puns,3e1bii,Everspace,24,Tue Jul 21 07:11:22 2015 UTC,OH now you're just going off on a Tangent.

puns,3e1bii,ArcticSoul,3,Tue Jul 21 14:00:27 2015 UTC,Confined to a plane. Otherwise that'd be a sphere (in 3D space anyway).
puns,3e1bii,pcj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who does not embrace math, why would it be infinite? A circle is finite after all."

puns,3e1bii,NWmba,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:23 2015 UTC,That's a better answer than mine.  Isoceles  (I so silly). Also there weren't enough letters to make mine.
puns,3e1bii,whynotboidzerg,7,Tue Jul 21 07:25:00 2015 UTC,Also a circle can't be isosceles
