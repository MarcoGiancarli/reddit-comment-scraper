CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,wardrich,-9,Thu Jul 9 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Correct.  It's all about context.  If your game was designed for kids and you asked them what a nigglet was, they would associate it with the game.  It doesn't become bad until somebody points it out and then you wind up with another generation stuck in the past."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,Cormophyte,4,Fri Jul 10 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd like to point out that Nigantor is a pal that can be interacted with by members of the family, both big and small. Please, don't pigeon hole your new friend."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,Cormophyte,13,Thu Jul 9 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need anyone to point out that ""darkie"" is a questionable word to use. Its not exactly an obscure insult."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,Not_The_Least_Wrong,6,Thu Jul 9 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"People are irresponsible, let alone kids. You think kids learning an incredible derogatory word is okay because ultimately other people would be at fault for tainting it? For starters, kids aren't known for their maturity, nor demonstrating good social skills. Why in the world would you leave kids such an enormous task of combating racism like that?   Your view lack realistic context. Furthermore, nigglet was created to offend black people, it was born bad. It wasn't tainted by anyone, that shit already sucked."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,wardrich,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:15:35 2015 UTC,It's not letting them combat it as much as it is just forgetting about the negative connotation and turning it into something positive...  It's even happening today... profanity in general is much less frowned upon than it once was.  I just don't see anything wrong with a word being used in another way that could catch on and be used for the greater good... that's all.
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,Not_The_Least_Wrong,8,Fri Jul 10 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Well, ""how fast"" should people be moving on from racism? Furthermore, you're ascribing way too ambitious a result from racial slurs. I can't even describe how it would feel, nor what it would take to simply ""get over"" being called a nigger.  I get it, yeah--move on, you ascribe more power to words when you react to them. Which is idealistic, but I also understand why it still gets reactions. The issue is far far more complex than simply ""moving on"".  Furthermore, have you ever been a victim of racism? Are you white? I'm sure you think that it's racist to assume you can't experience racism if you're white, you can. But it's nothing compared to minority racism. And that's a fact. I'm suggesting you grasp a better handle at this racism stuff before going off the cuff."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,VonSandwich,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the best outcome. Now, let's think of what the worst outcome would be..."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,thebiggestandniggest,-6,Fri Jul 10 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"No, the best way to forget it is to not use it."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,goddamngrapefruit,22,Fri Jul 10 04:41:23 2015 UTC,...but then it will always be offensive. 'Darkies' is only offensive here because you've taken it out of context as opposed to reading the meaning that they intended. Better to take the word back and change it's meaning then spending your life constantly walking on eggshells.
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,thebiggestandniggest,9,Thu Jul 9 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm not offended by what Dark Souls said because I knew what they meant, I disagree with the idea that calling people darkies often would make it okay."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,goddamngrapefruit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine, they're not referring to any particular race or skin colour, they literally just mean 'fans of Dark Souls'. It's inclusive. My issue is that if you start making rules about what words can and cannot be used you give it power to incite these issues in even innocuous situations like this. When people jump to race every time these words are used, then we are still thinking in terms of race, which is the source of the issue. Giving 'darkies' a non-racial meaning alleviates this issue. That's how I see it anyway."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,Not_The_Least_Wrong,5,Thu Jul 9 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"That's just silly. You're making it seem as if ""Darkies"" was remotely an innocuous term to begin with. Like the PC police are out of control.   This isn't someone freaking out about fans of a game called Black And White being called ""Blacksters"", Darkies is in fact a racial slur. And in some cases, it's literally a step below nigger.   This whole talk of ""taking the word"" back just reeks of people who probably have never experienced racism. Furthermore, no, if the stoppage of words meant anything to racism, than you'd think ""niggas"" and ""niggers"" would be a different issue, but it's not. It's complex."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,___WE-ARE-GROOT___,4,Fri Jul 10 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"When you're a corporation/company, you have to walk on eggshells because your shareholders rely on you to not ruffle feathers and offend people. You can make all the ""stands"" you like in real life, but not when you're representing your company."
CorporateFacepalm,3cobt8,goddamngrapefruit,-4,Fri Jul 10 04:21:38 2015 UTC,Of course. The whole business of corporate PR and promotion has always been hypersensitive - just because they have to appeal to and not alienate as many people as possible. Though not realistic it works as a fairly good measure as to what people think might cause offense/controversy.

Fanbases have been called much much worse by a group than part of the name. Slipknot dubs their fans Maggots. Let's go ahead and use your style of thinking to that. Slipknot has a mostly white following. And calls their fans maggots. So they are labeling white people as maggots. They must be racist! Or they could just be calling their audience a term that they deem fit. Kind of like Dark Souls dubbing their fans as ""Darkies"". They aren't being racist.

CorporateFacepalm,3cbq4w,Novapophis,2,Wed Jul 8 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"I do not disagree with what you have said, nor am I trying to perpetuate an anti religious circlejerk. I remember the awesome people that were a part of my clergy growing up. I just think it's worth discussing why an entire entity of businesses get to do business tax free. I would say the same of any business whether I liked it or not. Why should a church be exempt from tax?"
CorporateFacepalm,3cbq4w,Novapophis,4,Wed Jul 8 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"Because it's purpose isn't to make money. It's not a business.   Same goes for aid organizations. A soup kitchen for example is there for those in need. It has costs to cover and therefore it can accept donations to cover those costs. With this example you can see that it's adding a competent and efficient ""middle man"" to the tax free situation of giving $10 to a homeless man on the street for his dinner. That's not always a wise thing to do, but you can give it to a soup kitchen and they'll use it to feed more than just one homeless. You'll also be sure it isn't going to be used foolishly. So the government provided a tax exemption for certain types of organizations because it already provided a tax-free situation for direct giving, so it can now provide a tax free situation for more effective, slightly indirect giving.   A church falls into this category because it provides help for spiritual and physical needs. It also helps the whole ""separation of church and state"" deal.  When churches and other non-profits engage in for-profit activity, we must pay for-profit taxes just like anyone else. My church for example is downtown. It has a car park. When big events happen we charge people to park there like every other building with a lot in the city does. We must pay tax on this and we do. On top of that, churches who do this kind of thing are almost always squeaky clean within the rules because our tax returns are accessible by anyone in the populace. It's a requirement. So, people who are anti, people kinda like you, will check up on us. They'll make an estimate as to how much we're making from our for profit ventures and ensure we're reporting on them each year. We've even had a few people email us and admit to this and thank us for conducting ourselves in a manner that is above and beyond what is expected tax wise.   Lastly, Just in case you weren't aware, us church employees still pay tax on our salaries just like anyone else."
CorporateFacepalm,3cbq4w,WaterPokemon,2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"http://churchesandtaxes.procon.org Does a pretty good job of illustrating your stance and an opposing one. I am merely saying that a cultural discussion should be had on this topic. Do we want the government to support religious institutions by giving them a free pass? By offering a financial benefit to religious organizations, doesn't that mean religion is being supported by the government? Why should a nonreligious person want this?  What's keeping fraudulent religions from reaping this? Who gets to be unbiased and dictate what religions are real and which arent? It seems very sticky to me.  I find it somewhat obnoxious that you yourself are taxed and not the organization itself.  I also find it unfair to compare soup kitchen donations whuch come from a sense of generosity, and religious tithing which is provoked by threat of eternal damnation, in many places.  A fortune teller isn't allowed to tell his client that they must pay him money or they'll have bad luck. I agree with that line of thinking and just think it's important we give every other part of life that same application of logic and discussion on it is vital in my opinion."

CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,Carcharodon_literati,135,Fri Jul 3 14:08:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't understand the depth of the frustration.   (sigh)  Yes you do, Alexis.  There's nothing honest in that statement.  If you guys spent half as much time preventing fires as putting them out, you'd run out of fires.  Your moderators deal with an unnaturally evil cesspool of humanity behind the scenes, in PMs.  I said, ""To hell with this,"" the first time psychos decided to test me, and never modded again.  Do you know what kind of abuse they take to make this site happen?    You do.  We know you do.   What about your users?  Vote stalking... is still a thing.  Vote gaming... is still a thing.  Content rank manipulation... is still a thing.    So, there we have the four biggest issues that Reddit faces.  They're the same four issues that admins have denied all along.  The exact same four that admins have been warned can destroy this site.  Maybe... just an idea... maybe if the admins at Reddit spend more time improving Reddit and less time trying to invent gimmicks for gold, then it would make a difference.  I know, that sounds like work.  Doesn't it?"

CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,Saykazay,8,Fri Jul 3 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"I think I did read that and then quote it rather than ctrl+c, ctrl+v, so good catch!  It does make a big difference.  At the same time though, I wouldn't call it a conspiracy for a business to try and make money.  People are afraid of the things that can go wrong due to monetization strategies for good reason, and Reddit makes enough money to run as it is.  But if the business were not trying to find ways to grow, then they'd be on a treadmill.  Grinding sucks, but achievement and progress are fun; people will choose the fun option every time.  I say, since it's the understandable choice, encourage them.  It's much more likely they'll achieve things the community appreciates that way than solely by an adversarial approach."

CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,I_WUV_MUSIC,2,Wed Jul 8 05:03:24 2015 UTC,"(sigh) Yes you do, Alexis.    It's possible that he's a grown up with a shred of perspective about life, and so the ups and downs of moderating an online forum, or VOTE STALKING don't really seem like a big deal.  Nobody makes anyone sign up to reddit, or moderate a subreddit. If it's so horrible, go do something else and let someone else take your place. There are literally hundreds of thousands of better things to do with your one and only life.  Honestly, it's a bit like birdwatchers threatening to kill species of birds, because birdwatching is such fucking hard work, and the managers of your local park wont listen to birdwatchers, and provide you with birdwatching binoculars. DON'T YOU KNOW THE BIRDWATCHERS MADE THIS PARK WHAT IT IS!!  Sure maybe, but who gives a fuck. The park is the park. It isn't the property of its most obnoxiously obsessed users.   And just because you doing your hobby is incredibly important to you, that doesn't mean it's actually important - when mods burn out they should just tip their fedora and move on.   The quality of certain subreddits would probably be patchier. But at least they wouldn't be the centre of endless self aggrandizing drama."
CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,spidermonk,4,Thu Jul 9 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"Your comment surprised me, so I had to think over how to respond.  I can see where you're coming from, but I think that you underestimate the diversity of content and general traffic to this site.  In an ideal world, moderators would be paid employees, but Reddit has thrived without that expense.  Can you imagine the cost of paying moderators for so many communities?  Without moderators, or with moderators who change too frequently, worse would happen than the world getting fewer dank neckbeard memes.    NSFW subreddits would carry a risk of life-destroying content depicting destroyed lives.  Communities representing some radical worldviews would become more extreme.  Doxxing would be difficult to combat and sometimes, impossible to eliminate.  Criminals and extremist group would use the site to organize, in the worst case scenarios.  Moderating isn't only playing referee to arguments.    What we gain by having moderators who value their role is surprising at times.  An incumbent United States President isn't going to answer questions from a community that is moderated by somebody who considers it a coffee break hobby.  We couldn't as readily have communities devoted to topics in hard science that include discussion, Q&A, and debate involving active experts and researchers.  The site wouldn't be attractive to big businesses, as a platform paired with a community, so there would not be articles about the community by the likes of Forbes and Bloomberg.  There's plenty to do in life, sure.  But it's up to each person to evaluate the value of their goals.  You may not consider it worthwhile to devote time to moderating, but some people actually feel fulfilled by providing a valued service to a community.  Whether they personally are able or willing to devote the same time to other pursuits is solely their decision or circumstance.  So long as you are unaware of harm a specific person has caused, your general attitude of marginalization seems to originate from the confines of a worldview with blinders.  I intend no insult by saying that.  Just look at it from more than one perspective.    And if you can't do that, cool.  But you can't deny that the real world business behind this site benefits from devoted volunteer moderators to a noteworthy extent.  Why mess up a good thing?  edit: And one more thing.  If you think moderators are wasting their lives, then consider the networking they accomplish pursuant to their interests, or the fact that they tend to gradually augment and ease their duties by using robots.  Do you really think they're not accomplishing anything that will grow in value?"

CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,WestonP,44,Fri Jul 3 15:55:53 2015 UTC,"At this point there are a number of reasons reddit hasn't fallen.   Lack of consitant alternative. I started using voat, but until they get the servers handled it's reddit. The sheer size of reddit now compared to digg back then. Orders of magnitude.  Reddit learned alot from the digg collapse, by learn i mean damage control with auto deletion, shadow banning, auto shadow banning, karma creation, upvote creation etc Highly dedicated users/communities of subreddits. Fairly insulated with few alternative places to discuss the subs particular interests ex. /r/halo /r/fringe /r/scifi /r/gameofthrones. Back when digg fell almost everyone was using the front page, hell I don't even remember what digg called their subs.....or if they even had a name.   Some will argue we should try fixing what we got. Others believe there comes a time when you toss the broken pos and start from scratch. I already said I'm migrating to voat, a slow migration though."

I noticed the recent announcement from Pao immediately had thousands of upvotes, but has steadily gone down from there. Compare that to the previous post when the censorship happened that was stuck at a very solid 0.

CorporateFacepalm,3bzt78,rreighe2,2,Fri Jul 3 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"If you want some good sites to check out, here are the ones I'm currently using and planning on replacing reddit with once more people move over.  1). Snapzu: Currently it is invite only (I have three codes I can give out if anyone wants them.) It's an interesting site that has a sort of blog feel to it. You make a post to your own page, but get to add ""tribes"" (subs) to send the post to.   [Snapzu Link](www.snapzu.com).  2) Empeopled: Empeopled appears to be another site that a lot of redditors are moving to. Interestingly enough it is a very democratic website. You can go to the govern page and vote on topics to be created, vote on changes to the website (currently the choices are either being able to vote for your moderators and being able to click a link from the site and be taken directly to the link instead of to the comments page), and vote on how the treasury is used. That's right, a treasury. Every upvote you get gives you a very very very small amount of bitcoin. Apparently you can vote for who gets to invest the money that has been put into the site. They say that the more people who join, the bigger the treasury gets, not too sure how that works though.  Disclosure: This link will tell the site who I invited, as you can see from the url.   This link is just the normal link to the site if you do not wish to be linked through me.  3) Hubski is another site that is kinda similar to reddit. Unfortunately I haven't really checked this site out as the others looked better, but maybe you'll like it. It does seem to use tags for posts instead of communities.   Hubski  4) The last site I found is called Frizbee. Apparently they do not track anyone and they are the only decentralized content aggregator on the internet, at least that's what their front page says. I would like to use this site more but unfortunately the front page was a bit overwhelming. I believe they also use tags instead of communities. Because of what all is happening on reddit, they mentioned that they don't track or censor you, so that's cool.   Frizbee"

Meaning, is it just ""humanoid face + average color"", or is it more refined, taking in to account subtle differences in facial structure?  Different races certainly have different average facial structure, with some races, particularly those of African and southwest Asian origin tending to have somewhat broader faces, broader noses, and a more prominent suborbital ridge (the bone the eye brows rest on) and cheek bones than Caucasian or east Asian. Other than skin color, that's sort of what defines a 'race', and it's the reason that anthropologists can often identify the race of a skeleton with fair accuracy just from the structure of the skull.  It would be an interesting experiment to remove color from the equation entirely and see if the computer made the same equation between the same person and a gorilla because of a few subtle similarities in facial structure, or if it would then just see ""humanoid face"" and lump all races, and the most human-like apes, together. You could even take it further, and change the facial expression of the woman in OP's image (just because she's in the foreground and probably the most prominent component in the identification), and see if it still drew the same conclusion, or if the pursed lips contributed to it."

CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,barechips,-17,Fri Jun 12 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"Actions like that just make me hate fat people any more lol. Not because they're fat, but most feel entitled for being fat. Entitled to be insult free, electric wheelchair, handicap sticker leaches of society OK with being fat because they don't want to change it. I know I'm going on a rant but morbidly obese disgusts me. Chubby is fine, thick is fine, but when your very health is in danger because you don't want to fix it, then I have nobody else to blame but the fat people themselves."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,barechips,2,Sat Jun 13 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with this a lot. From the sound of it, the sub reddit was getting out if hand (I wouldn't know personally though), but the term 'fat shaming' pisses me off. First off all, you should be ashamed to be so fat that people gawk at you as you walk by. Second of all, fat shaming having a negative tone behind it makes it hard to be blunt and realistic with people. Like ""look, if you gain any more body fat, you're health is at serious risk"" is now considered rude and heartless? It's blunt and realistic. If there's something you CAN do about it, but won't, well then who's fault is it?"
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,Lovelynuts,4,Thu Jun 11 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"The difference is that smoking affects the people around you as well.  I'm a smoker,  but I don't smoke around non smokers.  Even as a smoker I would welcome a complete ban of tobacco products.  It's an addiction I struggle with and would love to overcome.  There was talk in our state (in Australia) recently of banning smoking for those born after 2000.  I think it's a brilliant idea.   Unhealthy foods on the other hand only affect the individual that chooses to eat them. If someone wants to shove 32 hamburgers down their throat a day,  that's up to them and nobody else's business.  The self entitlement is an issue,  but bringing overweight people down because of their size and opinions is not the solution."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,fidelitypdx,2,Thu Jun 11 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"The difference is that smoking affects the people around you as well.   Sure, it's not an apples to apples - but let's be honest: overweight people affect other people around them: sit next to a fat person on the bus or airplane, or have to stand because they take up too much of the seat. Fat people pass their lifestyle diseases on to their children. Fat people can hold up large movements of people and lines. We could go on and on about how unhealthy lifestyles, especially obesity, actually impact people.  But yeah, second hand smoke does legitimately impact society in larger ways, but it's not as if obesity only impacts the individual.   Following this logic, if smokers decide to smoke at home, or in established places, society shouldn't have a problem with them either. That's usually not the goal though, it's a complete prohibition and condemnation of tobacco users, no matter public or private. Parallel discrepancies in our society include alcoholism and gambling. Gambling is tolerated even though it destroys lives. Alcoholism is massive public safety concern and drunken stupidity definitely impacts all of society way more than tobacco."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,Lovelynuts,3,Thu Jun 11 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"What you describe is an inconvenience,  not adverse health effects.  Sure some overweight people have terrible body odour,  but inhaling it will induce vomiting at most.  Yes,  they pass health issues on to their children,  but so do many other people who probably shouldn't have children. Education is the solution,  not shaming.  It won't reach those who are too far gone with their own views,  but it can and will curb the trend in future generations"
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,fidelitypdx,6,Fri Jun 12 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"Education is the solution, not shaming.   I agree, but isn't the same true with Tobacco?   I think it's interesting that we've conducted public health campaigns against obesity and tobacco and other taboos for a long while - we've just naturally progressed to shaming with Tobacco, and now (at least on reddit), we've progressed to shaming fat people too.    What you describe is an inconvenience, not adverse health effects.   That's true, but what I'm talking about here is public health epidemics. Undeniably obesity is an epidemic. People are trying to solve tobacco and drugs through public policies, but we barely touch obesity when it's just as much of a problem.  Go back and substitute tobacco with powder cocaine - cocaine only impacts the individual, in fact it only impacts the individual for a relatively small bit of time and isn't at all an epidemic, but society is perfectly fine directing lots of resources to particular drugs, but not obesity. If a mom is giving their kids McDonalds she's just as threatening to that kids long-term health as smoking tobacco, in my opinion."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,Lovelynuts,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think in essence, we share the same views.  I know that the obesity epidemic is much worse in the US than it is here in Australia, but unfortunately, we're catching up.  In response to the epidemic, our government has launched quite a few initiatives, such as ""Find 30"" (30 minutes of activity a day). They don't target consumption, they encourage living a healthy lifestyle and staying active.  I feel this is the best they can do, because really, if you were to ban unhealthy foods, where do you draw the line?  A cheeseburger from McDonalds has a bun, onion, ketchup, mustard, pickle cheese and beef.  Do you ban the whole thing, or just particular components of the burger? Or McDonalds all together?  and then, if you ban McDonalds, do we then pull all of the unhealthy, processed food off the shelves in supermarkets too? Which ones? As nice as it would be to eliminate fast food and therefore force healthy eating (not healthy eating habits, people would still find a way to binge, just as people will still find a way to consume tobacco if it's banned), logistically, I don't think it's possible."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,Kurcide,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:00:51 2015 UTC,I wish there was a dedicated place people could go and discuss topics such as this. Maybe somewhere that allows for any specific topic and category to be made by groups of like minded (or not) individuals where they can communicate freely without being censored or judged for their honest opinions and feelings.  To bad that doesn't exist
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,CaptConstantine,-7,Thu Jun 11 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And I really don't think most people hate chubby people, or even fat people. I think most people hate the attitude of entitlement, that being fat should exempt you from any type of insult. I get made fun of for things I CAN'T change about my appearance. You learn to deal, for fuck's sake. If the fat jokes hurt so much, maybe lose some weight and take responsibility for your life."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,idontgetbacon,12,Thu Jun 11 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"The underlying issue isn't the liking or not liking of a group of people. They were intentionally trolling other subs, picking out people, and harassing them. It's not someone just yelling on the street, it is someone yelling on the street, then getting a group of people and following them around everywhere, yelling the same thing. It will eventually get to a person.   I hate to say it, but I could NOT care less. I'm not on any of those subs, and I have not been affected by them. I'll be happy when this blows over."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,CaptConstantine,7,Thu Jun 11 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't know r/fatpeoplehate existed until this whole thing blew up, so I'm not terribly invested either. And I agree, following people around the internet and bullying them is a horrible thing to do and should not happen to anyone for any reason.  I guess I was armchair philosophizing a bit. I was just making the point that when people feel hurt over things that are within their control to change, then they should try to change and better themselves. That could be fitness, or education, or even a haircut or a change of shoes. If it bothers someone so much to hear those comments, they probably agree with them on some level."
CorporateFacepalm,39gtal,barechips,3,Thu Jun 11 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"Well I will say this, I wasn't aware people were getting followed and bullied and harassed, I thought it was just like /r/WTF where you post a pic and everyone laughs. Still, there's some bad subreddits out there that probably do deserve to be taken down, but I'm an advocate of no censorship. I do stand by my earlier post though, if you're fat and ashamed, do something about it. /r/fitness has a huge supportive community that encourages anyone from the morbidly obese to 16% body fat people on how to get in great shape. Why? Because they're willing to try, and truthfully that's all that matters."

This is due to flag emoticons actually being 2 chars in UTF-8, a special char for each letter in ISO 3166-1. When the text is rendered and it sees two of these chars beside each other, it will just render it as the appropriate flag.  I found a video of it here"
CorporateFacepalm,39doi5,LukasFT,3,Wed Jul 8 12:04:10 2015 UTC,"ISO 3166-1:       ISO 3166-1 is part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. The official name of the standard is Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 1: Country codes. It defines three sets of country codes:    ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 – two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three, and used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions). ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes. ISO 3166-1 numeric – three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.   The alphabetic country codes were first included in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the numeric country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes have been published as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining codes for subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining codes for former countries.   As a widely used international standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards and used by international organizations  to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information.  However, it is not the only standard for country codes. Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1,  although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.

Even if you just read a paragraph of that tragedy you'd remember the picture next to it.   How could you not? My mind's blown. Especially since yall are on Reddit. I'd think at the very least someone on Reddit that isn't visiting for celeb nudes would know the challenger disaster   Seriously no offense but if you're American I'm shocked if the person wouldn't at least recognize it like damn. Maybe maybe if you were so young rn like 15.. Then I'd imagine it possible all they did was wiki it. But even that would have a pic as iconic as the towers falling.  Or is space that insignificant now :/
CorporateFacepalm,39dph3,BordomBeThyName,5,Fri Jul 10 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"I'm super interested in space, I just don't know the specific shape of the smoke trail from the Challenger explosion. Maybe I'm just a fucking idiot but the image itself never stuck with me. Of course I know all about the disaster itself, but comparing it to the towers falling is a bit... incorrect? In any picture of the twin towers coming down, you can see the towers. This image on the surface is just some smoke. Challenger doesn't have a huge emotional impact on me since it falls into the broad general category of ""sad things that happened before I was born"". The towers came down when I was in fifth grade and I distinctly remember the shocked reaction from my family, community, and nation. Challenger isn't a personal part of my life, it's history to me."
