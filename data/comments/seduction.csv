seduction,3e3nvc,jimbob8,4,Tue Jul 21 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with you having so many girls to date that's making you scared. The example with the model just sounds like self-sabotage to me. You've always wished you had these things in the past, but now that you have them, your previous reality is shattered. You're scared that you won't know how to act with this new ability. It's a gift. Something most men would love to have. Embrace it and stop acting as if it's a bad thing.  You should also stop looking at women as if they're hindrance. I just think you're at a place where you feel like you have power but no idea what to do with it. Just chill. Women are cool, bro. They love sex and they love attractive men like yourself. You sound like you have a lot going on, so just focus on bringing women into your world and showing them the time of their life. Have fun with them and stop taking stuff so seriously."

Hot, young, immature, mindless women won't be enough now.  You have everything to start getting involved with hot, interesting, more mature (as of mindset) women."

seduction,3e3nvc,neeners9223,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:58 2015 UTC,"This could be the fact that you've now acquired these skills from Seddit and now that you've applied them and put them to work with success its become all too normal for you. For example most men's fantasies if they get to experience them, either lose interest or the fantasy in their head was way better than what actually happened. In my opinion, youre telling yourself that you don't want to meet up with these girls or have sex with them because these opportunities didn't come up as often in the past, it's too familiar now. I agree with most of the comments here, you shouldn't stress or worry about the fact that its not as exciting to you anymore, embrace the fact that you've become good at it and move on to fixing other weaknesses about yourself."
seduction,3e3nvc,Morokweng,0,Tue Jul 21 20:04:37 2015 UTC,Is it really a lack of interest or is it a fear of success? Or are you ashamed of your sexuality or do you feel unworthy of having your needs met? Perhaps you're putting women on a pedestal and you're afraid to let them get close. Even scoring a woman as a '10/10' is a subtle way of putting her on a pedestal.  A lot of guys who turn to pickup often have a lot of unresolved issues that they've just slapped a thin veneer of game on top of.
seduction,3e3nvc,Morokweng,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"Na,  I love sex and I know I deserve it.  And I've had a good amount but it tends to be with girlfriends or people I have a good connection with.  I don't think that's the issue. The 10/10 was just for your reference and actually..  I think part of my demotivation might have been realising the 10/10 isn't a 10/10 and that they don't really exist :("
seduction,3e3nvc,Rayjaysdick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"For the 10/10 thing, I prefer 1 or 0, either I am interested or I'm not. I don't like rating women on a scale.   Na, I love sex and I know I deserve it. And I've had a good amount but it tends to be with girlfriends or people I have a good connection with.   That's perfectly okay, it's probably more healthy than being driven towards promiscuity.  You should read Models by Mark Manson, he talks a lot about moving away from standard pickup routines and about how to find girls that you can really connect with."

Do what you love/self amused :)  Treat everyone the same...(Normal)  Everyone in the world is your friend and they want the best for you  You're not above the process of going into state  State is...enjoying self, in the moment, authentic, yourself, speaking your mind, no thought of outcome, don't care how others react, fully present, assuming expecting everyone is your friend  Express yourself freely and don't care!  Why you shouldn't impress with lines or ""Oh I know this"" Because vibing comm that you don't care if she leaves, you don't need to impress, you have an abundance....The subcomm is WAY more powerful than actual words trying to impress  A way to be in the moment...tell yourself that THIS IS YOUR LAST NIGHT TO LIVE...you die tmrw..how wold you act  Tyler's Six Steps  1. Open All  2. Minimize time in between sets  3. Never judge yourself (every attempt is a 100/10!)  4. Find something funny about each attempt  5. End in a high note if out of state (early) & Burn it to the ground if in state (close)  6. Push every attempt a little further  Having fun transfers to others which is valuable=attractive  You'll be the most successful with women when you love yourself and the world without outcome..LOVING LIFE!!!

So after the club/bar....If there is a huge party (One you lie about, or hype up enough to get her to come) she will  Women are socially conditioned and subconciously to never pursue the man...So don't ever expect her to  When you stop a girl (moving target) by grabbing her, your mindset isn't hey im tryn to get you but rather, ""Hey, nows your chance What you are saying because its coming from you, pactice saying anything!  There is nothing wrong with letting a girl know you are interested in her (without saying it or supplicating yourself) It is very attractive beacuse you are acting through your own intentions and if she doesn't want it then you'll just move onto the next one  You want your faculties focused on the PRESENT MOMENT...not drawing experineces from the past, or thinking what will happen in the future...you are only thinking about the present moment  TRUST YOURSELF TO SAY AND DO THE RIGHT THING!!!

You are giving her an opp for it  See the best in yourself and others  I am entitled when I am extremely aroused around a girl I am talking to  Intent of sex wihtout outcome is grounded  Heaven on Earth can exist for you if you perceive it.. See love everywhere  Everyone is bored and in a walking daze because their ego has taken over. They are looking for material things (Money, clothes, car, etc) to make them happy and they are reaching for an outcome, when the process (life) and happiness is a default state. If you can be a grounding energy that is different, unstiffled, self amused and having fun in life with your default self esteem and no ego attached, people will fall into your reality because they want someone to let them be that way... Happy in the moment, which is a huge value giver and non needy, NEVER SEEK VALUE. Create your own value and amusement in life.  Ego is your false self that creates a false identity..It looks for outside tangible things to validate your perceived & wounded self..it can never be fully satisfied (getting more girls, Money, etc) whereas that feeling can and should be maintained all the time when YOU ARE SEEING THE BEAUTY OF LIFE LIVING IN THE NOW..It disapears when you stop comparing yourself to others"

seduction,3e1of1,Cinnamon_Boots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"I took some of the first points in this giant wall of text and tried to make them readable, elaborated on some of the points to make them easier to intellectualize what the hell is being said.  You words are impeccable, don't be stifled - be yourself in every way. Don't take anything personal, when someone is rude or dismissive it's because of their own negative, bitter worldview - why would you want someone like that in your life? Don't make assumptions or judgments of anyone - everyone's human and great because of it. Always do your best at everything because taking actions makes you happy. Don't try to logically change a girl's mind, change her mood instead. Women make decisions 99% of the time from emotions they're feeling in the moment.  Always approach from over the shoulder, not with your whole body facing towards her. You want her, but never need her. Convey dominance and escalate physically as soon as possible. Don't look for a response; be unreactive - you're a high value man with high self worth. Offer others value, you must give to get; notice that everyone has a genuine side to them, break that barrier, let her be herself around you and look for the good in people.   Draw her into your reality. Always come from abundance - not scarcity. Be self amused. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable - self improvement is consistently being outside of your comfort zone. Assume attraction with women, it gives you the benefit of coming off bolder than you would if you're looking for ""signs"" before making moves, which is sexy. Show intent at the earliest outset; e.g. direct opener, sexualize the interaction quickly.  Don't pedestalize any girl. You're the 10, hard wire her frame to believe it. Be attracted to uncertainty, become addicted to fear. Have fun no matter what. Everything you have to say is of value, you'll never run out of things to say if you believe that. Have a strong identity that isn't malleable by a girl's perception of you."

If you're double dating, then sure meet them somewhere, but being everyone's ride makes it inconvenient later when the girl wants to bugger off and you still have some third wheel to go drop off somewhere.    Or if you mean having a WINGMAN vs going SOLO.....   then my preference is still to go solo.  Simpler that way.  Again, I might meet a friend while out but we'll each travel separately.

I'd try and do the coffee thing asap just use a time constraint to keep it comfortable and try and plan something with more potential for intimacy while drinking your coffee. In my experience if you like a girl, making short term plans helps solidify their investment in you."
seduction,3dzbrd,Grokker429,6,Mon Jul 20 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain the ""making her react to you"" thing? Like what are the benefits?"
seduction,3dzbrd,Supapeach,4,Tue Jul 21 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"OP stated how he used conversational skills recently learned from here in order to keep the interaction with her active and ongoing. In this case, he used them to become more 'interesting' to her, which seem to have worked.   What are the benefits you ask? Being able to maintain an interesting conversation not only with a girl  but with anybody in general, in or outside of seduction purposes, is one of the fundamental traits that anybody that is looking to better him or herself as a person should strive to acquire. Conversation skills range from tone of voice, speed of talking, sentence structure, points of interest, eye contact, non-verbal communication, and so on...Of course, there's more than just conversation to all of this but to keep it on subject: if you tend to listen more than what you speak, the other person might see you as boring or uninteresting. On the other hand, if you talk too much, you might be seen as, well you know, like you ate a parrot for breakfast, as a result the recipient might become uninterested in the conversation as well.  The same applies for the other points I mentioned.   Once you know all this and you start practicing(by going outside and conversing with people), you will eventually(and hopefully) start seeing the benefits of having good conversation and people skills and you will start seeing people 'reacting to you'. Sorry for the long reply, I honestly tried to summarize it as much as possible and still keep it understandable and on point. Also, hope this helps.   TL;DR: OP used convo skills combined with other things to keep the girl's interest high. The benefits of this can and will work for other things other than seduction in life."

seduction,3e294o,DaygameCoach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think manipulate is correct. You are taking control of your state and doing what you want with it.

While it has some interesting ideas, tried and tested techniques would be of great value."

seduction,3e1axr,dazhealy,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"I, like you, don't enjoy the whole PUA pig mentality. I think it's misguided and eventually self defeating. It does take its roots from great, self enriching, and self improving ideas.   Check out, The way of the superior man. Definitely my favorite. Meditations, is also amazing.  Sam and Dean Winchester from supernatural were oddly good teachers    Being a man isn't about women, it's about garnering masculine life force in your own unique way and style. When you are a man, women come to you.   Remember, always leave them better than how you found them. This may mean you will have to bare some pain, but it will be an act of virtue. I recently had to end things with the girl of my dreams. We found each other when I was at my pinnacle, for that time. I taught her to love again, though in the end I truly wasn't the one for her, at the time. I reluctantly ended things because she's one of those types that will let things drag out unhappily until a much worse ending happens. We left on decent terms, though I seemed to get the lions share of the broken heart.  Did it suck? Yes.  Do I still wish I was with her? Yes.  Considering how everything was, do I regret doing what I did and how much pain I had to endure, breaking up with the woman that taught me I could love with all my heart? No.  The PUA community may seem superficial and honestly, really tacky and gimmicky. But! They set me on a the right path to find the questions I needed to ask of myself and the words to define the many situations and emotions that comes with relationships."

seduction,3e2k1p,recyclablebantha,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"the girls .....they're ugly (even though the one I would consider to be a 7-8)......that they're pretty insecure, and they probably don't have much experience with guys being 18 in high school   So.....  What's the draw here?  Insecure girls will get inside a guy's head and drag him down.  This kind of girl will make your life go downhill.  Though if you only want a one night stand, maybe you can stand this long enough to get through a night of it.  And do you realize how exhausting it is to teach a girl when she doesn't have experience?  Christ, man......  It's like trying to play a 2-player co-op video game with someone when they don't know what the hell any of the buttons do on the controller.  You have to keep putting your controller down to show them where things are..  It's an awkward mess and the girl usually gets more attached, more quickly.   I don't think even if she was into me she would've known how to give me signals,    Dude.  That's not how this works.  She would be giving signals all over the place if she was into you.  Many of them would be almost accidental on her part.  Also, most of those signals would be freaking obvious because of her lack of experience.  As girls mature, they tend to get more subtle, not more obvious.  If she was into you and you didn't know, it's because you don't know how to interpret signals or you talk yourself out of believing them when you see them.   At the beginning of the night I caught ""S"" giving me glances when I wasn't even talking to her, so I'm hoping she at least thought I was cute, but I'm worried by being boring and not escalating she got turned off.    Firstly, while she may or may not be interested in you.......  ""giving you glances"" is not some automatic sign.  People glance at each other when they hang out.  It's not what people do, but HOW, that matters.  Secondly, it's not on the guy to be ""interesting.""  It's on you to drive the conversation.  Get her talking about herself.  Thirdly, you're not on some timer to escalate, but it's better when you are comfortable being close to her.   I'm just not sure how to go about conveying sexual interest with girls like this (I want to generalize this so the information is more useful than just this one girl).   You always convey sexual interest by getting in close and escalating.  ALWAYS.  The key is paying attention to the girl's physical feedback as you get in closer and start escalating.  There's no other way to know what pace to go at."

I definitely don't want to date her since I'm going back to school and she's a little too immature for my tastes, but she is hot and a quick fling would be awesome.   I know I need to work on escalating but I really struggle with it. For example I'm sitting on the couch next to her and consider putting my hand on her leg or putting my hand out and trying to get her to hold hands, but I can't justify a reason WHY I would ever need to do this. If I did it and she just said ""what are you doing?"" I would have absolutely no way to justify my actions and I'd look like an idiot. I considered using old school pick up techniques like the Cube or palm reading to initiate more one on one focus, but I'm not good at that stuff and I'm also not really a fan of games and tricks to get girls, I'd like to aspire to be more like modern RSD guys who are just social geniuses essentially."

I remember learning in psychology however that most people don't like ideas that aren't congruent with their own beliefs about themselves, and especially insecure people who see themselves as failures block out information that suggests otherwise, like if you think you're dumb but then do well on a test, you assume the test is too easy rather than you're not actually dumb.  I was just applying that concept because I figure maybe a girl like that would take compliments as insincere because she's not used to getting them."
seduction,3e2k1p,Murfdigidy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"it would not be very helpful to start with the asumption that someone is unattractive. That alone has got to be relationship killing. Lets see ""I wont compliment this one cause she's ugly and doesnt get compliments.""   has anyone, ever, been able to pick you up when you felt down? Wouldnt that be an example of challenging a belief you had? you're taking one idea out of some book and applying it like it always going to work. Psychology is much about studying individuals and trying to figure them out with intuition and theories and such. It's not linear reasoning.   I cant believe your even pursuing this line of thinking. Have you ever seen anyone compliment another person? Maybe your mom or dad? Has anyone ever lifted you up with a compliment?"

Now that I've matured and get called attractive more regularly I've come to accept it and it's helped my self-esteem."

seduction,3e2v3d,Broodje_met_beleg,4,Tue Jul 21 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Two things:  1- what is your goal? If it's just a hookup than tread lightly. Long term risk for short term gain is not smart.  2- It's not about ""making a move,"" it's about continuous escalation and calibration.  If you go from zero to 100 then you're going to weird someone out and yeah, your friends and family are going to hear about it.  If you touch her does she pull away (think like a short touch on the shoulder)? How about eye contact while touching?  What about holding hands?  If you are getting good vibes, you can take a woman by the hands and say ""come grab (anything) from (anywhere)."" If you hug and give an extra squeeze does she squeeze back or kind of wiggle away. Do they jump at the opportunity to be alone with you?  Because these are long term family friends you will have to keep in mind they may be more comfortable with you than a friend of a friend, but you don't ever really want to ""make a move."" You want to escalate little by little, paying close attention and respecting their comfort.   In this situation, you want the kiss to be the most natural thing ever, and that starts with a lot of little things. Eventually it should be very unambiguous that you are about to kiss, and that she is up for it."
seduction,3e2v3d,BetterMeThanYou,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yes great advice here,  it's ALL about creating attraction, then no matter what you do it won't be awkward.    If you build attraction the girl won't think twice about the fact you're the brother of her friend,  she'll want everything to do with you.  Build attraction,  flirt,  banter with her,  give her sexy body language and eye contact which exudes confidence.  Then as the commenter said the kiss is natural cause she'll think your so sexy she can't wait for it! Use the seduction techniques you read on here,  also YouTube is a plethora of good knowledge for escalating"

But I think I'll follow your advise and progress slowly. I'm going for the long term, so a few weeks of work should be worth it."
seduction,3e2v3d,BetterMeThanYou,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Reading body language is what it is all about. I takes practice.  it doesn't have to take a few weeks, per say. You can go through all this in a couple of hours.  If you touch her shoulder, and she responds positively, you'll know its okay. If you hold her hand while you walk, squeeze her hand gently, and if she squeezes back, you'll know she is with you. If you are looking each other in the eye, focused on each other, and you brush her hair out of her face gently and she keeps eye contact you are pretty much guaranteed that you can kiss her.  Its not as much about time, as it is about comfort."

seduction,3e3nd0,aneurysm-p,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the majority of above average females (5/10+) were racking up massive numbers from the time theyre 15, yet the average female has only 4 partners? How does that work? I thought half-decent women were supposed to be constantly getting sex while the average guy is like some lonely cave dweller?   You were basing your conclusion on incorrect assumptions, as you have guessed.     You are aware that guys are always trying to get sex: We're generally in the role of Initiator.  They choose who they approach, and they generally approach quite a bit. You know that girls are usually falling into the role of Gatekeeper.  They don't usually approach or have much direct impact on who approaches them, but they choose who gets in from the pool of guys that do approach them.   This is just culture and I'm merely describing reality, not trying to make value judgements about what should be.... etc.  But knowing both of the usual roles for guys and girls, we all know that guys are generally trying to get at girls, and girls are generally deciding who gets in and who doesn't.    So what you are doing here is assuming that any girl would be having sex all the time, simply because they are the Gatekeepers.  What you aren't taking into account is the fact that the girls have a limitation too due to the different consequences that women face after sex.    Guys generally reaffirm their potency through promiscuity: they're ""studs"" if they have a lot of sex.  But girls who have a lot of sex have to deal with the negative label of ""slut.""  Girls and boys will call a girl a slut if she sleeps around.  A girl often even faces a drop in her self-esteem if she's the only one who knows about it.  So girls generally reaffirm their potency by withholding, being picky, having standards.  It's not fair..... it is what it is.  So guys and girls both have limits on their sexual activity."

seduction,3e1vxs,throwawaysedddit,5,Tue Jul 21 09:05:12 2015 UTC,how do you get a girl from a night club and into bed?   Definitely not by wearing crazy glasses or colored contacted.
seduction,3e1vxs,Mrbumby,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:28 2015 UTC,"clubs are my hunting grounds.   first of all: it is important that you like the venue. you should like the crowd, the music, the vibe. if you wouldn't go there just for yourself than it is the wrong place for you.  the dancefloor is a starting point for me. i actively look for eye contact, smile. i try to leave some sort of impression. again ... it is very very important that you are having fun while on the dancefloor. otherwise you will look creepy.  this can quickly escalate into directly making out, since, and there you are right, there is no point in starting long conversations while dancing.  then you always have the spots which are quieter, like the bar, or even better a chill out area. chill out areas are a gold mine.   between dancing and loud music, everyone needs a break and is into communication.   i either bring a girl directly from the dancefloor to the chill out area or i do my rounds there once in while to look for girls i had eye contact and smile exchanges before.  the rest is usual game...  to sum it up: know your venue and like it. be active with non verbal communication like smiling and waving. bring her to quieter place."
seduction,3e1vxs,bond_james_throwaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:59 2015 UTC,"Re: Your Supposed Prereqs   In my experience I've noticed there's three prerequisites to pull in a nightclub of which you need at least two.   Physical appeal on par with your 'target',    Hmmm.  Not appeal on some universal scale.  It's more like: ""You need to suit the specific taste of the 'target'.""  It's not like there's some scale that everyone is on.  So worrying about this, is kind of pointless.  You just need to approach and see how far you get, and in doing so, you find out if you fit their taste or not.   very good at dancing,    Not quite.  You don't need to be good, just have fun with the dancing.  And overall, it's about enjoying the activity of the venue.   or a wacky attitude that says you're here to have fun and not just to pull (maybe some crazy glasses or glow in the dark contacts).   Fun, yes.  Outcome independence, yes.  Props, no.  It helps when you are bringing fun to the equation because people go out to have fun.  As opposed to if you're looking for fun and not able to have it on your own.  And it helps if you are able to interact with people without a need for a particular agenda or outcome.  Because two people who are just meeting each other, really have no idea if they are attracted until they get to know each other at least a little.    Re: Your Assessment of Your Liabilities.  It's Incorrect   I'm no Tyler Durden, I can't pull girls without words (which are completely out of the question when you're eardrums are bursting to the music).   You don't need to be Tyler Durden.  You might be exaggerating but this is a bit ridiculous.    In any case, night clubs are not built around the activity of talking.  Loud music + dancing = you are not going to be opening people as effectively with words.  If you walk up to someone at a loud club and try to open them, it's like walking up to a guy playing in a match at a LAN party, and demanding that he takes off his headphones to talk to you.  Not a good way to start off.  Nightclubs are built around dancing and loud music, so you're looking at non-verbal openers for your best and most fun time.  Eye contact.  Dancing.   I can't dance very well    You just need to enjoy dancing and have fun with the music.  You don't need to be a professional.  If you really like dancing and want to know how, take a hip-hop class or something.  If you don't like dancing, DON'T go to clubs.  Find another place.  Go to a bar or something.   I usually punch above my weight in terms of physical attractiveness.    Looks don't matter in the way you think.  There's no way you can just look at a girl and magically know what her personal tastes are.  But you can screw yourself out of a chance if you assume you're not attractive to girls before you even try. Because people will pick up that lack of confidence and it's unattractive."

We generally only met twice per year in person. We continued that way for years, slowly building up our careers but still keeping up with daily interaction online, shifting hobbies when they became boring or frustrating. He finally moved down here permanently 2 years ago (as it finally made sense to; he worked towards being a home-based developer and I have an auditing position here. After his promotion to his current position we finally made enough money to comfortably afford the arrangement we wanted.)  I won't say it's hard, it's really just that the stars have to align for it to work out. PLAN, speak daily, enjoy yourselves, and most importantly be honest with yourselves. If it's not working there's no shame in admitting it. If your plans aren't rock solid, they aren't going to work out.

Tips for making it work: - create some kind of routine for speaking (always sending a good morning message or always sending a good night message) - video chat when possible - naked pictures or naked video chats - discuss plans to see each other in the future, note countdowns as time is getting closer - find mutual topics to talk about (hobbies, funny things on Reddit, movies, politics, etc) anything that opens communication and doesn't focus on solely one person in the relationship    I've had three failed LDR in the past; I move around a lot due to jobs and travel opportunities.

I'd only add that you should try to work in something interesting that you two have in a shared experience from your initial encounter; being playful or teasing with it. Then after you've got some light banter going back and forth, you can drop the We should have coffee some time (I personally like to just drop in an multiple choice starter: ""Which do you like more, Coffee or Ice Cream?"") And then suggest the date. Other than that, it's just a nitpicking point on top of these other nitpicking points, but I don't like to ask when is good for a girl.

Because again, the type of guy that happily accepts less than what he was aiming for, is not the type of guy that gets laid often.   A man has to know exactly what he want's, and have a ""take it or leave it"" mindset. That mindset forces you not give a fuck, while a ""maybe we could be friends"" mindset makes you seem desperate for any affection/validation you can get.  Furthermore, it's never a good idea to be friends with girls you'd rather smash. It does not lead to genuine friendships in my opinion, because yout sexual attraction to the girl is always going to be a major factor in how you interact with her, when it shouldn't.   I'm all for having lots of friends/network, but decide what you really want with a girl before you approach and then don't change your mind based on what she wants."

seduction,3dzqm2,letsgetrandy,0,Mon Jul 20 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"But when you ask for her number she says she has a boyfriend. Most guys would give up at this point. Instead, I go for the second best option. I say ""How about being friends?""   Don't place yourself into the ""friendzone"".  When a woman tells me she has a boyfriend, I gauge the situation and respond with one of these:  If she seems really responsive and is giving the ""go"" signals, I'll say ""I didn't ask you that.""  If she's fun and engaging, but not necessarily in the red zone, I might say, ""that's cool, he can join us.""  If we're not really connecting yet and she's saying it as a sort of dismissal, I'll say something like, ""Good for you. I'll bet that was a big accomplishment."""
seduction,3dzqm2,letsgetrandy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"There are two possible realities: either she really does have a boyfriend or she is lying to you. If she does have a boyfriend, then it is pointless to try to get with her. Even if you somehow do, you are getting with a cheater and I don't know about you but I don't want to be with someone who cheats. The other reality is she is lying to you. If she really is not in to you that much that she would lie about having a boyfriend, then there is no reason to keep pursuing. Plus you wouldn't want to be with a liar anyway."
seduction,3dzqm2,jzell3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"That's a false dichotomy. There are many other possibilities.  Perhaps it's a shit test to see how easily you give up.  Or maybe she's in a relationship with a guy she doesn't respect, but doesn't want to be alone, so she's looking for a higher-value man to replace him with.  Maybe they're in an open relationship, and the fact that she has a boyfriend is true, but doesn't mean she can't be with you.  Or maybe you're just so damned attractive and good at what you're doing that even though she's with someone, she needs to experience a night with you.  Why give up so easily?"
seduction,3dz21w,defpuathrowaway,22,Mon Jul 20 18:14:52 2015 UTC,Being receptive is not the same as being dtf. Hot girls are just better socialized so they are easier to open but harder to fuck

She probably saw you with your friends and it was weird that you left your group to talk to her. I try to separate hunting poon and hanging with my buddies.

If you meet a girl in real life and make an impression than this isn't a problem.  Online dating is a crutch, and its a game that you shouldn't want to play. Don't rely on it, don't invest any time into it, focus on talking to girls in real life."

seduction,3dzyoj,Aestheticpash,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, your competition is very numerous on online dating sites. Every guy who has ever been afraid to talk to a girl in real life is on this site, carpetbombing everything with a vagina with the same copy-pasted message. Anything you type is going to get lost in that avalanche of spam. And do you think that there are guys on Tinder who actually swipe left on anyone remotely passable? There aren't.  The game is not set up in such a way where you get to win, at least not without a lot of wasted effort.  If you simply talk to a girl in real life, you have automatically eliminated all of that competition and made a bigger impression on her than the greatest online dating message ever could have. You've improved your chances of success by an order of magnatude. Even the hottest girl won't get approached in real life even a fraction as much as the most pustulant ham-beast gets messaged online."
seduction,3dzyoj,Morokweng,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"Use the takeaway when setting up the date. Here's how Corey Wayne explains it.  ""Jessica, I have a really busy schedule, and I would definitely like to take you out, but if you can’t make definite plans with me, then how about we just do it some other time?""  Then you are going to wait for her response. It is what we call in sales, the Take Away. If she says: ""Yes. Give me a call and we’ll make it for some other time..."" her interest is low. If her interest is high, she will be more likely to say something along the lines of: ""No, I just wanted your number. I definitely want to see you.""  I will have women ask: ""You’re not going to call me before you come?"" I usually answer in a light-hearted manner: ""I am the kind of guy who keeps my word. I am making plans to see you next Tuesday, and I’m definitely going to be there.""  The best thing about this is you don’t have to call back to verify, so you don’t have to worry over the next several days whether or not you are actually going to be able to get a hold of her or not when you call back to verify. Nine times out of ten, if a woman gives you a call back to verify, you are never going to get her on the phone again."

seduction,3dzyoj,CaliBboy,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean? Just get her on the phone and lead the conversation by stating the time and place and she will either agree or not. If she hesitates use the takeaway.  Also do not be afraid to lose this woman or else you will always be the one without the woman. Winners always play to win only losers play not to lose.

seduction,3dzyoj,sunday_silence,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:23 2015 UTC,if you dont give any shits you will paint yourself in a corner.

That  you've been faking it all along? or that what you're saying now is fake.   or its possible the girl really is sick and really does like you. Then you blow her off and lose all chances. There are several ways to paint yourself in a corner with this approach.   I would try to give her the benefit of the doubt for as long as possible until you cant possibly buy into it.  This would certainly have better long term chances as she can see you're tolerant and patient which are also valuable qualities.

seduction,3dzyoj,WhatIWannaSay,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"The goal of a date should be to make her feel good.   Think of it from her perspective.   You're an incredibly desirable woman. Lots of guys want you. It's Monday  night. You don't have plans for Friday night. Somebody invites you to starbucks for a date. You agree. It's your first offer.   Tuesday comes around and someone else invites you to go mini golf. That's better than starbucks so you accept golf and maybe notify starbucks guy it's off. Of course you give Starbucks guy another chance because it literally has zero impact with a potential reward.   Wednesday comes and some guy offers to take you out to dinner. You don't know if mini golf guy is doing dinner so you ask him what his dinner plans were. Mini golf guy suggests a more appealing dinner venue. You accept golf guy and reject dinner dude.   Thursday you get an offer to go hiking up a mountain. You don't like hiking. It doesn't make you feel good. You reject. Guy is attractive and fit so you of course lead him on to try again.   Friday comes along. Your girlfriends are going clubbing late on Saturday so you'll be okay. You accept since you'll have golf and dinner beforehand. A random stranger approaches you and talks about his adventurous life doing yoga on mountains during sunset and how spiritual it is. Hey, he's even doing it Friday night. You should come with him since you both like yoga and would be an amazing experience. You accept. But hey yoga mountain sunrise dude has to get dinner first. He's going to ride his motorcycle to some restaurant that happens to be one of your favorite foods. You should come too since you're a foodie.but you're not really into hiking. But it's okay he's already explained how it's an easy quick hike. And he'll drive most of the way up on his bike. Plus after he likes to go a little crazy dancing.  It's Saturday morning. Chad hasn't woken up yet. He's out like a rock. You look at your phone and see 6 missed calls , 2 voicemails and 10 texts from that guy who was doing something yesterday. You open his messages to clear the little red circle quickly. You don't read or listen to anything. You glance at the words and can tell it wasn't happy but he's a grown man. He'll be ok. You quickly get dressed and grab your purse. You've got to get ready for tonight's girls night out.   You wake up Sunday afternoon. What a fun night. Guys kept buying you drinks all night. You didn't want to go home with a random dude so you and your girlfriends made an agreement to stick together.   Monday you're thinking about chad and the amazing spiritual night.   Tuesday you're wondering why chad hasn't called or texted.   Wednesday you've already locked down Friday plans for dinner and a movie.   Thursday eeeeaaarrrllyyy morning chad texts because he had this incredible discovery and he needs to show you right now. Get your ass over here. He was experimenting with body painting and needs to show you.  Friday and you're waiting for chad to setup something.   Nothing.   You go on your lame date. Movie guy sets up date 2 for tomorrow, Saturday, for some kind of bar hop tour. How immature I'm totally not into just getting drunk all the time. But whatever.   Saturday afternoon chad tells you his friend just opened up this cool bar that serves only craft brews that are made from barley tea and the. He's going to watch the planes takeoff from the end of the runway. And it's such a rush. You literally feel the engines roar over you.   Sunday. You see 6 missed calls 2 voicemails and 10 texts. You quickly open them to get rid of the little red circles. Chads already gone."
seduction,3dzyoj,sunday_silence,6,Tue Jul 21 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"This is probably quite accurate, at least the gist of it is.  While I can understand the psychology/consequences of women having so many options... to be quite honest (and I couldn't give a fuck less if I'm judged negatively for saying this, so, please resist any indignant feelgood responses), understanding this dating reality leaves me with an unshakable feeling that these women are just not worth this kind of hassle and effort. They are unworthy of the rewards and become jaded/spoiled/obnoxious by them. Before you get all feelgood/white knight, realize that I AM NOT SAYING that these women don't deserve some basic/human level of respect, attention, affection, love, fun, whatever, etc. Because they do, everyone (more or less) does. I'm also not saying that men are not playing a sickening role in this; they (we?) are largely the catalyst for this. What I'm saying is that the amount of shit most attractive women are handed is shockingly unwarranted to the point where I lose respect for them and the men giving it to them. I hate the culture/circumstances, not necessarily the individuals (or genders) involved.  A pepperoni pizza tastes great. But would I do a backflip and spend $100 dollars on one because a bunch of other guys were willing to? Fucking nope."
seduction,3dzyoj,gg4444,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:37 2015 UTC,"you are only seeing one side of this. The investment part.  have you ever had someone who was incredibly loyal to you? Who'd take care of you in sickness and even when you fuck up? Despite there being no logical reason for her to stay?   The unfairness of this goes both ways. Just like men, women often invest themselves in ways that is way beyond logical. It's often referred to as loyalty, faithfulness, bonding or whatever. Its very powerful.  Men have it too of course, but doesnt change the point."
seduction,3dzyoj,sunday_silence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not only seeing one side of this. I'm only commenting on the investment side.  I wouldn't argue with you on this, though. It's obviously not black and white, these things bleed across gender lines.    have you ever had someone who was incredibly loyal to you? Who'd take care of you in sickness and even when you fuck up? Despite there being no logical reason for her to stay?   I'm not sure, actually... If you mean girls I've been in a relationship with, then not so much. Then again, I've typically been a very decent guy in relationships, so I don't tend to ""fuck up"" more than the women have. In my experience, usually the woman fucks up and I give her a chance to correct, and when she doesn't (she usually doesn't) I cut her off and don't go back. If you mean girls that have been into me when I wasn't into them, then probably, I can't be 100% sure."
seduction,3dzyoj,newmood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"I mean in a more serious relationship. You know, you invest time and money in a girl and maybe it doesnt payoff...BUt then once someone falls in love with you, they can remain loyal, no matter who tries to seduce them, no matter how bad times are, etc.   That sort of loyalty is also not totally logical but its a powerful thing when people fall in love. I remember the first time I experienced this, with this landlord who was arguing with me. I had fucked up and burned the carpet, and my girlfriend just reamed him out, seemingly with no real argument. It was powerful, I saw her in a totally different light.   Re; this quote:   ""I'm only commenting on the investment side.  Im not so sure that saves your reasoning. The payoff in loyalty etc. is part of what you get out of that investment if ultimately pays off. To take your pizza analogy, the pizza costs $100, right? But there's a special offer one in every 5 or 6 pizzas come with a coupon for lifetime supply of anchovy or garlic sauce for you.   is the pizza worth it? There's a risk, but then there's also how much  you value garlic sauce.  Then there's also the issue of how much is a lifetime supply really worth?  All of this is tied up in the concept of investment as it relates to the initial investment of $100. And there's also the possibility you fall out of love for garlic sauce.  SO investing in girls is subject to the same vague analysis. You dont know really how amazing this relationship could possibly be. That's why you try to save your money for a girl you think could be a home run. And you cant really value it totally objectively. How much life will you have together? Will you fall out of love?   The bailing thing I sort of just accept as girls have a more emotional nature and they have more of an investment in the act of sex. Its probably just a natural genetic thing. I would try to give them the benefit of the doubt, for as long as posible, there cant be any hard rules in this as everyone is different. Some girls are incredibly worth it despite being more emotional than the norm."
seduction,3dzyoj,newmood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see your argument. But it's also not one-sided... BOTH sides of a relationship should be loyal and pay dividends (so to speak). So when I encounter women (or dating circumstances) that demand inordinate amounts of pay for something I might not be incredibly excited about (despite being varying levels of excited), while simultaneously failing to put in even a token reciprocal effort, then I decide it's not worth my energy. I'm not sure if this has always been this way, or if modern society has accelerated/worsened it, but my cost-benefit analysis according to my own dating ethics is that, if a girl won't put in the 40% (give or take) to my 60% and develops standards/requires efforts that exceed her actual objective worth (i.e. standalone intelligence, attractiveness, interests, accomplishments, goals/dreams, humor, compatibility, chemistry, personality, etc.) regardless of suitors/pursuers, then I typically lose interest.  Also, there's not enough guarantee of loyalty or satisfaction, often times, to make a, potentially constant, gamble worth it.  I know this all sounds very cold/dry and economic, but I don't really approach/handle individual relationships like this, I'm far more human/organic about it. However, upon later analysis, especially on a macro/culture-wide level, it's more useful to talk mechanically, rather than viscerally, about it."

Could you provide some sort of example of how the interaction went from approach to planning the date over whatever medium and then the actual final moments flake itself.  Could be that the number was flaky to begin with e.g. not solid enough interaction. Remember ""Girls will give out their number to anyone."" So how are you going about setting up these dates?  If you have something exact planned with a girl, there's no need for further texting with her really."
seduction,3dzyoj,recyclablebantha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your reply buddy.   It went like this.   I matched with her on tinder, and we wrote back and forth. I tried asking her out, and she said she didn't have time, and I removed our match at the same moment.  A few moments later I regret moving the match and I find her on instagram, as which I proceed to tell her ""I kinda regret deleting our match on Tinder, but I found you to be playing games, and I don't have time for that"" and she actually replied really in a chill manner ""Hey. That's totally alright, I actually did not have time, but i'll let you know when I do.""   2 hours pass by and she texts me randomly and we communicate very well together, I end up getting her to be very interested in me, and be very flirty.. almost to the point where she was being REALLY in to me, while I kept it cool.   We ended up planning to be together during the convo, on Wednesday. This was 3 days ago, so I text her today, and chat with her on SnapChat, but she doesn't seem as interested as before at all. I am ""afraid""/nervous that she is going to back out on Wednesday, and I don't know how to go about asking what time, and exactly where from now on.   I apologize for my very clumsy explanation, I hope you kind of understand some bits :)"
seduction,3dzyoj,sunday_silence,6,Mon Jul 20 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"Okay I think I got it. What happened here was, you went inside of your head and started imagining what she is thinking and feeling based on zero evidence. So, hopefully you haven't texted her too much on Snapchat so you can now just suggest a good exact time and place where and when to meet on Wednesday and after that, silence :)  However, there might still be a MILLION different reasons why she seems to be flaking. That's okay. It means you'll have time to go out and further improve your skills. So in short, try to let go of the outcome and try to harness some abundance so that you don't have to care about one girl flaking so much.  Whatever you do, don't show further neediness because if it hasn't already, that'll make her pussy drier than the Sahara desert. So, maybe she's still just busy just like last time and she'll get back to you when she has the time. Meanwhile you shouldn't be worrying about her and just kinda live your own life in a way that maybe next time you're not so available."

Just start speaking, don't think about ""the best thing to say,"" just start talking like you would with one of your buddies. Make solid eye contact, smile, laugh, and just do whatever the hell you want... women are attracted to men who are confident in themselves. Tell stories, make jokes, be the leader of your buddies at the party, as if you're the one that brought them all there. If you don't give a fuck and say whatever you're thinking with confidence, women will gravitate toward you without you having to make any effort."

seduction,3dxxyo,TheRealYellowClaw,25,Mon Jul 20 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"Londoner here.  It's all about expanding your worldview. During my first 3 months in University a lot of people I'm still friends with today, I met by cold approaching. Granted we belonged to the same university so we were both part of the same ""tribe"". But it's about 50:50 between people I was introduced to and people I cold approached, because I was that kinda guy.  However I've cold approached people in starbucks that didn't go to my uni, and had some awesome in-depth conversations, and I was just too lazy to follow up on.  Cool people like to meet new cool people. If in the first few moments you both share a similar world view about something (something you guys can identify with, aka you're part of the same tribe) then the conversation will go deeper. If heck you're intriguing enough it's not the hardest thing to get an email or a facebook, to follow up with them.  The critical thing however is to follow up. Ping the person a week later, and actually y'know...meet up with them.  Notice how nothing I said mentioned girls. That's because if you're going to be into cold approaching, especially in a city like London, where no-one talks to one another, it has to be your COMPLETE mindset. You have to be into cold approaching anyone you think looks cool.  If you get in the mindset of just cold approaching girls and girls alone, you will fail. Why? I don't know, I just know from experience. Maybe it's because your putting girls on a pedestal. Maybe because going out just to meet girls isn't attractive, and girls can sense that. I don't know. What I do know, is that the best days for cold approaching girls, are the days when it's natural as fuck, and it happens without me intending for it to happen. How? Because I was in an open mindset, cold approaching and willing to meet new people generally.  Easy tip for you, whenever I'm in a bookstore, I approach someone if they're looking at a book I've read or I'm interested in reading. Guy or Girl. Young or Old.  If 10% of those cold approaches is a hot girl, well heck, that's 10% more of hot girls I wouldn't have met."
seduction,3dxxyo,EndOfTheUniverse,9,Mon Jul 20 18:06:40 2015 UTC,If you go to Oxford Street in London you will find within an hour at least 10 people practicing cold approach. You probably don't know stories of people who have started a relationship through cold approach because your social circle is not into game. I would suggest to get to know people who are practicing game and go out together.
seduction,3dxxyo,Andrian-TQM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"Really interesting, especially because I've been there myself.  That street has such a high anonymity, a great place to practice cold approach.  edit based on your edit: You're probably right, even though I think it's way more rare to find these people outside of the really big cities. Where should I be looking?"
seduction,3dxxyo,mashisuh,7,Mon Jul 20 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"I went to dance clubs 3+ times a week for over a year while living in South Korea and Japan, and some of the hottest and by far the best long term relationships were from girls I met walking on the street. Don't get me wrong, I had some of the most exciting and best stories from the clubs, but those girls never turned into LTRs for me.  I can speak conversationally fluent Korean but the hottest girl I got from daygame I did not speak any Korean to. When I saw her, my whole world just paused, my brain wasn't firing right, I forgot I wasn't in my homeland where people speak English, and I ran up to her and just exuded excitement at seeing such a beautiful specimen. She could barely understand anything I was saying while I was enthusiastically talking AT her, like I was examining and describing a beautiful painting I had just found, and then I just shoved my phone into her hands at the end and she gave me her phone number with a big smile on her face. Met up later and best fucking thing in the world.  To get to this point where I was able to approach such a hot girl with such good energy was because I approached many girls before her and I was walking with friends and talking a lot before I saw her. When you are trying to warm-up, stop rationalizing and saying she is not hot enough. If you don't want to date her, just don't go for the number then and just practice getting out of your comfort zone and talking to a random girl on the street. It is easier when you're in a big city with lots of people. Even when I lived in the heart of Gangnam, surrounded with a sea of hot women, I would rationalize that they weren't hot enough for me and make excuses not to approach, just because I wasn't in the mood. Fucking do it and make yourself get into the mood.  I thought a lot of my success came from my language skills but it was a smaller degree than I thought. I met an awesome guy that did daygame only in English with girls and if the girls couldn't understand at all he would start making them laugh with words like APPLE and stuff and his energy would just start making them giggle and he got a surprising amount of phone numbers and lays with little to no communication.  I will be heading to China soon, so hopefully I can learn more about having no language skills and picking up."

seduction,3dxxyo,auveeb,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"About one year in the USA with three different Korean girlfriends, self-study and a University course that was probably the least helpful. Then a little less than two years in Korea doing an English teaching job, then tutoring and modeling while learning Korean in daily conversation and reading web comics online. So maybe three years of immersion... I mean I changed everything to Korean, my cellphone, my computer, my thinking -- Gotta get obsessed with it or at least obsessed with a hot Korean celebrity that motivates you to want to study Korean a bunch lol"
seduction,3dxxyo,Eddie_skis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"I've approached in Korea before, tried a lot of things.  Like you, I found that approaching in English and speaking little to no Korean yielded the best results, when I spoke just Korean, my blowout rate was much much higher.... but I don't think its the energy... its because of the English... it just hooks better because fluent English is a huge DHV in Korea, and it also snaps them out of a ""cultural norm"" mindset, since its not everyday someone just speaks to them in English so they don't rationalize it as an approach and it doesn't trigger ""possible creep"" alert."
seduction,3dxxyo,dallas_89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"Simile in Japan I think. Approaching in Japanese puts you at an immediate disadvantage unless you are literally 100% fluent. Also it removes some of your uniqueness.  I have a friend who would approach girls on the street pretending to be lost and ask for directions lol. Seemed to work for him.  I'd say this though, there are girls who are really into foreigners and girls who are really NOT into foreigners."

I only attempted to chat up and immediately get a middle aged woman's phone number once ( I did it too quickly but i was so nervous so I doubt I would have gotten it anyways) and I just met her on the street and asked directions to the subway station.    After that I said I enjoyed talking to her and I mistakenly immediately  asked for her number which she said no, god I wanna kick myself now i think about it  but whatever!

seduction,3dxxyo,SirByron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard to describe, because when I approach I enter flow and I'm not self-aware enough to really know exactly what I'm doing.  But people are friendlier when the sun is out, that's a given. Outrageousness always works. US or UK the more polarising you are, the more polarised your responses, i.e. the more people harshly reject you, and the more people warmly interact with you.  It's far far far far better however to meet people via social groups. Whether through volunteering, or hobbies (or my personal fave: bookstores). That way people's guards are down. Remember, usually when someone gets cold approached in London, it's to get asked to donate to a cause, or to get begged for money, or some other guilt trap.   It takes a lot of guts to stay there for the first 30 seconds or a minute while the person's guard is up. But when their guard slides down, it's like cool refreshing water. It's one of the best feelings in the world."

seduction,3dz6hi,Lyskam,5,Mon Jul 20 18:45:34 2015 UTC,I live on the border with Juarez literally a rock throw away. Here you tend to approach many girls who only speak Spanish and me being hispanic I'm expected to be fluent but I've been so Americanized that just isn't the case. With that said I've used that disadvantage of the language barrier to my personal advantage making a game out of it and it becomes this body language driven cute-sie interaction.  Even had dates with these girls and use google translate the whole time and try to teach each other our language. Point is you need to adapt to the situation I know you're most comfortable conversing in depth but challenge yourself one day approach with out saying a word they won't know you aren't deaf and see how their reactions are to your body language.  If you have more questions outside of this topic I hope my channel can help.

seduction,3dz6hi,trapaz0id,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Best example I have came out of tinder where we eventually set up a date and it started off very awkward but turned into this fun game of teaching each other how to say words and was easily flirtatious with her. The night was frustrating trying to talk with each other until we loosened up and laughed about both of our horrible accents and led to sex at the end of the night. body language is key with this language barrier a confident guy translates to all languages

I speak some Spanish and can hold a conversation, but I'm not fluent by any means. What I noticed overseas was the power of silence and body language. I would go to big clubs and popular bars and say only what I needed to say, with a smile and confidence.  I was the mysterious foreigner and something new/exciting to these girls and I set myself apart from my friends by being the best at Spanish. Also, I really tried when I did speak Spanish and the girls recognized that and appreciated it (at least I think)."
seduction,3dz6hi,DoktorBBQ,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:53 2015 UTC,I think this whole language barrier thing is hurting my confidence and people may see it in my body language.
seduction,3dz6hi,DoktorBBQ,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"I completely feel like i've been in the same boots as you. Ask for reference if in doubt, I'm just trying to keep my answer brief and sorta general.  I like the previous mentioned tips, I used to carry a hand-book and a pen for notes, but also communication (by drawing) if i'd ever feel like my chinese/body language wasn't enough(all day, every day).   It seems to me like your problem is on a more subtle level, as was my English at that time. Don't let the language shortcomings be in the way of your confidence; if any thought is spent at criticizing your communicative ability, you'll retreat into your head, loosing touch with the moment(which is a very good generator of ideas to talk about). Feeling like your lack of fluency is holding you back is most likely 99 times worse for your PUA progress compared to the  language barrier itself. Suddenly getting self aware of your awareness of ""fluency lack"", could be bad as well in the field, as it would force you to retreat into your head rather than enjoying the conversation, but fear not; there is no reason ever again to be paranoid about your communicative skills, they're not a problem, the paranoia is.   ""Shortcomings"" can be used in a good way, if you let them, instead of making them a source of self doubt. Own your language/cultural shortcomings and don't for a second doubt your value based on it.   As long as you're non-fluent in a language you've got the best excuse ever (mostly to yourself) to ask strangers silly questions about how to properly say/do things according to their customs. That opener is always available, and it might intrigue girls who likes playing with ideas if that's what you're looking for. I feel like seducing girls of other countries a great opportunity to communicate with people, freed of cultural constrains and courtesies. You're likely to see patterns that are easy to ignore if you'd be at home where you can fit in others reactions into your motherland cultural model of what makes people act like what( this one's a biggie).  My point is that the language barrier is not necessary bad, don't see it as such. Play with it if you feel like it, if not don't care.   I'm sleep-wise very tired and my writing is messy. The above mentioned should make some sense, i don't know what you wanna/need to hear from now on and if I did id be too tired to be able to put it to words.   Could you please describe to me HOW you experience your lack of fluency to be in the way? Based on your writing it seems to me that your English proficiency shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer like you."

I kinda messed up this one on purpose as I couldn't tell if she worked where I interviewed (don't shit where you eat.) but I see where where I could've improved there by simply asking.    Dude.  First off, are you getting the job for sure?    Secondly, the whole ""don't shit where you eat"" rule is BULLSHIT.  The real suggestion or rule here should be, ""Don't date where you work if you can't date without making a mess.""  So the question is, do you date without drama or mess during or afterwards?  If so, then this ""rule"" doesn't apply to you.    She walked up to you though.....  That's actually a skill to facilitate that sort of thing.  Good on you....    You could have improved by simply going with the flow instead of killing it out of fear.  Nothing in asking to hang out with the girl, automatically equals something douche-y is going down.  Do you even have a tendency to treat people poorly?  If so, then stop worrying about what people will think about you asking them to hang out.   Then yesterday I did 2 approaches, got a number and danced with my other approche. Interestingly enough the second girl actually had a boyfriend (he showed up later, we where at a festival.) but still slow danced with me. I only found out after when she told me.   Where were you?  Sounds like night game at a club.  How did you open them?    So why did you stop at a number with the first girl?    Also, with the second one, you have discovered the answer to a common question here, ""How do I find out if she has a boyfriend?""  You don't need to ask.

On my approaches the first one was actually a cute girl working at a local restaurant. Normally I don't game on girls that are forced by their job to interact with you but when she took my order she had no problem talking opening up to me and even flirting a little as she gave me my food so boom went for it. We have a coffee date set up on thursday.   This will happen sometimes.  Good work!  Looks like you have some data now about what real flirtation might look like when dealing with girls who are forced to be friendly as part of their job.  :)   ..... found out she was a dancer. It just so happen that when I asked her to dance a slow song came up and she said ""This song?"".  I said ""yeah!"" Happily, she Knew where it was going she wasn't afraid to get close and personal. We basically just talked and enjoyed the dance.    This was the one with the BF?  Sounds like you relate to people well and don't go negative if things aren't going exactly as you want....  which is good.   Fun fact: After the dancer told me about her boyfriend she insisted that I go talk to her younger sister, dancer girl was 18 i'm 21. I don't think I need to go further as to why I didn't...   Because she can't drink and you can?"

Yes the dancer was the one with the bf. She was also the one that was 18. Now the dancer was telling me to hit up her younger sister who was about 16-17. I was actually pretty surprised that she told me that, I guess she trusted me that much? Either way it was positive experience."

But, yes, the general advice is to refrain from gaming women over text because it's much less effective than gaming in person where you can flirt and escalate.  How come you can't just see this coworker at work? I mean, if she's added you on facebook, there's no harm in asking her out over facebook. I'd prefer to ask her out in person if at all possible."

seduction,3dzywk,recyclablebantha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:28 2015 UTC,"As a 30 male I want to ask what you guys think of talking to a girl by facebook/whatsapp to set up the logistics in the current situation:    Texting is excellent for logistics.  But you're not talking about logistics.  You're talking about replacing in person communication, when you seem to have access and opportunity to communicate with her in person.   A coworker is interested in me (I know that because my female friends told me),    Quit dealing with third parties and he said, she said crap.  Deal with her directly.   seems that this girl is already interested/attracted, I don't see her too much because she stays in another room.    So......?  Go to that other room.  Say hi.   Nowadays we use whatsapp and facebook to communicate, I was thinking of making some comment by fb IM since she added me and ask for her number to ask her out (yes direct approach like that). What you guys think about it? I just got a bit confused of this ""don't use text"" kind of rule.   This isn't about logistics.  You're talking about asking her out over text, which shows lack of confidence when you could walk over and do so in person.  Just march yourself over there and start a conversation in real life.  And on your way out, suggest hanging out and do this IN PERSON.  As for getting a phone number, come on man......  Join the 21st Century.  ;)  You already have her on FB, which probably means that you can already text directly to her phone.  And FB messenger has a call function, so you can already call her PHONE directly.  You don't need to get a number at this point.  It's redundant."
seduction,3dzywk,TheXXL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"There is a saying: ""never fuck the company"". Keep that in mind. If it doesn´t work out, this could get very uncomfortable for you, and/or for her. I would say don´t do it. There are so many beautiful, sexy and awesome girls, that dont work in your company.  Some years back, i had a similiar situation with a coworker. She worked in a different department in my company, and i saw her from time to time in our kitchen. Since we all were connected via skype, i then asked her out,... what can i say... no response whatsoever. When i then saw her, she avoided me. This was at the time uncomfortable for me, and obviously for her. About a month later, i got fired along many others due some tax evasion stuff on behalf of my boss, so this thing figured itself out somehow. but still, not that cool.  A more recent experience was with a woman from across my office, that i got into contact with. I one day initiated contact on our way home, since we had to go the same way. We got out for drinks, lunch and a few times on our lunch break. She was attracted to me, but was hesitant. I found out she was very shallow and got very disrespectful to me, so i broke contact.   Now we see eachother a few times a week on my cigarette break, and she doesn´t even look at me anymore. I don´t care that much, but my co workers start asking questions what´s wrong with us and so on... this is annoying. So if you are self confident enough, it could be ok, but keep in mind that others could be a pain in the ass, and it could jeaopardize your job in the worst case."

Get a new outfit if your not stylish, get a better haircut if you need one, start a gym membership, etc, etc.   As all that's being set in motion, do a few, simple, direct approaches. Like just get her attention politely, express that she's attractive and you wanted to chat...if the convo lasts more than a minute tell her you'd like to go out sometime. It will feel uncomfortable, but just fight through it.   Once you do that a few times, then start working on being less anxious with her, and making approaches smoother."

seduction,3dwz58,shaunanexus2014,12,Mon Jul 20 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"I think one aspect of it is that impressing others takes alot less effort and bigger short term results. All you have to do is present an image of yourself and perpetuate it every time you see this person (everybody you ever thought ""had it together"" was just projecting that image of themselves, they weren't necessarily well rounded people)  Impressing yourself is alot harder because you know yourself better than anyone else (you live with yourself 24/7) so there's no bullshitting anyone. Improving yourself is hard work, and the saying goes, anything worth achieving isn't easy. There isn't really any immediate satisfaction. When you work on yourself, a better life will just creep up on you. And you'll just have the knowledge that you were a better man than you were yesterday."
seduction,3dwz58,sakurafice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"i've been on the self improvement path for a few months now. coming to terms with the fact that there is no ""end game"" has been really difficult. You don't ever get to stop taking care of yourself. and it will always be work. there is no immediate satisfaction. as you say, the better life just kind of emerges into existence. it's just frustrating because i have vices and they work, short term.   nothing about self improvement is going to give the same shot of intense pleasure the vices provide.  im still not sure i've really accepted that, or want to. why would i want to give that up? i mean, the answer should be obvious, but it's not. i can list all the things that i could achieve without the vices and with the improved self-care. but can any of that really compete with the shot of dopamine you can get without having to do anything?  ugh. growing up sucks."
seduction,3dwz58,tonicandgin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. At first it seems like a drag and there is no point. For some things there is no clear endgame, for example flossing your teeth daily. For these things it helps to keep the purpose of why you are doing it in mind, in this case to have a healthy mouth later in life. On the other hand, some things do have an endgame, and it helps to break these things up into smaller, short term goals especially when the endgame is far away.  Your second comment is where you are wrong. The reason you feel this way is because you have not felt the pleasure of achievement and a healthy life. In my experience,  I have never, ever felt a greater high than when I reach a goal in the weight room. I'm not exaggerating. On a different note, I am content every moment of every day because I have a balanced life.  I work hard for my goals and I am living with purpose and direction, and when it's time to do nothing, I dont do anything. doing nothing feels a lot better when it's balanced with hard work. You wouldn't have had the idea of improving yourself if you didn't think it would be worth it. Keep your goals in mind but also find joy in the process."

If you place a high priority on being comfortable in those grey areas instead of having things black and white, it'll be easier.  If you're more flexible instead of rigid-minded, it'll be easier.

If this is what it takes to get you to the same level or higher, so be it.

Would your friends laugh at you if you picked up a guitar and played some random notes that didn't sound good?  Probably.

I will leave you with this beautifull quote, by Marianne Williamson:  ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you.  We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. """

Your friend laughed at you because he's insecure about himself and would rather put you down than improve himself when faced with something he could improve.  He might even be jealous.  If he continues to take the road of putting you down, then he's no friend and you might want to reconsider your involvement with him.  Friends should elevate you, not put you down.  You felt ashamed because you're still working on your confidence and maybe because you still think of ""seduction"" as something where slimy guys are all, ""Heeeyyyyy gurl....,"" wrapping their arms around some girl that doesn't want it, and tricking them into bed.    You must dispense with this incorrect myth.  Seduction is merely being social.  That's it.  It's a teamsport: nothing really happens without the girl contributing.

If a woman starts working out to lose weight in order to attract men, is that somehow laughable? Rather hypocritical if you ask me.   There's nothing shameful with recognizing you currently lack a skill and honing it. If you suck at basketball, what do you do? You take the time practicing how to dribble and shoot. Is that shameful?

I'd nearly say you've just not met the right woman for you yet.   It's not rocket science. Women aren't these mystical creatures. They're human, just like you and me. Where are you approaching these women that you've had ""sort of success"" with? If you keep meeting them when you're out clubbing or in a bar, generally speaking you're not going to find a girl that you're going to end up dating long term. Don't get me wrong, plenty of people do end up in relationships from meeting women while out.  What I'd recommend though is either day gaming, or meeting women through some hobby groups, that way you both have a common interest straight off."

It might not help you directly with ""here's the ABCs of how to relate to women!"", but it deals with being honest and authentic, traits that are fundamentally needed if you want real connection.  Look, some people just aren't worth connecting with. I mean yeah, emphathize with them, understand that they also have deep thoughts and emotions, and recognize that they're just human. But realistically speaking, you're not going to form super-deep connections with everyone you meet. So don't worry too much about it (I'm totally assuming you are, my bad, hahah).  Like I recently went out on a couple dates with this Asian girl. I found her really attractive... but that's about it. There wasn't anything wrong with her, there was simply no chemistry besides me wanting to fuck her. I can see myself being casual friends with her, but I don't see myself going out of my way to see if I can create a connection with her.  That being said, listen to them without judgement. Listen to their verbal and non-verbal communication. As long as you listen to them (rather than simply hearing sounds coming out of their mouth), then you're on the right track."

I paid and fled.   Just to be clear, SHE was the one with the problem.  It doesn't reflect on you if someone is incapable of answering a simple question without sounding like a lying idiot.  You were kind of hilarious.  What you said didn't need to be driven by some need to get her number or whatever.    In fact, she failed as a person and I hope you realize that you didn't want her number anymore after she pulled out such a poor attitude.    EDIT: Some of you have misinterpreted my hyperbole here, so I'll rephrase the last line.  Due to the amount of misunderstanding, I need a few bullet points to express what I had hoped to express in one line.  My bad.   There is nothing wrong with making friendly conversation.   And yes, guys who seem to be worried that the dreaded face of entitlement is rearing its head......  No one, including the girl he was talking to, is required to make conversation if they don't want to.  Consent is extremely important.  No one is entitled to anything and that's not what I was talking about. But OP, there is definitely NOTHING wrong with how you opened her and you should not assume that people are going to respond in such a way to you when you open them.  You should not be changing your friendly, positive approach under the assumption that you have to overcome such a negative attitude every time you open a girl.   Some people on this thread appear to think it's weird to start a conversation with a stranger: don't let their fear infect you. You did excellently to keep things simple: you made an observation and then shared a comment about that observation.  Usually, that will be a great way to open a girl if she's not in a poor mood.   Unfortunately, some girls will jump to conclusions, assuming that you're going to be like one of those awkward guys who comes on too strong.  There's nothing you can do about that, except move on and realize that you don't need to interact wish such negativity anyway, nor would you want someone's number if they're going to be that defensive. If someone reacts as she did, consider it process of elimination: some people are just not worth your time.  And move on.  If she goes negative, then she's the one with a problem or having a bad day or whatever.   You shouldn't have had to flee, either."

We don't have anywhere near enough information or context to know whether she sounded like 'a lying idiot' or if OP was 'hilarious'. We shouldn't have to lie to ourselves in an ""anyone who doesn't want me is a frigid stupid bitch"" type attitude to be okay with what happens in our life, because that sure as shit doesn't sound like outcome independence.

I was only supporting reframing the situation to a positive one as opposed to the original ""Oh I am shunned from women because of this one ugly encounter.""   Seduction and especially approaching women is a very emotional process. In our default state, I think most of us are like OP and automatically go into negative thinking where we take rejection personally. My stance is that you see it as a positive. In this situation the positive is that he gave it a shot and that he might be better off without her. Optimism ≠ outcome dependence, it's a choice in how to live...  A lot of people aren't quite at the point where they can easily walk away from a rude response and shake it off with ease.

seduction,3dxk7h,ninja_possum,13,Mon Jul 20 13:20:49 2015 UTC,"She sounds like someone who couldn't give a fuck talking to a random in the morning.  Sounds like me.    Remember, No one is entitled to another persons time."
seduction,3dxk7h,GiganticTree,-6,Mon Jul 20 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"If a girl did this in the past, or was just a bitch in general, I wouldn't be afraid to call her out."
seduction,3dxk7h,petriomelony,6,Mon Jul 20 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"What did she ""do""?  He asked a closed question (first error) which she answered with as long an answer as you'd expect any average stranger to.  It'd be like me wearing a suit and someone asking, ""Hey were you just at a wedding?"" ""uhh... no?"" I'd probably reply.  I mean he could have made it a bit fun and try to guess her coffee type or something, or just open with a solid ""Hello, I'm ____"".  She's not being bitchy just for answering his question.  In any case, maybe she was just on her way for a jog or going to the gym or whatever and was about to rush off.  The fact that he recognized the ""sullen"" look (ie: I don't want to talk to you/something is wrong) and KEPT pushing the conversation is just asking for her to ignore him... I don't see what there is to ""call out"" here."

seduction,3e12yg,Not2original,2,Tue Jul 21 04:16:57 2015 UTC,"Or talk to her and run solid game and there will be no need to see if she follows you since you will be making out with her, pull her somewhere else,  or have her #."
