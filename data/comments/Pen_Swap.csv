In my haste I didn't quite let the inks settle, so it's not super easy to see where they settle.  I'm full of win tonight.  Okay, so the run down:  All are located in California.  Pilot Metropolitan - Silver, Fine nib  2 pilot blue cartridges $10 [B] SOLD  Pilot Prera - Lime green, EF nib and and squeeze “converter” $20 [B]  Pilot VP Gunmetal Grey, M nib with con-20, 1 pilot blue cart, and metal cap $95 [B] SOLD  Lamy Safari - Charcoal, M nib with z-24 converter and 1 Lamy Blue cart $25 [A2]  Lamy Al-Star - Copper orange, EF nib with z-24 converter and 1 Lamy Blue cart $30 [A2] SOLD  Jinhao X450 - Dark Blue w/gold trim, M nib with converter $free ninety nine [B] SOLD  Noodler’s Ahab - Clear Modded for flex, have heat set the feed.  Should get a writing sample, probably. $10 [B]  Inks:  Iroshizuku Kon-peki - %50 $10 SOLD  Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo - %70 $15 SOLD  Iroshizuku Ajisai - %90 - $20 with some ink damage from a leak in shipping SOLD  The Metro and Prera were experiments in finer nibs without breaking the bank, and the VP is out the door because I liked the flat black and fine better than gunmetal and medium, the box will state that the VP is a Fine, it’s a lie, I swapped nibs.  The Lamys have been carried for maybe a day each, no visible wear.  Didn’t end up liking the style.  I was gripey in a previous post about the driness of the al-star, but once it got properly flushed, it’s perfectly well behaved.  x450 was tossed in from another exchange here, and I had some grand designs that won’t come to pass…so if you buy anything else, this can go along with it.  The Ahab was a trade for a spare part I had.  I’ve cleaned it up and spent a little time with the dremel.  It’s not professional quality work, but it’s not half bad.  It’s also only $10.  Flexes MUCH better than when I got it, and after doing a little reading I heat set the feed.  It’s pretty well behaved, but my penmanship is likely to always suck, and instead of lying to myself that it’ll get better and I’ll have fun with this pen…I’m just going to let it fly free.  All have original packaging except for the Jinhao and the Ahab.  The VP has slight discoloration on the nib, need a better photo of that, probably.  I’m happy to get anyone photos of anything in particular they’d like.  I’m just super good at putting things off later, and my potato quality photos above will get this whole train moving.  I also have some samples that didn’t get much use, and if you buy a pen I’ll throw in a sample or three for free (depends on which pen ;)  Those are:  Noodler’s Apache Sunset  Noodler’s Habanero  Diamine Syrah  Diamine Ancient Copper  Diamine Denim  Pelikan Edelstein Tanzanite  Iroshizuku Shin-kai  Iroshizuku Take-sumi  Iroshizuku Kon-peki  Most have had a single ml pulled from them, but every one has enough for a fill or two."

Pen_Swap,3dw67s,vinnycordeiro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:57 2015 UTC,Looks like it
Pen_Swap,3dw67s,Striker6g,-7,Mon Jul 20 07:55:24 2015 UTC,Wow. That's the ugliest pen I've ever seen. Worse than the cap of the Platinum Desk pen.
Pen_Swap,3dw67s,brielem,4,Mon Jul 20 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"It's made for people with arthritis, who have trouble holding slimmer objects. Made to be functional, not to be pretty."

Pen_Swap,3dw4zu,typoglycemia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"Would you mind providing the length of the pen, capped, uncapped, and uncapped and posted?"
Pen_Swap,3dw4zu,Silvire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:59:21 2015 UTC,Capped: 10cm  Uncapped: 9.2 cm  Posted: 12.5 cm  Capped and posted measurements don't include the ring/it's attachment - I stopped at the cap lip.
Pen_Swap,3dwajo,dxing97,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:53 2015 UTC,I have a vp nib in black in broad. Ironically I have it in a rhodium vp (mismatched). I think we might be able to make something happen here.
Pen_Swap,3dwajo,rockydbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:40 2015 UTC,PM sent!

Pen_Swap,3dwajo,markrobbo96,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:00 2015 UTC,The VP nibs are $61+shipping new from goulet btw. Though I know you're preferring trade.
Pen_Swap,3dv0bu,CuSetanta,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Looking to trade this handmade pen for something interesting. Its relatively heavy, with a narrow grip section, but it writes quite well.   Cost me £40, but I am looking for something fun in exchange. Will ship anywhere."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,NeutrinoParkerGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yes please! How about 3 pipettes, 5 big vials and 10 small ones, shipped to the Netherlands via the cheapest shipping option?  I don't know where you got these (lab you work in? Or bought at a lab supplies store?) but I've found 5-10 ml centrifuge tubes to be the perfect size for shipping small quantities of ink. In case you can get your hands on those in the future..."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,brielem,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, PM me with your address, I will give you my paypal, so you can send me 1 euro or something similar :)  I will have a look around the lab to find more tubes."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,ElencherMind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:06 2015 UTC,Misappropriating work supplies? ;P
Pen_Swap,3dqink,markrobbo96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:24:55 2015 UTC,Maybe :) This is a one time thing as these vials are quite old.
Pen_Swap,3dqink,vermilions,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:30:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in the UK, can I take a package? Would be much appreciated, will be handy for transporting a few different inks to university without taking a ton of bottles.  My girlfriend will probably be interested too. Will be happy to throw you some cash to over postage."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,jordanjay29,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, PM me with details! Will probably send the parcel tomorrow or in two days."
