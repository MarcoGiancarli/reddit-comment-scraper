HVAC,3e5f2d,wheels092303,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:41:23 2015 UTC,I hear commercial in general is easier? And no I haven't because I was not aware of such a thing! This is something I will look into for sure but it seems difficult in general to get into commercial work with little to no experience.

HVAC,3e5f2d,usmcadele,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"Commercial/industrial work is not easier, it's much more vast and complex, and tons and tons of different equipment, and no I'm not exaggerating. But with that said, as long as you can carry a toolbag, and get your extension ladder on and off your van, I don't see why you couldn't excel at being a service tech.  Heavy lifting may play a factor one day, but thats what rigging is for. If it's to heavy you should probably have a fellow tech helping anyway."
HVAC,3e54e6,deagle12,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"From what I understand the unit does blows cool air and periodically blows warm.   When the unit is not cooling, go to the outside unit and check to see if the fan and the compressor are running. The compressor will have a lower hum sound and the air coming off the fan should be warmer than ambient temp.  Could be the fan motor or compressor is overheating."
HVAC,3e54e6,Kepone,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks I did this today and felt very warm air but I don't think I heard that ""hum"" or pulsing sound from the compressor"
HVAC,3e54e6,Kepone,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"Another way you could check if the compressor is on is to touch the pipes coming out of the outside unit. The bigger pipe should be cold and smaller should be hot.  If the compressor is on and running, then Is the system a heat pump? If it's a heat pump then there could be something wrong with a circuit board or relay turning on the heat strip during cooling or turning off the outside fan."
HVAC,3e54e6,Swt23,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:59 2015 UTC,Do you have electric heat on the unit? Had a bad thermostat a few months ago kicking the heat strips on during cool some of the time.

HVAC,3e54e6,spilled_soda,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:24:14 2015 UTC,Well from what I know I think they have to check for leaks when refilling freon. But also he checked the level of refrigerant.  Should I mention this?
HVAC,3e54e6,TheMAgdich,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:29:25 2015 UTC,If there is already refrigerant in it then a pressure test wouldn't work unless he would pull all of it out. Just make sure a through leak check is done.
HVAC,3e4e2h,Not_A_Vegetable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:38 2015 UTC,higher humidity means more condensation build up in the drain. on a humid day you can make several quarts of water an hour depending on the unit
HVAC,3e4e2h,terayonjf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"Understood.  So it's entirely possible that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the unit then?    If that's the cause, is there a reason why the unit suddenly started accumulating large amounts of water compared to the prior year?  Thank you."
HVAC,3e4e2h,terayonjf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:01 2015 UTC,well water is a by product of a working system. if it is cooling good and making a lot of water could be just this year is either more humid than last year or its hotter and running longer which will dehumidify more than normal
HVAC,3e4e2h,ttarragon_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"I say that the flinger that flings condensate onto the condenser coil is broken, so all the condensate is going into the bucket.

Almost every institutional site in my corner has them in there.  Great units.  I prefer to see them delivered in one piece as opposed to field assembled.  I hate having to do pressure tests and then tell the mechanical contractor that it's failed again.
HVAC,3e1e7m,CheesyBolt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"You have a dual capacitance capacitor. Replace it.  If you want to confirm before you buy and you have a meter that reads ac amps, put 120 volts across fan and common and read the current through the capacitor. The current will be proportional to the capacitance. A 5 microfarad capacitor will draw 0.45 amps. Do the same test between common and herm. My money is that you will not get correct current draws."
HVAC,3e1e7m,ttarragon_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:21 2015 UTC,"Capacitance = (amps x 2650)/volts  This is actual Back EMF volts as opposed to ""line voltage""  So, a 5 mfd would read ~0.45 amps on a system showing 240 volts across the cap terminals. Which isn't likely. At 120v, the amp reading would be double.  This is why caps are rated at 370v or 440v - not for the line voltage but for the voltage produced by the motor/compressor. A 240v compressor can easily show 300+ volts across your cap terminals."

If you feel confident, pull the disconnect outside by the condenser, open the outer cover and pull out the contactor and replace it or dress the contact points for a temporary fix.  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=a%2Fc+contactor"
HVAC,3dyo3a,ttarragon_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:21 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking/hoping; I just don't have the experience to know that those symptoms point to the contactor. I'll have a look at it when I get home tonight; should be a cheap enough part and easy to replace to just go ahead and do it...
HVAC,3dyo3a,ucakes,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"Use your meter to verify you don't have 24v across the coil on the contactor.  If it has no voltage, but contacts are still made/engaged then replace the contactor.  If it has voltage, the contactor is working as intended and you have another problem."
HVAC,3dyfon,wietoolow,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"Let's see if you have enough tonnage to cool your problem room. Put a thermometer near the floor in the problem room. If you read ~72, then you know that the problem is that the cool air is lying on the floor and sliding down stairs.  You can get that air up where it belongs by replacing your current registers with Coanda Effect registers like are on the links. I built them and they worked in my daughter's split, like yours and in my FL snowbird condo. The cool air will stick to the wall and rise to the ceiling where it disperses  http://i.imgur.com/uJ2Brcm.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/FQfC20P.jpg  You will turn the registers over in the winter to direct the warm air down...or put back the current registers for the winter."

HVAC,3dyfon,ttarragon_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"12 inches sounds about right. I am in NY now, so I can't measure. The limit on the length is aesthetics and the ability to turn them over for the winter. You can make trial registers out of cardboard and tape them to the wall with two sided tape. The tape will leave marks on the wall."
HVAC,3dyfon,ttarragon_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:10 2015 UTC,So just got home and looking at the register in question there is a window above maybe 2 feet above it.  My guess that will affect the effectiveness of this

You could dump all your a/c into the attic and it would still be unbearably hot.   When the weather cools a little, (or you give up on being uncomfortable), turn the a/c off, close the ceiling registers and run the blower to develop maximum pressure and start feeling all that flex duct, especially the ends, and same for the trunk that the flex ducts are attached to.   Take off one flex. If it is filthy inside, you now have a reason to replace it all and you know that the ends will now be made up securely, because you will have done it."
