Juve,3e595l,kermv,6,Wed Jul 22 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"I'm from Venezuela. Football in my county is not really strong (it's getting better though) and I really really loved the sport, I played futsal and football (still play), watched Serie A, EPL, la Liga, UCL games all the time, became addicted to EA's Fifa, etc...   One of the first football matches I ever saw was a Juventus game, I started liking the team, and followed some of the players in the 2002 world cup, which made me a fan of Del Piero... I started watching Juve constantly because of Alex and Gigi, and I've been a fan ever since. I love the club, the players, the directors (the current ones), and the club's philosophy above everything else. I saw Juve for the first time 2 years ago in Miami and met Pirlo and Matri, they signed my jerseys and so did Caceres and Pavel Nedved, best day in my life haha...  I will forever be a tifoso, and I will forever be a Del Piero, Buffon and Nedved fan.   Edit: Serie B shaped me as the loyal fan that I will ever be, and influenced me greatly. I see life differently because of it and how players like Del Piero and Buffon decided to stay mostly because of the love they had for the club. Forza Juve!"
Juve,3e595l,SgtPepe,6,Wed Jul 22 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"Chicago, born and raised. Son of Mexican immigrants. My first football jersey was a juve away from 1999 which I unfortunately can no longer find. I was captivated by a blonde Czech who runs like he just robbed a bank, a bald Frenchman who had a knack for scoring at will inside the box, a short but good looking Italian who had a wicked right foot, a Dutch bulldog with long braids and perhaps the coolest goggles and a young but optimistic goalkeeper who is a great guy and might become a great leader one day, or so I hear.   I knew it was the start of something great and before you know it, a full-fledged romance emerged!   Unico Amore!!!"

I have always been a fan of the Italian national team, and for awhile when I was younger I only paid attention to international matches, but as my love for the game grew I started to pay attention to clubs. Since Buffon was/is my favorite player I was naturally drawn to Juventus. And that is how I became a fan of Juventus."

I became a Juve fan because in 2004 (when I was just 7) my cousin gave me a Del Piero jersey. I thought it was a referee jersey because of the black and white stripes. But later that day my dad and I looked him up and I found out that he played for Italy and Juventus. He immediately became my favorite player and why not become a fan of your favorite players team and I did so. I think I have the jersey still somewhere in my house. Gonna have to look for it when I get home next week."
Juve,3e595l,giono13,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"Born in Glasgow, Scotland I supported Celtic since birth until I moved to Italy for a while, I visted Alpi, back around 2004 with my brothers and my father, since then I have liked Italian football much more than Scottish, English etc. The art of defending is unparalleled in Italy.   I followed Juve when I got back to Scotland, I continued to watch Celtic weekly, and often catching glimpses of Juve, as we didn't have the channel that hosted it, and often due to the time period streams were very, very poor or non-existent. But it came through, it was a really bad winter, alot of snow, so we bought sky and another sporting channel that hosted about 4 out of 5 Juve games, it fed my addiction.  I returned to J stadium on holiday, best experience of my life, it was amazing, very newly built, I think it was about 3 months after the first home game was played in the stadium. I saw Milan, and ADP. Oh my god, he made it, Gigi too, it was like a movie, I decided at that moment to commit entirely to Juventus.   I went home, I already had a fairly big collection of scarves and jerseys, I promised myself to increase its size each year, at two points, the begging of the season and at Christmas. It got bigger and bigger now I sit around 60 juve jerseys, about 40 variations home, away and alternative kits, other memorabilia too such as 2 Gigi signed armbands etc.   I love this club.  I have been on reddit for around 2 years, originally due to one of my friends showing me stuff on the front page, it took my interest. After browsing I saw a post on /r/soccer it was about Inter, it then clicked, I typed Juventus, nothing. Then, Juve. Bingo, I had an account then, but I just floated around, never subscribed to any sub, I then lost the account as I'm a fucking idiot and couldn't remember my email... So I was accountless for a while just browsing on my phone without one, I made this account about 6 months ago, subbed for the first time and now we're here! I'm pretty happy with my 100 link karma and 1000 comment karma, got it the day of Real vs. Juve. Which was even better! The majority of that karma has came from this sub, so thank you friends, thank you for these internet points! I have a competition with a friend to see who has the most by the end of this year; help me out eh? :P jk.   From a post just before the final. Thought I would X post.  Edit: Alot of US fans. Haven't seen any Scottish turn up yet :( cmon someone surprise me!!"
Juve,3e595l,Marko_Lamont,2,Wed Jul 22 06:38:49 2015 UTC,"I was born and raised in Singapore (a country way east of you guys). Southeast Asia.   I started watching soccer in 94 and my favourite country was Italy (Singapore won't make it there) so I started supporting them from the group stages.  The newspaper did an article on Roberto Baggio and I thought he's really cool with the ponytail and all that. So he became my first ever favourite player and since he plays for Juventus, I naturally supported Juventus.   He left the following season, and I stayed on to support Juve, with players like ADP, Ravanelli, Zidane, Buffon, Ibrahimovic, Cannavaro, etc.   Have supported Juventus for 21 years, last year they came Singapore but I broke my ankle and I couldn't go watch the match. Was really sad but I'll be there in Turin one day watching a proper game and singing along with the lads.   Singapore doesn't have much of Juventus merchandise, hard to catch a match of Juventus too. So I go juve store to see what merchandise they have and come to the Reddit for the tidbits of news I can get.   Great team and I don't see myself supporting another team over Juventus.

As a little kid, soccer was a big part of my life - playing almost daily, during recess, after school, on the weekends on any type of ground that was available. But I didn't have a favorite team. I was 9 years old, when I watched the '94 WC final, Italy vs Brazil. I found myself rooting for Azzuri, can't remember exactly why. The match came down to penalties. Italy lost, when Roberto Baggio missed over the crossbar. I felt really sad for him. I found out that he also played for Juventus, and I started following the team. I noticed Juve because of Baggio, but I fell in love with the team because of Del Piero. Baggio left after '95, but I remained a Juventino. 20 years now.   Forza Juve!"

That was the first time I got into football, because it's all about basketball here in the Philippines.   Anyway I was playing some random team in Career mode (Udinese because I liked the name) and occasionally faced another team wearing black and white stripes. The guy with long blond hair in that team and the tall bald striker really pissed me off back then lol.  Later I started reading about some Juventus history and that was it."

Juve,3e3xkf,droidonomy,4,Wed Jul 22 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"Marchisio is definitely going to be taking corners I'd imagine.   Long freekicks are going to be Marchisio because he delivers into the box well.  Dybala, and maybe Draxler or Pogba will be taking free kicks if Draxler joins.   Penalties will be Mandzukic and Pogba I'd imagine."
Juve,3e3xkf,Killagina,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"Mandzukic was Atletico's PK taker last year. Dybala also takes PKs well, so does Pogba and Marchisio. We have a ton of options there. I do not think Morata will be the penalty taker - it will either be Mandzukic or Marchisio IMO. Corners will be taken by Marchisio or Dybala. They both can take solid corners. Long free kicks by Bonucci or Marchisio, and short free kicks by Dybala most probably. Of course, if Draxler joins, this might change a bit."
Juve,3e3xkf,aakashd93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say one of our fullbacks will probably take the corners, Dybala could definitely take our freekicks and I'd bet one of strikers, probably Morata will be the penalty taker.   It definitely won't be as certain as the situation with Pirlo and Vidal."
Juve,3e3xkf,alpha1028,0,Tue Jul 21 20:02:19 2015 UTC,Marchisio/Evra for corners  Dybala for short FK'S  Pogba for long FK'S (On goal)  Marchisio for free kicks that are placed into the box (from unscoreable angles)  Pogba for pens.

Juve,3e3lmi,JuveSoCal__S,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think Mnadzukic was the wrong buy (although I could be wrong). If we needed a replacement for Tevez we should have gotten Bacca or someone else who is a proven goal scorer. I want to see Dybala and Morata upfront. This is a good idea because it will form a partnership at the early stages of both their careers, so we could have this partnership for a while. It could be another Del Piero/Trez situation, best case scenario of course. Mandzukic could be good in a 3-5-2, however. In the 3-5-2 we put in a lot of crosses into the box. Since Mandzukic is tall af he could prove to be a wild card. I want to see Draxler or Gotze in a Juve shirt next season as well. Both can play behind the strikers and can also play as wingers. Dybala and Draxler/Gotze on the wing with Morata in the middle can be a deadly trio. Llorente needs to leave because we have 3 CFs. When Berardi comes in next season (hopefully) then we will be set for attack. Midfield is troubling atm though. Vidal leaving is a HUGE loss. Unless we get Verratti I dont really see us having that great of a midfield in the future. Verratti should be our prime target for next season. With Marchisio and Pogba, Verratti can shine."

Juve,3e3lmi,charizard77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:17 2015 UTC,Pogba isn't a #10 nor would he be played there. Too good in the midfield. Dybala can play a #10 but he isn't preferred there.
Juve,3e3lmi,Killagina,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah Pogba is a big help in the middle and we would definitely be down a player in that position if he played #10, but I think he could be successful there. Big physical presence combined with his great ball control and ability to score goals, could be like Zidane 2.0  That being said I know it won't happen, we have shown too much interest in other 10s like Gotze, Draxler and De Bruyne so I highly doubt Pogba will ever play there for us. Still, I think it could work if we kept Vidal and maybe had an additional centre mid"

We come from 4 incredible years, but you can't keep that going for too much. Hell, i thought this team was done last year when i saw Allegri, and this year it's been a transition, a wonderful one, but still Conte's legacy was there. Allegri showed lots of skills, adapting that team to his idea, but now it's his time and i trust him."
Juve,3dzw3v,zeshie,2,Tue Jul 21 11:36:38 2015 UTC,This crazy mercato will just make it all the better when we have another strong season despite the changes.
Juve,3dzw3v,_Titty_Sprinkles_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is that last years Juve team wasn't going to make the Champions League final again this year anyways. We squeezed 110% out of our roster last year and we nearly achieved our dream. Especially when it comes to the whole Vidal thing, this guy played under Conte for three years who worked him hard and I honestly think we got the best out of him. Arturo was all over the pitch hustling his ass off for us during these last four years so maybe this is the start of his decline, but either way I can understand why management would sell him (see more)... I am still pissed about the price and this recent revelation that he asked to leave. Even if this is the beginning of a new era though, I still think we'll have no trouble winning the league and at least reaching the quarter finals of the Champions League."
Juve,3dzw3v,mucco,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:58 2015 UTC,"No way Vidal will be declining, I think his next season might be his best ever, and he'll be at peak until the next World Cup in my opinion.  But it's okay."
Juve,3dzw3v,_Titty_Sprinkles_,3,Tue Jul 21 02:15:18 2015 UTC,"I think he's got a couple prime years left, but I have a feeling that when its all over people will look back on his career and say that he was at his best with Juve."
Juve,3dzw3v,patiperro_v2,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. He was running like a 20 year old during Copa America.
Juve,3dzw3v,lightoasis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:11 2015 UTC,Is there any reason he would want to leave besides a larger wage? I don't know of any issues he had with management. Or maybe Juve was always a temporary stop for him.
Juve,3dzw3v,_Titty_Sprinkles_,4,Tue Jul 21 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"What Marotta said today was ""Vidal ha espresso la voglia di vivere un'esperienza diversa"", translated, he expressed his desire for a different experience. People say things, who knows the real reason. One thing I will say is that Juve was definitely not just a planned pitstop for him, he loves this team, that I know. May not necessarily mean much, but he has chosen to cover part of his body with Juve tattoos (here's one photo)."
Juve,3dzw3v,patiperro_v2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, he always said great things about Juve in Chile. Not sure he would have minded too much if he had stayed in Juve forever. My guess is his manager has been working the ""different experience"" angle for a couple of years now and Vidal finally caved in to the Bayern offer. It was always going to be Real or Bayern."
Juve,3dzw3v,input1112,0,Tue Jul 21 12:45:13 2015 UTC,"Tbh I didn't have much faith in Vidal ending his career with us after last summer. Rumors of his move to Man Utd were all over the place and he never denied them, not even with a tweet (maybe he did towards the end). It seemed like he wasn't so sure about staying.   Anyway, I agree with what you said. We really got the best out of him. I personally think he already started declining. He's still a top player but his last season wasn't his best. A new challenge might give him a push to reach his true form, but I doubt that Bayren's Vidal will be better than Juve's Vidal. I'm grateful for his time with us and respect his decision to leave, but that price tag was disappointing."
Juve,3e0rm0,droidonomy,8,Tue Jul 21 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"allegri was always a good manager, especially on match days. The poor guy got knocked out of CL with Milan by Barca every year Barca went on to win it. Its funny how everyone was blaming him for Milans collapse when the management was replacing Ibra with Pazzini and Thiago Silva with Mexes. Milan lost its key players and replaced them with average ones, however look how well Juve have backed him up.   Allegri for me is a perfect coach for Juve without a doubt as his direct approach and well organised defence will surely win him the CL one day. Look at the Real Madrid game (away) , where Juve defending all first half and then came out of the second grabbed a goal and shocked Real. The same thing nearly happened when we versed Barca when it was 1-1 after 60 minutes. Allegri is an example of how Italian teams should be aiming to play, direct, combact defensively and efficent going foward. With the right backing and the desire to hold key players while reshuffling the team in certain areas and bringing Italian Youth Juve could remain in Europes Top 4 for a while. And I beleive Agneilli family is doing exactly that (Rugani, Cerri, Berardi, Zaza) they are constructing a team with 4-5 key Italian players and building around that! and BRAVO, this has always been the case with successful Italian teams just look at Milan 07 (Nesta, Maldini, Gattuso, Pirlo ) and then having expectional foreign players like Kaka, Seedorf, Crespo etc etc."
Juve,3e0rm0,vin_mac18,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:30 2015 UTC,I'm excited as well.  Allegri played a 4-3-1-2/diamond 4-4-2 with a squad built for 3-5-2.  Now he can have the proper disposal of players
Juve,3e0rm0,biggerleaffan,3,Tue Jul 21 11:45:48 2015 UTC,"we did see Allegri's Juve, and it was better than Conte's. He changed the formation, the playing style and had a few new players like evra, morata and pereyra.  Conte didnt have much to do with our CL final appearance."
Juve,3e0rm0,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:17 2015 UTC,Aren't most of our signings made by the management?
Juve,3e0rm0,input1112,2,Tue Jul 21 06:46:57 2015 UTC,yes and no;  allegri requests players (such as him asking for a play maker) and then the management goes out and finds the best options..  I am sure they take his opinion into consideration when they decide who to sign.  It's not like they just sign a player and tell Allegri to deal with it :)
Juve,3e0rm0,m309,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"i don't agree. we saw allegri's juve when he turned to 4-4-2 diamond, now we will see his ability to adapt to the departures."
Juve,3e0rm0,man_overb0ard,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:20 2015 UTC,"Right, but that was Allegri's system, not his squad.  What I'm saying is that I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when both the system and squad are of Allegri's design."

The best deal you can get for juvestore.com is free international shipping on special days; but he price stays the same until the jerseys are obsolete and they need to get rid of them to make space for the new ones. So if you need to buy a jersey below the normal price, you could buy a fake or buy it in a year from now."
Juve,3e0olt,eamesa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:24 2015 UTC,Juvestore offers discounts to shipping and/or personalization when we win some games. For example if we win super coppa on aug. 7 we'll get one of those. I am waiting until then to buy mine.
Juve,3e0olt,Davidgzb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:32 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% certain they ship internationally but uksoccershop.com had 10% off last weekend/early this week. It may have ended by now though they have sales fairly often from what I've seen.

Juve,3dz05f,Killagina,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"But we could have gotten someone better, wouldn't you agree?"
Juve,3dz05f,maczirarg,3,Tue Jul 21 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"No. There was no point for signing a quality 5th option. We only pla, yed 2 up front that season anyways. We already had Quag, Matri, Vucinic, and Giovinco."
Juve,3dz05f,Killagina,0,Tue Jul 21 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"Even for a 5th striker, you should agree that we could have found a better alternative than that."
Juve,3dz05f,maczirarg,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:49 2015 UTC,No I wouldnt. It was be totally unnecessary. He never played because we never got to a point where we needed the 5th striker
Juve,3dz05f,Killagina,0,Tue Jul 21 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"You never know when someone is going to get injured or something, and it's better to be prepared for that than not. But having that kind of player is useless. I'd rather rely on a youngster from the youth team."
Juve,3dz05f,maczirarg,0,Tue Jul 21 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yup. I wouldn't worry to much about Vidal, he wasn't the heart of our team (under Allegri), his role can be filled. Losing Vidal means that there will be less chance of losing Pogba anytime soon.   He's 28. We're trying to lower the average age, he was very poor in the CL final, he will never be the same pre-injury Vidal and to be honest, he was a bit of a dick.   Good luck to him and thanks for your time, but Ciao."
Juve,3dz05f,Marko_Lamont,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"well he used to be the heart of our team under Conte, but last year we dealt with the fact that he was injured/out of form and moved on.

Juve,3dy7oh,farhadJuve,12,Mon Jul 20 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Please, before all the ""hate""... just have hope and trust. We were in Serie B and we have come back. Stronger than ever. Vidal is in his prime, but money is needed too. In 2 years his legs wont be the same, and all his quality is in his strength. Its the right time, we need change, we need new faces. Last year time wasn't enough to win against Barça, and if we dont add new and young faces, it won't be ever! We are rebuilding smartly, because there is still Buffon, Marchisio, Liech, Evra, Khedira and others to guide the youngs, but they have a lot of desire. So, even if this season is not so good... with the buy of Berardi next summer in our minds, the future looks bright indeed. And trading Vidal for a future left back or attacking midfield doesn't look so bad!  So have hope, because if there's any team that can go to hell and come back stronger than ever, it's us! Forza Juve <3"
Juve,3dy7oh,Pedro_Matos,4,Mon Jul 20 14:54:21 2015 UTC,Grazie Arturo.

So long Arturo.....i will miss u and you had Juve DNA which we can never forget."

Juve,3dy7oh,adityaseth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Resale value, man. Benteke and Sterling are much younger than Vidal and don't have big knee injury in their history. Luiz was ridiculous transfer and it's not realistic to reference it.  Vidal will never be worth more than 40m for the rest of his career. Marotta got a decent price considering Vidal's age, injuries, and recent behavior. Vidal also asked to leave for Bayern so Marotta has no leverage."
Juve,3dy7oh,yimrsg,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"Vidal's injury really wasn't that bad, it only required keyhole surgery. The issue was that he had to play the WC right after the surgery, which compounded the problem. Apart from this one thing, he's hardly been injured for us."
Juve,3dy7oh,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"None of Liverpool, City or PSG need him though. Liverpool needed a striker who'll work in the prem, City want to increase their home grown contingent and PSG need a backup midfielder and are looking at Di Maria also.

Juve,3dy7oh,Super_Sic58,2,Mon Jul 20 23:42:25 2015 UTC,Why would he want to go there though? In fairness to Arsenal they've improved their squad in those 3 years but they've not been title contenders. They're being linked with Benzema and other strikers and midfielders were never an issue with them.  They've an abundance of midfielders vying for a few spots and you've got to remember that Arsene passed up on Fabregas so to expect him to turn his attention to Vidal and pay 50m is completely unrealistic.

Not all players nowadays are truly committed to the one club for 10+ years mentality. We can be thankful we got vidal in his best years and left it all on the pitch each and every game.

Juve,3dy7oh,zeshie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:52 2015 UTC,Don't think he's just entering his prime. This IS his prime. Plus his injury plagued season and off pitch issues surely factored into depreciating his value. It sucks but it is what it is. I'm choosing to be excited about how we're getting younger overall and hopefully on our way to becoming a legitimate powerhouse in Europe again.

Juve,3dzh6j,man_overb0ard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"less rotation in middle of the park with khedira, marchisio, pogba and pereyra as starters. maybe more injuries, sturaro will play his role aswell as i predict that khedira will take an muscle injury in the first part of the season. mandzukic our top scorer with 20 goals, morata with 10-15 goals and dybala with less than 10, coming us a sub for the major part of the season. barzagli playing a lot less, neto playing as good as buffon in coppa. serie a champions, inter runner-up. coppa italia finalist, ucl last 16 (terrible draw)."
Juve,3dzh6j,daddytorgo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:59 2015 UTC,We spent $32m on Dybala already - he's not going to be a sub.

Juve,3dzh6j,daddytorgo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:50 2015 UTC,Oh of course they will - obviously. But you don't sign someone for that kind of $$ with the expectation that they won't perform to a starter-level quickly.

Juve,3dy0iy,Kegos,3,Mon Jul 20 13:40:22 2015 UTC,I'm just glad that I didn't go to the Revolution-NYCFC game this weekend hoping that he would be in attendance (he's not slated to join the team till like tomorrow I think).   I'll go next year with all my Juve kit and get a great seat by the NYCFC bench :)

Juve,3dvg06,Super_Sic58,10,Sun Jul 19 21:22:24 2015 UTC,In a sense I'm kinda meh on all the mercato talk but it is nice for Juventus to be the frequent talk of the transfer window. The Pogba and Vidal rumors have died down in the last few days and were being linked with 3 fantastic players.   If worst comes to worst there's no deal and we get to keep Vidal and make a push for both Draxler and Sandro. It seems that the whole Vidal situation has sparked the clubs interest for both players and at this point it would be idiotic for Beppe to not pursue them after lining them up for potential moves.
Juve,3dvg06,Elchidote,7,Sun Jul 19 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think if we keep Vidal, get Draxler and Sandro, that is definitely not the worst scenario. I'll think that's a great scenario to be honest. Haha."
Juve,3dvg06,Artist17,4,Mon Jul 20 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"replacing Vidal is like replacing 2 players. He plays both defense and offense. So not only we sold him for cheap but now we have to get 2 players to equal him.  with only 40 mil its likely we wont do that. none of our mids are like vidal; khedira, sturaro, asamoah, pereyra. only marchisio and pogba. if sturaro pans out that would be ideal but we dont know that.  No matter how i look at this deal it doesnt make sense to me.  i really hope it either doesnt happen or we get something more out of it than a stupid 40 mil"
Juve,3dvg06,JuveSoCal__S,4,Mon Jul 20 02:38:00 2015 UTC,How about Goetze + $10mil?   Would that be a fucking steal? :)
Juve,3dvg06,daddytorgo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:27 2015 UTC,us paying 10 mil or bayern? lol
Juve,3dvg06,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:09:40 2015 UTC,"Bayern.   If we pay $30m for Goetze over 2 years, and they pay $40m for Vidal up front...I'd say that's a great deal."
Juve,3dvg06,daddytorgo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:30:08 2015 UTC,yea thats not gonna happen. Gotze is 22/23 and very promising. they're not gonna just give him away that cheap.
Juve,3dvg06,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"That's the number I've read, loan with an option to buy in 2 installments totaling 30m"
Juve,3dvg06,daddytorgo,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"c'mon man, vidal is absolutely strong and   one of the best midfielder in the world, but he is 28, he had a bad season , problems with his knee, and the crash before the cup surely didn't increase his price, I think 40 million is the best we can have."
Juve,3dvg06,4lxp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:38:25 2015 UTC,"bad season? he played in CL final and u guys forget his nice goals and his defensive work against madrid especially. he saved us from some 100% goals as well, and all of this while playing trequartista.  his bad knee is something people keep mentioning but he still plays 100% all the time, so where is the bad knee?  zidane was 29 and we sold him for twice that over a decade ago"
Juve,3dvg06,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"not a bad season in general, a bad season if we see what he did in the past seasons.  Zidane was sold for twice that, but a part from the fact that an attacker usually costs more than a midfielder, we are talking about zidane, one of the best player ever.  And the most important thing is that vidal contract will be over in 2017, if he had a contract until 2019, it will be cost a little bit more."
Juve,3dvg06,4lxp,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:10 2015 UTC,Its the most plausible explanation for Marotta being in Germany.
Juve,3dvg06,jakesonwu,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"It does sort of feel like that, yes."
Juve,3dvg06,daddytorgo,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"*Juventus have reportedly agreed personal terms with Bayern Munich’s Mario Gotze and now must convince the German champions.   La Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that Bianconeri Director General Giuseppe Marotta met with the player’s representatives last night and presented them with an offer.  This is believed to be for a five-year deal worth €6m per season plus bonuses and the Old Lady are reportedly keen to finalise a move quickly in order to avoid competition from Spanish and English clubs.  Gotze had hinted that he may be open to a move on Saturday, when he said Juventus are a ‘big, big club’ and that ‘playing abroad might be good.’  Arturo Vidal is believed to be close to a move to Bavaria, and reports suggest that Juve could bring Gotze the other way on a two-year loan deal with the obligation to buy for €30m.*"
Juve,3dvg06,daddytorgo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:39 2015 UTC,I still have hopes Vidal's move to Bayern will be torpedoed by a last minute disagreement.
Juve,3dvg06,patiperro_v2,3,Mon Jul 20 08:18:37 2015 UTC,"I kinda get that feeling too, but you bring up a more interesting talking point which is the kind of deal we'll offer Gotze. I'm totally fine with a loan deal with option to buy, but I'll be seriously pissed if we do the same kind of deal we did with Morata. I'll tell you why... So they say Gotze and Pep don't click, well Pep is leaving to Man City in 2016 right? Well keeping that in mind, if they have the option for buy back, doesn't it kind of seem like Bayern are just using us to get Gotze back in form? He'll play a season here since he's out of favor with Pep and once Pep is gone they'll buy him back and we'll be left wondering why the fuck we sold Vidal for ~40M just to have Bieber on loan for a year...   I just hope Marotta knows what he's doing."
Juve,3dvg06,_Titty_Sprinkles_,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, the Morata kind of deal doesn't sound really good for Juventus but I guess that's also why clubs will be willing to part with their brightest stars because they don't think they'll lose out in the long term.   That being said, perhaps what Marotta is trying to achieve us to get Morata to sign another deal while he's here to negate the clause (not sure if it works), but apparently Morata is able to reject the buyback if he wants to stay with juve right? (Again I'm not sure but thought I read it somewhere)"
Juve,3dvg06,Artist17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, Morata can definitely reject the buyback. I suppose it would be the same deal with Gotze."
Juve,3dvg06,_Titty_Sprinkles_,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"So maybe the idea is to get them here, convince them here is where they can grow, and here is where they will start instead of being a sub, be a star and the possibility of being a Juventus Legend.   The pay package and the reputation of the rival club (in this case Real) might play a part in them going back as well, but we have 2 years to ""brainwash"" or convince them this is the place to stay hahah."
Juve,3dvg06,Artist17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Bayern fan here. Götze said that he has no intention to leave, according to sz (usually very reliable). Also pep seems to be pro Götze. So probably unlikely.   Not sure about the vidal transfer though. The rumours seemed to die down."

Juve,3dtgzf,OxyFlemme,15,Sun Jul 19 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"He could potentially be the most technically and creatively gifted forward that Juve has had since Del Piero in his prime, but the problem lies in how he would fit into the team. Juve prioritizes pressing, discipline, and intensity over pure finesse, which is the type of player Gotze is. He could provide a nice finesse balance to a team built on grinta OR he could look incredibly out of place. Hard to tell really, as he would be a very expensive risk."
Juve,3dtgzf,dc10101,6,Sun Jul 19 10:48:53 2015 UTC,"you are forgetting Dybala my friend :) I actually think that Dybala is gona be as good as Gotze when he's 23 if not better  Also, I think that Gotze will do great because Allegri is known for giving the players the freedom the want on the pitch (unlike Conte)"
Juve,3dtgzf,m309,8,Sun Jul 19 10:53:48 2015 UTC,I actually think that Dybala is gona be as good as Gotze when he's 23 if not better   I like your optimism. Seems to be sorely lacking around here lately.

Juve,3dtgzf,eleytheria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's this that I'm worried about, if he'll fit in Juve's playstyle or not. If yes then we'll be one of the best team in the world for years to come and if not then it would have been an expensive flop."
Juve,3dtgzf,DrRinaldi,4,Sun Jul 19 12:22:05 2015 UTC,"Just wasted a good hour on Gotze highlights. My conclusions: he is much stronger on the ball than I had originally thought. He's a finesse player for sure, but I think he's tough enough to play for Juve and to excel in Serie A. I have seen others comment about how he lacks grinta and so on... I think those opinions are misguided based on his highlights from Bundesliga."
Juve,3dtgzf,hoegdall,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"Götze has the potential to be one of the best players in the world, and I think Juve would be a perfect club for him to develop. But he is gonna be expensive as hell."
Juve,3dtgzf,Sergiokun,2,Sun Jul 19 08:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is a true CAM which we need"
Juve,3dtgzf,Kegos,2,Sun Jul 19 10:08:32 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about the starting line up for next season, and the thought came to me, signing Gotze would give us even more flexibility with out formations, such that we might be able to deploy an effective 4-2-3-1.  How I see it:  Buffon - Lich - Leo - Georgio - Evra - Marchisio - Pogba - Dybala - Gotze - Pereyra - Mario  Of course we'd have backups for the Midfield two with Khedira and Sturaro. Zaza, Morata and Mario of course would be competing for that starting striker spot. The three behind the strikers is where we might lack depth however, only Coman might be effective in those positions, but the three starters, Dybala - Gotze - Pereyra, would be able to rotate in and out of each other very effectively during the game and cause big problems for opposition defenses.  Just a thought of course, and all dependant on whether or not we succeed in getting Gotze."
Juve,3dtgzf,zeshie,0,Sun Jul 19 17:01:51 2015 UTC,I don't think we will play anything but 4-3-1-2 or maybe a 4-3-3. Gotze- Pereyra-Dybala would also leave us pretty weak in midfield and a defensive midfield pairing of Marchisio and Pogba probably wouldn't be using them effectively. I think we will see a midfield trio of Khedira/Sturaro-Marchisio-Pogba
Juve,3dtgzf,Kegos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:53:03 2015 UTC,You're right that I may leave us a bit more vulnerable defensively but I think against some weaker opposition in seria a it might be a risk worth taking so that we might be set up better to dominate throughout the game.
Juve,3dtgzf,Artist17,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"I love 4-2-3-1 and I'm sure Pogba, Morata and Coman can play where the 3 is when required, so this might actually work!  We have lots of talented midfielders, and putting 5 on is no problem hahaha."
Juve,3dtgzf,nryan8989,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:19:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but I doubt we'll get him
Juve,3dtgzf,asinineanteater,0,Sun Jul 19 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would rather have Draxler. He's almost guaranteed cheaper than Götze, he has potential, and he's also a no. 10. The only bad thing about him is that injury, so it might be a bit of a gamble. However, the potential reward outweighs the risk and cost IMO."
Juve,3dtgzf,daddytorgo,4,Sun Jul 19 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"Potential is great, but it all depends on where your team is at and what you need. Do we need another ""high potential"" player in the #10 role, or would it be better to have someone who has realized more of their potential and is playing at a higher level right now in order to help the players we put around them develop themselves?"
Juve,3dtgzf,asinineanteater,2,Sun Jul 19 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point, but I think that there is a certain amount of risk in bringing Götze in. If his attitude is wrong, he will underperform. He has shown inconsistency in many areas. Also, if he is brought in, will he not take time away from certain players (i.e. Pereyra, Dybala) who are also young? However, bringing in a different player in on lower wages, for cheaper, with a similar ceiling, is worth a season or two's wait IMO. I'm confident in our forward signings, and our midfield and defence, even without Vidal, are very strong. However, I trust the management. They sure as hell know better than I do."
Juve,3dtgzf,Killagina,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"Where has he shown inconsistency? I've yet to see it. He went from a guaranteed starter to someone who comes off the bench a lot in Peps system, and he has had a great attitude.   He is a great scorer, creator, and his defensive contribution isn't amazing, but he does more than a lot of #10s. He isn't lazy like some people try to imply.   Personally I think he would be great. That is the kind of player that pushes us to the next level."
Juve,3dtgzf,asinineanteater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. You probably know more than I. I just think that if he's bought, great, I'm sure he's good, if not, I won't be too disappointed. I just hope we get Draxler."
Juve,3dtgzf,daddytorgo,2,Sun Jul 19 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think Goetze would be competing for time with Dybala, and I guess I'm not as sold on Pereyra as others here are. I'd take Goetze over Pereyra (assuming equal effort) any day of the week."
Juve,3dtgzf,asinineanteater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"I thought Dybala would get time behind the strikers, when we have Morate, Mandzu, and Zaza up top. To be clear, I thought he'd also play up top, but that he could/would be played as a no. 10. I also think that whenever Pereyra came on last year, he did well to create chances, and that if he works on his finishing he will be, if not world class, pretty damn good. He's 24, there is still time for him to develop. I know Götze is younger and better, but I guess his wages and the agile Dortmund thing sour me to him a bit. That said, I think that Götze can succeed at Juve."
Juve,3dtgzf,daddytorgo,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I can see Dybala getting some time as like the 2nd option #10 if we bring in a Goetze-level player, but I think playing 2 of Mandzu/Morata/Zaza up front doesn't give you enough movement/creative force up top. I'd rather see two ""creative players"" in the ""attacking three"" to help increase the # of chances we create.   But I think in some circumstances it'll make sense to play 2 of the ""No 9's"" together."
Juve,3dtgzf,asinineanteater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"I also tend to see Morata as a hybrid striker; he's big and physical, but also deceptively quick and fairly technical. Playing someone him to run the channels alongside Manzu as a more ""pure 9"" with Dybala in behind would make sense to me. But I see your point with playing Dybala up top. Honestly I just want this to be over with us having a good fullback and no. 10. It's bad for my nerves."
Juve,3dtgzf,daddytorgo,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:54 2015 UTC,Yeah - I think Morata could be a bit of a hybrid too.
Juve,3dtgzf,tigull,-5,Mon Jul 20 00:45:18 2015 UTC,No. I think he's overrated and will never be any better or more influential to his team than - let's say - a Juan Mata. I'm not saying he's not good but he's not worth changing our playstyle for.
Juve,3dtgzf,Killagina,4,Sun Jul 19 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"Gotze is already better than Juan Mata. You don't want Gotze if you don't think he is great. One of the few players who is influential wherever you put him. Great coming off the bench, great out left, great up front, and great behind the strikers.  He has unbelievable balance, great positioning, and is one of the best players in the world when it comes to playing in tight spaces. Draws a tremendous amount of fouls, and scores and assists a lot of goals.  Calling him overrated is honestly ridiculous. Anyone who says that hasn't watched him. I think Berardi or Dybala could potentially reach that level, but I also rate them both extremely high and think they could be world beaters. Gotze is already a world beater."

Juve,3dtgzf,SgtPepe,0,Sun Jul 19 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"What about being one of the most important players in the dortmund team that reached the CL final and won the league title two times against bayern?

Juve,3dtgzf,tigull,0,Sun Jul 19 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"He was awesome then and in no way I mean not to acknowledge his outstanding qualities and talent. It's just that the enormous potential he showed hasn't really translated into his game, he hasn't developed the way players like Hazard or Neymar have. The fact that Pep isn't playing him much to me is a further sign that when talking about world beaters he just doesn't make the cut."
Juve,3ds0kr,khdbdcm,4,Sat Jul 18 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it the more it seems to me that this Vidal deal would include some sort of price, option or clause favorable to us on Götze. Worst case scenario is that there's no deal and we keep Vidal and give a look into that Draxler kid. Unless Andrea is pressing for a fast sale, which I doubt,  I don't think that Marotta is stupid enough to just sell Vidal for that kind of money and not take advantage of Bayern in some way.   It's actually quite entertaining thinking on how all this may unfold for both ends and this deal might be the deal that truly establishes Marotta as a bargaining genius."
Juve,3ds0kr,Elchidote,3,Sun Jul 19 02:32:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see it happening. If Goetze gets on the market, a lot of wealthier clubs will jump on him. But still let's wait and see.  Draxler is much more realistic option and I would be thrilled if he joins us this summer. That kid is fantastic player!"
Juve,3ds0kr,renopeno,3,Sat Jul 18 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think if we get Goetze, it'll be part of the Vidal deal. Don't worry about wealthier teams."
Juve,3ds0kr,input1112,6,Sun Jul 19 02:10:35 2015 UTC,This excites me. Goetze and Sandro would be incredible signings. It surprises me people don't want Goetze.
Juve,3ds0kr,Killagina,4,Sat Jul 18 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure what to think about Gotze, he has been a brilliant player but I wonder how much his time at Bayern has done to him? And I'm not sure he fits the mold of a Juve player, but I'll admit  I though the same of Tevez.   Alex Sandro is someone I've wanted to sign for a long time, I certainly hope that goes through.   I don't like all the movement though, too many players in and out in one summer, it reminds me of when Napoli replaced basically their entire team and went from a Scudetto challenger to midtable mediocrity despite supposedly getting much better on paper. These frenzies are more for clubs like Inter and Roma"
Juve,3ds0kr,alpha1028,5,Sun Jul 19 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"He doesn't fit the mold, but maybe that is fine. Gotze can play out right, in the middle, up front, or even could be a proper midfielder. Remember at Dortmund he would occasionally play as a DM during the 1st season.   He is one of the best #10s in the world right now. Great at goal scoring and creating. Sometimes doesn't influence himself as much on games as he should, but that will come. He is a great goal scorer and that is super important. Incredibly good in tight situations, great dribbler, and strong on the ball. He suits Serie A nicely.   Yeah. A lot of movement I agree. Essentially have a completely new set of forwards. Dybala, Zaza, Mandzukic, are all new, and hopefully Draxler or Gotze become new forwards for us as well. Only one with any experience at Juve is Morata and he is just 22.   With that said most this movement is in one department which is good. We added a great character in Khedira which will help, and if we only add 2 players (Rugani and Sandro) in defense, I think we should be fine.   It is definitely a transition phase, but man does it give us a lot of potential. Berardi, Gotze, Dybala, Morata, and Zaza upfront is ridiculous in terms of talent.   Something like   Dybala -- Morata/Zaza     Gotze    or   Dybala -- Morata/Zaza -- Berardi   So many great options for the future."
Juve,3ds0kr,Killagina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"I reacted quite hysterically to the news of Vidal's departure, but let's take a step back... This kind of team rebuilding is kind of Juve's tradition and we went through those cycles a number of times. The club is much larger than any of the players and I'm sure we all know that. Right now I would be very happy if Goetze would join Juventus. Honestly, I'd forget about Vidal as I've forgotten Zidane (by that I mean forgetting but still embracing what they did in black and white) especially if we'd sign Sandro as a bonus. What I'm trying to say is lets trust Marotta and judge him after his full job is done. I think he earned it."
Juve,3ds0kr,JoseArcadioMorales,2,Sun Jul 19 00:23:00 2015 UTC,If we get Goetze and Sandro this will be an incredible transfer window.
Juve,3ds0kr,Killagina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Losing Vidal sucks, but those two guys would be amazing gets."
Juve,3ds0kr,nTsplnk,3,Sun Jul 19 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"Well, everytime he looses the ball, he stares at the ground instead of running. Probably not the Juve mentality. He thinks that he is a ""vedeta"" just because he scored that goal against Argentina.  He is not a hard worker player, he just likes to be the star."
Juve,3ds0kr,Pedro_Matos,2,Sat Jul 18 23:40:50 2015 UTC,"He is one of the best attacking players in the world. Plays multiple positions, and is a proven goal scorer. I don't care about his attitude, he is great."
Juve,3ds0kr,Killagina,5,Sun Jul 19 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"Tevez had a horrible attitude before coming to Juve, and I don't know what it is about this club, the team, or the people who surround them (nedved, allegri, pararici, nedved)... But for some reason players seem to change their attitude when they play for us. If that happens to be the case with Gotze then he could become the best center attacking midfielder of this generation. I'm talking best of cases, its not even certain that he'a coming..."
Juve,3ds0kr,SgtPepe,3,Sun Jul 19 02:34:51 2015 UTC,It's amazing how so many people underestimate Gotze on here.

Juve,3ds0kr,DmcDT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:44:30 2015 UTC,it's probably because ppl don't watch enough football;  if they did they'd realize Gotze is literally one of the best attacking midfielders in the WORLD
Juve,3ds0kr,m309,4,Sun Jul 19 06:35:19 2015 UTC,Looks like they're not just baseless rumors after all. Don't see us pulling it off but excited that we're looking for a trequartista nevertheless. Also looks like we're keeping an eye on Draxler. Thoughts?
Juve,3ds0kr,heytterebea,2,Sat Jul 18 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"draxler has potential, i'd definetely buy him. götze is fairly good player, i wonder if he could pull of for us."
Juve,3ds0kr,man_overb0ard,5,Sun Jul 19 07:33:04 2015 UTC,draxler looks really promising but goetze is a a safe bet.
Juve,3ds0kr,_Titty_Sprinkles_,2,Sat Jul 18 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Also something I found on /r/fcbayern   https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/3dps8n/khr_talking_about_vidal/  Taken from the comments:   He is confirming that Bayern is looking into Vidal, but there is no transfer fee and contract yet   Does this open up the possibility of Vidal staying? Not sure whose words to take since Di Marzio has reported the transfer fee at €35(or €37) million plus bonuses."
Juve,3ds0kr,farhadJuve,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'm still in denial too, but Vidal is almost certainly leaving. Those bastards tried offering us a straight swap with Ribery and we declined. Now we turn our focus to Gotze."
Juve,3ds0kr,Marko_Lamont,2,Sun Jul 19 17:39:16 2015 UTC,That would be fantastic!
Juve,3ds0kr,Super_Sic58,2,Sun Jul 19 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think it will be €35-40mil for Vidal, loan Götze w/ option.   Which, to be honest, is a reasonable deal. But it depends on how he plays here... Hopefully his attitude will change, not a fan of his mentality, would like to see some more agression from him rather than just whining, probally worse that he scored a WC winning goal, he is already proven himself in his own mind. But, I like him, he would suit Allegri, also slot into the team well too."
Juve,3ds0kr,Marko_Lamont,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:04 2015 UTC,I would be completely happy with that deal.   Gotze will fit fine into this new look Juve team. He is overshadowed at Bayern; he could flourish here.

Juve,3dowzg,nryan8989,2,Sat Jul 18 02:38:10 2015 UTC,i got a feeling that vidal was not officially announced because they want to tie this move with gotze arrival. marotta is a fucking genius.
Juve,3dowzg,man_overb0ard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:52 2015 UTC,It is true and that's the only reason Marotta flow to Munich. Usually the buyer fly over for contract purposes not the other way around.
Juve,3dowzg,a_demanding_poochie,2,Sun Jul 19 03:14:25 2015 UTC,"For starters, Juventus is stretching its wage budget by trying to bring Gotze, i don't see it happening because presently gotze earns 7 million EUROS without bonuses.  I know he would be a starter, it will change his status from a prospect to a world class player. Juventus is amazing that way. Pogba wouldn't have been the player he is today if not for Juventus.   I would really love for him to join Juve, but unless he forgoes a million in salary and leave his favourite club, don't see it happening.  Still Optimistic"
Juve,3dowzg,Ahmedsoukat,3,Sat Jul 18 10:54:48 2015 UTC,"Gotze makes 7 million total, this is a €6 million net offer, so far more money in his pocket each week."
Juve,3dowzg,alpha1028,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"Completely true, wages in the other leagues are shown before taxes while in Italy they always show the net."

Juve,3dowzg,Juve313,3,Sat Jul 18 05:58:50 2015 UTC,"Vidal. He said players. But it seems like a circumstantial thing, and they did not make their mind up 2-3 weeks ago when Marotta said that. Having an established trequartista means less pressure on out attacking lineup consisting of 3 new faces. Last season even, Morata had a really bad start but Llorente covered up for him. If it was Morata playing day in and out, out of form, things might have turned differently for him."
Juve,3dowzg,daddytorgo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"This would be a good ""next shoe to drop"" after the Vidal sale. Essentially replacing Vidal/Pirlo in the starting lineup with Khedira/Gotze.   If it happens."
Juve,3dowzg,a_demanding_poochie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:19:41 2015 UTC,I don't think Juve is going to pay him more than Tevez (4.5m). Not sure about the tax situation in Germany but I guess it's way more than in Italy.
Juve,3dowzg,khdbdcm,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:03 2015 UTC,This is only somewhat relevant and doesn't mean anything but I got Gotze for around €25 million on FM14 since he was set to leave on a Bosman but I didn't want him changing his mind and signing a new contract so I signed him summer 2016. He became my top earner along with Vidal. Again it means absolutely NOTHING but since it's summer and there's not much to talk about thought you guys would like to know. Conte also became coach at Bayern after Pep left to manage the Spanish NT.

Juve,3dmnt4,aakashd93,7,Fri Jul 17 14:43:58 2015 UTC,I like the lineup. We also have pereyra who can slot in anywhere in the midfield. I've also heard dybala could play behind the strikers too.
Juve,3dmnt4,nryan8989,2,Fri Jul 17 15:39:29 2015 UTC,Pereyra is best utilized behind the strikers IMO but yes he is a flexible player in terms of position.
Juve,3dmnt4,m309,7,Sat Jul 18 04:47:31 2015 UTC,Honest question; how are we gona get Gotze?  the guy is getting 7mil/year at Bayern AFTER tax..  so please someone explain to me why is everyone acting like its a done deal?
Juve,3dmnt4,m309,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"7m a year after tax is less than pogba is making from my understanding. With the sale of Llorente, Isla, and Vidal, we would be able to fund the transfer and fees, along with a left back."
Juve,3dmnt4,Sam_Hog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:41:47 2015 UTC,you have the other way around my friend.  Pogba might be making more BEFORE tax because he takes home 4.5mil;  Gotze takes home 7mil (or 6.5) so it means thats AFTER tax :)
Juve,3dmnt4,m309,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:54:49 2015 UTC,Vidal will most likely be part of the deal
Juve,3dmnt4,Sam_Hog,2,Fri Jul 17 22:09:53 2015 UTC,that still doesn't answer how we gona afford his wages unless he's willing to take 1million less per year.  Latest reports are saying we're willing to give him 6mil/year
Juve,3dmnt4,breaking_good,2,Sat Jul 18 08:53:19 2015 UTC,lol I don't know man. All I know is that I wouldn't mind having him on Juve instead of Vidal
Juve,3dmnt4,m309,2,Sat Jul 18 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"Oooo I would be careful throwing that around here...   I agree with you, but many Juve fans see Arturo as a god"
Juve,3dmnt4,syxsyxsyx,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"No one sees Vidal as a god; at least whoever has been a Juve fan for a long time.  You can't place Vidal in the same category at Buffon, Chiellini, Marchisio, DP (those are gods).  Everyone is just very pissed about the low price we got for him.  I've come to accept his sale (if it means we get a LB and a #10) but there's no justification for his low price tag"
Juve,3dmnt4,daddytorgo,3,Sun Jul 19 06:29:00 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or the front pair (Mandzu-Morata) seems incompatible?  I watched them both extensively (Morata last year and Mandzu in Germany) and their playstyle seems a bit.. clashing. Mandzu have a great work ethic (possibly better, if not on par with Tevez), but he lacks the fantasista ineffable Tevez had in abundance, that from time to time make up for Morata's rather.. clinical approach.  Of course, I hope I am wrong, by all accounts, but I do hope that we get a decent #10 (that I really hope is not Oscar, he is too.. frail for us) to make up for that and provide us with one or two moment of brilliance against opponents that park the bus.  And I'm all in for Khedira. He is not Vidal, but, before the injury, he's one of the smartest box-to-box midfield in terms of timing. Not a lot of magical moments, but run efficiently and work for the team."
Juve,3dmnt4,farhadJuve,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:03 2015 UTC,Agree with you - all-in for Khedira. His intelligence and reading of the game always struck me as world-class. Very efficient.   Agree with you on Mandzu/Morata. I don't think they'll start together though - I think it will be one of them and then Dybala/Coman(?).
Juve,3dmnt4,forpirlojuve,4,Sat Jul 18 23:31:31 2015 UTC,the new lineup will take time to gel. Whoever is expecting us to be amazing first 5 games will be disappointed
Juve,3dmnt4,dellealpi,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:33 2015 UTC,agree with you once we set in we can conquer serie a
Juve,3dmnt4,hurric9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"We can conquer serie a without changing the team. We should be considered as a serious champions league contender otherwise the entire reconstruction is pointless. I don't know what's the hurry to sell Vidal. Its not worthy if we swap him for Draxler who barely played during the past season. Draxler can't be a starter, so can't Pereyra, at least not now. I'd love to see player with higher caliber such as Oscar, KDB or Gotze coming."
Juve,3dmnt4,daddytorgo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Well, we did lower the average ages."

Juve,3dmnt4,m309,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"I mean can we really not afford that? I'm no expert but we are a pretty big club and I just think that doesn't seem outrageous. Toronto can pay Giovinco, Michael Bradley, and Altidore all 5m+ and they are in no way close to Juve in terms of size and influence. I know we have much more expensive players on our team but still. Again I honestly have no idea what I'm talking about, just observing stuff as a fan so sorry if I am spouting rubbish right now!"
Juve,3dmnt4,andiamojuve,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"Matching his pay at €7m is a bit too much. That would make him the highest paid earner in Serie A even above De Rossi.

Juve,3dmnt4,daddytorgo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"Makes since. Even if we can theoretically pay that we wouldn't want to undermine all other players on out team.

Juve,3dmnt4,ghobbins,0,Fri Jul 17 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"That would be a good lineup. We shouldn't get our hearts set on a #10 yet. I'd say Khedira/Sturaro share a starting spot at the beginning, Pereyra is in the mix somewhere, and Pogba will play on the right now."

Juve,3dlt37,Zarolio,0,Fri Jul 17 10:04:09 2015 UTC,we would be super retarded to sell Pogba to them. They are already a strong team and we're making them stronger. And to them its basically to continue having the best player in the world after Messi is gone.  After this Vidal sale i question the ambition of our club; are we here to win CL and be an elite team in the world? or are we just here to make money and keep our name around and be content with winning scudettos.
Juve,3dlt37,JuveSoCal__S,4,Fri Jul 17 16:55:01 2015 UTC,unfortunately we live in times where agents can force their clients out of a club and Raiola is def one of those agents.  Unless Pogba puts him into his place (like Nedved did when he told him he doesn't want to leave Juve and doesn't want to join inter) then Raiola can and will go around saying this stuff
Juve,3dlt37,m309,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:59:20 2015 UTC,Does Raiola have any other client still relevant? His only bet is Pogba now.  Balotelli is hopeless and Zlatan has only another 2 season max. He no longer is the same super agent as those days with the demise of Serie A.

Juve,3dlt37,Kegos,2,Fri Jul 17 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"yea so much for ""mercato is closed"" to giving away 3 key players for nothing"
Juve,3dljfz,Ahmedsoukat,2,Fri Jul 17 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have thought so, we have Marchisio, Pogba, Khedira, Sturaro, Pereyra and if needed Asamoah. We may end up signing someone else but its not required."
Juve,3dljfz,Zarolio,2,Fri Jul 17 07:43:42 2015 UTC,"man we def dont need any more center mids; we have Marchisio, Pogba, Khedira, Sturaro, Pereyra and Asamoah (so 6 of them fighting for 3 spots).  I know Pereyra can play behind the strikers as well but he can be a center mid when needed.  If anything we sold Vidal coz we have too many center mids; so I believe with the vidal money + Llorente (plus maybe Isla) we'll get a left back and a play maker"
Juve,3dljfz,m309,2,Fri Jul 17 10:08:40 2015 UTC,"Juventus' primary objective will continue to be: Win the League. Without Vidal and with the players we already have in the squad we have the ability to achieve that objective.  The Champions League is where everyone (including myself) really wants to see us succeed. Losing Vidal, Tevez, and Pirlo is a massive blow to that campaign. I think we've done the right business to replace Tevez long term in the form of Dybala, and short term in the form of Mandzukic. Pirlo was fading this last season, everyone saw it. We will miss his experience but I have faith Marchisio will carry on just fine. Vidal is the player that we can't replace right now because there is nobody quite like him and as good as him. Time alone will tell if Sami is on his level. Pereyra, although he is a bit more attack oriented at this point has proven himself flexible and a hard worker like Vidal. Sturaro is young, but has shown us he has potential, and has the backing and belief of the Juventus back staff.   When the Mercato is truly over and our squad for next season is confirmed we can make a good guess on where we'll reach in the champions league next season. At this point the only way I see us reaching the final again is if we sign Verratti with the Vidal, ogbonna, (Llorente and Isla maybe) money."
Juve,3dljfz,Kegos,2,Fri Jul 17 13:53:15 2015 UTC,difference between last time and this time is we are going to have lot of pace now in attack with zaza and dybala but we are now lacking experience tevez gone but mandzukic can cover that to some extent .we dont need verratti we definitely need some one creative upfront rather than like pirlo creating from deep .marchisio can provide balance in midfield  .to some extent can verratti give defensive solidity like vidal? no either sturaro or khedira should take that spot
Juve,3dljfz,forpirlojuve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that Sturaro is a closer replica (ATM we don't know what kind of player he will mature into) to Vidal my reasoning for thinking Varratti is the right replacement is more because of overall quality. Presently, Varratti is a better player than Sturaro and Khedira. To answer your question I do think Verratti is reliable in defensive situations, maybe not set pieces, but he works hard and makes some good tackles.. He isn't a CAM that is true but he offers the right balance between attack and defence that we will miss in the starting line up once Vidal is gone. He's got much more of that Juventus warrior like spirit than someone like Gotze for example and he's Italian, which is a massive factor in my opinion. Gotze would be an amazing signing but I can't see it paying off long term like Verratti would."

Juve,3dk79g,Zarolio,11,Fri Jul 17 07:47:15 2015 UTC,"Vidal. Vidal is the best box to box midfielder in the world.  Gotze is not even in the top five best attacking midfielders in the world.  I don't even know why this is a debate. Vidal is 28, it's not like he's 34. He embodies the Juventus grinta. Without Vidal we wouldn't have won 4 scudetti in a row, we wouldn't have won the Supercoppa twice, we wouldn't have won the Coppa Italia, and we wouldn't have made it to the final of the CL.  He's scored 48 goals in 171 appearances for Juventus, and assisted 26 more goals. He's gotten only ONE red card in 4 years at Juve.  IMO, this isn't even a debate. I'd much rather keep Vidal and invest in Berardi next year. What the fuck are we going to do with another attacking midfielder, even if he's very talented? We already have a surplus of players up front, even after getting rid of Llorente. Coman is staying and needs playing time, Dybala, Morata, Mandzukic and Zaza are all there as well. Berardi is coming next year. I don't understand why people in this sub, of all subs, are willing to part with one third of the best midfield in the world in order to get a young German player who betrayed the team that brought him onto the big stage by going to their rival the night before they played the CL final against them, the player who hasn't settled in at his new club, the player who has no work ethic whatsoever.  Is Gotze good? Yes, he's a massively talented player. But he's not as good at attacking midfield as Vidal is in central midfield. We are making Bayern stronger, and I find it hard to understand how ambitious the club can be if we make our European competition stronger.  One last thing... some people in this sub are talking as if this is a great thing for Juve, and Vidal leaving is good because he's getting older, blah blah. Why do you people think Bayern Munich is willing to spend 40 million euro on him? He will improve ANY team he goes to. ANY TEAM. I'm even seeing some names that I've recognized since we first made the sub a few years ago who are fine with Vidal leaving. I just don't understand it."

Juve,3dk79g,MyNameIsCandain,2,Fri Jul 17 08:24:56 2015 UTC,"His secret is that his performance is always better when he's on a yellow card. Even with more than fifty yellows, he was only suspended because of accumulated cards on six or seven occasions. That's why I wasn't worried by how he was playing in the final, he knows the limits better than any other player I've ever seen, knows exactly how lenient a referee is willing to be."

He had a place in Juve, he was a part of the formation, his style of play was a perfect fit to the team strategy and his teammates weaknesses. Him, Tevez and marcisio were the best players in the team the last season. Goetze needs to fit like a fucking glove to even begin making up for the class we lost."

It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's not the worst thing in the world. Sturaro I believe wants to take Vidal's spot, and the former will grow to become an amazing player. Khedira is also pretty good.   Honestly it's just gonna suck not seeing those three guys out there anymore.   Change is topical though. This is life."

Most likely having to do with his DUI situation. Probably the last straw for our board so they decided to sell him.   people are all believing it must be Vidal asking to leave and already had a under table agreement with Bayern during Copa America.

Juve,3dih0b,dellealpi,12,Thu Jul 16 15:17:18 2015 UTC,NON SI VENDE ZIDANE
Juve,3dih0b,kermv,14,Thu Jul 16 15:26:45 2015 UTC,"And Thuram too...  I'll take this thread as the ""okay with Vidal departure"" thread, and I'll run a quick analysis of our transfer season so far.  As GK, we changed Storari (38 years old) for Neto (25).  In defense, we signed Rugani (20) for free and sold Ogbonna (27) for 11m.  In midfield, we apparently sold Vidal (28) for 35m and let Pirlo (36) go; we signed Khedira (28) on a free.  In attack, we sold Tevez (31) for 3m plus Vadalà (18), and we bought three strikers: Dybala (21) for 32m, Mandzukic (29) for 19m and Zaza (24) for 18m.  I believe the first two reparti have been clearly improved, with young free signings. Attack is going to be interesting, I think we still have to sell Llorente which will give us some more cash, but if Dybala and Mandzu perform like they did in the past, I think we won't be any weaker. Midfield is going to be less stellar, maybe; but we dominated even without Vidal last season, we have Marchisio in his prime and Pogba one year more mature. Khedira is a WC winner and a midfielder who could start for almost anyone, just like Vidal. The net expenditure of the season so far has been 20m, 22m if we consider co-ownership resolutions which include fully signing Pereyra and tying up Berardi for next year.  I think that it is not a bad window. We may be slightly weaker than last year, possibly, but we have significantly lowered the average age, which was among the highest in Europe big clubs. It had to happen. With the huge money influx from last year's CL, we might have a lot to splurge on a trequartista, maybe, we'll see. Sturaro and Asamoah will be very useful this year, I'm eager to see if Sturaro develops in a world class player especially.  By the way, if we wanted to sell Vidal, this was the right year - just after him carrying Chile to the Copa America. We will never see that kind of money for him again."
Juve,3dih0b,mucco,6,Thu Jul 16 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"we signed Rugani (20) for free   Rugani wasn't free, €3.5 million over 4 years was the cost.    we sold Tevez (31) for 3m plus Vadalà (18)   We actually don't receive a single cent in transfer fee, the loans with option to buy are the payment.

No doubt it has been used for the first installment on all our transfers as well debt repayments. Continassa I'd imagine will get a healthy slice of the income too.

Juve,3dih0b,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:39 2015 UTC,Marotta is a genius and if he wants Vidal out then I want Vidal out. The man turned Juve into a top 6 team in the world in four years.

Juve,3dih0b,man_overb0ard,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:11 2015 UTC,Is Vidal final? I didn't like it :/  P.S. Buffon was already a star and I think he is still the most expensive goalkeeper more than a decade later. Similar for canavaro. You can't make a great team only by selling for profit.
Juve,3dih0b,dantemp,4,Thu Jul 16 19:06:19 2015 UTC,What about a striker from Lazio?
Juve,3dih0b,Sethbuf,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:55 2015 UTC,No more signing strikers from Lazio
Juve,3dih0b,alpha1028,2,Thu Jul 16 16:23:30 2015 UTC,Uhh I guess I'm the only one lost here. Who's Zidane?  Surely you aren't talking about Zinedine?

OP is drawing parallels between the moves in the 2001 offseason and this offseason, where Juve have sold Vidal and are bringing in some new talent. This is in response to criticism of the Vidal move, with fans saying that Vidal is worth more to our team than these new guys."

Which makes no difference to us, we're getting money from SportFive (the society taking care of the Stadium's naming rights) even if they don't manage to find a name-sponsor. Basically, as for now we're getting paid to call it Juventus Stadium, te-hee"
Juve,3dj1m7,alpha1028,4,Thu Jul 16 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"Interestingly both Birindelli and Torricelli also both appeared on radio today and both discussed Juve's policy on professionalism, wouldn't be a surprise if it was on Juve's orders.   It all seems to suggest that the incident in Chile was the deciding factor in the sale, and it would also explain why the fee is so low. Perhaps its for the best given that Vidal isn't allowed to buy Ferrari's anymore and that is the Scudetto bonus."
Juve,3dj1m7,daddytorgo,9,Thu Jul 16 17:52:02 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  Knew that stupid DUI would come back to haunt us.  I've got faith that with the added cash they'll improve the team.
Juve,3dj1m7,Cee-Mon,6,Thu Jul 16 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"Tbh, he royally pissed me off with the DUI incident. I have been prepared to ignore it by appreciating the on-pitch player and ignoring the off-pitch person, but hey. At least I have one reason to feel that it's okay that he's leaving.   I hate drunk drivers. And I'm glad Juventus shows character, even if it causes us to sell a key player for too little. Sets us apart from a lot of other clubs."
Juve,3dj1m7,daddytorgo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:42 2015 UTC,Totally agree.
Juve,3dj1m7,Super_Sic58,6,Fri Jul 17 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"I fucking knew it. The minute I read the news that he wrecked that Ferrari and was drunk, I fucking knew his time in the black and white was over.   I thought the silence regarding the aftermath was proof that it wasn't anything to be worried about; oh how naïve I was."
Juve,3dj1m7,Elchidote,3,Thu Jul 16 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"Wait, is he literally not allowed to purchase a Ferrari? Will they refuse him the sale of one if he walks into a dealership?"
Juve,3dj1m7,patiperro_v2,9,Thu Jul 16 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"Ferrari have very strict terms of sale and anyone deemed damaging to the brand is banned from purchasing any Ferrari. If a dealer was to sell anyway they lose their license, if another Ferrari owner sells to them they get banned too.   A guy I went to college with was banned after his reckless driving caused and accident on the I-90 that left a girl paralyzed, China is ground zero for bans these days though."
Juve,3dj1m7,khdbdcm,5,Thu Jul 16 19:18:50 2015 UTC,TIL
Juve,3dj1m7,patiperro_v2,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:43 2015 UTC,Are you still going to be following us now that Vidal is gone? ;_;
Juve,3dj1m7,theultimatebr0,5,Thu Jul 16 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"Isla is still there... lol.  Joking aside. Juve might want to have a look at Charles Aranguiz. He plays the Marchisio role in the Chilean midfield (covers when Vidal goes on his attacking runs). He also has huge stamina and is a bit of an all-rounder. He's an even better penalty taker than Vidal as well (I think he's missed 1 penalty in his whole career), can also take corners and freekicks. Like most Chileans he can run for ages. Would be a great option from the bench."
Juve,3dj1m7,Elchidote,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:30 2015 UTC,Aranguiz really impressed me for Chile.
Juve,3dj1m7,JimRayCooper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:04:10 2015 UTC,Damn! I guess all he can live up to is to fix up the one he messed up. Shame.
Juve,3dj1m7,Dwimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Sounds logical. Is there a source that confirms Vidal is banned?
Juve,3dj1m7,dc10101,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"No there isn't, they don't have a list on a website or anything like that, but a very public DUI while driving a limited production ferrari is definitely a ban."
Juve,3dj1m7,nTsplnk,0,Thu Jul 16 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this makes me feel worse. If selling Vidal was part of a plan to bolster the team, then fine. It may be dumb but its for footballing reasons. But selling him for off field reasons doesnt benefit the team."
Juve,3dj1m7,Dwimer,5,Thu Jul 16 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"I think its the opposite. If it was to solely benefit the team on the pitch, then a 35 mil fee is borderline incompetence. If it's for professional ethical reasons, then I fully stand behind Agnelli (and whoever else) for sticking to their ethical integrity even if it's a sacrifice on the pitch, and even while knowing that they would probably lambasted for it."
Juve,3dj1m7,nTsplnk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"They aren't mutually exclusive. Juve has an extra 35 Million Euros now, it wouldn't surprise me to see another major move be made."
Juve,3dj1m7,Dwimer,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"But for what? 35 is nothing for a star attacking player. Gotze cost Bayern that, and we arent getting him. Isco is going nowhere. KDB would be a fortune. Oscar we might, but have you watched him? He really isnt that great. Theres a reason why Chelsea fans wouldnt be too upset to see him leave."
Juve,3dj1m7,nTsplnk,2,Thu Jul 16 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for Sandro and Draxler both.   And I really question a lot of the integrity people on here. Vidal almost cost himself, and others, their lives, for being needlessly reckless. The fact that many are willing to excuse this behavior shows a lot about their character. If someone at Inter did this we would be crucifying them for lack of integrity. This wasn't being a little buzzed and getting pulled over."
Juve,3dj1m7,Dwimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"We better get someone good out of this. Just hoping Marotta has deals in place already and we wont be chasing players throughout the rest of the summer. it never ends well.  To be honest, I dont particularly care what he does outside of the game. Hes a footballer, not a role model. He can be an asshole and a dick but as long he plays his heart out Ill cheer when he scores. Its up to the Chilean authorities to deal with him and punish him accordingly."
Juve,3dj1m7,nTsplnk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:55:42 2015 UTC,That is something I can agree on.  The DUI wasn't outside of the game-it was during one of the most important tournaments ever for his country. And he blew it. He went out and partied and risked his life and others while he should have been focused on the team. This isn't the first time this has happened.  He clearly puts partying above his team and country. This is not outside of the game.
Juve,3dj1m7,daddytorgo,0,Thu Jul 16 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"This is not outside of the game.   I disagree, so I guess we can end it here."
Juve,3dj1m7,Killagina,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:34 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but you're saying if Vidal did this right before the Real Madrid UCL matches, you'd be okay with it."

Juve,3dk9f5,JuveSoCal__S,4,Thu Jul 16 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't doubt it really, I would do the same too. Don't see how it would change anything though, same thing probably happened after Conte left and Allegri came but look where we are now.

Juve,3dk9f5,khdbdcm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:29:27 2015 UTC,Conte was a coach. It's different than a key player. But whatever im honestly over it. Whatever happens just get it over with and move on.

Juve,3dir0t,orangejulep,7,Thu Jul 16 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"Sturaro will play a lot. And he will be very good. He's played on the big stage and made that wonderful play against Real to keep the ball out.  Vidal will be hard to replace, but if we add more in positions of need and people step up, we will be okay."
Juve,3dir0t,nTsplnk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:11 2015 UTC,I really think we need to upgrade our fullbacks. Licht & Evra were ... serviceable last season but both are getting older and it's likely that they will decline. Need to inject some young blood in those positions.
Juve,3dir0t,NathookGD,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"Lichtsteiner will be fine, leftback is much more important."
Juve,3dir0t,zeshie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"Alot of Lichsteiner's game is based on his athleticism and his ability to run up and down the pitch for 90 minutes. He's 31, won't be able to keep that up much  longer."
Juve,3dir0t,NathookGD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:24 2015 UTC,yes ofcourse but i think he never had fitness issues (even if they are only small time) and he can still deliver 2 years apart from this

Something else will happen and then we can judge based on the whole thing. Would getting a young LB & RB (Alex Sandro, Simone Vrsaljko) be an overall upgrade? What about if we also got someone young to play CAM?   Signing Khedira on a free gave them a ton of flexibility, and selling Vidal (assuming of course he asked to leave) can be a huge part of continuing to set the table for the future.   Maybe Andrea/Beppe/Allegri sat down and all said ""with Pirlo and Tevez leaving it will be very hard to get back to the CL Final this next year, so let's invest in youth and plan to get back there within 3 years with a squad that can win it."""
Juve,3diilw,daddytorgo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:12 2015 UTC,"But Vidal loves Juve. I doubt he would ask to be pulled away, I think he's been pushed, I really like him, but losing three of the main players in our team is a tragedy.   Right now. I'm just gona close my eyes to this, and open them when the transfer window closes. It's too much uncertainty surrounding everything."
Juve,3diilw,Marko_Lamont,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"He says he loves Juve - he seems to, but trucks full of money can change a lot of minds.  If he didn't want to leave he wouldn't agree to terms with Bayern."
Juve,3diilw,daddytorgo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree.   But if he wants to win the hearts of fans, he won't sign the contract. If he does, he's just another player now to me. I loved him at Juve. But I don't see the need for him to leave, he got the chance of a CL final and he underperformed, not the team, he did. Pirlo even told him to calm down that day. If he leaves, it's certainly not for a better team, it's for the cash.   We're losing him at the right time if we do, he'll never be the same player pre injury. His incident only gave him a worse image, the CL final he really underperformed in front of everyone. I'm not saying that to put him down, I'm saying that to soften the blow of losing him. :/"

This is not a terrible sale, this team needed a breath of fresh air, we got a free Khedira and we're gonna sell Llorente for a profit!  It isn't a low sum if you consider that Vidal was worth 50 mil at his peak before he had his big injury and before he had this good but not great season and before his drunk driving accident which no one seems to acknowledge as an issue for some reason.."
Juve,3dht0f,nTsplnk,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"Actually he didn't play at all for the first part of the season so there was definitely a ""post-injury Vidal""   What I mean by this is his drop in form is due to his playing out of position, not some imaginary knee problem thats ruined him. He didnt have a great year because hes not a trequartista. When he played in his normal position he was great.   This is not a terrible sale   This absoloutely is. Selling one of the best B2B midfielders in the world for less Benteke is a joke. This is fucking terrible.    we got a free Khedira   Who isnt as good...   before his drunk driving accident which no one seems to acknowledge as an issue for some reason..   Bayern clearly dont give a shit   his team needed a breath of fresh air   So selling Tevez, Pirlo, Storari, Ogbonna, Llorente in one window isnt enough of a breathe of fresh air? We are selling the heart of our midfield."
Juve,3dht0f,Dwimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"If Vidal played so much out of position then it would make sense to sell him, it's clear he doesn't fit in with Allegri's ideas."

Juve,3dht0f,nTsplnk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"He played Pirlo because he was humiliated by the press over dropping him years ago. Pirlo was an instrumental part of our rebuilding, so to come in and drop him again, with the chance that he still might be brilliant, would be foolish. Allegri wanting to shoe horn all players into the midfield doesnt mean Vidal wasnt in his plans. Weve played Marchisio on the wings and behind the strikers for ages, I dont think that meant he wasnt in our plans, just that we didnt have the right players or space."
Juve,3dht0f,Dwimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"That's just talk, many people were calling him to bench Pirlo for most big games this year.

Vidal playing well, honestly, was more important than Pirlo."

I dont disagree. Pirlo was a liability throughout a large part of the season. It was shocking how many times he lost the ball in important games. If Pirlo wasnt there this season Vidal would have played in his preferred role. Its just down to Allegri wanting to please everyone as best he could."
Juve,3dht0f,Dwimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"hate to say we went through this comment chain on the idea of him playing out of position being the reason for him being moved, but it's clear it was the DUI.

Juve,3dht0f,legionmd82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:16 2015 UTC,but can benefit allegri in getting what he wants.   Its up to Marotta to pull some big magic tricks off. We need a fullback and an attacking mid. Still dreaming that Gotze is part of the exchange somehow.
Juve,3dht0f,IWantToBeAHipster,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"You guys are hilariously short sighted. 35-40 million for Vidal is a great price on a 28 year old who was injured half of last season and didn't really put it on till late in the season. If we get a great #10 with the money we will be winners with this deal. We kept Pogba, marchisio (who was best mid last season easy) , pererya, and Sturaro as well as signing Khedira for free. Wake up guys, no player is bigger than the club. Also off field antics with the crash and DUI were probably a factor in a discounted price."
Juve,3dht0f,fogee23,2,Thu Jul 16 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"I agree Vidal is 28 and his commitment to the club is questionable, particularly since the interest from Man United surfaced last summer. I wish we could have got Schweinsteiger in exchange though, he is truly world class."
Juve,3dht0f,dc10101,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.. some juventini need to seriously chill out..  We got 40 million (37+3 bonus) for a good, but reckless player.. Juve has always been very strict with players and Vidal is no exception, I'm sure that incident is the biggest reason why this sale happened, which isn't a bad thing. Have a little faith in the management that got us to where we are, last year about this time everyone was sh***ing on Morata, now what do you think of him?"
Juve,3dht0f,legionmd82,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"Wake up guys, no player is bigger than the club.    This.  Although I agree with most of the others that the fee is entirely too low, especially compared to other midfielders like Kondogbia, Illarramendi, etc. 45-50 seems to be a fairer price. I think the DUI probably knocked off 10-20 mil off the asking, so its a tough situation for all involved."
Juve,3dht0f,legionmd82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"35-40 is a great price?  how so?  Jackson martinez who is 29 was sold for 35mil..  schneiderlin got sold for 35 so how is 35-40 a great price?  I agree with everything else you said but 35-40 is a HORRIBLE price..  I am OK with Vidal going for the sake of bettering the team but that price is waaaaay too low for one of the best mids in the world  Also, what no. 10 are you gona get with 35mil?  I will tell you who you will NOT get; Isco, Oscar, Gotze"

And 28 is not that old, for a player widely considered one of the best in his position and the best in his role while entering his prime 35-40 million is a laughable price.

We have Khedira, We have Sturaro, We will buy another mid probably stronger than Vidal who was underperforming lately.  The team needed this revolution,   Tevez wanted to go home  Pirlo wasn't him anymore  Vidal was underperfoming.

I love the guy but the timing is correct for a b2b midfielder like him and we won't get more in the next year's. I'm actually ok with him going.  Edit: let's make this a bit more rational:   His contract expires on 2017. Before next season they would need to renew it at higher wages and if they will not agree to a renewal Juventus will loose Vidal for half the money they are getting now. This season has been by far his worst one at the club. He has been on a very successful 4 year cycle with Juventus and it is normal that he would look for new motivation elsewhere.   I am actually admiring the courage of Juventus management to regenerate the team and not letting it boil like Inter and Milan did in the past."
Juve,3dgjbb,eleytheria,3,Thu Jul 16 11:36:54 2015 UTC,It's official man..  Vidal is leaving us for 35million..  and that's not a typo and it's not in british pounds..  He's leaving for 35million EUROS!!  Ridiculous!
Juve,3dfhxd,JoseArcadioMorales,12,Wed Jul 15 21:27:48 2015 UTC,Just when I thought we had a perfect mercato... We can't loose 3 absolute key players in one window :/
Juve,3dfhxd,Marko_Lamont,3,Wed Jul 15 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"3 key players.   Genuinely, this totally changes the team. In every way. We don't have an outfield player we can rely on now to score, we don't have the man that the Conte era was based around, we may not even have our King. And we still have a long transfer window to go.   Last season I doubted Allegri, but now I'm doubting the overlords. Please, I hope they see sence."
Juve,3dfhxd,khdbdcm,9,Thu Jul 16 18:05:19 2015 UTC,"Marotta can go fuck himself if it's true. ""We don't sell our best players"" What happened to that? And I very much doubt Vidal himself asked for a transfer, he loves Juve."
Juve,3dfhxd,Horsecaulking,6,Wed Jul 15 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"bayern is one of those clubs that we can't compete with financially.  I read they are offering 6.5 million a year in wages, a number like that can change a players perspective pretty quickly.  Arturo is 28 and needs to get paid now.  He loves the club and we fans love him.  I figured when we signed Khedira that he or Pogba was going to go."
Juve,3dfhxd,khdbdcm,6,Wed Jul 15 22:23:30 2015 UTC,So we can reject an offer from them 2 seasons ago and reject bids for Pogba but now all of a sudden with improved finances and coming off a deep CL run we can't hold them off? Bullshit.
Juve,3dfhxd,alpha1028,3,Wed Jul 15 22:28:25 2015 UTC,"You are right, while we aren't on the same level yet we are much closer to them now than when we rejected their bid 2 summers ago, and Man Uniteds offers last summer.  If he asked to leave that is one thing, but with so much time left on his contract selling him for €40 million is a joke, and if true Marotta should leave with him."

I am not sold on Khedira, we seem to have missed the train on Witsel and now we assume that Schalke are going to let Draxler just leave.   This one upsets me the most of all our transfers/losses."
Juve,3dfhxd,Maluni724,3,Thu Jul 16 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Since everyone else are still losing their shit and ignoring the question, I'll answer you OP.  I think only 2 of those for 40-45 is realistic, and of those two I would definitely prefer Draxler and Sandro. Honestly I think Khedira will be able to show why he was a starter at Madrid and will replace Vidal (not as well as Vidal did play, but closely), and Draxler and Sandro would improve our squad more total than keeping Vidal would. As Schalke is the team I root for in Germany I am very glad we're linked with him, instead of someone like Oscar, whom I don't like. And for that price that is being rumoured is just a bargain that has to be taken"
Juve,3dfhxd,khdbdcm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:25 2015 UTC,Isn't Draxler's buy out clause (if he has one) bigger than the reported price? Why would Schalke sell for less?

Juve,3dfhxd,Armagizmo,2,Thu Jul 16 08:38:51 2015 UTC,"Good move. Even if we don't pick up all three of those guys, a move like this enables us to spend more money retaining Pogba. Vidal is good but two of those players would improve our squad immensely. Draxler is a fantastic player too."
Juve,3dfhxd,daddytorgo,2,Thu Jul 16 02:17:28 2015 UTC,I'm not really a Cuadrado believer. I guess if we're thinking 4-3-3 though we need speed and width...
Juve,3desn5,renopeno,25,Wed Jul 15 18:33:11 2015 UTC,Horrible deal. €45mil for Vidal? The best box to box midfielder in the world? He should absolutely not be sold. Even if a play maker comes in. We have Berardi and Coman as bright prospects. Why would we rip out the heart of our team for €45mil?
Juve,3desn5,Killagina,19,Wed Jul 15 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't believe people with Juve flair are suggesting it would be a good deal, shows with certainty they have absolutely no idea how Juve works as a team right now. Khedira wouldn't be a replacement he would require an entirely new system to be brought in at midfield and alter how Marchisio and Pogba can play, which will fuck up everything, and given we've already lost our best striker this would be a monumentally stupid idea."
Juve,3desn5,alpha1028,9,Wed Jul 15 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Our midfield is so good. The last thing we want to do is alter our midfield at the same time that we are playing around with 3 new strikers. That midfield will take the pressure off of players like Dybala, Morata, Coman, and Zaza. It will allow then to succeed.  You mess with the midfield and suddenly our whole team is a whole lot less impressive.   Vidal didn't have the best season last year. But he seems to have recovered well. It would be a huge mistake to sell him unless we are getting something very impressive as compensation"
Juve,3desn5,Killagina,4,Wed Jul 15 19:39:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the reason Juve was able to consistently win with mediocre strikers was because the midfield was there to do the heavy lifting when needed. Vidal wasn't at his best for the first half of the season but the 2nd half he was solid and there were even a few games when he was back to his old self.   This whole situation is ridiculous, I'm perfectly happy not signing another player this summer as long as we keep Vidal.   To be completely honest the only reason I see behind this is that Pogba wants to play on the right as he has always said and Vidal won't move over to the left. But that would be ridiculously petty.   At the end of the day no matter happens with Tevez gone we will be worse off next season, taking Vidal too and we take a massive step back, and we really can't afford to do that."
Juve,3desn5,alpha1028,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Especially given how far some other teams have come. I know Sturaro has shown great talent, but I don't think he would be a good replacement quite yet."
Juve,3desn5,Killagina,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think Allegri was going to play Vidal at CAM and now with the opportunity to cash in on him and get a real CAM, they're going for it.  I too think it's too much change and the team will have a rough adapting period. I'd also like Vidal to stay. But it looks like a forgone conclusion. These aren't just rumors. Reputable sources are saying it's a done deal. We have to move on."
Juve,3desn5,ghobbins,3,Thu Jul 16 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Only way it's remotely a ""good"" deal is if a world-class trequartista comes in as a result."

Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,8,Wed Jul 15 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"If Vidal leaves, Marotta knows that it has to cost Bayern dearly. €45m doesn't cut it. I prefer not to sell Vidal but if maybe part of the deal included let's say, Götze (which happens to be the only player we might be interested in) it might not be too bad. But then again, it's wishful thinking on my behalf."
Juve,3desn5,Elchidote,3,Wed Jul 15 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"It would be a no brainer for me if Gotze is coming back. He's younger and a world class talent. He would do wonders for our attack.   I personally think guys like Vidal are easier to come by than Gotze. Khedira won't be Vidal but people are overrating the drop off. Vidal had a good Copa but the refs favored his style, it's easy to forget how he could've easily been sent off in the CL."
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,6,Wed Jul 15 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"A squad can only handle so much change in a season, not many clubs can handle a complete overhaul and maintain success."
Juve,3desn5,zeshie,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Yes but if we wait to overhaul now then we will be overhauling our entire defense, goalkeepers in the coming years. This is not a complete overhaul it is one guy. Tevez was leaving next year anyway.  I love Vidal and obviously want something back if he is sold, but the fact is we need to be concerned about the future as well. If we can improve with this sale we should do it."
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,3,Wed Jul 15 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"You never need that much change, consistent flow through seasons is the way to continue a squad. If we re-arrange how both our forwards and midfield play and the personnel then we could have a very slow start which would have huge implications for the scudetto and the CL. We would be completely changing our style of play and after a season where our players really stepped it up and played their roles perfectly it just isn't a smart idea."
Juve,3desn5,zeshie,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"The fact is we already rearranged them to a 4-3-1-2 multiple times this year, they have proven they could handle it.  You're overreacting, honestly. It would hurt but the way you guys make it sound it'd be the end of Juve..."
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:30 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with you. This is a big deal if it turns out to be true.

Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Players like Vidal are one in a generation. A player with that stamina, tenacity, ability to win the ball, pressure the opponent for 120 minutes AND score 10 goals a season?  That simply can't be found. I can name 5 other CAMs I'd rather have than Gotze, not that I think he'd be a poor addition to the team. I'd rather have Isco, Ozil, Sanchez, James or even Thomas Muller than Gotze.  The only player in the world who is similar to Vidal is Yaya Toure, and 40m wouldn't even begin the discussion with City for his signing, and he's older.  Vidal is the player who most exemplifies the Juve grinta, like Marchisio, Bonucci, Chiellini and Tevez. He's simply irreplaceable."
Juve,3desn5,adityaseth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:27:56 2015 UTC,"You're overrating Vidal. He is the best box to box midfielder in the world, but he wasn't good for half the season this year, and people think that the Copa America is comparable to Europe-it's not. He was almost BANNED FROM THE TOURNAMENT by risking HIS LIFE AND OTHERS. He benefited from refs that just let physical play happen, which would never happen in Europe. He was lucky to even be in half the CL round stage games. Easily could've had two reds. Look, I don't want to say that Vidal isn't good, he's the best at what he does. But obviously Juve management thinks otherwise. Maybe he doesn't fit in with Allegri's system next year, maybe they know something we don't.  His style of play will wear down and when it does it will happen fast. Everyone says that X is irreplaceable until someone replaces him. Welp, Vidal is gone, let's pack it up! Juve will never be good again!"
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,2,Thu Jul 16 12:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not overrating him, I think you're underrating him. His form in the first half of the season was average at best, I agree, but he was also coming back from a bad summer and injuries. In the second half of the season, he was back to his best, and he was invaluable for us. Also consider that for a good part of the season, he was being played out of position at attacking midfield, and he showed his class each time he came back to his central midfield role.  As for the Copa America, yes it's not comparable to Europe. It's pretty close, though. Look at the players, it's names like Vidal, Messi, Higuain, Di Maria, Neymar, Suarez, Cavani, etc. All players who light up Europe every season. Maybe the quality is not the same, but it's definitely better than the Europa League.  His drunk driving is a non-issue. It doesn't matter because it has nothing to do with his footballing ability. We're not hiring him to drive the team bus, we're hiring him to play in our midfield. What he does off the pitch is his problem, and if he fucks up, he'll pay for it. This is the one and only blemish on his record, and I, for one, refuse to hold that against him. He's been sentenced by his country, and he'll serve his punishment. It's irrelevant whether he was drunk driving, committing tax fraud or assault. He didn't do it on Juventus duty, and it doesn't impact his Juventus career.  As for the physical play, that is where you don't seem to know Vidal. Vidal's style of play is to live on the edge of a red card. He did it for Juve for 4 years now, I'm shocked you haven't noticed. When Vidal has a yellow card, he knows exactly how far he can take it with the ref, and his quality is that he goes exactly that far. In his whole time at Juve, he has gotten ONE straight red card, and never has he had a yellow and then gotten a second yellow card. One time.  In the 171 matches he's played for Juventus, he has scored 48 goals and racked up 26 assists for a total of 74 goals scored or created. That is a record even strikers would be pleased with, and he was primarily a box-to-box midfielder for us. I can't say it enough, he is worth too much as a player to even consider the amount we could get in cash for him. He's invaluable to our style of play.  I do consider him irreplaceable. The team we had won the double and got within 20 minutes of winning the Champions League. We could bear the loss of Tevez, since we've replaced him with three strikers, one of whom is world class already (Mandzukic)... we could bear the loss of Pirlo because he was losing the physical ability to keep up, and our midfield was excellent even without him. But to lose Vidal? That destroys our midfield.  Next season, we will have a completely different team if Vidal is sold. The makeup of our midfield will change completely. We have a practically brand new striker lineup, our best remaining striker is a 22 year old who is only just starting to understand Italian and Juventus football. We need to keep our midfield intact in order to hold up against the inevitable friction that will arise from depending on a brand new striking lineup.  I think this deal would be a grave mistake. I don't consider Pogba unsellable, but I do consider Marchisio and Vidal to be unsellable. They were the ones who made everything possible for Pogba and Pirlo."
Juve,3desn5,adityaseth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"So you think Vidal, who has come off an injury, played Serie A, CL, AND Copa football, AND the Copa America, will be well rested and amazing all year long, with his endless tenacious style? If you think that, fine, but that won't happen. In fact, Vidal could  very easily fall off. The psychological impacts of the drunk driving and the endless playing will have its effect.  Yes, Del Piero was irreplaceable, so was Maldini, so was Zidane...the list goes on. Players get old and move on, transfers happen. No one is irreplaceable.   Our defense is aging, we are weak in many positions, we have a new manager with a new system, these things are going to happen. This is where I differ from most on here, people have trashed Pogba on this board for the last month and it's ridiculous. Pogba has way higher upside than Vidal and is already better offensively. Sturaro is very good. Khedira is very good. They won't replace Vidal of yesteryear, but it remains to be seen how good Vidal will actually continue to be.  I will miss Vidal if true, but I look at these things with my head, not my heart. Many of us are scared of the future, we want to cling to the success of our past season and not let go, but sometimes you have to."
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:23 2015 UTC,"Considering he'd have an extra two weeks to relax before returning for training, yes, I think he'd be fine. He's not coming off an injury right now, so I don't know why you mentioned that, he's perfectly healthy, just tired from playing the Copa America... and two weeks of rest is enough to get over that before getting back into light training and practice matches. I think he's strong enough to get over the drunk driving incident, he clearly already has considering his form got even better towards the end of the Copa.  Our defense isn't exactly aging. We've replaced Ogbonna with Rugani, apart from that our only old defender is Barzagli, who is 34 and at the end of his career. Chiellini at 31 still has 3-4 years left in him, Bonucci is 28, as is Caceres. We're looking into Alex Sandro of Porto to replace Evra, who has one year left on his contract, and Asamoah is back to full fitness. Our only weak point is RB, where our only replacement for Lichtsteiner is young, inexperienced Mattiello.  It's not about letting go, for me. If he is sold, he is sold, I will look forward and wait to see what happens next. My point is that he shouldn't be sold because it doesn't make sense. We don't need the money, and he's too important to our playing style and dressing room."
Juve,3desn5,adityaseth,3,Thu Jul 16 13:44:58 2015 UTC,"We won't be the same squad without him. Instead of building on last season's success, we will be starting over."

Juve,3desn5,Killagina,4,Wed Jul 15 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Gotzes level? the level that has almost every Bayern fan and ex player criticizing him? I hope you are right, id hate for them to become that selfish and irritating to watch."
Juve,3desn5,Zarolio,0,Thu Jul 16 07:55:35 2015 UTC,That'd be great but we don't know if that will happen. It doesn't seem like Juve is too keen on getting Berardi here either (which kinda worries me.)
Juve,3desn5,nTsplnk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"He is coming next year. Nedved made it clear that him and Sturaro are the future. Even Berardi's agent said he will come to Juve next year. Berardi just wants more play time.   Berardi will join. Then ideally we will have Berardi, Dybala, Zaza, and Morata as young forwards. If we get Gotze it would definitely improve our forwards. Just not so sure we need it. I just want a left back :("

I hope it's 30 mil and gotze. Tbh I was a fan of vidal when he was a bruiser in cdm. Ever since he wanted to play more attacking he lost his appeal.. for me. I like the direction that juve is doing and pogba and marchisio in the mid is still a very strong midfield. Plus, transfer window isn't over yet. All in all, I'm ok with vidal leaving. Just my thoughts"
Juve,3desn5,duncan_macocinue,2,Thu Jul 16 03:41:46 2015 UTC,What if it's 45m + Goetze? It might be wishful thinking on my behalf but given we are in the market for a CAM and have Mercato Master Marotta negotiating you never know!!!!

Juve,3desn5,Kegos,8,Wed Jul 15 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"This would be a truly terrible deal for us, and if it happens it Marotta should leave with him.   Although to be clear I don't believe this, Di Marzio is good but not infallible"
Juve,3desn5,alpha1028,2,Wed Jul 15 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"I think Juve would rather keep him but if the motivations for the transfer are coming from the player and his entourage what can Juve do?   Juve have said time and time again that they don't intend on selling important players unless they voice desires to leave.   Regardless, not a fan of this in any way."
Juve,3desn5,SeveredGarden,2,Wed Jul 15 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"vidal definitely did not ask to leave. He was wearing Juve shin guards at the copa final, that tells u how much he loves the team. His cousin was also wearing Juve jersey.  This is all from Bayern's camp."
Juve,3desn5,JuveSoCal__S,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah also a possibility, Vidal is a Juventino through and through add his tattoos, etc, three scenarios:  A. It came from Vidal's camp B. Came from Juve C. Bayern inquired after Schweinstieger left  I see A and C being possibilities, whatever the case talks are ongoing."
Juve,3desn5,SeveredGarden,5,Wed Jul 15 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"i don't know, it's a difficult situation, but i think that sell vidal for gotze or oscar, could be a very good deal, i know how much vidal is strong and important for juve, but he can't play as trequartista for another season, we need a good player in that role, and we are pretty covered in the midfield with sturaro and khedira.  We also have to consider that vidal is 28 and gotze is 22."
Juve,3desn5,4lxp,3,Wed Jul 15 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck this. So we spend 4 years building a solid platform and then we fuck it all up and start from the beginning?

I hope this is rubbish, like the last window when he was already  at ManU."
Juve,3desn5,Juve313,3,Wed Jul 15 21:07:54 2015 UTC,If this happens I expect Nedved to come out of retirement.
Juve,3desn5,ampsmith3,7,Wed Jul 15 21:53:37 2015 UTC,I'd rather sell Pogba than Vidal.

Juve,3desn5,patiperro_v2,7,Wed Jul 15 20:39:41 2015 UTC,If he agrees to this it kills all talk that he is some kind of mastermind.
Juve,3desn5,alpha1028,3,Wed Jul 15 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm just looking at all this as a selfish Chilean fan who thinks Juve's style is the best for Vidal to showcase his talents. I wanted a Chilean to become a legend at a European giant. At his age it's impossible for him to establish himself as a legend anywhere else at this point in his career. With Juventus he would continue to win many more trophies and expand his position as one of Juve's greats... now he will throw all that out the window, I bet his agent has been working on him year after year, the twat! I can't see Vidal preferring Germany over Italy.  Deep down, even though they will have a thinner midfield without Pirlo and Vidal, I know Juve will survive somewhere near the top of Serie A regardless. But it might be a bumpy ride, specially with the rest of the Italian teams getting stronger. I still remember the jump in quality Juve made from 6th (or was it 7th?) when Pirlo and Vidal arrived. They just changed the face of the team dramatically.  Now they have brought Khedira who is experienced, Marchisio has grown since then and obviously Pogba will have to play an even bigger role. The rest of the midfield has yet to prove themselves day in day out, Pereyra is good as a ten but deeper in midfield they will only have Sturaro if any of Khedira-Marchiso-Pogba gets injured, I don't think Pereyra or Asamoah are good enough defensively  It might take some matches for the new faces to gel, like Khedira and Dybala. But I can't help but feel Juventus will be considerably weaker (at least for 1 season) without Tevez, Pirlo and Vidal. You can't let those three world class players go and expect everything to remain the same.  Unless Juve buy a world class number 10 or striker, I expect a serious challenge from other Serie A teams to the title. With Tevez and Pirlo gone it would have been wiser to keep Vidal... :/  As a bonus I will get to see Vidal play Pep-ball and pass sideways forever...ugh... I'm going to miss those surprise bursts into enemy territory from midfield. I don't even think Vidal suits Pep's style, he is not particularly brilliant at small triangulations... he will probably play him as fullback or CB or some other bullshit like that.  In short, I hope these negotiations go to hell."
Juve,3desn5,patiperro_v2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, Vidal is one of my favourite players and I had always kind of hoped that like Nedved even though he doesn't have that 15 year legacy that he would etch his name into the foundations of the club and be here for years to come and then after retirement stick around work for the club like Trez etc.  I still am sceptical, only a few months back he spent around €800k on renovating his house which to me is an indication that he wants to stay."

Negotiations falling through are possible  Reason for the talks : Vidal is 28, last major transfer offer he would be getting for juventus. Last year we were hearing 50 million euros offer from man utd still he stayed.  Also know, Vidal is Juve blood. he has the three stars tattooed on his neck!   He jumps into tackles, because he plays with so much passion. And last season wasn't his usual best but he is getting back to his previous level.   If Marotta is planning on replacing him with witsel, big mistake! need a player of character to lead and make the difference when it matters.  Vidal > 45 million euros.  Would love for him to stay."

Sturaro                 Draxler            Mandzukic  Dybala    I'd really hope to go out and snag one more good signing as well on top of those transfers if they do happen

Yes, we had lots of money from the Champions, but not all can go to transfers. Yes, its a blow to loose him, yes... it may cost us the scuddetto? maybe. Last time, when we sold Zidane, we beat the crap out of Real..

Juve,3dc24f,man_overb0ard,8,Wed Jul 15 02:37:38 2015 UTC,"He is on 4.5mil a year. Losing Pirlo,  Tevez, and Llorente lowers our wage bill a lot. I'd love to sell him even if he does seem like a genuinely nice guy. We have 3 proper forwards in Zaza, Morata, and Mandzukic"
Juve,3dc24f,Killagina,3,Wed Jul 15 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think selling Llorente will be a tough task because of his wages and the fact that he didn't have a great season last year.  With that said, considering Liverpool just got a lot of money from Sterling, maybe they're dumb enough to splash on Llorente (they did pay 20mil for Balotelli after all)"

He had a good season under Conte but he isn't doing as well in Allegri's system. I think we should look to sign a quality left back and maybe a right back. I have faith in Lichsteiner but upgrading wouldn't be a bad idea.
Juve,3dc24f,charizard77,2,Wed Jul 15 03:54:46 2015 UTC,We already have Caceres. No need to invest there. Left back on the other hand is necessary. We are an injury away from Padoin starting

Out of a few hundred comments. I have said, ""whatever' less than 5 times. Including the 3 in this post. Your the guy who had an argument with me, if your new here, it happens, let it go. Who really wins from an argument here? No one gives into the others point. It's just hostility, with two or more users flaming each other. Reddit is for fun.

I could not give a single fuck that you want to spend what? £150 on jerseys. But you want to flash that about, why would you even comment that? Trying to put other people down? Or trying to big yourself up? If you were trying to big yourself up, why not buy someone else a jersey, I don't think it's necessary to have 3 jerseys, all from the same season. I only have 2 or 3 of the same jersey and they are from the 1980 and 1990. As they had two of my favorite players of all time playing in the same team.   It's exessive. If you want to pay that much for 3 jerseys of potential players who may flop. Go ahead, it's not my money. Go ahead, I doubt you will.

Zaza: I don't know if he will play as much as our other strikers, but I'm hoping for him to understand the system and start playing better after every game. Hopefully he will score more goals than in Sassuolo, his numbers at Sass don't impress me.   Khedira: If we keep playing with Vidal as a #10, then Khedira will have a starter spot in our midfield. He's a world cup champion, he must play as one as soon as possible, we need to keep our midfield as one of the best in the world, and without Pirlo, we might need an extra effort from our players.   Madzukic: This guy. I've seen him play for Bayern and for Atleti, he always fights till the end and gives his all. I like his attitude, though he might seem like an asshole sometimes. I expect at least 20 goals from him this season in all competitions.   Rugani: How long have I been waiting for this kid. It's finally happening! Rugani will play for us :) I hope to see him more than we saw Ogbonna last season, hopefully he will become as solid as Bonucci and start for us in a couple of years.

Juve,3d57fc,aakashd93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant be loaned out if we purchase him. Will make the edit."
Juve,3d57fc,clapton86,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:25 2015 UTC,I just want Rugani to not be a flop. We need an Italian world class cb.
Juve,3d57fc,ghobbins,2,Wed Jul 15 10:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Mandzu will start from day one. I hope he finds a rhythm domestically early or we're in trouble.  Tevez leaving gives Morata and Dybala a lot more space to shine. I'll be interested to see who does better between the two and who combines better with Mandzu and the midfielders. I don't think it's a given that Morata will start over Dybala. Morata scored some big goals in the CL but wasn't extremely effective domestically.  Khedira should play as much as possible and I'd expect him to put pressure on Pogba and Marchisio. I could see Allegri putting Khedira in the Pirlo role with Marchisio and Pogba slidghtly ahead of him with Vidal in the hole behind the strikers.  For Rugani, the best case scenario is a situation where he gets an extended run of play. I'd like to see him beat out Barza for the #3 center back spot.  Overall, I'm excited but it's important to realize our offense will be in transition. We won't have Tevez and Pirlo to help us scrape by when we desperately need a goal (which happened a lot last season). We need our scoring midfielders to pick up the slack like in the early Conte years. Could be another huge year for Vidal and Pogba."

Juve,3d49ux,mucco,3,Mon Jul 13 12:07:45 2015 UTC,Madness how highly some rate him despite so few performances.
Juve,3d49ux,alpha1028,2,Mon Jul 13 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"Shows a lot of promise, but yeah I agree. I remember he looked great in that first game vs. Chievo but he is still quite raw. Hope to see him get more playing time.  This was also reported by Di Marzio a few days back."
Juve,3d49ux,SeveredGarden,2,Mon Jul 13 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"Could you post that article?   I'm glad we turned down the offer personally. I really like Coman, yes he's still young and raw so to speak, but I feel like when he does play we've been witness to a player who has that creative spark. When he touches the ball I feel like things can happen."

Juve,3d4yqx,renopeno,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:49 2015 UTC,5 is now clear for sami. i would take the 5.
Juve,3d4yqx,man_overb0ard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:22:51 2015 UTC,Ideally it'd go to that world class LB signing we desperately need...
Juve,3d4yqx,ghobbins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"in brazil 5 is the number of a midfielder, and 6 the number of the left back, that's why i think sami should take, i'm used to it. ;)"
Juve,3d4yqx,man_overb0ard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:51:27 2015 UTC,I've seen it both ways. For me the cleanest thing is:  GK: 1 CB: 2 and 3 RB and LB: 4 and 5 DM: 6 CM: 8 AM: 10 Wingers: 7 and 11 Striker: 9
Juve,3d4yqx,ghobbins,2,Mon Jul 13 21:59:02 2015 UTC,I remember the 2 as a RB number. Thinking of Cafu...
Juve,3d4yqx,SgtPepe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:55:55 2015 UTC,Where is this taken from?
Juve,3d4yqx,soldado3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:57 2015 UTC,Plus Vadala we've signed 4 strikers. I'm slightly concerned about other positions especially our fullback options. I won't mind seeing Isla coming back but at least do something rather than remaining the same as last season. On the left I'm not really worried with Asamoah coming back but he's not a natural fullback either
Juve,3d28yx,kurt_rolson,9,Sun Jul 12 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"If there is anything to say about Zaza is that he has a great attitude. Guy works his fucking ass off and seems to love Juve. Wouldn't be upset to see him to do really well and then link up with Berardi next year in the black and white.  He seemed to lack consistency,  but maybe being at Juve will help that."
Juve,3d28yx,Killagina,3,Mon Jul 13 00:54:14 2015 UTC,The future is so very bright for Juve!!
Juve,3d28yx,soldado3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:04:42 2015 UTC,Maybe if we sign a fucking left back and get Scuffet. I'm getting pretty annoyed with our lack of fullbacks and the lack of a proactive approach to finding a Buffon replacement.
Juve,3d28yx,Killagina,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:33 2015 UTC,We're probably still hoping Leali will develop. Don't think it's as likely anymore.
Juve,3d28yx,khdbdcm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:19 2015 UTC,"He still looks very capable, he just hasn't been getting the limelight as much. Scuffet made a number of mistakes when he played last season so its not so black and white for him becoming as good as people thought when he burst onto the scene. It would be nice to get an option on him though somehow."

Juve,3d28yx,soldado3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:47:01 2015 UTC,idk about De Sciglio - seems more of a risk now. Let him play out a bit more then I may consider it
Juve,3d28yx,aakashd93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"I like Berardi's attitude, he wanted to stay in Sassuolo and keep getting minutes, but I also like Zaza's attitude, he feels like he's ready to play in a big club, and the first person that must believe that is him."
Juve,3d28yx,SgtPepe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:54:16 2015 UTC,i have a feeling that khedira will be a beast in the middle of the park.
Juve,3d0tfu,Derwaeg,14,Sun Jul 12 15:54:02 2015 UTC,...why?... A 30-year old forward who relies on speed more than technique and can't finish 9 out of 10 chances and who consistently underwhelms wherever he plays.  Why not just recall Berardi?
Juve,3d0tfu,dc10101,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"Berardi would get more playing time at Sass. While I'd love for Berardi to be at Juventus, Max Allegri has always said it's going to be 4-3-whatever. Signing Lavezzi is short term, yes, but it allows Berardi to grow at Sass for our long term."
Juve,3d0tfu,aakashd93,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"eh maybe. If Allegri's fully committed to playing three attacking players, be it with wingers or a trequartista, there would be plenty of playing time for Berardi. Coman is the one who would suffer the most.  Edit: I say that making the assumption that Llorente won't be here next year."
Juve,3d0tfu,dc10101,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:12:51 2015 UTC,I think Coman will go out on loan. Berardi also felt that he wouldn't get the most playing time at Juve this season - he wants to play and be ready in case he gets called up for the Euros. You know how Conte is - really calls up those who perform well.
Juve,3d0tfu,aakashd93,2,Sun Jul 12 23:06:10 2015 UTC,You know how Conte is - really calls up those who perform well.    Was that sarcasm or are we talking about different Contes?

Juve,3d0tfu,spiz,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"If he comes, it means a seriously approach to 4-3-3 right?  Its good for Mandzu and Zaza, but what about Morata and Dybala? I know that Morata played a lot as a winger under Mourinho's Real, but can Dybala be a winger?"
Juve,3d0tfu,Pedro_Matos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:58:06 2015 UTC,We lack some wingers if we play 433 unless Morata and Dybala convert to professional wingers outright. The possibility of it is meager. I really don't see our current squad enables us to play 433 in a champions league level before we get Berardi back
Juve,3d0tfu,dellealpi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:54:13 2015 UTC,We can play a 4-3-3 like we did in the 90's with only one true winger and a pacey forward playing more forward than the other winger. The 4-3-3 takes many forms
Juve,3d0tfu,Killagina,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"Dybala will play the wing as well, probably on the right."

Juve,3d0tfu,man_overb0ard,0,Sun Jul 12 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"It's a sticky situation. In a 4-3-1-2, whoever is chosen as the trequartista will be out of position. In a 4-3-3, both wingers could possibly be playing out of position.  It's only in the 3-5-2 can we ensure everyone is playing their primary position."
