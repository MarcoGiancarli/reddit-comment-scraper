Defenders,3e1cpd,MTDearing,21,Tue Jul 21 06:07:19 2015 UTC,"Well, given he created Jessica Jones in the first place, seeing the show ahead of us makes sense."
Defenders,3e1cpd,ScrabCrab,17,Tue Jul 21 06:24:34 2015 UTC,if course that's only natural. But what OP is saying is that if they have two complete episodes they then have plenty of stuff to use for a trailer.
Defenders,3e1cpd,iampattym,8,Tue Jul 21 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with not seeing a trailer for a while. Ant-Man gave me hype fatigue so bad. I am pretty sure I enjoyed the movie less than I would have if I hadn't seen 4000 different trailers ads and clips.   I definitely want to see a good trailer, but if they start the hype train now, I am afraid they will keep  it going at full speed for months."

Defenders,3dirz7,Delvoire,55,Thu Jul 16 16:38:10 2015 UTC,Here's what Daredevil got nominated for.
Defenders,3dirz7,jocab_w,15,Thu Jul 16 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"I could see it winning 'Outstanding Main Title Design' and 'Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series', I'm a tiny bit disappointed Vincent D'Onofrio didn't get a support actor nomination."
Defenders,3dirz7,khcloud,22,Thu Jul 16 19:59:58 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Thanks, I couldn't find anything, but then again didn't look under those categories.  Blows my mind that they didn't get Cinematography though.  That series has some of the best shots I've seen on film, possibly ever.  We all know the Hallway scene, but I loved the car scene that followed the action outside as well."
Defenders,3dirz7,McIgglyTuffMuffin,14,Thu Jul 16 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"That's the problem though, like /u/TheWooSensation says it's a generic looking show.  Sure there are a few standout scenes, like the hallway scene, but for the most part it isn't anything special. It's much more amazing to me that a show like Hannibal, using as an example since it isn't eligible this year, doesn't get a nom in the cinematography category."
Defenders,3dirz7,your_mind_aches,3,Thu Jul 16 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"It's a network show. I'm not surprised. If it moves over to cable, I'm sure the Emmys would suddenly take notice of it.   I'm pretty much done with caring about the Emmys anyway. I'll join the campaign for the shows I like that have a chance, but I won't overly care about the outcome. Most of my favourite shows aren't ""Emmy worthy"" anyway."
Defenders,3dirz7,higuy5121,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Hannibal just does the whole ""dark cinematography"" thing to the point where it's just corny, but that's just me."
Defenders,3dirz7,McIgglyTuffMuffin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"I do think that sometimes some scenes are way too dark, but for the most part I think it's one of the most beautiful shows on television. At least in season 1 and 2.  At the moment I'm not holding season 3 to the same regard."
Defenders,3dirz7,austinbucco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:26 2015 UTC,Are you saying that the cinematography this season hasn't been as good?
Defenders,3dirz7,Xaguta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:07:55 2015 UTC,Reads that way doesn't it?
Defenders,3dirz7,McIgglyTuffMuffin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"To me, I loved the way the show looked and felt, through it's cinematography.   I also don't watch Hannibal, which both of you have compared it to and said was better."
Defenders,3dirz7,Electrorocket,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the way Daredevil looks but at the same time it just didn't feel special. I feel like you could mix it up with scenes from something like Arrow and it would feel the same."
Defenders,3dirz7,Electrorocket,3,Thu Jul 16 19:22:01 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd go  that far.
Defenders,3dirz7,TheWooSensation,3,Fri Jul 17 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"Hannibal is amazing, like crazy good. Next level shit, man."
Defenders,3dirz7,Anivair,37,Fri Jul 17 00:29:02 2015 UTC,Hyperbole much?  House of Cards has overall much better cinematography as does the disappointing 2nd season of True Detective (one of these two will most likely win). Daredevil does have the one standout scene but the show for the most part looks like a generic crime show. The show is great but I don't know if having amazing cinematography during all the talking in a show like this would add anything.   The true show that's going to get shafted for the cinematography nomination is Hannibal. It is far and away the best looking show right now.
Defenders,3dirz7,Pooperism,6,Thu Jul 16 18:31:15 2015 UTC,I feel like where Daredevil really crushed it was lighting.
Defenders,3dirz7,DoobieDoctor5000,10,Fri Jul 17 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"YES! I completely agree. The lighting and sound (which it got is nomination for) were easily the best departments on this show. Straight from the first episode where we see the billboard coming in through the window to the fight scene at the end, it was great out of the gate."
Defenders,3dirz7,deptford,3,Fri Jul 17 05:06:30 2015 UTC,Omg Hannibal... and neither amazon nor netflix will pick it up!
Defenders,3dirz7,DoobieDoctor5000,-2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:01 2015 UTC,Hannibal without Anthony Hopkins is like Breaking Bad without Bryan Cranston or Dexter without Michael C Hall. FAIL

Defenders,3dirz7,deptford,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:30 2015 UTC,Hannibal wasn't eligible for the Emmys this year. I have no doubt it'll be nominated at least for cinematography next year.

Defenders,3dirz7,soulbreaker1418,5,Fri Jul 17 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"Well some shows like say... The Flash or maybe like... Supernatural where the special effects are at the forefront and are necessary for the story they're telling. In daredevil, the special effects weren't at all NECESSARY for the story but they added to it quite well. Like when we see what he ""sees"" with his world on fire.  I'm sort of just talking out of my ass but that's my assumption of what the award entails."

Defenders,3d7x11,skcih,20,Tue Jul 14 05:17:15 2015 UTC,D'Onofrio is such a great actor and commands such a presence on screen that it would be disrespectful to just shoehorn him in an episode or two and take away from the main plot with another villain who is being developed.   When the Defenders series get released (with all the villains teaming up or whatever) I think he would be better there.
Defenders,3d7x11,BearZeBubus,15,Tue Jul 14 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"I think you can have his story arc continue on in jail and have him develop more of his ruthlessness while locked away.

Defenders,3cx84m,LastRedShoulder,2,Sun Jul 12 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Then again Charlie Cox is definitely not how a pictured Murdock but he has such a compelling voice that it's actually made like the character more. In the comics Daredevil often came off a little too self righteous for me, but something about Charlie's voice makes me empathize with him, and blunts some of traits I found unlikable.  I think Bernthal will be able to give us that mix of qualities necessary to feed the divided Punisher fan-base. Everybody has a different view of the Punisher, but in the end we all want him handled with respect and Bernthal seems to be on the same page."
Defenders,3cx84m,youmonsterikill,2,Sun Jul 12 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"I find the comic DD to be a bit more of a playboy, and Charlie to be a bit more serious. He also reminds me a lot of Will Graham from Hannibal! haha.  I really enjoyed the Warzone movie... minus the Parkour, or whatever. I feel like with some edits it could have been really good. I think Ray did a good job and had a physical presence."
Defenders,3cx84m,LastRedShoulder,2,Sun Jul 12 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"I totally get the Will Graham from Hannibal thing, and I can even suggest why in case you weren't aware. Both actors are British and they have a very distinct ways of enunciating the more ""American"" parts of their speech patterns. Before I picked up on it I just noticed I liked the way they talked, it sounded precise and a little forceful. A good voice for a superhero!  I think Ray did the best job he could but I actually was one of the few people who felt he was miscast. After loving Titus on Rome I was dismayed to hear he'd be playing the Punisher because the thing about Ray is he strikes me as a gentle giant. Even when he was severing limbs and cracking skulls he has very 'kind' facial features that I don't find particularly menacing. He was big though, and I liked all the tactical thought that went into the outfit.  They got a few things right in the 2004 version too which I admittedly liked better, but on the whole it felt like a decent action flick with Punisher elements tacked on. It didn't feel like a Punisher movie.  You liked Ray Stevenson but if you could have your ideal Punisher casting pick, is there anyone else you would have chosen? I can never settle on anyone."
Defenders,3cx84m,youmonsterikill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"Well, in some comics like MAX, Punisher is a bit withdrawn and silent, I think that gentleness plays similarly.  He just has that slick back hair look down.  I haven't seen the 2004 version in a long, long time. I should probably watch it again.  I think Tom Hardy would do a great job, though his face is a bit too sensual. I think he could bring it to life and has even mentioned wanting to do it. He's a very masculine and physical actor that could be menacing just with his body language, which I feel is important.  I'm not a guy who knows a lot of actors beyond the ones I really, really like, so I can't say. I just feel like Bernthal is too ethnic looking in a way... the top of his head is just too small.  John fucking Hamm would be a great Punisher! http://feelgrafix.com/data_images/out/22/938180-jon-hamm.jpg  He has that classic face that would nail it perfect. He would just have to grit it up a bit and be pretty physical."

Defenders,3cq2t9,soulbreaker1418,4,Fri Jul 10 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see Snipes now, I can only think of an article I saw on reddit a while back that said during the filming of Blade 2, Snipes threw a fit at one point and spent the rest of the time in his trailer.  He would only communicate with the director by sending him post-it notes that were signed ""From Blade""."
Defenders,3cq2t9,amanzarak,27,Fri Jul 10 13:18:59 2015 UTC,No thanks. Get someone else and we can talk.
Defenders,3cq2t9,twistedmixes,2,Thu Jul 9 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"yeah he´s an awesome fighter very intimidating, but old and not good a good actor at all, i´m sure there are many young actors that would kill for the role. On the other hand, an homage would be nice as a minor role, mentor or whatever"
Defenders,3cq2t9,soulbreaker1418,-8,Fri Jul 10 19:58:32 2015 UTC,Agreed
Defenders,3cq2t9,Anivair,2,Thu Jul 9 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"Blade could be pretty cool to incorporate into the MCU but he definitely shouldn't be played by Snipes in that case. With Daredevil and Punisher, they will have a pretty rich and developed streetlevel scene going.  Maybe we should get Morbius in as a one or two episode villain?"
Defenders,3cq2t9,Micp,2,Thu Jul 9 23:42:55 2015 UTC,They could just insert a shot of a post-it note from Blade into Jessica Jones.
Defenders,3cq2t9,mrglow,2,Fri Jul 10 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"Blade should make a comeback, Snipes not included."

Defenders,3cq2t9,CasualToast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"Simple.  Make Daredevil 3 be about Daredevil, Elektra and Blade teaming up against vampires.  They still haven't cast Iron Fist nor started production on Luke Cage so the way things are going we could see Daredevil 3 before The Defenders.  We could even have a Moon Knight cameo somewhere in there in time for The Defenders.  And The Defenders could have a Ghost Rider cameo too."
Defenders,3cq2t9,martinfphipps,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:44:13 2015 UTC,"Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm, GoT) is the perfect actor for a Blade reboot. Go back to his origins as a Londoner so we can erase the memory of Blade Trinity."

Defenders,3cq2t9,Archardy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"Snipes doesn't have a lot of range as an actor.  He has the martial arts chops and I enjoyed some of the fights in the blade movies, but he started throwing fits in Blade 2, and in Blade 3 there were tons of problems to get him to show up to work.  Many of his gripes were sharing the screen with other actors, taking a team player role, having Ryan Reynolds get jokes, not wanting to be seen being rescued on screen, tons of other problems.  They really had to work hard around him using stunt doubles and odd camera shots and editing to make it look like he finished the film.    Marvel had enough of this sort of thing by the time Ed Norton showed up and tried to do the same thing with the Incredible Hulk, which is too bad because I liked his take on the character and how they did that movie and would have liked to have seen a sequel or two.    That all being said, prison can have a truly humbling experience on a person, Michael Vick comes to mind as do a few others who came out of the big house changed men.  It would be a gamble, and Snipes is ten years older now... I'd vote no though if it was up to me.  His history of being unstable and frankly outside of doing kicks and punches, his acting is really one-dimensional.  I enjoy his method approach to some of his roles, but too risky since his tantrums back in Blade 2 & 3 caused set-backs for Marvel"
Defenders,3cq2t9,ultramexicanman,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:45:12 2015 UTC,I want Michael C. Jordan to play new blade.

Defenders,3cq2t9,Vaccino,2,Thu Jul 9 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Well we still don't know if Fantfourstic will do well. If it does well critically and financially, it'd probably be safe to assume that Michael B. Jordan won't do any Marvel Studios movies. Well- unless Marvel and Fox make a deal, but their relationship is all myeh.  The original Fantastic Four movies weren't ever really good. Which is a good thing. If Fantastic Four was good we might have never gotten Chris Evans as Captain America."

Defenders,3cjyrf,crapusername47,9,Wed Jul 8 18:53:37 2015 UTC,I definitely enjoyed Secret Invasion more than Civil War as an comic book event. Though I don't think it translate to an MCU movie very well - you need a long-running series to build up the relationships between the characters so that the betrayals feel more significant.
Defenders,3cjyrf,Astrokiwi,4,Wed Jul 8 18:56:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's also the issue that the invasion was deeply rooted in Marvel's storylines for years prior.   Bendis had it planned out from at least the point where Electro attacks the prison in New Avengers #1 but it goes back even further than that as Secret War ties into it too.
Defenders,3cjyrf,crapusername47,5,Wed Jul 8 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"It was essentially the main storyline for most of his New Avengers storyline (plus some Civil War in the middle). I guess the Defenders is going to be pretty similar to the New Avengers, but I feel the tone isn't going to fit with the idea of a secret alien invasion, and the length (probably one 10-12 episode season) isn't really long enough to build this up properly."

Given that most actors don't come from a martial arts background - Charlie Cox included, I'm assuming - obviously casting someone without that experience is common and okay BUT I think it's awesome that she does have martial arts experience and such a roll isn't new to her, so she can just add that extra little something that an untrained actor wouldn't.    The fight scenes in season 1 WOWed us, can't wait to see how much more amazing they'll be in season 2!"

Defenders,3cis79,rew9,22,Wed Jul 8 06:07:32 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons. Some spoilers to follow, I'm sure.   First and foremost is that was what the creators of the character wanted to create. It also serves to do a few other things.    Sets up the easy concept of ""blind justice"". Low hanging fruit. His blindness gives reason for his abilities. It's kind of lame for a hero to gain enhanced senses except for sight. The thing that seals the deal is that blindness actually does this in real life. People that are born or become blind strengthen their other senses to compensate as they are the only way for them to percieve the world. This is because humans are naturally sight-based creatures. We rely on sight more than any other sense (aside from maybe touch/equilibrium) and if you take that away the simple act of trying to be aware with your remaining senses makes them stronger. Daredevil is special because this natural strengthening of senses if compounded to the nth degree thanks to the circumstances of his blindness.  It gives him an interesting weakness that not many other characters have. It's true that in most cases he might as well not be blind. But it has been exploited before, such as the time with Nobu.  It also serves as a more mundane disability. He can't distinguish color or light. The painting that Vanessa shows him probably has a smell and audio profile that allows him to ""see"" it and identify it as different from the other paintings, but can he really appreciate the painting as a person with sight can? Not really."
Defenders,3cis79,Wark_Kweh,13,Wed Jul 8 13:34:06 2015 UTC,"Being blind allowed him to focus more on his ability to ""see"" it enhanced his ""sight"" if he wasn't blind, I don't believe his ability would be as powerful as they are now. Its like how blind people develop their other senses more with the loss of sight, hearing is improved, smell, Taste, etc."

Defenders,3cc7jb,Dr_Midnite,8,Mon Jul 6 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"S1 started filming in July as well, so it would probably be released around the same time (April-ish). Based on the filming timeline for the other shows, I assume Luke Cage will come out about June-August (that is, assuming there is 4 months of post-production after the reported final film date in March)."
Defenders,3cc7jb,sophoclesantigone,4,Mon Jul 6 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"Very likely around that time. They wrapped season one last December and it was released four-ish months after.   Jessica Jones is still filming at the moment, so maybe done by the end of the summer for a holiday release this year?"

Defenders,3cc7jb,RichardBlackDJ,7,Tue Jul 7 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Daredevil is on a schedule more akin to that of a film (i.e. it's filmed all at once and then post-production starts) whereas AoS is filmed and edited in a per episode basis. So with AoS, they'll film the first few episodes and send them to post; meanwhile, the crew continues filming the next few episodes, rinse, repeat, until all scenes have been filmed. I can't recall when exactly S2 wrapped filming, but I seem to remember it was after S2.5 had begun airing.  TL;DR--yes, it's probably because Daredevil releases all at once."

Defenders,3c8rik,youmonsterikill,28,Sun Jul 5 23:30:19 2015 UTC,Ennis Max version. I feel like Punisher should be the darkest and most out of place character is the MCU. You made some great points but that version of the Character is the best but i would fine to see Rucka's mixed in but the Ennis verison should be the most prominent version.I want to see Slavers in live action.
Defenders,3c8rik,SwagBelow,10,Sun Jul 5 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt Ennis has done the most definitive version to date. Rucka's is almost like a compromised Ennis, like if you had to shoehorn him into another characters run, that's how I'd do it.  The only other concern is Bernthal is pretty young. Part of what sold Ennis' Punisher to me is imagining just how long he's been doing this, and how much he's seen. I also wonder if they're going to acknowledge the specifics of his military service, I hope to god they don't try to shift him into modern times.  If DD can live an version of Hell's kitchen that has more gangsters than hipsters, Pun can come from world where Vietnam war lasted into the 80's."
Defenders,3c8rik,SwagBelow,10,Sun Jul 5 23:46:23 2015 UTC,I think they will make him an Iraq veteran. I am Ok if they do though but Daredevil's Hell kitchen is bad because of what happened in Avengers so i think the Iraq or Afghanistan origin can work. I will say i would like to see Rucka's story lines like with Rachael and War zone when he fights the Avengers. I think they should start with him being a version of Ennis's run and Rucka's run.
Defenders,3c8rik,SwagBelow,8,Sun Jul 5 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"Fairly certain Tom Jane's Pun was Desert Storm then FBI.  I really don't think the Punisher works as well in Iraq. While there are significant parallels in terms of mentality, and trauma experienced by the soldiers, it was the complete lack of structure and support that pushed Frank Castle to the breaking point.  I think it could be done, but it needs work. I think maybe establishing that he was a long term prisoner of war who fought his way out would be both a topical and cogent way to establish Castle's grit and the amount of shit he had to deal with, alone.  Just thoughts, happy to have someone to bounce them off of."
Defenders,3c8rik,candidateHundred,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:12:10 2015 UTC,Yeah that can work and I hope they make a version of the Born story from the comics and just change the location to Afghanistan or Iraq. I could see that as an origin for him in an episode of his own show.
Defenders,3c8rik,TheGoshDarnedBatman,3,Mon Jul 6 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"I think the current ""broken down"" hells kitchen the show portrays makes a good excuse of how the Alien assault totally changed the dynamics of that area.  With the gangsters trying to pick up the pieces.   So I don't think Punisher would need any Watchmen-esque alternate history for his backstory.  I can see them going for Afghanistan vet."

Defenders,3c8rik,soulbreaker1418,18,Mon Jul 6 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"Oh god. Amazing.  Ironically in Punisher kills the marvel universe they start it out with a really great scene of Murdock and Castle being childhood acquaintances. I always kind of liked that idea. An Irish American and an Italian American, in that neighborhood, at that time, a lot of potential for interesting stories, I'm picturing like Black Donnelys MCU.  I though it would be cool in Daredevil if they sort of knew of each other, but didn't know each other. Like Frank could remember when Battlin' Jack Murdock was gunned down, heard his kid was orphaned. Or Murdock could remember hearing about Frankie from down the street joining the marines.  I don't know could be cool. Or they could be lizard people, that works too."

Defenders,3c8rik,SwagBelow,10,Mon Jul 6 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of the Punisher, but I'm a really big fan of the way the MCU has drawn on the Ultimate material, and I'd like to see more of that for Frank Castle.  Ultimate Punisher clashes with Daredevil when Frank kills his ex-partner while that cop is meeting with his attorney, Matt Murdoch. Later on, Matt takes Frank on as a client, which is a plotline I'd appreciate seeing. I might be the only person who wished there was more legal drama in the first season of Daredevil, and seeing Frank on the stand is always a hoot.   Ultimate Punisher also spends a great deal of his time in prison, which would provide the potential for scenes with the Kingpin. Another aspect of that character I'd appreciate seeing in the show is his popularity with regular people, who think the justice system and superheroes are too soft on crime."
Defenders,3c8rik,commenter_on_reddit,9,Mon Jul 6 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"I too would like to see more legal drama in the show, mostly because it's one thing I can get from daredevil and almost nowhere else in Marvel. ('Cept She-Hulk.) They should play to their strengths and find ways to weave the characters between Matt Murdock and Daredevil. I think Castle being put on trial, or arrested would be a great way to connect the characters.  I was never fond of the ultimates, especially ultimate Punisher. It felt like he was never written by someone who liked or understood the character. This is a constant for the Punisher as his divisive nature means people who see him as a brute, write him as a brute.  Most importantly though, the cop angle is awful. Punisher needs to be a soldier, it's integral to the character. Especially in this political climate, can you imagine them running with a cop who kills people he thinks are guilty? Cops aren't trained killers. The leap for Frank has to be organic. Killing is what he does, and it should feel like a natural response for his character."
Defenders,3c8rik,SwagBelow,6,Mon Jul 6 03:01:43 2015 UTC,"Especially in this political climate, can you imagine them running with a cop who kills people he thinks are guilty?    Well yeah, if he's the Daredevil's antagonist, I can imagine that going over pretty well. In the context of the Hell's Kitchen that the show has set up an ex-cop who fights crime as a vigilante without a mask and who focuses on killing corrupt cops could be a popular figure, like the way there were people trying to be Batman in the latest Batman movie.  Would you say that Kingpin was written as a brute in Season One of Daredevil? I liked that he was a villain with shades of gray, and I think Punisher will be fulfilling a similar role in Season Two."
Defenders,3c8rik,omnitricks,3,Mon Jul 6 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"I thought Kingpin was very well written. He was sympathetic enough without ever really questioning his villainy. At least that was my perspective.  The difference is while he is the antagonist, Punisher isn't a villain. Sidestepping philosophical and moral questions, the punisher has been portrayed as the 'hero' protagonist of his own comics, games, and films for more than 30 years. This can not end the same way as Fisk's Arc, because the writers are smart enough to know that you don't heavily distort core characters of the Marvel Universe. Punisher is an Anti-hero and I have faith that he will be portrayed as such.  Odds are based on the material they chose from season one, the new showrunners will likely be drawing on more of Frank Miller's work. And on David Lapham's means and ends. Seems appropriate given how Kingpin's imprisonment is the catalyst for that story."

Defenders,3c8rik,LastRedShoulder,3,Mon Jul 6 03:42:48 2015 UTC,Ultimate Punisher would be terrible. The Punisher has been described as the greatest solider in the world and as destrctive as the Hulk and a cop does not come close to that.
Defenders,3c8rik,dating_derp,-2,Mon Jul 6 03:47:10 2015 UTC,Like I said I'm not a fan of that version of the Punisher. Also I don't think the greatest soldier in the world with Hulk level destruction would make a good villain for Netflix's Daredevil - a hero who has come very close to dying in a fight with street thugs.
Defenders,3c8rik,TheDalekCaan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:15:11 2015 UTC,Daredevil is going to be a better fighter every season. They had him get beat up because it was the origin story. He will one of the top fighters in the MCU.
Defenders,3c8rik,Lorahalo,3,Mon Jul 6 12:36:21 2015 UTC,"Rucka Punisher. An unstoppable force of nature that people just don't want to deal with and do their best to get by. Since it IS a Daredevil series it would work well because Punisher would fit as a supporting character without hogging much of the limelight.  The memorable Punisher from War Journal during Civil War/World War Hulk/Suicide Kings. Displays the resourcefulness and adaptability of Frank when selecting and using his gear. Now the MCU doesn't have much of that gear to use...aside from Hydra experiments/Shield vault/Chitauri leftovers/Stark tech but if Frank uses it, its definitely going to be a trip.  Ennis Punisher is also definitely in because he always one ups the other heroes. Even if Frank doesn't get an ongoing and is only a guest in all the other planned series, it is still going to be a hoot.  I also daresay I want a little Ultimate Punisher in there because MCU Hell's Kitchen seems to have a lot of dirty cops and in comparison, Ultimate Punisher has no problems dealing with dirty cops."

Defenders,3c8rik,woodsoffeels,3,Tue Jul 7 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"Late 80's/Early 90's run works for me. He is going to have to be pretty violent and murdery though - as DD is pretty vigilante in the first season. It's questionable, especially if you aren't paying close attention, how far he will go.  I thought the guy that he threw off the roof would die.  Dan Abnett's year one would probably translate the easiest as they will most definitely tell his origin.  Obviously they deal with Horn Head's desire to take a life in the last half of the season, but the distinction needs to be made."

""He kills gangsters because gangsters killed his wife and kids"" isn't a hard think to explain without taking a lot of time. Especially on a show that isn't really about him.

They didn't spend a lot of time on Batman's origin in the 1989 movie, or the Hulk's origin in the Incredible Hulk, or on Frank's in two of the his own movies. They don't have to spend a lot of time on his to make people get it. If they feel the need to expand, they can do flashbacks in his own show later on. All you have to do is acknowledge that his family was murdered by gangsters, and now he kills gangsters, and the general public will know what's up. Especially since his name is ""The Punisher""."

We can disagree on lots of things, but we need to agree on that. Then we can move on from this back and forth."

I also have this concern that the directors that they bring on to the series won't come with the an appreciation for the classic kung fu movies that were the inspiration for the character.

Thor has 'magic' in it and It's fairly easy to say their are similar energies within the Marvel cinematic universe that border the mystical others can tap into.

I came to terms with also enjoying art from people whose political, and social views I disagree with. It could change the interpretation of the art, considering its meaning. The piece may still hold some value and should not be immediately disregarded. Like for example Orson Scott Card's works vs. ""anti-gay"" views.  Wow I went off on a tangent here.

Defenders,3bo6u6,pitaenigma,11,Wed Jul 1 02:36:18 2015 UTC,"Punisher MAX and Born are the definitive Punisher reads, in my opinion. They flesh out just how unhinged he is. Too many Punisher books glorify the violence in an attempt to be bad-ass. The MAX and Born books use violence to demonstrate why he's the paradigm anti-hero. He's not a good guy at all; he's just a guy who happens to be killing the people society thinks are bad, but could just as easily be killing anyone else - because he's an insane mass murderer. A Punisher TV storyline that deals with the thin line between vigilante and serial killer would be awesome. Although that sounds more or less like a more action oriented version of the show Dexter."

Defenders,3bo6u6,TheBlackSpank,4,Wed Jul 1 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"If he can get caught up on Jason Aaron's Punisher MAX series and Greg Rucka's THE Punisher series, he'll be in good shape to represent the darkest hero in the Marvel Universe.

Defenders,3bpi1j,JuanRiveara,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"I like her too, but do we really need her if we have Elektra?"
Defenders,3bpi1j,Rheul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:00:53 2015 UTC,Maybe season four onwards. She's a cool character but doing her directly after Elektra is a bit redundant.
Defenders,3bpi1j,hargendarsh,0,Sat Jul 4 05:24:35 2015 UTC,They should bring in Echo in a season that features Kingpin as the Big Bad and not Wilson Fisk. I want Echo to feature in a season when Wilson embraces his Kingpin persona and becomes even more monstrous then season 1. So in season 3 or 4 or when if the Kingpin becomes prominent in a later season.

Defenders,3bllyz,JuanRiveara,3,Thu Jul 2 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"Like the soap opera moments. For Arrow Season 3 practically all of Oliver and Felicity's romance which is by far the worst part of the season for me. Especially in finale when Felicity says ""We need to save Oliver!"" and Roy says ""I need to make a cure to save the city"" and Felicity says ""But Oliver!"" those lines sum up it pretty well. There's some other moments but ""Olicity""(what a stupid name) specifically was terribly done and might nearly ruin one of the most iconic comic romances of all time, Green Arrow and Black Canary, though I'm not the biggest fan of Laurel either."
Defenders,3bllyz,your_mind_aches,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"If you hate ""soap opera moments"" you'll hate Spider-Man hahaha  EDIT: I agree though. That was the stupidest thing of the season. Of the whole series. But hush your mouth about the name Olicity. :P   Also, it's Ray, not Roy."
Defenders,3bllyz,JuanRiveara,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:43:19 2015 UTC,Yeah but it doesn't seem like they're going to make it have a lot of Soap Opera moments and make seem real which I appreciate.

Defenders,3bllyz,JuanRiveara,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but it seems like their going to make the high school stuff realistic and like a soap opera. When Feige said that they're going for John Hughes vibe it made me more excited for Spider-Man since it seems like they're not going to focus on BS love triangles and over dramatic acting.
Defenders,3bllyz,your_mind_aches,2,Mon Jul 6 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"But that's literally teenage drama. People always complain about ""teenage drama"" in Arrow. Couldn't they fine more descriptive words for it?"

Defenders,3bigu7,dirty30m,7,Mon Jun 29 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"One potential problem that I see in this is that DD is supposed to tie into the rest of the Defenders, so its entirely possible that one wont know which parts of DD are fluff and which are essential until the release of the remaining series.   That said, I enjoy fan edits (but have no skills to contribute), good luck & I'll watch it when it's done!"
Defenders,3bigu7,thatfreakygirl,3,Mon Jun 29 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"This. A lot of seemingly meaningless scenes may be integral to another part of the overall story. However, if you were to cut out some of it just for the sake of trimming it down...    The fight scenes, while AWESOME, are also very long. They can be shortened, while still retaining most of the 'awesome' factor. For example, in Nelson v. Murdock, Matt jumps on top of a dude in a train yard for fiddlin' with his daughter. He ends up punching the guy like 6-7 times. I feel like if we had a POV shot from the guy Matt is punching, and then having Matt only throw ONE punch, then immediately cut to black, then back to Matt in present time, it would send the same message of ""vengeance"" and ""justice"" that is so important to the character, without having to show Matt beating the tar out of someone we know he can beat the tar out of.    Another point I can make is Matt's Catholicism, while important to the character, drags a lot in the show if one isn't religious. I wouldn't advise cutting all of it out, but a lot of it isn't very important in my opinion.    Aside from that, there isn't much else you can cut out without hurting the character or plot development."
Defenders,3bigu7,iiJakexD123,3,Mon Jun 29 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"See but the point of those repeated punches is to blur the line between good and bad; yes, Matt stopped that guy but look how needlessly violent he was. It feeds into that question of is he doing this because it's right or because he enjoys hurting people?   This is the problem with shortening anything. There's a reason it's that long."
Defenders,3bigu7,OnBenchNow,3,Mon Jun 29 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's a really good point. This is why shortening anything is really difficult. It wasn't written to be a feature length film, it was written to be a 13 episode TV show. :P"
Defenders,3bigu7,iiJakexD123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:17:17 2015 UTC,that is why it is going to be so tough to do :(
Defenders,3bigu7,Tanokki,3,Tue Jun 30 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"Well, you could probably condense episode 1 into half an hour, use anything non-flashback of episode 2, followed by a montage to show Daredevil fighting the Russians/Ben and Karen investigating and meeting Fisk's mom, throw in a couple scenes of Fisk and Vanessa growing close, and Matt talking to Fisk on the radio.   Then cut to Matt finding and fighting Nobu, short version of Nelson V Murdock (Foggy finds out about Daredevil and Foggy leaves pissed), Vanessa gets poisoned, and Matt talks to Father Lantom about his conflict and Lantom drops his Rwanda story. Cut to Wesley abducting and being killed by Karen, followed by Fisk finding the body and finding out that Karen and Urich talked to his mom.   By now you're at about 3 and a half hours, so from here on you can show Fisk's attack on Urich through the end of the season. It's about 5 and a half hours and will probably drop a lot of character development (Stick would be completely removed), but it'll get the job done."

Defenders,3b83tk,RetConBomb,6,Sat Jun 27 04:06:48 2015 UTC,Maybe that's why the two fight
Defenders,3b83tk,Mark_1231,9,Sat Jun 27 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I imagine it going something like this:  Punisher's family has recently been killed. Maybe it happens during the show, maybe it's already happened before the season starts, but I think it will be fresh.  DD is chasing random goon probably not tied to primary story of the season when Punisher interferes violently. Punisher says something super quotable. DD is upset by the murder and gives chase. DD follows into an abandoned building, hears a high pitched trigger, and looks down at his feet just long enough to hear the device explode and his senses go to white.  After a few moments, DD recovers sanity and slinks off to NN for repairs.   Throughout the season, as things heat up with whoever is the ""big bad"" of the season, DD and Punisher continue to tangle in the middle of trying to get the bad guys and frustrate each other's efforts. Probably leading to a big success for a villain nearing the end of the season.  Eventually, the Avocados remember the Castle case from when they were interns (probably) and understand his motivations. In the end, they'll have a gentleman's agreement to work together just this once to stop a foe neither can stop alone.  And if I'm a really good boy all year, maybe they'll do like they've done in the comics and DD will agree to work with Punisher as long as he uses rubber bullets and then Punisher will find ways to secretly murder bad guys after DD thinks he's upheld the ""no kill clause"". Like planting a delayed explosive on a tied up goon in a dark alley."

I think it was from 2014. I'm trying to remember the arc name.  The instance of Punisher killing after promising not to was actually not with DD.

Defenders,3b83tk,kah88,17,Fri Jun 26 23:27:10 2015 UTC,They didn't really confirm it. They just teased it with a comment about how the dirver was the same person and had a very specific set of skills. From there ppl took it as the Punisher was driving the truck.
Defenders,3b83tk,ICookTheBlueStuff,4,Fri Jun 26 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"That's false as it was announced Jon Bernthal, from shows like The Walking Dead and Mob City, will be playing the Punisher."

The show is kind of based off of The Man Without Fear arc.  Boxing and MMA are the only 2 sports I watch (because I am a huge nerd), and I didn't have any trouble believing his dad boxed. He's not a good boxer. But looks at guys like: Mark Hunt (great striker), Nick/Nate Diaz (good strikers), Charlie Brenneman (not a great fighter, but still a pro), and boxers like Saúl Álvarez and Keith Thurman who don't really look all that special.  I guess my point is, combat sports are home to every body type.    Anyways, I am glad you are enjoying it! I liked the show."

Defenders,3azcd7,soulbreaker1418,7,Wed Jun 24 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder if current Avenger's actors have a contract that makes it so TV appearances cost too much. And that's why someone like Hawkeye doesn't show up on Agents of SHIELD but Lady Sif can.   I remember reading that Chris Evans signed on for 6 appearances. Which includes the 3 solo movies and The Avengers. He agreed to do that brief part in Thor 2 for free because it was short. But that would have counted as an ""appearance"" so by the time Infinity War came they'd have to renegotiate. I also wonder if that's why there's no Iron Man 4, because he could be better served appearing in stuff like Civil War.   I wonder now with Agents of Shield and Netflix these new people being brought in, starting with like Rudd, have contracts include TV appearances called like ""cross media"" or something."
Defenders,3azcd7,soulbreaker1418,2,Thu Jun 25 00:33:33 2015 UTC,I don't think they would include a television appearances in there contracts especially Spider-Man. The Films will always have more priority then the shows. The films make money the shows do not.

Defenders,3azcd7,Black_Dumbledore,2,Sun Jun 28 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"I think that´s exactly right when those contract were signed Marvel was light years away even from Agents of Shield, now that Netflix is there and TV is an important platform for actors i´m sure everyone involved wil put that on paper"

Defenders,3azcd7,dev1359,4,Sat Jun 27 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"I still don't think they will be any significant cross over. The target audiences for the Defenders shows a Spider-man are very different, granted there is overlap.   Compared to Daredevil, Spider-man is going to be relatively family friendly. I can't see Marvel wanting to mix the two.  It would be like having Walter White show up in an episode of Modern Family. The kids who will want to see Spider-man probably shouldn't also be watching Daredevil. To me that's the main hurdle any big screen Defenders crossover would face.  I'm sure it could be done but it's a tricky endeavor."

Defenders,3azcd7,PhilipkWeiner,10,Thu Jun 25 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"Or, save Miles for 10 years down the line, because he's a natural successor to Peter and a way to have Spider-Man naturally for the entirety of the MCU."

Defenders,3azcd7,Avengers_IT,-2,Thu Jun 25 01:38:28 2015 UTC,I think the age difference is going to factor in to why they don't meet up. Spider-man fights younger villains or he mostly is fighting against oscorp. Also if you think about it each character could stick to a different borough or maybe Spider-man just spends most of his time in Manhattan. The city is big enough and has enough crime to split it up. Hell maybe we'll get a post credit scene of all of them meeting up to discuss territories.

Defenders,3axxht,Inspace96,2,Wed Jun 24 13:27:50 2015 UTC,They usually put it up about a month before for an exact event schedule but they announce big  guests and events during the rest of the year leading to the show.  So I expect Marvel TV to announce a panel around August or September which would be right around Aka Jessica Jones finishes filming and DD season 2 starts production.

I think only recently have what I consider hard dramas started winning accolades left and right, e.g. Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, House of Cards. Before now, it was basically genre all the time on television, because we weren't so sophistamacated."

Defenders,3alpkv,Anivair,0,Sun Jun 21 16:06:44 2015 UTC,What did GoT win an emmy for? Pointless gratuity and redundant stories?
Defenders,3alpkv,TheAmazingContrarian,24,Mon Jun 22 21:14:40 2015 UTC,Is there an award for best fight sequence?
Defenders,3alpkv,atizzy,42,Sun Jun 21 15:03:39 2015 UTC,Fight sequence no. Stunt work yes.
Defenders,3alpkv,dorv,10,Sun Jun 21 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"i can't think of a show this season with better stunt work. GoT was lacking this year, but Arrow had some cool sequences. If Arrow or DD don't win that I'll be very disapointed."
Defenders,3alpkv,iampattym,28,Sun Jun 21 19:57:44 2015 UTC,The hallway fight is levels beyond anything arrow has ever done.
Defenders,3alpkv,SlipShodBovine,11,Mon Jun 22 01:24:04 2015 UTC,"I think from a cinematography point of view you're right. I remember watching that thinking ""holy shit! This is the coolest thing I've see in cinema in a long time"". But in terms of stunts I think arrow has had some good moments, they may not be as breathtaking on camera, but the award IS about the stunts and sequences themselves."
Defenders,3alpkv,iampattym,2,Mon Jun 22 03:11:11 2015 UTC,I guess that's true.  I just found the way that the fight was sold was so realistic that it was about the best thing I have seen in a long time.  But a stunts award might not be about how well the stuntman and actor acted through the stunt sequence itself...
Defenders,3alpkv,SlipShodBovine,14,Mon Jun 22 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I felt like Arrow's action/stunts was a lot worse this season. It was already pretty unbelievable last season but there were so many moments where Oliver is literally right in front of a gun and doesn't get hit, it just felt weak compared to Daredevil."
Defenders,3alpkv,decross20,2,Sun Jun 21 21:32:42 2015 UTC,There were some rough parts (the flashbacks especially) but I thought that there were some solid fights in there that took a lot of work from the stunt team. But of course daredevil also had some amazing fight sequences. I'm just saying that they would both be deserving of such an award.
Defenders,3alpkv,iampattym,3,Mon Jun 22 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"No. Of course they weren't realistic, but I think there was some good coordination in the fight scenes earlier in the season  that should be recognized like the Merlyn vs. Ollie vs. Nyssa for example."

Defenders,3alpkv,iSamurai,2,Mon Jun 22 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"I think though that shows submit specific sequences, not their season as a whole.  And GoT can submit the last 15 minutes of Hardhome and be in great shape."

Defenders,3alpkv,alex3omg,2,Sun Jun 21 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"I think it'll win stunt work awards. Which I think most of the major awards have stunt stuff, they just generally don't air it. It's a shame since it's a great program overall, but award season tends to run screaming from genre stuff."
Defenders,3alpkv,klmnumbers,3,Mon Jun 22 03:18:44 2015 UTC,does it count as a tv series technically? i know its a series but it wasnt on television so idk what its aloud to win.
Defenders,3alpkv,shingonzo,18,Mon Jun 22 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Considering Netflix has got a ton of Emmy nominations for original content, and won some, yes it counts (although I'm not sure the voters are taking it super seriously yet as they have all been minor awards that they've won, although you can obviously debate whether they actually should have beat the real winners of the big awards or not)  Meanwhile, Amazon and Netflix have both won major awards at the golden globes for their original content."
Defenders,3alpkv,blendermf,5,Sun Jun 21 16:27:20 2015 UTC,Yes. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black both got Emmy nominations and I believe Transparent might have as well.

Defenders,3alpkv,suss2it,-12,Sun Jun 21 15:37:28 2015 UTC,You're getting down voted but you have the right mentality. Award shows and what they mean are over stated.
Defenders,3alpkv,UrbanVermin,6,Sun Jun 21 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think they mean something. I kind of treat awards and best of lists or whatever, like a recommendation list from somebody.  Like when album of the year lists come out I usually poke around multiple blogs and places like NME, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, A.V. Club, etc. even though I have different problems with all their selections. It's not something that should be viewed as a definitive measure for all quality, it's just like a group of people that might have some broad similarities in taste saying, this was what we liked this year.  So like if you compared Mad Men and Daredevil, they're both going for different things, and do those things well that appeal to different tastes. You know?"
Defenders,3alpkv,Darth_Tier,-10,Sun Jun 21 16:16:40 2015 UTC,I could honestly care less if I get downvoted. The whole karma thing means as much to me as award shows. But it's good that at least one other person here doesn't share a need for that nonsense.
Defenders,3alpkv,MechanicMonkey,8,Sun Jun 21 16:51:35 2015 UTC,How much less could you care?
Defenders,3alpkv,dance4days,0,Sun Jun 21 17:22:03 2015 UTC,Total agreement here. Awards season is all marketing bullshit to get people to care about stuff in the media after the holidays are over. It's also kind of icky that people use it to turn art into a competition with winners and losers. I wish they would all just go away and people would learn to enjoy art on its own merits.
Defenders,3alpkv,mEsjycCxNe8y7x,-1,Mon Jun 22 00:54:27 2015 UTC,Probably not. It was a good show but not good enough to win much.

Defenders,3ahxlz,Nachoswolf,37,Sat Jun 20 10:00:15 2015 UTC,Daredevil's first trailer dropped in early February. The released in late April. So a 2.5 month gap.  Marvel has said that they are not going to Comic Con this year.  My guess would D23 will be the release of the trailer. It's in the middle of August. So 2.5 months would put JJ at the beginning of November. I feel like this all lines up nicely.
Defenders,3ahxlz,SirHoneyDip,23,Sat Jun 20 11:24:05 2015 UTC,iirc Marvel TV will be at comic-con through Agents of Shield and Agent Carter. Maybe we'll see something related to the Netflix shows there.

Parts of the Living Weapon could work but I think that Iron Fist, when it actually does come out, will be kind of a fresh take on the character, a new story that will lead hopefully into a new Heroes for Hire title or solo Iron Fist title"

Defenders,3afa1y,slingstone,15,Fri Jun 19 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Season 2 will get a serious redesign. something akin to Daredevil's marvel heroes costume maybe?.
Defenders,3afa1y,TripleActionRelief,5,Fri Jun 19 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"Every MCU hero went through several costume changes by now.  Even Scarlet Witch, who only appeared on AoU for now already has two different outfits."
Defenders,3afa1y,TheDalekCaan,16,Wed Jun 24 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Potter flat out says that the costume is still a work in progress when Murdock takes it, and that he has a lot of work left."
Defenders,3afa1y,dasrac,20,Fri Jun 19 22:26:42 2015 UTC,I like the costume and I think it's much better than Affleck's.
Defenders,3afa1y,catdoctor,6,Fri Jun 19 19:29:31 2015 UTC,They have a point. I hope next season he has a lighter costume. Something similar to this. http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/marvel-heroes/thumb/a/a2/Modelsheet_daredevil_modern-es28_0.jpg/468px-Modelsheet_daredevil_modern-es28_0.jpg
Defenders,3afa1y,SwagBelow,3,Fri Jun 19 22:04:52 2015 UTC,That's... Pretty much Daredevil's main costume for the last 40 years.
Defenders,3afa1y,TheDalekCaan,2,Wed Jun 24 18:45:23 2015 UTC,That is why it is a classic. I want to see a costume like this next season. It should be lighter and have less armor. It should reflect that he is a pro at crime fighting and being a superhero which is what i think this costume has reflected for the last 40 years.
Defenders,3afa1y,SwagBelow,24,Wed Jun 24 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"The title is pretty clickbait-y, but I agree with the author's assessment. Too many straps and rivets, too many colors."
Defenders,3afa1y,IceBunz,13,Fri Jun 19 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"I wish they would have kept it simple like their Black Mask costume, but this is their first iteration. They'll change it"
Defenders,3afa1y,TheOtherSon,20,Fri Jun 19 17:38:15 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if they are going to tie things together by having him jump straight to the newest cosutme from the comics. https://i.imgur.com/lGubfi1.jpg
Defenders,3afa1y,JonathanL72,10,Fri Jun 19 18:46:22 2015 UTC,Badass.  Was there any reason for the change given in-story or just a new art team running the title?
Defenders,3afa1y,TheDemon333,12,Fri Jun 19 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"From what I understand Marvel Comics is doing a reboot thing, & I believe since the netflix show popularized the black suit, that inspired them to change the suit in the comics to be more black as well."
Defenders,3afa1y,gosgood73,2,Fri Jun 19 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"There's a big event happening called 'Secret Wars' in which all the universes (except for the MCU, for obvious reasons) are colliding and merging - most specifically the Ultimate and Main 616 universe, but also including one-time elseworld issues like Old Man Logan"
Defenders,3afa1y,TheDalekCaan,2,Mon Jun 22 03:31:31 2015 UTC,I had not seen that costume yet. Love it.
Defenders,3afa1y,Jackal_Legacy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"I hope not. I want to see classic-style Daredevil running around, as was shown in the freaking intro."
Defenders,3afa1y,Jackal_Legacy,9,Wed Jun 24 18:44:39 2015 UTC,I totally agree that the black ninja suit is way better but why are people asking for something that looks more like affleck's suit? It looks even stupider and lowers the shows credibility.
Defenders,3afa1y,UNITBlackArchive,5,Fri Jun 19 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone wants to see the shiny leather make a comeback, but I do think the profile and simplicity of the Affleck design are good."
Defenders,3afa1y,Try_Another_Please,2,Fri Jun 19 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I can get behind simplicity."
Defenders,3afa1y,Semiramis42,4,Fri Jun 19 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"IRL, leather is squeaky as hell.  I think Matt would get a headache from all the sounds it makes.  Plus, not so stealthy."
Defenders,3afa1y,Jexx212,4,Fri Jun 19 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"It's already established to not be complete. He just took it so he could  take down Fisk. And the title is clickbaity. It hardly ""ruined"" anything"
Defenders,3afa1y,swusn83,3,Sat Jun 20 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"I don't care if they make a new one next season, the black ninja costume was far better. Sure, this is a comic book series about a bloody superhero but the simplicity of the first costume steeped the character in reality. I feel like the red superhero costume is going to make the show more cartoonish, and Daredevil was such a success precisely because it doesn't have that cartoonish superhero feel about it."
Defenders,3afa1y,Kingslayer360,3,Sun Jun 21 12:20:34 2015 UTC,I actually really liked the suit... I hope the new suit in Season 2 looks similar in all honesty.
Defenders,3afa1y,cabbagehead112,5,Sat Jun 27 01:28:17 2015 UTC,The blind guys costume does not look cool? How could that have happened?
Defenders,3afa1y,Andres_is_lame,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:22 2015 UTC,How Clickbait Headline Gave This Site More Views Than Needed
Defenders,3afa1y,desertdogkai,2,Sun Jun 21 09:25:27 2015 UTC,Its like people didn't really watch the part where it was explained. That it's not finished at all. That's why you see a lot of black areas - which is the Kevlar and belts...etc.
Defenders,3afa1y,dannzo_29,5,Mon Jun 22 07:04:25 2015 UTC,I would like to see it all black with a few red accents
Defenders,3a768b,rkkim,16,Wed Jun 17 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if this is a cookie-cutter response, or if he's legitimately stoked to be playing such a prominent character in the MCU. He's a great actor, so there's no doubt he can pull it off. I wonder if he's read any Punisher comics."
Defenders,3a768b,baconlovr,20,Wed Jun 17 21:00:37 2015 UTC,"He seemed pretty excited on his twitter when the announcement came through, posted pictures of himself with Punisher comics and thanking everyone for the support and congratulations etc.  Honestly think he really is thrilled, as he and everyone else should be because this casting is baller."
Defenders,3a768b,thedisgustingbacklog,7,Wed Jun 17 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, thanks so much for the info!"
Defenders,3a768b,baconlovr,4,Wed Jun 17 22:24:37 2015 UTC,Pretty sure himself as The Punisher would appear and shoot Jon in the face if he said anything more.
Defenders,3a768b,-MS-94-,4,Wed Jun 17 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"If he hasn't, he will. Marvel sends actors a big bound book of issues for that actors character."
Defenders,3a768b,Supertrinko,9,Thu Jun 18 06:12:11 2015 UTC,As someone who cares about dogs too there is nothing I read here I did not absolutely love.
Defenders,3a768b,d3r3k1449,9,Wed Jun 17 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"Without knowing about his acting skills, I was still excited when he was casted, as physically he looks like he fits the part, but could someone tell me how is he as an actor?"
Defenders,3a768b,JonathanL72,13,Thu Jun 18 00:31:33 2015 UTC,He's hilarious in The Wolf of Wall Street.
Defenders,3a768b,PWN3R_RANGER,6,Thu Jun 18 00:46:45 2015 UTC,Really he was in that? I need to rewatch that movie then lol.
Defenders,3a768b,JonathanL72,5,Thu Jun 18 00:52:27 2015 UTC,for real.  i keep seeing that but i absolutely never realized it was him in it.  going to re-watch it too to see him.  haha.
Defenders,3a768b,dannytdotorg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:33 2015 UTC,He was Brad
Defenders,3a768b,Mongostein,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:33:25 2015 UTC,"Is Brad the guy who ""sells the pen"" to the main guy? By going ""hey I got ya pen, try to write something down"""
Defenders,3a768b,ksaid1,2,Thu Jun 18 10:53:20 2015 UTC,Yup.
Defenders,3a768b,suss2it,9,Sat Jun 20 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"He's pretty good in The Walking Dead. Some really great scenes with him. Parts were off, but I definitely think the Punisher's in good hands with him."
Defenders,3a768b,TheFaceo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:36:57 2015 UTC,He was good in Mob City and Fury as well.
Defenders,3a768b,TheAquaman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:07:08 2015 UTC,M'ask you somethin removes cap and rubs head
Defenders,3a768b,007Kkzz,4,Sun Jun 28 05:11:50 2015 UTC,I thought he was really good in Fury.
Defenders,3a768b,kiji23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:13:24 2015 UTC,I thought he was one of the most intense and interesting characters in the walking dead (Shane)
Defenders,3a768b,007Kkzz,3,Sun Jun 28 05:11:06 2015 UTC,Damn. And here I thought he would be very disappointed.
Defenders,3a14tc,paulmallblartcop,6,Tue Jun 16 12:20:30 2015 UTC,Dammit that was funny.  Where devil?  Theredevil (masked guy waving hi.)  That part had me giggling.
Defenders,3a1cvs,StolenHam,38,Tue Jun 16 13:39:47 2015 UTC,Summer Glau.   wait...  Nvm I don't want this show to get canceled.
Defenders,3a1cvs,atizzy,6,Tue Jun 16 17:29:45 2015 UTC,Arrow seems to be doing fine.
Defenders,3a1cvs,your_mind_aches,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:16:07 2015 UTC,Season 3 would tell you otherwise
Defenders,3a1cvs,your_mind_aches,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:15:11 2015 UTC,Season 3 still had great ratings.
Defenders,3a1cvs,cymric,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:12:47 2015 UTC,Awesome actress with the worst track record with the longevity of shows
Defenders,3a1cvs,aronfemale,31,Thu Jun 18 00:53:39 2015 UTC,Sofia Boutella
Defenders,3a1cvs,Anivair,5,Tue Jun 16 19:19:20 2015 UTC,This is the right answer.
Defenders,3a1cvs,sneechesgetsteetches,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:08:26 2015 UTC,This is the logical choice
Defenders,3a1cvs,your_mind_aches,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:43:12 2015 UTC,Yes please. I loved her in Kingsman
Defenders,3a1cvs,kickshaw,0,Sat Jun 27 05:16:26 2015 UTC,Absolutely!
Defenders,3a1cvs,thebichedder,14,Wed Jun 17 21:17:28 2015 UTC,Someone Greek?
Defenders,3a1cvs,junglemonkey47,3,Tue Jun 16 21:21:29 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
Defenders,3a1cvs,schm0,18,Wed Jun 17 13:27:11 2015 UTC,Jason Alexander.
Defenders,3a1cvs,JuanRiveara,5,Tue Jun 16 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right. Come on."
Defenders,3a1cvs,theCANCERbat,24,Wed Jun 17 05:01:13 2015 UTC,I would cast Nina Dobrev she has the looks and she's proven that she could be a leading lady.
Defenders,3a1cvs,MacBeth_in_Yellow,6,Tue Jun 16 13:45:44 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind this except for the fact that she's 7 year younger than Charlie Cox.
Defenders,3a1cvs,TheDalekCaan,16,Tue Jun 16 21:05:20 2015 UTC,Foggy is 5 years older. As long as she looks the part I don't think it really matters.
Defenders,3a1cvs,walterpinkman45,5,Tue Jun 16 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"It's a general rule in the acting world that an actor (or actress, if you prefer) is going to be able to portray his or her own age plus or minus ten years, provided the actor is at least 27 years old. Some actors (e.g. Michael J. Fox in his younger years) can stretch that even more, although there does come a point where it'll strain an audience's suspension of disbelief (e.g. the original The Blob with a nearly forty-year-old Steve McQueen playing a high school student).  Bottom line: a seven year age gap between two actors that are supposed to be peers really isn't a stretch at all. I'd assume that (as characters) Murdock and Elektra aren't exactly the same age anyway, even if they were in school at the same time; realistically, one could allow for a four or five year age gap without issue."
Defenders,3a1cvs,Brys_Beddict,3,Wed Jun 17 18:31:39 2015 UTC,She looks about the same age as Cox.
Defenders,3a1cvs,The_AtomBomb,3,Wed Jun 17 00:00:49 2015 UTC,Please let this happen
Defenders,3a1cvs,Chickens-dont-clap,5,Tue Jun 16 14:16:47 2015 UTC,Michael Cera

Defenders,3a1cvs,peterkeats,10,Mon Jun 22 02:22:03 2015 UTC,Eva Green.
Defenders,3a1cvs,JuanRiveara,5,Tue Jun 16 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"If Penny Dreadful stays on the air, this would be unlikely.  For some reason I thought she had something to do with Doctor Strange, but maybe I'm remembering things wrong."
Defenders,3a1cvs,busybagel,6,Tue Jun 16 21:21:26 2015 UTC,Penny Dreadful just got renewed for Season 3.
Defenders,3a1cvs,Chuck006,4,Tue Jun 16 23:02:32 2015 UTC,She would be a great Mistress Death.
Defenders,3a1cvs,007Kkzz,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:39 2015 UTC,Odetta Annabelle she has the perfect look for Elektra and can do the physical aspects of the role
Defenders,3a1cvs,riraito,2,Wed Jun 17 03:21:11 2015 UTC,An unknown actress with a background in acrobatics.
Defenders,3a1cvs,Valrek_Machines,2,Sat Jun 20 05:44:21 2015 UTC,I honestly think Rosario Dawson (Claire) would've made a good Elektra
Defenders,3a1cvs,TripleNerdScore1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:14:23 2015 UTC,Katrina law from arrow/spartacus
Defenders,3a1cvs,soulbreaker1418,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"She's already a reoccuring character on arrow though, that could possibly rule her out of the role. She's a good fit for the role though."
Defenders,3a1cvs,gatsby365,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"One Alexandra Daddario, please."
Defenders,3a1cvs,TripleNerdScore1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm actually not wild about an Elektra appearance in the show. I'd hate for the plot to get too sidelined by a romantic interest. Also, I'm a little too worried they'll make her a Mary Sue. I don't know, maybe that's not fair - but I'd hate to see Daredevil get sucked into an out-of-character romance with a femme fatale.  If I had to cast for Elektra, I'd pick someone virtually unknown. Maybe Mozhan Marno?"
Defenders,3a1cvs,gatsby365,7,Tue Jun 16 19:35:58 2015 UTC,They might not play up the romance since it's already been hinted at. I just want the character to be done justice in the MCU and kick some ass
Defenders,3a1cvs,Riley1066,6,Tue Jun 16 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"i actually wanna see it, love and relationships based on it are an integral part of any person and it would be interesting to see how Matt reacts to a woman he would have to impress and set a moral standard outside of his own.   I think we can agree Matt liked a lot Claire(us too lol) and didn´t know what to feel with Karen, his only real ""love interests"" were his father and, at the end, Foggy"
Defenders,3a1cvs,gatsby365,2,Wed Jun 17 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't Elektra kind of, well, all the things you're afraid she'd be?"
Defenders,3a1cvs,hargendarsh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she is. Maybe instead of ""they'll make her a Mary Sue,"" I should have said: ""they'll have a hard time making her not a Mary Sue."""
Defenders,3a1cvs,gosgood73,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"I guess it's just funny, because pretty much everything in the Mary Sue trope you linked fits her.   Skills, looks, death, on and on.   And for Matt getting into relationships? That's a vital part of who he is, too."
Defenders,39xrx4,tomrwentz,2,Mon Jun 15 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"So this is obviously a custom design and very well done at that,  can you share where you ordered it? I'd love one for my collection."
Defenders,39xrx4,cajunsamurai,8,Mon Jun 15 23:16:45 2015 UTC,"this isn't custom, i got it from a hot topic!"
Defenders,39xrx4,cajunsamurai,2,Tue Jun 16 00:04:47 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard that Funko announced it.  OMG!  Thanks for the info!
Defenders,39wgrn,emcee_paz,63,Mon Jun 15 10:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they can use the name, but the MCU uses real names wherever it makes the scripts sound more normal.   Look at how many times ""Iron Man"" is used in the MCU, as opposed to ""Stark"", which is used constantly. The MCU is pretty sparing with their use of aliases."
Defenders,39wgrn,phrankygee,4,Mon Jun 15 11:52:26 2015 UTC,"Have they ever said ""Shellhead""? That'd be fun."
Defenders,39wgrn,Advacar,11,Mon Jun 15 16:49:51 2015 UTC,I think I heard Black Widow use it in AoU. Either when she was on the motorcycle or in the middle of fighting Ultron bots in the city. It's kind of hard to imagine that nickname coming naturally anymore though.
Defenders,39wgrn,phrankygee,14,Mon Jun 15 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"It was when she and Hawkeye were driving the Surprisingly Shiny Audi toward the helicarrier toward the end of the movie. It was something like ""We're on our way, shellhead; not all of us can fly, you know"""
Defenders,39wgrn,Advacar,16,Mon Jun 15 18:52:57 2015 UTC,I was just saying earlier how advertisers love Redditors. You and so many others love to make sure that their advertising dollars don't go to waste by making sure that everyone remembers which products were in which movie.
Defenders,39wgrn,phrankygee,6,Mon Jun 15 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, I didn't notice it until I read about it here. But once it was pointed out, it was very obvious."
Defenders,39wgrn,Advacar,-10,Mon Jun 15 23:31:49 2015 UTC,I suppose you liked that it was there? Because by pointing it out now you're making it very obvious to even more people.
Defenders,39wgrn,dev1359,4,Tue Jun 16 01:03:10 2015 UTC,This is why I can't wait for Spider-Man to become a part of the MCU. He's gotta use that nickname at some point lol
Defenders,39wgrn,slowphoton,4,Mon Jun 15 23:47:57 2015 UTC,Yeah! Silly nick names all around!

Defenders,39wgrn,d3r3k1449,20,Mon Jun 15 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"I would think he would have to unite all of the city's organized crime under him to be called Kingpin. In the comics its been said that everyone ""pays up"" to Kingpin. Guys who don't get vanished. Fisk can start building toward this in season 2 from behind bars. Either way at some point he has to get out of prison."
Defenders,39wgrn,Rheul,13,Mon Jun 15 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"Good point…though he is already well on his way to earning the moniker, I think. In the last shot of season one he sure looks a lot more like KP too. Larger and darker and brooding."

Defenders,39wgrn,Rheul,2,Mon Jun 15 20:25:35 2015 UTC,Yeah. Though it wasn't mainly the clothes that left me with that impression so I was hesitant to mention them.
Defenders,39wgrn,d3r3k1449,5,Mon Jun 15 20:28:39 2015 UTC,Bah! The white shirt was totally intentional. A nod to the fans. No shame in acknowledging it. I doubt he'll be walking around in a white smoking jacket in season 2. Maybe he'll get a leg injury and he'll get his cane though!
Defenders,39wgrn,Mark_1231,2,Mon Jun 15 21:13:09 2015 UTC,Yeah yeah I am not discounting the significance of the white jumper just trying to convey I caught the Kingpin vibe now in other ways too.
Defenders,39wgrn,Rheul,2,Mon Jun 15 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"When Fisk seized control of the taxi business, I thought for sure Fisk was going to assume each leg of the operations as DD took out the various partners. Then he would be the ""Kingpin"" of the operation."
Defenders,39wgrn,Techno_Bacon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:13:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was kind of surprised he was locked up at the end. I figured he and DD would have their showdown DD would kick his ass but Matt wouldnt be able to make any charges stick.
Defenders,39wgrn,Smooth_Meister,3,Mon Jun 15 21:32:59 2015 UTC,Have you seen anything to corroborate that? I wonder if its like Pietro and Wanda being only called their names in Avengers. Couldn't Sony own the rights to Kingpin as he is mostly a Spiderman villian?
Defenders,39wgrn,Inspace96,9,Mon Jun 15 11:25:01 2015 UTC,"?  He's saying that Wilson Fisk is not ""The Kingpin"" yet. He's not saying that they can't call him that."
Defenders,39wgrn,Rheul,4,Mon Jun 15 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure kingpin is mostly a daredevil villain. He was a main villain in one of the spiderman tv series, which is what I think causes so much confusion.  EDIT: turns out kingpin WAS a spidey villain, but at the moment he is pretty close to daredevil. Shouldn't be any rights issues though."
Defenders,39wgrn,suss2it,6,Mon Jun 15 11:32:02 2015 UTC,He was a Spider-man villain until Frank Miller reworked him for Daredevil.
Defenders,39wgrn,minieggs12,3,Mon Jun 15 14:03:20 2015 UTC,Kingpin was originally a Spidey villain. Frank Miller made him DD's big bad in the 80's.
Defenders,39wgrn,demosthenes718,2,Mon Jun 15 14:04:46 2015 UTC,Kingpin was introduced in Spiderman and was a villain mostly in that Conib for like 20 years.
Defenders,39wgrn,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was a rights issue because Kingpin's rights were packaged with Daredevil which Fox had then eventually gave back to Marvel, so Marvel should have full rights for him. And do we know for sure Marvel Studios could use Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch but couldn't use their codenames because that sounds more like a fan theory and not much of a distinction."
Defenders,39wgrn,demosthenes718,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"This article seems to think the names are off limits to Marvel I've also read that Sony would have been the one to lend the name Kingpin to Fox since they own Spiderman, so the name would have reverted to them and not Marvel."
Defenders,39wgrn,Try_Another_Please,5,Tue Jun 16 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"Marvel got the rights to Daredevil and all his associated villains back from Fox so it's not a rights issue. I think Season 1 was an origin story for both Matt and Fisk, with Matt earning his name at the end of the first season so I'm sure we'll see a more comic like Kingpin in the coming season(s)"
Defenders,39wgrn,TheDalekCaan,3,Mon Jun 15 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"The same reason that they only called Matt ""Daredevil"" at the very end of the last episode, or why they never called Owlsley ""The Owl."" This show is supposed to be the grittier, more realistic side of the MCU. I'd put some money on Frank Castle not being referred to as The Punisher more than a handful of times.  It's especially weird because the rest of the MCU seems to have no problem with embracing the comicbookiness of the universe. It kinda bugs me that Daredevil has to take the Dark Knight approach to comic book adaptation; I wish they'd just accept that it's a comic book and call them Kingpin, and Daredevil, and Punisher."
Defenders,39wgrn,MacBeth_in_Yellow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:26:11 2015 UTC,It was an origin story so they wouldn't have been called that anyway because they weren't their respective roles yet. The movies and shows don't call them by their aliases that often either. Stark or Agent Barton/Romanoff is much more common than Iron Man or Black Widow for example. It just doesn't always flow on screen to use the names and DD comics are more serious in tone than others
Defenders,39wgrn,grntplmr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"It was an origin story so they wouldn't have been called that anyway because they weren't their respective roles yet   Matt was absolutely Daredevil from the word go, same with Fisk. Also, in the first Captain America and Iron Man films- also origin stories- they were referred to by their superhero names plenty of times.   Stark or Agent Barton/Romanoff is much more common than Iron Man or Black Widow for example.   Yes, but Fisk was NEVER called Kingpin. Matt was only called Daredevil retroactively. It's a very different situation."
Defenders,39wgrn,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Mon Jun 15 22:10:17 2015 UTC,It's not that different at all. Matt didn't get his red devil suit until the end. Daredevil isn't a name that he gives himself so he acquired at the end when he became comic DD. The movie heros have been established awhile now so the name has already stuck. it was undeniably an origin story for DD as we know him. Fisk doesn't act much like comic Kingpin until the end and he doesn't accept that he is a criminal until the end and he his final scene is him wearing the iconic white. He became Kingpin right then and obviously both will be back and with their famous names. Being an origin for both men was kind of the point. I just don't understand how it's taking a TDK approach. TDK called Wayne batman far more than any marvel hero's alias is used save maybe Cap. Joker literally has nothing else to go by etc. DD is far more similar to the comics in realism standards than those movies. We already have meditation and Hand ninjas even  Captain America is a propaganda piece. The name was his only reason for existing. It had to be used. Stark is more similar. His name is used only a couple of times in the movie and he doesn't adopt it until a good portion of the way through the movie. It is still very rarely used compared to Stark. DD wasn't even known to the public as a hero until the end.  tl;dr It's an origin where they became the hero/villain we fully know at the end. Obviously season 2 will use the DD name since it exists now.
Defenders,39wgrn,EVula,2,Mon Jun 15 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much like the ending to the first Iron Man. Newspaper calls superhero by his superhero name, name sticks, respective sequels come out using the name he earned after the first movie/season."
Defenders,39wgrn,XMenOrangesTangerine,4,Mon Jun 15 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt it has anything to do with rights. When the rights to DD reverted back to Marvel, they got his entire supporting cast including the Kingpin.  In general, the MCU seems to be using a more organic approach to character naming than what is commonly seen in the comic books. It used to be that characters just named themselves and announced their names during their initial appearance, sort of like a group of musicians or professional wrestlers (e.g. I am... The Kingpin!). Like those colorful spandex outfits that are oh-so-common, this approach works reasonably well when used in comic books, but comes across as a little too corny and archaic in modern movies.  Will Fisk be called The Kingpin in the Netflix series? My guess is that he probably will be given time; perhaps in the second season or during one of the crossover series. The first season was very much an origin story of sorts, so the only reference we get to Fisk's comic book alter-ego is Urich's use of a deck of cards to connect the crime in Hell's Kitchen. Eventually I'd guess Fisk will be referred to as A Kingpin before he becomes The Kingpin."
Defenders,39wgrn,JonathanL72,2,Tue Jun 16 08:51:58 2015 UTC,"I could see it being something the media tags him with. A reporter on TV discussing the recent destruction in Hells Kitchen, and the name that is now buzzing around on the wind.  ""So the question on all of our minds, who is this Wilson Fisk, the so called ""Kingpin of Crime"" and what does he want with Hell's Kitchen? Very little is know about him before his public appearance as an apparent benefactor, but now the rumors grow as alleged ""employees"" continue to come out of the shadows and tell their side of the story. More news, and coverage of yesterday's incident in Midtown after the break"""
Defenders,39wgrn,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a good way of getting Fisk back into the role of crime lord without the general public or the police knowing.   Instead of Fisk, it would be the mysterious ""Kingpin"".   I wouldn't make it another season arc of DD trying to find out who the Kingpin is, because that would be a retread of season 1.   Maybe make it a B plot for a couple of episodes or something.   And put him in the white suit and purple cravat. I know its dumb, but a show as good as this one has earned the right to be dumb sometimes."
Defenders,39wgrn,JonathanL72,2,Mon Jun 15 19:51:55 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that they could give Fisk the white suit and a purple cravat and make it not look dumb.

Defenders,39vdd8,Rheul,5,Mon Jun 15 14:11:24 2015 UTC,I don't think the Punisher's origin will be told on Daredevil though. I think he will have short arc setting him up for his own show and a part in the season finale. I mean I can see him being more of a mysterious force of nature that Matt has to contend with. Elektra has way more to do with Matt so I think her story can work.
Defenders,39vdd8,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:27:29 2015 UTC,I agree. At this point writing a big part for him just before the second season goes into production would be pretty risky. Slipping him into the last few episodes seems like the smart bet.

The Punisher acts as judge, jury, and executioner while Daredevil is more idealistic about letting the legal system do it's job.  As a result, the Daredevil will often find himself protecting the criminal that he, himself, was trying to apprehend. In the comics, they spend nearly as much time fighting each other as taking on the criminal underworld. In Means and Ends, a storyline that might make sense with Fisk behind bars, Daredevil  gets a kid killed and the Punisher arrested only to watch crime skyrocket - making him question his own methods."

Though I would probably want something closer to Gallants, that really is a testament to the old Shaw Bros era. For a lot of modern audiences, it might be easier to call out films like Legend of the Drunken Master. I don't know how many films you are watching out of China recently that still incorporate fantasy elements into the martial arts flicks, through netflix I have watched, and enjoyed films like Tai Chi Zero/Hero, Journey to the West, Dragon Tiger Gate, and you might start to get a feel for what I would want to see in an Iron Fist series. Anyway, it is a rough balance, considering people have made films as a testament to the same Shaw Bros films, from Man With the Iron Fists, and The Forbidden Kingdom, and while I enjoyed both of those films, they were missing the heart of, say, Gallants. Anyway, as opposed to drawing from the film noir action flicks, I would want it to be drawing from the more fantastical flicks."

So if nothing else the fight choreography could have him pulling out some Wushu level shit and then switching into some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and bringing that ground game. As far as the fight choreography though I want it to honestly be more kung-fu movie-ish. Like, I'm thinking stuff not exactly as gritty as the raid but not as far out as Kung Fu Hustle. But it for sure can't be like Daredevil cause Iron Fist is not exactly in that same gritty genre as Daredevil."

Defenders,397fvb,Nichase,148,Wed Jun 10 10:29:38 2015 UTC,"I never expected them to actually use Punisher in the MCU at all. This is absolutely incredible. The casting is just great as well, as can be expected with Marvel stuff. Daredevil season 2 is gonna be insane."
Defenders,397fvb,Smooth_Meister,25,Wed Jun 10 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"I dont know how far in advance they have planned Season 2, but I wonder how possible it is that they saw fan reactions to Season 1 of Daredevil and how positively people reacted to the level of gore and violence they were able to portray.  I specifically remember some people commenting that Daredevil had the level of violence they wanted out of a Punisher show or something.  It really makes me wonder if the TV execs at Marvel saw such comments and reactions and felt it would be fitting to include Punisher in a Daredevil story."
Defenders,397fvb,o-o-o-o-o-o,8,Tue Jun 9 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"An interesting theory, lets test it.  SURE WISH DAREDEVIL HAD MORE BOOBIES AND STUFF.  now we wait..."
Defenders,397fvb,ReeferMaaan,2,Tue Jun 9 21:47:52 2015 UTC,That actually makes a lot if sense. It's interesting to see something as planned out as the MCU be so flexible.
Defenders,397fvb,Smooth_Meister,3,Wed Jun 10 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"Deknight said that they wanted a pg16 kind of show(limited gore no cursing, etc), JJ i guess will have the cursing but no the gore, now Punisher will have a simmilar tone but i don´t know if it will work out as well with DD´s kind of violence, i know both are very simmilar characters- even Cox said DD was ""one bad day to be the Punisher""- but that doesn´t mean their shows could/would/should be simmilar"
Defenders,397fvb,soulbreaker1418,30,Tue Jun 9 22:43:32 2015 UTC,Deknight said that they wanted a pg16 kind of show    They killed someone on screen by repeatedly slamming a door on his head until brain matter dripped on the ground. Ain't no way that's PG
Defenders,397fvb,oliyoung,3,Tue Jun 9 22:31:55 2015 UTC,Not to mention ron howard skewering his own face on a jagged piece of metal  Side note: that wasn't actually ron howard was it?
Defenders,397fvb,TVhero,3,Tue Jun 9 23:59:28 2015 UTC,They also showed those Russian guys break a dead guys rib off by hand in one episode
Defenders,397fvb,o-o-o-o-o-o,11,Wed Jun 10 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"They had a similar scene in Agents of Shield to this, where a guy rips a man's rib out and then stabs the guy with his own rib. That's on network television. So seeing that in Daredevil didn't surprise me. The door slamming scene though....that came out of left field."
Defenders,397fvb,Agent_Phil_Coulson,2,Wed Jun 10 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"Did they really? I dont remember that, but you are Agent Coulson, so Ill take your word for it.  Agents of SHIELD has gotten away with some pretty decently violent stuff though, you are right. Hope your arm is doing well."

Defenders,397fvb,legochemgrad,-4,Wed Jun 10 21:41:09 2015 UTC,Yes it is check it out. that´s the reason we see Fisk´s face instead of the guy´s head and it´s pretty obvious tthe cursing stuff
Defenders,397fvb,soulbreaker1418,3,Wed Jun 10 22:45:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding Jessica Jones, they seem to be hinting at Purple Man sexually abusing Jessica so they'll probably push that aspect."
Defenders,397fvb,prophetofgreed,10,Wed Jun 10 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"Bendis went out of his way to make her imprisonment by Purple Man to be not rape, but basically rape. It was weird."
Defenders,397fvb,remotectrl,5,Wed Jun 10 02:01:11 2015 UTC,Its tough to do with the comics without it being too explicit. I feel like the tv show has a chance to delve into it better than the comics could.   The synopsis really hints to something bad happening to Jessica and with Purple Man in the show I feel like that's what has to be happening.
Defenders,397fvb,prophetofgreed,6,Wed Jun 10 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"Well Jessica explicitly said that he never touched her and refused to do so. He used his mind control powers to make her ""love him"" and he constantly refused her as a weird power trip thing. It was emotional abuse, emotion rape if you will, but not physical abuse. I'm curious how they will handle it because it isn't really mentioned at all in the first two volumes."
Defenders,397fvb,remotectrl,2,Wed Jun 10 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. Almost worse than rape, you're raping someone's mind by making them lust intensely for you, but denying them.   Wow."

Defenders,397fvb,woodsoffeels,6,Wed Jun 10 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"From the synopsis for Jessica Jones:   Ever since her short-lived stint as a Super Hero ended in tragedy, Jessica Jones has been rebuilding her personal life and career as a hot-tempered, sardonic, badass private detective in Hell's Kitchen, New York City. Plagued by self-loathing, and a wicked case of PTSD, Jessica battles demons from within and without, using her extraordinary abilities as an unlikely champion for those in need... especially if they're willing to cut her a check.   They make it pretty clear."
Defenders,397fvb,prophetofgreed,2,Wed Jun 10 11:32:40 2015 UTC,"Cool, it wasn't a criticism or anything, I know very little about Jessica Jones"
Defenders,397fvb,woodsoffeels,0,Wed Jun 10 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"hey careful with spoilers haha yeah there is no doubt in my mind that´s coming, now the thing is GoT iss being criticized for its depiction of an abusive relationship... and that´s not even close to what happen with JJ"
Defenders,397fvb,soulbreaker1418,5,Wed Jun 10 13:46:27 2015 UTC,The abuse/rape isnt why GoT is being criticised.
Defenders,397fvb,Wheresmyspacebar,0,Wed Jun 10 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"GoT has been critized for many things but what it´s in vogue now is how easy it is for them to show pain and horror without ""earn it"", this time taking the form of rape and ""child abuse""(to say it nicely...). Well with JJ they will have to present an even worse scene in a genere where something like this has barely happened and probably aren´t expecting"
Defenders,397fvb,soulbreaker1418,33,Wed Jun 10 07:46:53 2015 UTC,"Punisher is relatively popular and almost everyone was speculating he'd make his way to Netflix, so this isn't exactly shocking."

Defenders,397fvb,your_mind_aches,13,Wed Jun 10 00:02:54 2015 UTC,I think it's shocking. Especially because the Punisher name could easily carry his own show. I'd say the Punisher brand is more well-known than Daredevil.
Defenders,397fvb,TheMeatball,26,Tue Jun 9 20:47:06 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet we'll get a Netflix Punisher announcement after season 2 of Daredevil.
Defenders,397fvb,suss2it,19,Tue Jun 9 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"We certainly don't need another standard origin story. Daredevil was great with giving you pieces slowly, like how you would eat a door in a year."
Defenders,397fvb,ziekktx,9,Tue Jun 9 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"Well the whole of Daredevil Season 1 was practically an origin story.  And well, Arrow did it first. We still haven't seen all of Oliver's origin story."
Defenders,397fvb,your_mind_aches,7,Tue Jun 9 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of more the standard ""wimp to hero in the first x minutes, do not deviate"" thing. They paced it out so it didn't feel like a slog. In fact, with Daredevil, his coming up from ep1 to the Daredevil was an emotional change, not physical. He started with all the tools, and only needed the willpower to become the hero.   Oh, and Arrow: they did the same with his character on Smallville and it made it easier to accept his character for it."
Defenders,397fvb,ziekktx,2,Tue Jun 9 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's all different stuff I guess. Makes no sense to compare"
Defenders,397fvb,your_mind_aches,6,Tue Jun 9 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to bet a dollar they do an origin story of Punisher out of Daredevil. It will come from the fall out of Frank Castle learning half his unit was corrupt, and perhaps his family died in the Russian blasts."

Defenders,397fvb,timbo4815,2,Wed Jun 10 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"My only real Marvel comic experience is reading through Ultimate over the last year, but the little Ultimate Daredevil arc stood out as one of my favorite parts  This has me hopeful that season two's plot will be founded on the Ultimate DD arc. Punisher's origin story could be tied into Daredevils plot that way without feeling forced, and it still allows for Punisher to be introduced & exist in DD organically. The way that Castle & Murdock are both obsessed with justice & punishment, but on totally different ends of the spectrum, is a really compelling dynamic between the two characters"
Defenders,397fvb,Gonzzzo,2,Wed Jun 10 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's only a matter of time until Punisher gets his own show, but I wouldn't mind waiting until the Defenders mini-series comes out first before a netflix Punisher* show.  Edit: correction"

Defenders,397fvb,ninjames,27,Wed Jun 10 05:02:40 2015 UTC,Totally. He is a classically trained actor even and will pull off the look quite well too. That busted up-looking nose is perfect and he is a fairly big guy whom I'm sure is already buffing up further now.   Good stuff indeed. What a time.
Defenders,397fvb,d3r3k1449,15,Tue Jun 9 20:48:00 2015 UTC,Did you see him in Wolf of Wall Street? He was huge! And he killed it in that role. This is such great news!

Defenders,397fvb,dinero2180,9,Tue Jun 9 21:52:22 2015 UTC,Takes some serious acting chops to portray a really convincing unlikable character.
Defenders,397fvb,Worthyness,2,Tue Jun 9 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"I meant to see Fury and probably still will. The Pacific was too brutal to enjoy for me so did not stick with it. Much more so than Band Of Brothers and such, IMO."
Defenders,397fvb,d3r3k1449,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"Eek.  Fury was pretty brutal, too, IMO.  Not so much in a sense that there was so much blood and gore, but it's not, in any sense, a light movie.  I saw it once, was in tears a good portion of the time, and promised to never watch it again.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.  Jon Bernthal (and the rest of the cast) was amazing, though."

Chris Evans was great casting!  But not since RDJ have I thought to myself ""Oh my God that's brilliant!""    Also, I'm just talking about my reaction to the casting announcement.  I'm talking about casting people who already are these characters.  I didn't shit my pants with excitement when I heard Chris Evans was going to be Cap.  I never said to myself, ""That's perfect!""  Now with about 5 years hind sight I know that he's a fantastic Steve Rogers.  Maybe Bernthal will suck.  We obviously can't know for sure.  But I stand by my statement that this is the most perfect casting since RDJ."

Defenders,397fvb,JonathanL72,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:29:58 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that he spends the first few episodes as a primary antagonist, but then a greater threat (Bullseye, The Hand, Madame Gao, etc.) force them to come together."

Defenders,397hiw,RunicLordofMelons,3,Tue Jun 9 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Posted this on another thread, but this is how I think I'd like this to pan out... I would like to see him start off as an apparent villain. A stone cold killer who, may want similar end goals to DD (Put an end to the Kingpin/ Bullseye/ alternative threat), but with an apparent unjustifiable bloodthirst and psychopathic streak.   Maybe they cross paths a couple of times early on when DD is already going head to head with a low level criminal, and Punisher comes across as a relentless, unpredictable madman, but the writers subtly don't have him actually attack DD. DD attempts to find out who he is, but is unable to track him down.  Perhaps midway through season, something happens that paints DD in a bad light... Has him perceived as a ""villain"" to the in-show public. Word gets around, and Castle comes after DD, believing him to be bad. This is the first time that DD realises that Punisher is exclusively going after villains, but is still disgusted with the way he goes about doing it . The two fight, but neither is able to get the upper hand. DD says something that leads Punisher to realise that DD is not a criminal, resulting in Punisher leaving him alone.  Finally, in the final episode, maybe a reluctant team up, showing that, although still an unpredictable madman, the Punisher is teetering on the boardlines of Anti-Hero. We still aren't told why he is such a murderous nutter, and DD questions him on this. But, other than perhaps a throwaway line about his family, his full intentions and reasoning are left somewhat a mystery.  Now, assuming that the character is well received enough to earn his own series, this would be where we start to get more depth for the character. In a number of flashbacks, spread out throughout the series (similar to DD s1), we see Frank as a noble soldier, and a family man, before seeing the events that change his life and make him who he is. For the first time, as viewers, we would be able to start to understand why he is so messed up and, although not justifiable, sympathise for his loss. Cementing his eventual place as an Anti-hero.   I also believe that, so get this message across, Punisher should remain the only Netflix hero to straight up kill people."
Defenders,397hiw,RichHardLemonz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:09:35 2015 UTC,"If Punisher becomes the antagonist to Daredevil, wouldn't he be an anti-villain?"
Defenders,397hiw,JonathanL72,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"I suppose. I wasn't necessarily suggesting he be the main antagonist. This scenario would be more of a side story (who is the man in the skull shirt and what are his motives?) he starts off being perceived as a villain, a crazy murderer, because we dont know his motivation or reasoning. Eventually , as the pieces are put together, we understand that he is still a crazy murderer, but with good intentions.  I would use this fairly sparingly though, saving the in depth characterisation for a potential spin off show. The primary antagonist would still be bullseye and/or Fisk."
Defenders,397hiw,RichHardLemonz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"The problem with a bunch of the stuff you've mentioned is it's two arcs from season 1 combined.  Fisk already was able to turn everyone against Daredevil, and the conflict you've described between Matt's unwillingness to go as far as others will was also done with the whole Stick storyline (and they seem to have set it up that he's going to return to the story sometime).  Some of these are things that I think are probably unavoidable to repeat, as they seem to be some of the underlying themes of the show but I think they need to be careful not to bore us by doing the same thing over and over again."

Defenders,397hiw,TweetPoster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think I would love to see a situation where Daredevil and Punisher end up in the same place at the same time and when the bad guys start getting killed it starts a fight between the two of them which ultimately ends up in Frank getting subdued and arrested.  He then attempts to hire Matt and Foggy, Matt initially tries to decline, they have a big philosophical argument and eventually Matt agrees to take the case even though he disagrees.  They manage to get him off on a technicality and they end up in virtually the same situation again where they both happen to go after the same baddie at the same time.  This time Punisher is beat by Daredevil again, but Matt won't help him and he ends up in jail on a longish sentence.  It may write out an interesting character while there's still more stories to tell with him, but that's the kind of thing you need to do to make the situations meaningful.  Plus once in prison that doesn't mean he's gone for good (although the guys he put there might want to try making that so)."

Disney owns ABC and Marvel and is very close with JJ Abrams, who is key in rebooting the Disney-owned Star Wars franchise.   Alias starred Jennifer Garner, a procedural spy thriller with a lot of detective work and supernaturally gifted spy, Sidney Bristow.

I'm a spoiler whore so I don't know where to censor myself, but my point of this diatribe is that considering how much we DO know about ""Jessica Jones"" we don't know a hell of a lot about the series being made about her. What little I have been able to glean does not have me happy right now.   The name ""AKA Jessica Jones"" indicated to me they'd keep on the screen that fascinating conflict of identity Jess has with herself in the comic books. Is she the little girl who fantasized about Johnny Storm (FOX), or failed to get (Sony) Peter Parker's attention? Is she the girl who woke up from a coma and learned she could fly? Is she the girl who tried to be a hero? Is she the detective? Is she a significant other with a child and a baby sitter? Is she what she wants to be, or what other people tell her to be? There is SO MUCH meat on this bone. It's a GREAT potential property. If they could JUST tell the story already told in the comic book, I would not be worried at all. That's not what they can do.   This series is to take place in the same world as the Marvel/Disney Cinematic Universe (MCU) which means they don't technically have access to Johnny Storm or Peter Parker or many other referenced characters in the comics. This was my first concern. There will need to be dramatic changes to her backstory to accommodate contractual limitations. So we ALREADY KNOW the story told in the comic books Alias and The Pulse CAN'T be told on Netflix as they were presented in the comics. Further, the actors in the movies do not want to do television without getting paid a lot of extra cash even for a cameo. I'm not even sure if Netflix programs can legally or contractually have access to characters available on ABC's SHIELD. Maybe offhand references will happen, but can Ward even show up in Hell's Kitchen for coffee? I doubt it. Can Lola even drive by in the background somewhere? I doubt it.   A big deal about the Jessica Jones' story is that she was ingrained in the Marvel Universe. Other characters whose tales had been told for decades affected Jessica in very visceral ways. Their very existence in her universe molded and shaped her in ways which she was not even consciously aware. I don't see how that can even be presented now in a way that connects her to established movies and TV series aside from Daredevil and Luke Cage, who happen to also be Netflix.   In the comics, she had a romantic sexual relationship with Scott Lang ""AKA"" Antman from the upcoming movie. Is that possible to even mention now on the Netflix show? Would Paul Rudd stoop so low as to do a web based series when he's doing MCU movies, or will he just be mentioned in passing as one of her past relationships? X-Men's Phoenix (yet another off limits property) helped give Jessica self confidence, but these plot duties are being given to a new character that hasn't been seen in the movies, and ISN'T Grey. Ms Marvel was very key in Alias, but in the MCU she's not even around yet! IF the rumors are true and it's Carrie Anne Moss as Hellcat that's replacing these roles? Okay, that sounds promising, but that brings me to a whole nother problem. When was Hellcat a hero? Before The Battle Over New York? WHEN exactly were there heroes running around that conveniently got ignored in all the movies before now?   In the comic book universe, Alias is a story that was overlayed into established canon for the 616 universe. You could say that Jessica had gone to school with Peter Parker, then went into a coma after an accident, then woke up and had super powers and she had a brief stint as a superhero for awhile and then Kilgrave messed her up and after a recovery period she dropped out for awhile gathered herself and then rebuilt her life as a dour and skeptical brownshoe. That all worked on the comic book page. The character wasn't mentioned in the other comics before her, cuz she didn't show up on anyone's radar.   If a woman was seen flying prior to Tony Stark's Iron Man? I'm pretty sure somebody somewhere woulda mentioned that in an MCU movie when Iron Man started flying around. Tony Stark's just copying that chick who flew before he did, and he needs a suit to do it.   In the MCU, Banner turned into The Other Guy less than a decade ago. Tony Stark admitted he was Iron Man less than half a decade ago. The events of Avengers happened last year give or take. SHIELD fell to Hydra less than a year ago. Has there honestly been enough time in the MCU timeline for Jessica Jones to have had the life described in the comic book, if the detective story of Jessica Jones is coinciding with Matt Murdock's origin as Daredevil? If The Battle Over New York just happened in the world of Jessica Jones, at what point did she have a career as a super hero?    If they had changed the name to ""Also Known As"" and dropped her name from it, I'd understand why. The name ""Jessica Jones"" only means something to those of us who actually read the comic book Alias, or The Pulse. I woulda thought they'd focus even more on the multiplicity of this fascinating character, but if they're just going with just her name.. that's rather ambiguous. What CAN they tell about her, if so much about her doesn't fit in the MCU?   I'll get downvoted for this and I don't care. What little we're being able to glean from a show so tight lipped about a questionable Marvel property with only niche popularity.. I'm not seeing much here that I can find hopeful. In fact if they were to take say five minutes of whatever they have in the can right now and present it to the public, in much the same way the DC/CW did for Legends or CBS did for Supergirl, I bet the result would be more like Supergirl (corny but srsly? pls) than Legends (corny but promising)."
Defenders,391akm,soulbreaker1418,5,Mon Jun 8 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"They can literally replace every character you mentioned with one from the comics like Cloak and Dagger, Hellcat,Valkyrie, and Nighthawk or any other superhero. It is a loose adaptation of the story and in the MCU Kevin feige has said that Spider-Man exists and we don't hear anything about him so  they can do the same for her. This show will way better then Supergirl or  Legends."

Defenders,391akm,slightlyaw_kward,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:17:03 2015 UTC,That is what i said it is a loose adaptation. Marvel has never fully copied a story from the comic just the main idea.They will still have the same themes and issues but change the cases. You were saying this looked as bad as supergirl because they can't copy the book exactly while that is not true. I think Jessica jones will change the superhero genre in a powerful way.

Snatch & Lock Stock Crank Blitz The Bank Job Redemption / Hummingbird Furious 7 Spy   He has a respectable degree of range, and has shown himself to be adept at action - he's a Hollywood pedigree martial-artist and action star - and also at comedy and some darker dramatic roles. Statham has got excellent comedic timing, and he's also exceptionally convincing as a dark and menacing presence. He doesn't preen, or put anything on; he just looks like he's an ace away from doing some serious and irrevocable violence in a lot of his roles. He's held his own on screen with Brad Pitt, Jet Lee (numerous times), Chris Evans, Ben Foster, Donald Sutherland, Paddy Considine, David Morrisey, Aiden Gillen, James Franco, Vin Diesel and many more - and even when the films weren't so good, and better actors have come off poorly, he's still held up his end (particularly with Blitz, where I think he's the only person to come out of that film still looking good).   I don't think you know what you're talking about, son. Statham's take on Bullseye would have been better than Colin Farrell's, for a start. And he would have represented a real physical presence and challenge to Cox's Daredevil, as well as holding that promise of movie translation."

So i think they will use Jessica Jones as a way to introduce more heroes like Hellcat and others to the MCU and her investigating Kilgrave.

I feel like they will use the same basic concpet which is Jessica Jones investing superheros.They will use her story as a way to bring in characters like Cloak & Dagger, Hellcat and minor heroes in the MCU since Jessica's origin is not that important. Jessia's show's purpose will be a world building  show instead of fulling focusing on her."

Defenders,38ocsn,soulbreaker1418,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:26:32 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we're going to get any overlap with shield. It's airing on abc, we might only be getting vague references.   I think an important change is that in the book one of the main ideas is that she used to be a superhero. In the MCU,  the age of heroes is just beginning. If we're not getting an origin story,  how do you think they'll explain her past?"
Defenders,38ocsn,ThePlaidBandit,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:50:39 2015 UTC,We are going to get flashbacks and there should be no overlap with shield. The show has enough material to stand on its own. I also don't think the age of heroes is beginning. A lot of heroes that have not made an appearance have been mentioned like Doctor Strange and Moon knight.
Defenders,38ocsn,DragonPup,3,Sat Jun 6 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"If you're the sort to care about spoilage,  skip this. What I describe is my speculation, but I don't like whining about spoilers so consider this your warning.   I am hoping the flashbacks in the comics will be the 1st season of the netflix series for Jess Jones. Like with Daredevil, we will focus on Jessica's childhood flashbacks. Her flashbacks will be of her childhood, before and during the accident that put her in a coma and granted her powers. I'm still hoping it's the same accident which made Matt blind (and dosed a rat and four turtles we'll never see) but I may be asking for too much.   In Daredevil the show told us Matt's back story early on while addressing a Now story that happens between Avenger movies. For Jessica I think they should start her Now story during the Battle of New York, but in a way where Jess never meets the Avengers directly.   The bulk of the show would be about Jess discovering she has powers, but before she encounters the purple man. Id save that for end of season one and maybe season two.   Because of the nature of tv compared to the comics, they may need to dramatically change her story to use characters they can access and use movie characters only peripherally. If I were writing this I would put her in a coma until The Incident where the hospital she had been in is attacked by the aliens but she wakes up to find herself trapped. She learns of her powers out of desperation, having to pull herself out of the rubble.   In the comics, the Avengers beat her up and apologize later, but the story will not be able to use the Avengers for contractual reasons. So instead id weave a tale of what happened to Jessica during the final act of the first Avengers movie. Id have her encounter Ben Urich during this period. From the ground, from their perspective, the Avengers were as unsafe and dangerous as the aliens. Ben deduces Jess has aquired powers somehow, and he warns her not to put on a stupid costume and play hero. She doesn't take his advice. She tries to emulate the Avengers, has some early lucky successes but when she encounters a certain somebody, Its mind over matter and she's completely outmatched."

Defenders,38a68g,PhuturePhil,51,Tue Jun 2 21:54:51 2015 UTC,This seemed more like speculation based on some confirmed and unconfirmed rumors.    I find it hard to believe Netflix is afraid of Blade/Ghost Rider being too supernatural/goofy when they already have Iron Fist in the pipeline which is heavy in the supernatural.
Defenders,38a68g,PhuturePhil,16,Tue Jun 2 23:24:28 2015 UTC,Yeah but Iron fist does not fight vampires and demons. They probably think bringing that mythology with out any context will seem weird. Like In Daredevil those Iron fist elements were implied to exist just not expanded on. Vampires and Demons have not been mentioned at all.
Defenders,38a68g,d3r3k1449,6,Tue Jun 2 23:34:57 2015 UTC,He fights a supernatural magic dragon.  Something tells me Marvel isnt afraid of anything past that point.

Defenders,38a68g,Ozzdo,19,Thu Jun 4 20:17:21 2015 UTC,I think Punisher makes more sense as a storyline for Daredevil season two as he and Daredevil have a rich history in the comics and would fit nicely in a post-Fisk arc.  Means & Ends would be a perfect place for Daredevil to pick back up. The juxtaposition of these two heroes and how they seek justice would make for great theater IMHO.
Defenders,38a68g,Ozzdo,3,Wed Jun 3 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Punisher still a show though. They can adapt Means & Ends as a episode portraying how ruthless Punisher is away from the main story-line in a similar way to the episode called ""Stick"". A Punisher show can work because all he would need is a strong supporting cast and adapt Ennis run since  Punisher does not have any Character development."
Defenders,38a68g,PLZ__DONT__PM__ME,7,Wed Jun 3 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Means & Ends be a running storyline throughout the second season - not just an episode.

Defenders,38a68g,Ozzdo,2,Wed Jun 3 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think the audience will though. Punisher represents something new in the MCU. He not like Iron man, Cap, Daredevil, or any type of other Character because he is dead inside.

Defenders,38a68g,peterkeats,17,Wed Jun 3 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been using the Inhumans recently, but that might change once the Inhumans movie scheduled for 2019 comes along. It’s a good bet the movie will ignore all or most of what the TV show has done.       Really, they'd better not. Otherwise, what's the point of an interconnected MCU? I'd at least like to see it addressed somehow. A rogue group of Inhumans hijacked an aircraft carrier and tried to infect the whole world with terrigen crystals. Wouldn't Black Bolt, the king of the Inhumans, have an opinion about that, at least?"
Defenders,38a68g,phorner23,5,Wed Jun 3 03:38:14 2015 UTC,Marvel would not let the terrigen crystals affect the whole world maybe like 3 people will gain powers and the fish pills will be recalled.That is to big of a change for something as lame as getting your powers because of a fish pill. Black is also a King that wants to protect the people on the moon he  probably does not care about the happenings of earth.
Defenders,38a68g,sunthunder,6,Wed Jun 3 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"There are way....WAY too many variables that would have to come into affect for that scenario to happen. 1) A person would have to get powers. 2) That person would then report their powers to the government. 3) the government investigates, and eventually (It would take some time) determine that fish oil pills were the cause (this would be after multiple other people, far more than three, also got powers and then decided to report those powers to the government) 4) Government recalls the fish pills.   Realistically, that doesn't get past number 2.  No one is going to get powers, and their first thought is going to be surrendering themselves to the government.   Also, I would hope Black Bolt would care about the goings-on of Inhumans on Earth. He's their king. Like I said before, if nothing else, he would have an opinion."
Defenders,38a68g,iDork622,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"I can guarantee you that it the terrigen crystals in the water won't affect the MCU as a whole. That would cause marvel to write that as an event that would affect the other shows and movies. It would require writers to actullay  try and connect it to AOS. They won't do that because every project in the MCU so far has been stand alone. Daredevil only had one reference to AOS and that was Creel. They would have to make it that people popping up with powers in the other shows and movies is a result of the fish oil thing and people will be like ""what the hell is that"".  I am telling you marvel would not make AOS affect the MCU that much.The fish oil thing will affect a small number of people and only on AOS. How lame would it be if a majority of people in the MCU got there powers because of a fish oil pill."
Defenders,38a68g,iDork622,2,Wed Jun 3 16:34:58 2015 UTC,DD had a couple of other references to SHIELD. There was a Cybertek reference and Matt and Skye went to the same orphanage.
Defenders,38a68g,grimacing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Yeah they did small stuff. The point I am trying to make is that marvel would not allow AOS to change literally every show in such a gigantic and dumb manner. the fish pill thing would not be a reference but a complete change of status quo for the MCU. It require someone to actually watch AOS to understand how someone might be inhuman or have powers if someone with powers show up on the other shows and for writers of those shows to write it in. Every Marvel project has been standalone with only references being made to other projects.That is why I think 2 or 3 people will gain powers from it and the pills will be recalled because every show can't address it.
Defenders,38a68g,iDork622,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"I don't need it to change the entire MCU. Realistically, and statistically, it wouldn't. Fish oil pills aren't that popular, and Inhumans aren't that populous in the world. I'd just like the events of the show to be addressed in some form in the Inhumans movie. I'd be happy if they at least acknowledged the existence of the Afterlife sanctuary. I'd love something like that. Jeph Loeb has assured fans repeatedly that ""It's all connected."" I'd just like to see it more, especially in places where the connection is already there, waiting to be made, as it is with the Inhumans.   Comics do it all the time. (Or they used to.) A person, or some piece of information is presented, and while it's not completely relevant or important to the main story, there's a little box in the corner of the panel that will say ""Want to know what this is about? Check out Thor #143! On stands now!"" or something like that. I'd just like a TV/Movie equivalent of that. Actually, there was a great example of something like this in recent crossover episodes of Flash and Arrow, where they would guest on each other's show, and make a reference to what's going on in their own show. If you want to know more about it, just watch their own show. It was really well done, actually.   But yeah. All I want is what basically amounts to a shout-out. That would be enough, and it would connect things. And above all else, most importantly, it would be cool."

The reason, I think, SHIELD is using Inhumans is to start familiarizing the term. We all know Mutants, and, well, I humans are the Disney substitute for them. Many people were probably asking who the hell Inhumans are when the movie was announced. Without having to rely on fantastic luck like with GoG, they have to start getting the Inhumans word out there. A Ms. Marvel show, for instance, also relies on it.   Film may be king, but the Avengers franchise is king over all, over GoG, over Inhumans, etc.   Well, it was a nice article to read nevertheless."

Defenders,383i4y,cleantoe,7,Tue Jun 2 04:23:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm I don't know, perhaps not. But either way, Spider-Man brings the total up to 5. I wouldn't put it past Marvel to introduce Blade and the Punisher eventually either."
Defenders,383i4y,suss2it,4,Tue Jun 2 04:29:26 2015 UTC,Blade and the Punisher don't necessarily have to be in New York tho. Punisher's current run has him in LA for example.

Defenders,383i4y,JonathanL72,25,Tue Jun 2 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"In the MCU don't we already have Hulk, Iron man, Cap America, Falcon, War Machine are all based in New York? I know Cap America use to fight in Germany but modern day cap is still based in New York. Pretty much the exception of Thor & Black Panther, almost every superhero is in New York. That's the one thing I don't like about Marvel, and Hollywood in general, is that New York is an overused setting."
Defenders,383i4y,RhettS,30,Mon Jun 1 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"Hulk really doesn't seem to be getting his own movies, and he's basically nomadic. Iron Man has the Stark/Avengers tower, but I'm pretty sure he primarily lives on the West Coast. Cap and Falcon both live in DC but go on missions internationally."
Defenders,383i4y,JonathanL72,6,Mon Jun 1 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"I did get the vibe that he lives partly in California, he did live in that one house on a cliff looking over the ocean that got blown up in Iron man 3, but his main residence is the stark/avengers tower, and he's been seen frequently in New York, so I still think that's where he's from.  but I didn't know Cap & Falcon are based in Washington DC thanks for clarifying that up."
Defenders,383i4y,RhettS,6,Mon Jun 1 23:38:04 2015 UTC,I'm not totally sure but from Cap 2 I got that sense.

Defenders,383i4y,xodus112,2,Tue Jun 2 04:25:32 2015 UTC,"Stark has lived on the West Coast in each of his three solo movies. The house by the cliff is his main residence in each of his three movies–and Iron Man 3 takes place after Avengers 1, so he had Stark Tower. He's been in New York a lot for the Avengers movies (though, I don't remember that much of Avengers 2 being in New York, but I've only seen it once) because that's where a lot of shit has gone down."
Defenders,383i4y,mrglow,11,Tue Jun 2 12:22:09 2015 UTC,"The Avengers are in New York State now, aren't they?"
Defenders,383i4y,Mmsenrab,5,Mon Jun 1 23:15:40 2015 UTC,I don't know about other movies but it makes sense in the MCU to have a lot of superheroes in New York because it was invaded by aliens. If I was a citizen in the MCU living in New York after the invasion I would be happy about all the heroes around.
Defenders,383i4y,APowell23,13,Mon Jun 1 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Fuck that. I'd be moving. No one is gonna attack Middle O' Nowhere,  South Dakota."

Defenders,383i4y,Diggasson,6,Tue Jun 2 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well when it comes to Marvel it seems like most of world's superheros & supervillians are in New York, I imagine a typical week for a new-yorker would be alien invasion monday, killer robots tuesday, evil experiment gone wrong Wednesday, Take over the world plot Thursday, Alternate universe crises Friday."
Defenders,383i4y,jjackrabbitt,3,Tue Jun 2 00:21:59 2015 UTC,Wouldn't people move away from NY just because of the heroes? At this point I would assume that people realize that the heroes attract the villains.
Defenders,383i4y,Ozzdo,3,Tue Jun 2 02:15:50 2015 UTC,And once Civil War rolls around we'll have Spider-Man swinging around NYC as well.
Defenders,383i4y,garrett1999o3,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"New York City has always been the epicenter of the Marvel Universe. I'd rather they not change that. Heroes and villains can, and have, popped up in other places around the country and world, but I've always liked that NYC is the place where they all come together, that there's an importance to this one location. It's to superheroes what Washington DC is to American politics.   I do agree, though, that NYC can be overused as a setting. I can't tell you how happy I was when I first saw San Andreas, that some place other than New York was being destroyed for a change."
Defenders,383i4y,theCANCERbat,5,Tue Jun 2 15:32:47 2015 UTC,I want to see more but in different parts of New York not just Hells Kitchen.I would like to see around 20 but each doing there own thing.

Defenders,383i4y,hargendarsh,2,Tue Jun 2 04:58:51 2015 UTC,LOL I get what you mean about team-ups but I want just to see small ones once every season on the show. Each hero needs to develop on there own.
Defenders,383i4y,Hawkguy67,5,Tue Jun 2 05:21:37 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if some of the characters moved to different cities. Why does everyone have to be in NY?

Budget wise, it may get tricky because it's probably going to require more CGI and wire stunts. But hey they did so well on the first one, Netflix may just throw a shit ton of money at them."
Defenders,37ie4y,your_mind_aches,2,Thu May 28 14:51:00 2015 UTC,Eh. Arrow does good with the grappling stuff and Daredevil has a much higher budget and more time to film than that.

Defenders,37e1sy,sneechesgetsteetches,3,Wed May 27 20:02:29 2015 UTC,Yes! Sofia Boutella should be the only logical choice for this role. She has the looks and the physical abilities to boot.

Defenders,379fpm,RustoleumZ,1 point,Tue May 26 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"I would not be a fan of Patsy or Greer suiting up in Jessica Jones.    Hellcat doesn't really have any powers, so there is not much to differentiate her from, say, Daredevil and her costume is way too vivid for real life.   I wouldn't mind Tigra showing up eventually, but with a modified origin.  A supersoldier experiment from HYDRA where they tried to replicate with animal DNA splicing or maybe an Inhuman, but not from a totem given by Cat Peope."
Defenders,379fpm,Lastdigist,2,Tue May 26 18:00:34 2015 UTC,Hellcats suit does have powers like low level telekinesis and why would you want another boring supersolider origin story and we saw skye become inhuman in AOS already why do it again. They don't even have to show the cat people just imply that they exist. It will be another mystery in the MCU and that makes the mythology better. I hope they adapt that origin.
Defenders,379fpm,Jackissocool,10,Tue May 26 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think they should wait before giving Pasty a suit until the defenders series, and putting in Tigra will make the show to crowded. They should wait to an show a easter egg implying she will be Hellcat."
Defenders,379fpm,Rheul,5,Tue May 26 00:56:59 2015 UTC,Waiting for Pasty to suit up in the defenders is a bad idea. That show might drop in 2017 or 2018 and . They should have Pasty become Hellcat in the pilot or in the first 5 episodes and use her as a way to keep Jessica close to the superhero community.
Defenders,379fpm,Rheul,2,Tue May 26 01:48:12 2015 UTC,They'll adapt her origin in a clever way. She's gonna be a former child star who used to do crappy teen romance shows. Now she's a model and superhero.

Defenders,36y5y1,ksaid1,29,Sat May 23 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"It's pretty cool that Matt spent an entire episode of Daredevil just lying on the couch trying to recover from a stab wound. Even though he probably recovered much faster than real life, he's still so much more vulnerable than most other superhero (or even regular action movie!) characters."

Defenders,36y5y1,Pikapeach,20,Sat May 23 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. And since she looks like she's thrown in the trash, perfect time for Claire to walk by and accidentally adopt another dumpster baby."

Defenders,36y5y1,eskimo_bros,31,Sat May 23 03:25:28 2015 UTC,I doubt anyone did that to her I think it is a flying accident. She can't fly very well and crashed into trash.
Defenders,36y5y1,iSamurai,13,Sat May 23 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"She did get beat up pretty bad a couple of times in Alias, but it was always while fighting another super human. Have any metas been announced for the show that have super strength?  I know another guy suggested a flying accident, but she shouldn't have gotten seriously injured from a crash, especially if she landed in trash."
Defenders,36y5y1,eskimo_bros,12,Sat May 23 05:22:53 2015 UTC,I mean she has to get beat up somewhat at some point. Would be a pretty boring show if she just creams everyone she fights or whatever.
Defenders,36y5y1,ksaid1,7,Sat May 23 06:01:50 2015 UTC,Nobody's arguing that. We're just wondering who did it.
Defenders,36y5y1,kickshaw,4,Sat May 23 06:07:23 2015 UTC,From what I remember of Alias she doesn't actually spend much time fighting. Usually people yell at her for being a mutie and she just walks off in a huff. Most of the conflict comes from her trying to solve mysteries.
Defenders,36y5y1,Inspace96,5,Sat May 23 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"There's the one creepy superhuman guy who tries to strangle her, and Jessica Drew throws her across a room at least once."
Defenders,36y5y1,CodeonConduct,5,Sat May 23 14:43:49 2015 UTC,Maybe in the mcu she only has super strength but no durability.
Defenders,36y5y1,madcitizenkane,7,Sat May 23 05:30:29 2015 UTC,I hope they don't weaken Jessica's powers like that. I love the thought of her being one of the stronger superheroes in the mcu but hate the thought of being one. It makes it ironic.
Defenders,36y5y1,crapusername47,2,Sat May 23 06:20:30 2015 UTC,Actually how strong is Jessica in terms of strength when compared with other heroes in the MCU? I think Jessica would at least make the top 10.Like above Cap and but below Luke and Spider-man. Somewhere in the middle.
Defenders,36y5y1,Ninja_Wallace,10,Sat May 23 06:34:07 2015 UTC,"In the comics she can lift a regular sized car, which puts her on a level roughly with Spidey.  She could not go toe to toe with Iron Man, Thor or Luke Cage.   As for durability, someone with strength equal or above hers could give her a bloody nose and she may or may not be bulletproof but it took her a long time to come back from the beating the Avengers gave her when she attacked them on Killgrave's orders."
Defenders,36y5y1,Flamma_Man,8,Sat May 23 07:37:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, she could go toe-to-toe with Luke Cage alright."
Defenders,36y5y1,Chris_Parker,3,Sat May 23 13:03:56 2015 UTC,It wasn't even from just The Avengers - just The Vision. Put her in a coma with one punch and almost popped her eye out.

Defenders,36y5y1,R-KIVE724,6,Sat May 23 06:51:50 2015 UTC,"That first picture looks like a reference photo from the comic, dead on. Very excited."
Defenders,36wfe5,slingstone,40,Fri May 22 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"That is pretty appropriate. Fun fact: In daredevil 7 way back in the day, Daredevil fought Namor, the Sub Mariner. Namor is WAY more powerful than Daredevil, and he's not stupid either, so the writers just had him kick the shit out of Daredevil for the whole issue, with Matt being smacked down, then still coming back despite being hopelessly outmatched. In the end Namor gives up whatever bullshit he was trying to pull purely out of respect for Matt, saying ""Out of all the super powered humans I have fought, none have been more courageous than he, the most vulnerable of all."" It was one of the first times a superhero had ever won by losing."
Defenders,36wfe5,fench,3,Fri May 22 19:01:23 2015 UTC,That's awesome.
Defenders,36wfe5,fidderjiggit,1 point,Fri May 22 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the (Spoilers for Hunter X Hunter) final fight in Hunter X Hunter's Hunter Exam arc. The main character can't possibly beat his opponent, but he just refuses to surrender, annoying his opponent into conceding. THEN the main character refuses to accept his opponent's concession! So his opponent just knocks him out, concedes, and walks out."

Defenders,36rauc,platypus_bear,8,Thu May 21 23:38:44 2015 UTC,I dislike it actually. There's too many lines and shapes breaking up the flow. At least make every piece the same color so it comes together. It's like it's trying to be sleek AND tactical but achieving neither.
Defenders,36rauc,CenturyEagle,5,Thu May 21 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"I know ditching the color scheme would rustle too many jimmies... but I think it would be so much more badass if it just stuck to blacks & greys. Makes more sense in the camouflage department, and blacks just always looks better."
Defenders,36rauc,qp0n,3,Thu May 21 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"I loved the black suit, and I am glad they spent nearly 100% of season 1 with it, but if they went BACK to black after the final episode of this season, my jimmies would definitely be among the rustled. The red suit needs to be improved, but it needs to stay as red as Battling Jack's robe, and the entire opening credits."
Defenders,36rauc,phrankygee,2,Fri May 22 08:23:43 2015 UTC,I'd like to hope that his outfits change over the seasons like many MCU superheroes generally do.
Defenders,36rauc,o-o-o-o-o-o,8,Sun May 24 04:18:59 2015 UTC,Huh. I wouldn't have suspected the horned portion of the helmet disconnects from the cowl.

Defenders,36rauc,concretin,7,Fri May 22 04:20:10 2015 UTC,The lines on the costume almost give it a samurai vibe. I wonder if that might be intentional since he fights the Hand ninjas.

Defenders,36mqi2,Hellknightx,27,Wed May 20 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"I know it's not really in the comics, but I think he should have a solid plate across his eyes. I loved the look of the Man in Black costume because it hides all of his facial features, and I think it would have looked cool to see that somehow transition into his red costume."
Defenders,36mqi2,Badluck1313,21,Wed May 20 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it'd kind of be a dead giveaway if the costume had eye plates. I mean, it can be assumed that maybe he's able to see through the black mask, but not having eyes on his new, solid mask would pretty much rule out anyone who relies on sight."
Defenders,36mqi2,AnOnlineHandle,2,Wed May 20 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah but nobody else in the world has his sort of echo location abilities, they're not going to know wtf is going on, and are just going to think he's magical."

Defenders,36mqi2,quangtran,11,Thu May 21 03:24:53 2015 UTC,"The showrunner explained why his bandana and red mask covers up his nose.

Defenders,36mqi2,HardDifficulty,7,Wed May 20 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"The black bits honestly weren't my issue with the costume but after seeing this, it looks so much better! I think it looks more sleek and less clunky as one color."

I think the reason this DD costume has the nose, is more to protect Murdock in the suit. Being the realistic version, Potter wanted to provide as much protection to him as possible, thus giving him the nose protector. Your version looks great too though, much more original looking!"

Most of the movies are on this grand scale gods saving the world from aliens or something; and so far this entire show has stuck to these fairly human stories of regular criminal boses and vigilantes fighting over a few city blocks that few people outside the city would care much about. And I really like how that's worked out and it's a cool part of the universe to explore, it would be kind of cool if maybe other than a small wink here and there they remained relative separate."

Showing Daredevil subduing some inhuman protesters trying to take advantage of the rioting. But I'm not sure such a scene would fit in the context of it all.
Defenders,36oblz,imjustbettr,2,Wed May 20 22:33:00 2015 UTC,Seems like maybe they want to keep the defenders separated until they can all be introduced and developed thoroughly. I have no evidence to base this on though.
Defenders,36oblz,iiJakexD123,2,Thu May 21 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"Do I think he should? Yes. Do I want him to?  Yes. Would it make complete sense, seeing as how he's both a masked vigilante, AND a lawyer? Absolutely. Do I think he will? No. A mention or a small cameo is possible, like they did with Spiderman in the Netflix show, but I don't see him being a major character."

Defenders,36oblz,DaMaskedAvenger,1 point,Thu May 21 14:34:57 2015 UTC,I hope we will see Matt Murdock at an attorney for The Avengers...but in the comics i believe Daredevil always denied joining the Avengers because Hell Kitchen is more important..can someone confirm this?
Defenders,36oblz,diamened,0,Thu May 21 14:43:36 2015 UTC,I think not. Marvel made one thing right which is to make the movies leak into the TV shows but they don't seem to be willing to make the TV shows leak into the movies. I think it's a mistake.  The Whedon said recently that the Avengers movies are made for people who only watch the movies. I think such people don't exist.
Defenders,36oblz,Mullet_Ben,2,Thu May 21 12:56:16 2015 UTC,"I think such people don't exist.   Consider that The Avengers made more money at the box office than any other comic book movie. In all likelihood, that's because there is a large constituency of people who haven't seen any comic book movie other than The Avengers. At the very least, a very, very large portion of people seeing any given MCU movie haven't seen all of the MCU movies. The average watcher of the Avengers probably doesn't know the difference between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk. So if the audience for the movies hasn't even seen all the movies, what makes you think they've seen any of the TV shows?  Comic book movies aren't just for nerds. The Avengers is the third highest grossing movie of all time. Ultron is currently number 8. Do you really think that a TV show exclusively on netflix even comes close?"
Defenders,36oblz,AwesomePocket,2,Thu May 21 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but I you're totally wrong. The movies make billions, but many don't watch the shows at all. SHIELD kinda struggled to keep people watching after season 1 started off so slowly."
Defenders,36o5q8,cnaiurbreaksppl,3,Wed May 20 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"Alias: Vol 4 has Jessica Jones' interaction with Daredevil. You can get all of the volumes to read up on JJ's entire run. It's 28 issues or 4 volumes in total.  Then there's Shadowland which has a bunch of crossover stuff.  And as far as street level similar to The Punisher, look into Moon Knight."
Defenders,36o5q8,Larfox,1 point,Wed May 20 23:29:57 2015 UTC,"These look great!! Thanks so much.   Quick question though, what's daredevil's back story for coming to control the hand? My gf has picked up a couple daredevil series that I haven't read yet, so I'm just wondering if it's in those."
Defenders,36o5q8,d3r3k1449,2,Thu May 21 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"Speaking of both Luke Cage and The Hand you'd probably really dig New Avengers that started in 2005 (iirc). Early Vol. 1 appearances by Daredevil as well and some of ""his"" other characters have big plot roles like Elektra and Echo. Plus plenty of Jessica Jones (she is pregnant at the start) and Spidey and Wolverine are on the team too for a further sweet bonus. The series is also a good seque into and a large part of the various crossover events of that time period including House of M, Civil War and Secret Invasion."

Defenders,36o5q8,mastelsa,2,Wed Jun 10 06:02:34 2015 UTC,Marvel's digital comics and iPad app have Man Eithout Fear on sale at the moment. Good read.
Defenders,36o5q8,mastelsa,1 point,Sat May 23 01:24:00 2015 UTC,"If you're planning on reading a lot of comics in a relatively short amount of time, you might consider a month-by-month Marvel Unlimited account.  It's $10/month and it's got huge archives of old and newer comics.  The only catch is that the Unlimited access to ongoing series stays about 8-6 issues behind.  It's mathematically worth it if you're going to read more than 3 issues per month, and if you read everything you want to read you can cancel the subscription any time.  As for recommendations, I really enjoyed the Mark Waid series that started in 2011 (and the continuation of it that started last year).  I credit that series and Matt Fraction's Hawkeye with getting me into comics.  He doesn't have any interaction with Jessica Jones or Luke Cage in that, but there are team-ups with Spider-Man, Hulk, Silver Surfer, and The Punisher, which are all really fun.  And probably more that I can't remember."
Defenders,36iu9u,rkkim,54,Tue May 19 18:32:13 2015 UTC,"It never dawned on me that Fisk was autistic, makes sense. Was this ever confirmed?"
Defenders,36iu9u,therealScarzilla,31,Tue May 19 20:37:05 2015 UTC,I always got the impression that he was a little bit aspy (as our pediatrician would say)
Defenders,36iu9u,Anivair,15,Wed May 20 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"The whole time I was watching the show, I just kept saying ""This fellas definitely on the spectrum""."
Defenders,36iu9u,Djammer,5,Wed May 20 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  and I thought it was a really good depiction."
Defenders,36iu9u,Anivair,15,Wed May 20 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"It's never confirmed in the show and I haven't seen anything said by the creators.  I think he acts a bit ""autistic"" (most of Dinofrio's characters do, lol).  However, even though we don't see a lot of his as a teen/kid... he didn't really present any symptoms there.  He is probably more just delayed in some areas (emotionally, relationally) and has some quirks from his childhood trauma completely messing him up.  I don't buy the autistic thing at all."
Defenders,36iu9u,SlipShodBovine,27,Wed May 20 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"Fisk's backstory suggests that it's also possible his social awkwardness is a result of his traumatic childhood, but this is definitely an interesting article.  What is weird, though, is that it doesn't mention Melvin Potter at all. He's the character who designs Daredevil's suit, and unlike Fisk there is absolutely no question that he has some sort of social or learning disability. Surely that's worth discussing in an article like this. I'd like to know what the author thinks about how that character is represented."
Defenders,36iu9u,ksaid1,6,Wed May 20 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  We don't see a lot of Fisk as a kid, but he doesn't present nearly as much back then as he does when he is older, so I think the trauma is the main cause.  It was my first thought that he was on the spectrum, but I don't think it's the case and I think we will see those tenancies fade as he recovers from that trauma because of Vanessa.  and you're right.  Potter should have been mentioned. He definitely is a savant of some sort."
Defenders,36iu9u,SlipShodBovine,3,Wed May 20 14:26:47 2015 UTC,Good point about Potter.
Defenders,36iu9u,d3r3k1449,11,Thu May 21 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"My argument against him being autistic (which I don't believe he is) is that he didn't exhibit any of the signs before murdering his father.  He seemed a sweet kid, who was chubby, a little awkward (but not unlike many other kids in that age range), and was bullied at home and at school.  I think the trauma is what led to his ""awkwardness"" as an adult."
Defenders,36iu9u,cocainelady,7,Wed May 20 11:24:17 2015 UTC,"I've known a good amount of autistic kids from high school who are able tp act more ""normal"" at home with their parents. It's a comfort zone for them.  We didn't see little Fisk in a classroom, or in a social environment. We saw him with his parents, and once with his dad and a bully in the neighborhood. So there's not too much to go off of with the flashback scenes.   I do agree that little Fisk maybe seemed a bit too ""normal"" if he was going to be autistic, but that could just be the child/young actor(nothing against him. Autism may just be too difficult for him to comprehend and portray right now)."
Defenders,36iu9u,redjc99,36,Wed May 20 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm....don't know where I read it, maybe on this sub, maybe somewhere else...but I don't believe Fisk was autistic.  I'm not an expert but he didn't display many of the signs of autism.  I specifically disagree with the author about Fisk not being able to maintain eye contact--there are many scenes where he did.  And he's able to relate romatically to Vanessa, which is something I think a truly autistic character would have EXTREME difficulty pulling off the way he did.  My first reaction when seeing Fisk was to think he could be autistic or has Aspergers.  But after more consideration and actually observing him in action...I changed my mind and realized D'Onofrio is playing him as a somewhat awkward guy, but not autistic.  Edit--found the thread here from a few weeks ago.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Defenders/comments/33luwt/is_wilson_fisk_on_the_autism_spectrum_s01e04/"
Defenders,36iu9u,Matsuyama_Mamajama,40,Tue May 19 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"I'm autistic, so I can help with the eye contact thing. It's just a tendency, and it can be overcome with practice. Fisk has obviously had tons of time to practice. He also strikes me as uncomfortable just being around people, like he has to concentrate on it all the time, unless he's consumed by emotion like when he's slamming a guy's head in a door or picking up an annoying Daredevil and throwing him around like a sack of potatoes.  Also, his romantic attraction to Vanessa seems to me to be just like what an autistic person would experience; he is SO in love with her that she can draw him out of his comforting routine, and he can push right up against that wall of discomfort and break through.   Remember; autistic people can relate to others, we just are fucking terrible at showing it. Our emotions are bottled up inside, but they do exist."
Defenders,36iu9u,yarrpirates,5,Wed May 20 00:20:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually saw a TON of autistic tendencies in his character. My SO is a physical therapist that works with autistic kids. Thanks for the input!
Defenders,36iu9u,nottherealstanlee,4,Wed May 20 00:40:46 2015 UTC,Semi-related: does the internet help you socialize at all?
Defenders,36iu9u,KyleProbably,6,Wed May 20 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"It really did early on. From teenhood until mid-twenties I just sat online as much as I could, interacting mainly through text. These days, however (I'm 37) I like to see who I'm talking to, so I can use all these lovely things I've learned about human emotional cues to socialise better. To any autistic kids reading this: it's actually really fascinating how much you can tell about people when you study up on outward signs of emotion, and how context affects everything! Well worth a bit of dedication."
Defenders,36iu9u,yarrpirates,7,Wed May 20 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"The autistic spectrum is just that: a spectrum. Some people with autism cannot interact at all. Others can, to an extent.   Seeing Fisk as autistic is pretty obvious to me."
Defenders,36iu9u,AgentKnitter,7,Wed May 20 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"As some with High Functioning Aspergers , Fisk never really struck me as Autistic. Socially Awkward, yes, but Autistic ? No.   Not everyone who is socially awkward is Autistic."
Defenders,36iu9u,Omnikiller,14,Wed May 20 23:02:23 2015 UTC,I definitely got the autistic vibe from Fisk and I thought it was an awesome character choice. There's so many levels of autism and I thought Fisk as an autistic guy made him all the more approachable and yet unpredictable at the same time.
Defenders,36iu9u,nottherealstanlee,2,Tue May 19 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he is supposed to be autistic... He's definitely a a bit messed up, though. Then again the autism spectrum at this point is pretty wide these days."

Defenders,36iu9u,pitaenigma,4,Wed May 20 13:45:16 2015 UTC,He made a comment about how Fisk is like a child in many ways but didn't bring up autism in the AMA.
Defenders,36iu9u,Nurglings,-1,Wed May 20 13:59:51 2015 UTC,I think Vincent D'Onofrio is autistic and so every character he has every played since Gomer Pyle kind of comes off that way as well.
Defenders,36l0tl,Silent_Samazar,12,Wed May 20 04:08:22 2015 UTC,Fisk wanted him free and rigged the jury to let him go free so he could keep stabbin' dudes. Murdoch unrigged the jury and then won the case on his own skills.
Defenders,36l0tl,astoundingchair,8,Wed May 20 05:53:01 2015 UTC,"You're mostly correct.  However, after Murdoch unrigged the case by getting the blackmailed woman off the jury, he made a effort to lose the case without making it completely obvious only to realize that another juror had been blackmailed, thus resulting in a hung jury."
Defenders,36l0tl,Travis_Touchdown,5,Thu May 21 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"Matt wouldn't need to be a vigilante if justice was always done in the courtroom.  He didn't want to win the case, he wanted to see if justice was truly done in that courtroom or not, free of Fisk's meddling.  It turns out it wasn't, so he suited up.  Like he was telling the jury (paraphrased), ""right and wrong are very important questions, but all that matters here is facts.""  The ""facts"" set a murderer free, so Matt made sure that another kind of justice found him outside the courtroom."
Defenders,36l0tl,amanzarak,2,Wed May 20 15:02:40 2015 UTC,Such a good speech.
Defenders,36l0tl,XMenOrangesTangerine,3,Mon May 25 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"I was confused about this episode too, but after watching through a second time, I figured it out:  Basically, Fisk just wanted Prohaska dead so they could take over his holdings in Kitchen Taxi. But, he wanted to keep Healey out of prison, so they rigged the jury, twice, to ensure it would end up a mistrial.  The only reason they hired Nelson and Murdock for the case is because they're a brand new firm, with a squeaky clean reputation, and so no one in the legal system would be suspicious of jury tampering. Fisk and Leland wanted as little connection to Healey as possible so their takeover of Kitchen Taxi immediately after Prohaska's murder wouldn't seem fishy."
Defenders,36l0tl,Roldo421,0,Wed May 20 17:14:02 2015 UTC,I think it was mostly to show how powerful Fisk was. It didn't really have to make sense

Defenders,36jxpo,Spatula26,17,Tue May 19 23:46:24 2015 UTC,Daredevil did win.  He doesn't want to eradicate all crime - he's a psychopath with a vengeance fetish.  He got his fix with the Kingpin and now he'll get to fight some more crime.  It's a win-win.
Defenders,36jxpo,boysetsfire1988,4,Tue May 19 23:38:01 2015 UTC,"i have to disagree here - you're right with matt being driven by vengeance, but he is definitely no psychopath. he shows real empathy, has a deep relationship to foggy, feels remorse and seeks for divine forgiveness and has a high sense for morality - all of these elements can't be found in psychopaths. If he were a psychopath, he would have killed fisk at the first opportunity, and he would definitely not sit in that small office with foggy - he'd be part of a big ass company, making his way to the top as fast as possible (most non-criminal psychopaths can be found in high, powerful positions - especially among CEOs, lawyers, politicians or cops)"

If he locks everyone up, you may argue what's the point if they wouldn't be condemned anyway? But if he let them stay on the streets, then why did he even put the mask in the first place?

Defenders,36dsh2,thedumbprogrammer,9,Tue May 19 05:46:55 2015 UTC,The show is fantastic of you can make it through the first 16 episodes. Everything after season 1 episode 17 all the way through the season 2 finale which aired last Tuesday has been great. They are really starting to lay the foundation for the next set of movies. If you've got the time I say go for it.
Defenders,36dsh2,KMoneyGT,4,Tue May 19 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"I think fantastic is stretching it a bit. After 16 episodes it becomes extremely acceptable background television. It should only be followed fanatically by super SHIELD fans (not even general Marvel fans, as the fusion of the two worlds is only a handful of times a season)."
Defenders,36dsh2,TheCrimsonCritic,1 point,Tue May 19 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love the MCU, but SHIELD is at best a mediocre-to-pretty-good show. It very rarely manages to do anything all that great, and is frequently clunky, directionless, and/or cliched.  I enjoy it for the little MCU-related plot points, references to the rest of the universe, and for Kyle MacLachlan's absolutely scene-stealing moments in the show, but not much else.  Although I did think this season's finale set up the possibility of things getting better in the future, but we'll see."
Defenders,36dsh2,ImpressiveDoggerel,8,Tue May 19 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"Ya'll are crazy! The show is really good in the 2nd season and when it crosses over with Cap 2, it's really fun and unique. The first 16 episodes are ROUGH though for sure... You can skip probably 13 of them and not miss too much of a beat. But the 2nd season was really good. Production value isn't there, acting is spotty (Kyle MacLachlan is great but Dichen Lachman is really bad), but the plot is great."
Defenders,36dsh2,nottherealstanlee,-4,Tue May 19 16:45:29 2015 UTC,The season half of season 2 is pretty horrible I mean the 1st half was good but some storylines don't go any where and the effect budget gets pretty bad gets bad in the 2nd half. I think the Winter Soldier stuff is where AOS reached it peak because it does not get that good in season 2.

Or that the May storyline that explains why she's called the Cavalry wasn't a well told and tragic story? I mean sure the show isn't going to win an Emmy but it's fun television. All they need is some better production man some of the effects are really bad. The story though is fine. The finale was really great.
Defenders,36dsh2,nottherealstanlee,1 point,Tue May 19 18:29:35 2015 UTC,Yeah that was a great scene but May should have had her own back story instead of tieing it in with inhumans and it kind lost its hype. I thought the first half was really  good they just kind of lost it when dealing with the second half for example all that real shield nonsense went no  where and everyone was calling it the beginning of civil war which it was not.
Defenders,36dsh2,suss2it,2,Tue May 19 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it went nowhere, but they definitely missed a beat with it. I mean it's not the show's fault that people unfairly put the expectation of starting Civil War on that conflict. Besides, the implications are still there as seeds for Civil War. Powered people vs. Non-powered people. Still that's just one point. The greater story arc of Skye/Daisy's development and her family was great."
Defenders,36dsh2,VanDroombeeld,0,Tue May 19 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"Quick! Everybody downvote this guy, he has a contrary opinion!"
Defenders,36dsh2,VanDroombeeld,5,Fri May 22 07:39:30 2015 UTC,Its amazing.
Defenders,36dsh2,VanDroombeeld,1 point,Tue May 19 13:28:44 2015 UTC,Amazing is pretty big word I mean not everything in season 2 was that it had some problems and weaknesses. Did you really enjoy everything in season 2?.
Defenders,36dsh2,GrowMender,2,Tue May 19 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"The good outweigh the less then so good, in my eyes. So I dont really find the need to focus and nitpick the things small things that dint go so well. The story was there, the ass kicking was there, the easter eggs wer there, the potential universe growth was there. It had sentiment, shock, laughs, and twists. It tied into the Movie really well, because of Phil, Fury was able to be there to save the day. So it was amazing in my eyes. There could have been little things that could have been better, but its a waste of energy to focus about them."
Defenders,36dsh2,FNAKC,2,Wed May 20 14:22:33 2015 UTC,It depends on what you are looking for its way different from Daredevil its the kind of show that get gets good then goes to being bad again. I also would not say its setting up the next movies people just assumed that it is. I would wait til season 3 to watch.
Defenders,36dsh2,elguitarro,-27,Tue May 19 12:16:19 2015 UTC,You talking about the fish oil thing because i hope that does not feature because it kind of dumb. I mean getting your powers because of a pill not very cool. I think they should keep the inhumans that on AOS and focus on superheroes.
Defenders,36dsh2,legochemgrad,14,Mon May 18 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Its not cool, I agree. But its a smart way to flesh out there being more super powered people. And making them inhuman is a super easy way to explain where their powers comefrom. You say it should focus on suoer heroes... Well, it dusnt matter where yuor powers come from. You can be a hero anyway."
Defenders,36dsh2,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon May 18 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying but i don't want every hero in the MCU to gain there powers by fish pill. If a character is inhuman make them inhuman don't change the origins of characters like cloak and dagger, she-hulk, and Spider-Man to make them inhuman because that is dumb."
Defenders,36dsh2,your_mind_aches,13,Mon May 18 18:44:42 2015 UTC,Inhumans are still Inhuman and the other characters power origins don't have to change unless they are a mutant (due to license issues and Fox). Instead of a Terrigan bomb going off in the atmosphere triggering ancient Kree genetic tinkering now it's happening through the food chain. Doing it this way instead of a bomb gives enough time for the movies and shows to establish everything needed for the Inhumans and Infinity War movies.
Defenders,36dsh2,your_mind_aches,7,Mon May 18 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"They don't even have to mention it again, just people getting powers (out of the blue... deep blue sea)"
Defenders,36dsh2,crapusername47,1 point,Mon May 18 22:10:01 2015 UTC,I get what you are saying and i am OK with inhumans gaining there powers though the use of a fish oil pill but I not OK with established super heroes origins like she-hulk and cloak and dagger gaining there powers though fish oil pills and being inhumans. Every hero in the MCU gained there powers though accidents or experiments and I want it to stay that way every hero in the MCU is not inhuman.
Defenders,36dsh2,crapusername47,3,Tue May 19 03:42:31 2015 UTC,But no one is saying non-inhuman superheroes are getting their powers like that. Everyone keeps telling you only inhumans will get their inhuman abilities through fish oil. Only inhumans.
Defenders,36dsh2,mwriteword,3,Tue May 19 05:27:19 2015 UTC,It's also in random sushi and fish fillets
Defenders,36dsh2,craiye,2,Mon May 18 21:41:29 2015 UTC,They already changed the origins of  for the MCU.   Spider-Man already has his powers.
Defenders,36dsh2,mwriteword,1 point,Tue May 19 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"She is OK since she is a shield agent I am cool with that I just dont want superheroes like Cloak and Dagger, She-hulk and any other superheroes to have there origins changed because of a fish pill. If they want to show inhumans fine just don't change established superheroes who are not inhumans."
Defenders,36dsh2,craiye,1 point,Tue May 19 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"Well... Quake wasn't. But I get what you're trying to say.   Honestly though, Cloak and Dagger aren't that well-known to the public. Their origin stories could be changed."
Defenders,36dsh2,level1gamer,3,Tue May 19 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"Cloak and Dagger origin is the reason why they fight crime in the first place. They got there powers because of what a drug did to them and vowed to fight the drug trade. You can't just make them inhuman and call it a day and even though Skye is Quake she is not a superhero in the same way Daredevil,Jessica Jones are she is a sheild agent and not a superhero."
Defenders,36dsh2,MTDearing,1 point,Tue May 19 04:21:27 2015 UTC,You've got a point there.
Defenders,36dsh2,GimmeTwo,7,Tue May 19 07:43:37 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. One of the storylines in Alias was about Mutant Growth Hormone dealers.  If some nefarious organisation found out what caused those who took those fish oil pills to suddenly manifest powers then you have your replacement.
Defenders,36dsh2,level1gamer,1 point,Mon May 18 18:43:12 2015 UTC,That is something i have no problem with i just hope they don't use it as a way to change superhero origins.
Defenders,36dsh2,Carlthecool,1 point,Mon May 18 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"Oh agreed, definitely. The only issue is the similarity of Jess and Matt Murdock's origin stories. People might feel they're repeating themselves when that's not really true, it's just that time is compressed somewhat here."
Defenders,36dsh2,UVladBro,11,Mon May 18 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"I would love it if Jessica Drew were introduced, and even if she went on to be in the main avengers team, why not show a little more integration by having her migrate into the films?  Also, David Tennant visited the Marvel HQ a while back, and they posted pictures of him around the office, 2 of which he posed next to each Jessica in a mural...."
Defenders,36dsh2,NickBR,6,Mon May 18 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"You know he's been cast as Purple Man, right?"
Defenders,36dsh2,TheHandyman1,3,Mon May 18 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why I thought it might be a hint for the series since he posed with both jessica's."
Defenders,36dsh2,meggyver,3,Mon May 18 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misread your first post a bit and didn't understand you meant he posed with Jessica Drew as well. Here's to hoping she's in the series!"
Defenders,36dsh2,Dr_Toast,2,Mon May 18 17:48:14 2015 UTC,I heard the defenders will be in Infinity War part 1 so that might be cool to see.
Defenders,36dsh2,meggyver,11,Mon May 18 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with including existing superheroes in shows like Agents of SHIELD and Jessica Jones is that Marvel has been so successful, any superhero, no matter how obscure, has potential to have their own movie or TV show. Obvious ones like Punisher, Moon Knight, Cloak & Dagger all have potential for their own projects.  But, Jessica Drew seems really likely.  I doubt they'd ever do a Spider-Woman show or movie because the confusion with Spider-Man and she's a bit of a wonky character anyways.  Luke Cage is pretty obvious. Since he's already been cast, it's very likely he'll appear first in her series.   Darkhawk may be obscure enough."
Defenders,36dsh2,m_walusi,3,Tue May 19 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Cage is in eight of the thirteen episodes I believe. Jessica Drew deserves a show, even if it's Jessica Drew: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. or something like that and they never call her Spider-Woman"
Defenders,36dsh2,FNAKC,2,Tue May 19 00:44:18 2015 UTC,I do agree about Punisher and Moon knight getting TV shows but I think Cloak and Dagger translate well on Jessica Jones I thought a good scenario would be Jessica is called in to do a missing persons case and the Roxxon oil company is trying to cover it up till Jessica is able to find them and learns about the horrible experiments Roxxon did to them and Jessica helps them break free and mentor them by the end they decide to become superheroes but Jessia thinks its a bad idea. A Netflix mini series can then follow there adventures in the same way as Agent carter til they return in the defenders.
Defenders,36dsh2,kravitzz,2,Tue May 19 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"Darkhawk! I remember buying darkhawk #1 when it first came out and hoping that I had just purchased the next Spider-Man #1 or something. I was in junior high and loved those comics. I probably bought the first 12 issues before moving on to some other obsession.  Pretty sure Darkhawk is a terrible comic, but I am far too biased to ever admit it."

Defenders,36dsh2,nottherealstanlee,2,Mon May 18 20:22:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I don't want She-Hulk or Red Hulk in any MCU format, I feel like it cheapens the Hulk himself."
Defenders,36dsh2,nottherealstanlee,7,Mon May 18 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Red Hulk, but I think She-Hulk enriches the character of the Hulk."
Defenders,36dsh2,ZachsMind,8,Mon May 18 22:29:14 2015 UTC,Especially because of the lawyer connection here too. She's a much different Hulk.
Defenders,36dsh2,astoundingchair,9,Tue May 19 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think she shows how a more mentally healthy person reacts to that power.  Bruce has these bottle rage issues from past traumas.

Defenders,367y2e,kravitzz,0,Sun May 17 18:27:40 2015 UTC,What do you mean? The MCU is not connected to the comic books or the characters within it. They don't make any references other than in-universe reference. Daredevil doesn't have many other than the pretty glaring references to the Avenengers.  Any characters that exist in the comic books practically don't exist in the MCU unless they're featured or talked about.
Defenders,367y2e,kravitzz,1 point,Sun May 17 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I'm only halfway though Daredevil, so I don't know if certain references are going to pop up later, but I meant moments such as when Owlsley mentions his son Lee. It was an offhand comment that didn't really mean anything in context, and mentioning Owlsley's son by name made for a pretty random line in an otherwise tight script. It seemed like it a nod to something in the comics, which I noticed but didn't understand. So my post was asking if any comic experts felt like writing down all the references they catch in each episode and making a post explaining them."
Defenders,367y2e,wtffighter,2,Sun May 17 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"References like that are just setting up stuff to come, most likely. Leland himself is an actual supervillain with powers in the comics. You never know where the show is going to go."

He says that superheroes are their greatest assets since they're the reason why the whole ""make money off the destroyed New York"" plan is working. In other episodes Foggy makes a few references to Captain America, and there is one small reference to Thor as well. You'll recognize that Ben Urich has written two big superhero articles, one about the events of the Incredible Hulk and also one about the events of the first Avengers film which Kingpin's plot (and this show) takes place after."

Defenders,35v47p,SeanTheOriginal1,66,Wed May 13 19:38:45 2015 UTC,...Is this serious? The entire second half of the season was put into motion because of her.
Defenders,35v47p,filthysize,117,Wed May 13 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"Just one example of why she, as a person and a character, is so important to the story (spoilers, obviously):  The scene at the end of episode 8 where Fisk is whining about how people like Matt want to destroy his vision. Vanessa thinks for a moment, and turns to Fisk and asks, ""and are you going to let them?"" This is the turning point that allows Fisk to step ""out of the shadows and into the light,"" which gives him the upper hand against Matt/Ben/Karen's plans.   That's just one example, because I think the most important takeaways from that scene are  1. Vanessa has a lot more going on beneath her composed exterior than we or Fisk initially perceive. She has values and ideals and goals that are clearly in line with Fisk's, and  2. She is ultimately instrumental in helping Wilson Fisk transform into The Kingpin. She inspires him and motivates him. She can see miles beyond the impulsive and childlike responses that Fisk is prone to. She is his Lady Macbeth."
Defenders,35v47p,theonewhogawks,2,Wed May 13 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, well said! I was impressed by the scene where after she's hospitalized, Fisk, in a fit of rage, promises that he'll make them pay. Then, abashed at the vehemence of his feelings, he looks to her and she says ""Make them suffer. Make them understand."" She gave her blessing to his dark side right there, and it's only after that moment that Fisk embraces it. Becoming the ill intent."
Defenders,35v47p,RightReverendJA,64,Sun May 31 10:31:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's worthless, she's the one who scares me the most. All the other villains either have a motive for doing what they're doing or think they're doing good. She could've left Fisk when she realized what he was but she just came back. She's the only one who is comfortable with evil for no real reason. It feels like she's pure evil."
Defenders,35v47p,slightlyaw_kward,15,Wed May 13 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"yes.   I'm rewatching DD now, and last night got up to their dates - the one interrupted by the headless Russian, and the one in the next episode that went a little better.   She tells Fisk a story about having a prince for a lover. She's an art dealer who talks about art as a commodity as much as a thing of beauty. It's subtle, but it is setting up a woman who is as ruthless as Fisk - she sees him not just as a big man in the shadows with a vision, but the next Mayor of NYC, and she plans to be next to him.   Vanessa's ambition, as much as Fisk's, is what characterises the escalation of Fisk's plans and his step into the light to be the Kingpin. Not just a man with a plan, but what the people of Melbourne have taken to calling a ""colourful construction identity"" (it's a relic of decades of organised crime on the waterfront docks and construction firms. People like Mick Gatto, a figure in Melbourne's crime world, is an industrial mediator if you go by his business card. It's why actual industry mediators don't like to be called industry mediators here - the term implies something more sinister than it should!!)"
Defenders,35v47p,AgentKnitter,25,Thu May 14 08:06:56 2015 UTC,"Well she is important in the comics, as his wife. As with most everything this season, that relationship was just being set up."
Defenders,35v47p,Astrocricket,13,Wed May 13 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"Spoilers and speculation ahead. Tread carefully, cuz I'm not. If you have read this far and still freak out over spoilers why are you even in here?   By the halfway point in the season, I sensed the writers were using her like Lady MacBeth in Shakespeare's famous Scottish play. She manipulates Fisk. Pulls his strings. In her own way of course she may love him, but I just think he's a means to an end. She's more attracted to the power he has amassed around him, and the Manchild she observes inside him is like her infinity gauntlet. Make the Manchild happy, and he will make sure she is happy. And secure. Push his buttons just right, and the world is hers.   Of course then she almost died, and he was almost powerless to stop it. I was expecting her to turn on him after that but it just brought them closer together. Which was way more creepy now that I think about it. If Kingpin returns in season two, the writers will probably establish that she's ""preparing"" the outside world for him by nurturing his power reserves worldwide, and is probably going to be instrumental in getting him out of jail.   If you still think Vanessa is a worthless character, you need to see The Scottish Play. This first season is just act one. We haven't really seen this particular Ice Queen in full regalia yet. Give the series time."
Defenders,35v47p,ZachsMind,1 point,Wed May 13 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she definitely had a Lady MacBeth vibe, except that here she shows up after MacBeth has already killed Duncan and becomes the king.  She just eggs him on and her acceptance of him allows him to embrace his inner evil (rather than deluding himself into the fact that he was a good guy).    I must admit, I didn't love the Kingpin's character arc and mannerisms.  The paralleling with Matt was a cool idea, but I don't think it worked as well as they thought it did.  Vanessa's Lady MacBeth schtick, well... Wilson was already pretty evil.  He starts out by lying to her (and maybe to himself) and by the end, he's not lying anymore, but he's basically acting in the same ruthless manner he was in episode 1."
Defenders,35v47p,wilyquixote,1 point,Thu May 14 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"well okay the comparison breaks down under close scrutiny. Most do. She's not exactly Lady MacBeth but that's NOT what the writers are going for. Considering the situation, they did alright. This isn't Shakespeare. It's comic books. Have you read comic books recently? Some of the writing is terrible. No Daredevil the Netflix Series wasn't perfect. It wasn't Shakespeare. But it's trying to be equal to or better than its source material, which was comic books. So I think it accomplished its goal.  You're setting the goal posts higher than they actually are."
Defenders,35v47p,ZachsMind,3,Thu May 14 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"I think she is the epitome of the ""behind every successful man blabla woman"" expression. she is the one who makes fisk get to grip with his own malevolence"
Defenders,35v47p,shinreialba,2,Sat May 16 14:08:33 2015 UTC,While i definitely don't think she is worthless for the same reasons said in the other comments.

Defenders,35v47p,CaptainFilibuster,2,Fri May 15 00:48:15 2015 UTC,She is definately not useless. Lady macbeth comparison aside she completes him. She is a piece of his soul and his development into Kingpin. Without her Fisk would just be a run of the mill villian with no depth and character.

Defenders,35plj4,commendatore,2,Tue May 12 19:44:46 2015 UTC,Silvercup. I can see the sign from my window. Fun fact: the Silvercup studio's sign is where they filmed the final fight in Highlander.

I hang out in this neighborhood quite a bit, so I was somewhat surprised the first time I watched this scene. However, the scenery itself is generic enough (with the construction area, the food truck and the mural) that it can easily represent some parts of Hell's Kitchen or other Manhattan neighborhoods."

Defenders,35plj4,AgentKnitter,3,Thu May 14 08:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Hell's Kitchen is a fine neighborhood these days. But don't think that suggests Williamsburg & Greenpoint are bastions of modern day crime. They likely chose them because it looks a little more ""run down"" (though that is just the aesthetic, it is still an expensive place to live) and because they could get the NYC skyline in the background so it actually looks like NYC to people who aren't as familiar with it.  Note in real Hell's Kitchen you cannot see the classic skyline and if you were on a pier you would be looking at Weehawken NJ."
Defenders,35q6cb,Death_Star_,7,Tue May 12 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'd call it an Easter egg. At most, he's an amalgamation of the two Healy brothers, as he attacked the guy in a bowling alley (which connects him to Tenpin), but killed him with a bowling ball (the other Healy brother is known as Oddball and uses special balls as weapons), and said things like ""I'm just looking to throw a few balls."" I have no doubt that it was intentional, though. This show was loaded with little Easter eggs like that."

Defenders,35fb9e,pleasedontabbabme,1 point,Sun May 10 09:13:31 2015 UTC,I'd rather it's not Olivia Wilde. She does nothing for me. Doesn't really read Greek to me. Neither did Jennifer Gardner which is something that bugged me about the old movie.  Find a stunt actress that can pass as Greek and have at it. She doesn't need to be a known figure given that the fans will watch at least once cause it's comic book. If she's got chemistry with Charlie to make that believable and she can kick ass they will love it. And yes it's better that she can do her own fights and stunts at least to a degree cause she's not known for wearing a face mask so covering up the switches would be harder.
