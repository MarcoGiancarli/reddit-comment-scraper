mathrock,3e1ibx,imjoey8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:02 2015 UTC,I love Mockroot but this isn't really that math rock. More just folky jazz or modern jazz. It's funny because they have jazz breakdowns like prog metal and even beatboxing and stuff.  Thx for sharin' anyways

There are some legit runs in there on occasion that are really aiding a counterpoint here. Root notes? Come now hes clearly better than that. A lot of times it just sounds like bass and drums are following the rhythmic play of the guitar. There are moments...but im having a hard time...
mathrock,3drqws,plentyofswords,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:31 2015 UTC,I wasn't really huge on this. I love hydra but the riffs in this aren't really that great and the songwriting leaves a lot to be desired.

Even though Covet is playing with CHON and Polyphia, the flier still says ""Yvette Young"". It's kind of annoying seeing that, as it will forever be known as her band. I really enjoy this band and the rest of the members need credit where it is due."
mathrock,3drqws,major_noodle,2,Sun Jul 19 09:01:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like it may be too early to tell.  Unless I'm missing something (please tell me if so), they haven't even released a single yet, let alone an EP or album.  Yvette Young has built up some sort of following, so of course they're still known as ""her"" band, because people haven't really been able to judge the band on they're own merits yet."

mathrock,3dnk1q,treefuxxer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:32 2015 UTC,I'm really into this band at the moment. Their album is just full of euphoric math rock. Probably one of my top 3 math rock bands and I don't say that lightly!  It's good to finally see some decent footage of them playing - all the other stuff I've seen has just been filmed at the front of a show on someone's camera phone.   Would love to see them live but they don't seem likely to come to the UK.  As for the session itself- it's pretty good but it seems to suffer from the same thing as a lot of live math rock- the fret tapping is just too quiet!

mathrock,3dbhlm,octosoup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:30:36 2015 UTC,A Math Rock Band with vocals that isn't TTNG or Invalids?  YES PLEASE
mathrock,3d7ru2,deeee123,14,Tue Jul 14 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"I think that vocal styles and lyrics play a big role in driving genres forward, but I listen to mostly instrumental mathrock so this is an interesting thought for me.   Their popularity isn't too big, but I'm a big fan of Sphaeras.  I haven't found much that is quite like them while I have found other bands with very similar sounds.    IMO TTNG is/was killing it and may have the popularity to really push things forward."
mathrock,3d7ru2,Ledgeron,14,Tue Jul 14 05:55:23 2015 UTC,I think Delta Sleep are pretty special. They bring all the elements of math rock together and get a nice balance between the beautiful stuff and the balls out drums and riffs. Was hoping their album would get some main stream recognition but I haven't seen much yet. No idea why. What's not to love?  The 100 Onces album has really grown on me over the last few months as well. They do the basics really well. Just non-stop incredible drumming and big riffs. They seem to have picked up Hella's sound and made it a bit more accessible.
mathrock,3d7ru2,ox_,11,Tue Jul 14 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"I think Uchu Conbini was a real game changer when they started making waves last year. For me, it was a very refreshing take on the genre which I've always been a fan of.  So sad they had to break up."
mathrock,3d7ru2,ClarenceGarcia,2,Tue Jul 14 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"yup, uchu conbini and tricot seems to be really different from other math rock bands. And they also popularize the name of ""math rock"" to people out of the math rock scene too."
mathrock,3d7ru2,kenny01123,2,Tue Jul 14 11:10:04 2015 UTC,I totally agree. They make music that easily accessible while still playing in playful/odd meters etc. Those bands push the boundary of mathrock for me.

mathrock,3d7ru2,one-piecesuit,4,Tue Jul 14 07:04:02 2015 UTC,"Naw man; they were 'game changers' like ten years ago. ..they've kind of regressed as far as mathrock goes these days..  Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on Tera Melos by any means!  I believe they're doing and expressing exactly what they want and they are still one of my top ten favorite groups but I can say with confidence that they aren't as ground breaking as they use to be, within the confines of mathrock at least."
mathrock,3d7ru2,WhiskyTech,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:08:05 2015 UTC,What was groundbreaking about what they were doing a decade ago though? I've seen tons of no-name mathy bands with that same sort of style. It was totally a thing in the mid-00s at small time shows. They were just probably the best at it. What they're doing now and started on with Patagonian Rats is a lot more unique.
mathrock,3d7ru2,InSovietChicago,4,Wed Jul 15 02:51:16 2015 UTC,Clearly
mathrock,3d7ru2,ArchdukeThe,2,Tue Jul 14 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"I second this. Those guys are not only great musicians, they write really interesting songs whose melodies get stuck in my head. Their song ""No Phase"" from X'ed Out isn't a crazy polyrhythmic freakfest, but a great, slow song. But they have plenty of freakfests."

mathrock,3d7ru2,Moniitor,3,Tue Jul 14 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"yeah i could never get into keytalk, although i liked their disco elements and can appreciate them.  the guitarist had a song out that was the theme for an anime, i forget what it was like tho.  the drummer was briefly in a band called peelingwards, with the lead guiarist and bassist of Cinema staff, but he left. Although peelingwards are awesome, just kinda hardcore punk but still got as distinct sound i'd say."
mathrock,3d7ru2,ClarenceGarcia,2,Tue Jul 14 20:36:28 2015 UTC,"Man, I was super sad when this band broke up. They're really one of the best math/emo bands I've ever heard. So much power coming from a trio. Gotta love Japan and Zankyo Record releases."
mathrock,3d7ru2,plentyofswords,3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"I dont really see a lot of the larger more popular bands really pushing the envelope on math. In fact i think more than anything they are becoming much more streamlined and playing it safe to appeal to larger audiences. I dont necessarily view this as a negative but not in the realm of making the genre see some new colors. Sure the japanese tend to push the technicality portion... But much of it to come off as ""doing it for its own sake"" rather than conveying an emotion. Exception made with the now defunct the Cabs...incredible group. Guys ive been impressed with lately are the recently dead Toasted Plastic out of jersey. Got a chance to catch Shipley Hollow (Canada) and find them to be really pushing the vocals as an up front presence, lots of harmonies. Theres a few more but thats all ive got for now"

mathrock,3d7ru2,bhakan,3,Wed Jul 15 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"These are all great suggestions.  I've been doing some thinking and whether or not you consider him a band or not, Henry Kohen from Mylets is pushing the genre in terms of approach.  I am starting to see a lot more one-man math rock bands trying to do what he has done. He is also writing some killer songs."
mathrock,3d7ru2,WhiskyTech,7,Wed Jul 15 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"I think Chon is.  They don't necessarily consider themselves math rock, and some people may not consider them math, but they are definitely doing something unique that at least has a lot of elements of math rock.  I don't know of any bands before them that really sound the way they do, and they are getting a lot of recognition and on tours with a wide range of bigger bands."
mathrock,3d7ru2,bhakan,2,Tue Jul 14 19:31:30 2015 UTC,There's definitely some math influence in Chon's music. I would consider them as game-changers.
mathrock,3d7ru2,WhiskyTech,2,Wed Jul 15 01:02:15 2015 UTC,What have they done that hasn't been done by progressive rock bands decades ago? I think they're fun and have a good energy but really it's just a re-trend of prog rock that isn't boring as shit like 99% of other attempts. I don't really hear much math-rock in their sound.
mathrock,3d7ru2,WhiskyTech,3,Wed Jul 15 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say there's a lot of prog rock in their sound, and that's why I mentioned them.  IMO, they're kinda the halfway point between prog and math.  The post asked for bands who were doing something different or bringing math rock to new levels of attention.  I feel like the twinkly tappy math rock bands (as much as I love them) aren't necessarily changing the game, and chon are doing something different and have been getting a lot of attention outside of math rock circles.  I don't agree that chon sounds just like old school prog rock, as I don't really know any bands that really have their style, I'd love to be proven wrong though."
mathrock,3d7ru2,Danny98m,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"and chon are doing something different and have been getting a lot of attention outside of math rock circles.

I should have just ignored this whole Ellen Pao thing too right? Ignoring things that are publicly posted multiple times is so easy!  What you're missing is that if we had half decent moderators they'd notice the trends, make a sticky, then everyone could circlejerk each other there. I saw Toe on this tour as well and you don't see me making a thread about it. I actually have the self-control to only make threads that would be considered a positive contribution to the sub."
mathrock,3d68u5,WhiskyTech,2,Wed Jul 15 02:38:56 2015 UTC,The Ellen pao thing had serious ramifications for reddit. This just means you have to skip a few extra posts. Not even comparable.   I agree with you about the mods making a sticky about it. But if you care so much then take it up with them.  Rather than be so negative about it.  And you talk about positive contributions like yours is the only opinion that matters. The post got up voted a bit while you've been down voted.

mathrock,3clto6,filementary,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:25:20 2015 UTC,I've been super into this band recently. This recording was a little strange I thought.
mathrock,3cklgo,ThinkRom,2,Wed Jul 8 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"gonna be contrarian here and say it's really not all about the compression pedals. they're useful in the studio to smooth out your tone but live it can be hard to tell a difference unless you're squashing the fuck out of your signal.  if you want 'clean with a subtle amount of gain' then you probably want an all-tube clean channel (for example, most fender amps, and AC30s) and you want to set the gain so it's just starting to break up.  the tone from the guitarist you linked to sounds like humbuckers through a super clean fender amp (not actually a 'subtle gain' its pretty much just clean) with most of the bass and mids rolled off. definitely doesn't strike me as particularly compressed."
mathrock,3cklgo,daren_james,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going to split the difference here and say that a compressor will help with the consistency and smoothness of the tap sound by leveling dynamics, but /u/daren_james is absolutely right. High-headroom clean tube amp and a clean, bright toned guitar (single coil vs humbucker is a debate that could go on for years) is what will be the basis of the tone itself.  Sometimes the subtleties will be too quiet to come across uncompressed, so a little bit of squish will bring some of the fun stuff to the front of the mix."
mathrock,3cklgo,denkyuu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"a lot of bands that use tapping like Uchu Conbini probably use compression pedals, it makes the sound a lot juicier like you're describing"
mathrock,3cklgo,jamesismynamo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of all three. A compressor pedal is definitely a lot of it. Look into Keeley compressors. It's what I use live and I love my tone. I also use a tele and switch between the middle pickup and the bridge pickup. My amp is a Mesa Dual Rectifier ran through a 15"" Peavey Black Widow. The amp just needs to have a lot of clean headroom which old Fender Twins or Vox AC30s have. Hope this helps!"

Tigran Hamasyan, obviously Snarky Puppy - modern big band/ensemble that is jawdroppingly amazing  Strobes - really cool mathrobeat that has an album coming soon :D Jaga Jazzist - one of my favourite bands ever. great prog-jazz ensemble Zu - wicked jazzcore band. their earlier stuff is as experimental as music can get Acoustic Ladyland - best punk jazz band ever! seriously!

mathrock,3bzt5h,AceFaith,3,Fri Jul 3 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"Hello friends!  Putting this up here as the channel was recently granted YouTube Partnership after many weeks of waiting. This means a few changes, but one we'll directly address is that we will not be monetizing any videos that we don't already own the rights to. Most videos should be ad-free and will stay that way.  At the speaking moment, the channel has 60 videos and over 2000 subscribers, which is great! Having said that, the Partnership grants us scheduled uploading, which is the Holy Grail for us since it's been tedious to constantly export videos with the backlog that we currently have. The direction we would want to go would be to have a couple weekly uploads to keep some momentum and make the channel less sporadic. Since this recently fell into our laps, we're just not quite sure what to make of it. Any tips on what we should do from here on out?"

Because in my opinion, titles should state facts, not opinions and not irrelevant questions posed in the form of overly enthusiastic statements.   Origami JP - Näytös (teen instrumental math rock band from Tokyo)   is a good title. That makes me interested and curious.   Origami JP - Näytös (teen instrumental math rock band from Tokyo!

Their stuff is a bit more on the post rock side of math rock (lots of delay, reverb and ambient sounds).  El Ten Eleven also does the looping thing, with one guitarist who plays a double neck guitar-bass.  I think the Fall of Troy, especially their first two albums, are a good example, though they do use overdubs on some songs."

mathrock,3beq99,mrblahblahblacksheep,3,Mon Jun 29 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"It might be difficult.  One of the most ubiquitous qualities of math rock is angular guitar riffs, which are basically the opposite of what most blues riffing is.  It would be cool to hear it though.  You might be better off looking at prog rock.  Obviously different genres, but you'll still hear plenty of odd rhythms in prog and there's definitely a little more blues influence."
mathrock,3beq99,bhakan,3,Sun Jun 28 18:44:34 2015 UTC,Strawberry girls. Thanks I really like that one. I also liked Jizue. Thanks anymore suggestions?
mathrock,3beq99,KBKarma,2,Sun Jun 28 23:32:10 2015 UTC,"Clever Girl, to start. I'll post more later.   Edit: no I won't, because I was substituting blues for jazz, and do have several jazz-styled music and no blues-styled that I can recall."
mathrock,3beq99,gr3yh47,3,Sun Jun 28 17:33:42 2015 UTC,Can you list some more jazz style math rock bands though
mathrock,3beq99,KBKarma,3,Sun Jun 28 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"Well, jizue is one. Another is toe. There's Lite, but not everything they do is jazz-styled, same as toe and jizue, and Lite verge into math rock territory at times as well.   After that, we start getting into ""bits and pieces"" territory. As in, bits and pieces of piglet and Alarmist and Enemies and Rumourcubes and Human Pyramids are certainly jazz-inspired, though piglet is not quite post-rock, and Alarmist and Enemies walk the line as well. Emancipator do some good stuff, but maybe one or two tracks are jazzy, and possibly none of their tracks are post-rock.   Honestly, if you want jazz, it's unlikely that you'll find many post-rock and jazz groups. The ones I've listed are straddling the border. But, for some good jazz, math rock is your friend (and, in the case of PROTODOME at least, chiptunes). Post-rock is, generally, epic and impressive, like a soundtrack (I eagerly await people to prove me wrong, because I would like more post-rock to listen to), while jazz and math rock are down, dirty, and generally up to no good. Post-rock is about soundscapes, about the whole, while math rock and jazz (in my limited experience) is about making done good music, and the hell with most of the rest.  Edit: Well, shee-it, I misread your comment (edit edit: and thought this was /r/postrock, how awkward). I'll keep that there because I like it. Jazzy math rock: Alarmist, piglet, Enemies if you can catch them at the right time, Lite, toe, Do Make Say Think (oh, hey, an occasionally jazzy post-rock group, what a hypocrite I am), Four Tet if you squint really damned hard, tricot, Pia-no-jaC if you squint a bit harder, Suffer Like G Did, and world's end girlfriend if you screw up your eyes something fierce."

mathrock,3beq99,NC_310,2,Sun Jun 28 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe check out Pearls & Brass, they're most definitely a blues band but the riffs are just a bit more angular and mathy than most blues bands.  https://youtu.be/qtFwZlS0YTk  Swinging pretty far into heavy noisecore territory, Coalesce put a lot of blues into the album 0:12 second revolution from 1999  https://youtu.be/bGjDeq4zZbA  Beyond that idk, this is a pretty unusual niche.

About the name, after weeks of debate and being at a loss as to what to name our band(I am horrible at naming things), we decided to pay homage to our love of The Legend of Zelda and name our band after my favorite boss. Also, we thought it was a sweet double meaning with Blind being a verb, but in this context it is the name of a character."

There's something about this band that draws me to their work. I know the riffs can be all over the place, but the landscape of each song is just amazing... anybody agree?"
mathrock,3b9xv1,buenopower,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"yeah the impressive thing about them is that they're super technical and difficult to follow but at the same time you can just sit back and take it all in as an atmosphere, it doesn't force you to listen to it in a certain way"

mathrock,3b8m12,toeboy,2,Sat Jun 27 04:35:56 2015 UTC,That sucks. I liked the first album but I wasn't a huge fan of the hip-hop EP he did. I wonder if he's keeping to that style.
mathrock,3b8m12,daren_james,2,Sat Jun 27 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"i was told last december by a person who i was on tour with who had previously/recently toured with so much light that speed of sound is not actively a band right now, hence why he is focusing on so much light. i believe i remember him saying that it was because of college/life/obligations making it difficult for them to practice/write together."

mathrock,3b8m12,daren_james,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:44:28 2015 UTC,He still occasionally posts videos of TSOSISW on his facebook and tumblr so it gives the impression that he is still interested in perusing that project at some point and that he doesn't want it to be forgotten. I hope they do something new again soon. Damien is such a talented musician.
mathrock,3b8m12,RunForWord,2,Mon Jun 29 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"yes the impression i got was they are not broken up, just inactive due to impracticality"
mathrock,3b7um8,mammalsasmonarchs,5,Fri Jun 26 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"This is a good song. Very well written and some great guitar playing. The problems I have are all with the production. When you come in with the chords at around :50 and repeats of that the guitar tone is really thin and dry. I would change the tone for that rhythm guitar part and maybe add some reverb or something to thicken it up. Also, while the drums sound pretty good for the most part the kick just isn't cutting through the mix. Giving that a little more power will help the whole sound and definitely give some more oomph to those parts I mentioned earlier.  I'm probably be into laying down some vox. PM me if you are interested."

mathrock,3b70nv,samuelc26,5,Fri Jun 26 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"So first let me preface this with that I don't want to start a ""this isn't math rock and doesn't belong here"" debate.  That's not at all what I'm getting at.  I've heard these guys referred to as math rock before, and I definitely dig the stuff I've heard by them, but it struck me as pretty straight forward 4/4.  Obviously nothing wrong with that, I like them either way, but I'm wondering is there some hidden mathy gem from them that I'm missing?"
mathrock,3b70nv,bhakan,2,Fri Jun 26 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"They have some neat tapping parts. I love these guys. Check out their guitarist Matt Fazzi's other band Happy Body Slow Brain, its like floating in a sea of Fender Rhodes, distortion, and drippy verb."
mathrock,3b70nv,future_steak,2,Fri Jun 26 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"Some of their songs are mathy, but I'd say most aren't. Here's a few that I'd consider mathy: 1 2 3 4"
mathrock,3b70nv,swagbuckaroo,4,Sat Jun 27 06:04:20 2015 UTC,"Went to their concert in Brooklyn a week ago where they did a play through of the album ""where is my prefrontal cortex"" it was magical."
mathrock,3b779d,Manzi-Yenko,7,Fri Jun 26 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan as long as Nick is involved, but I gotta say no album released so far has been as good as the Untitled record with the numbered melodies. Melody 4 is my favorite Tera song of all time."

mathrock,3b779d,jasahhn,4,Fri Jun 26 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"Drugs to the Dear Youth will probably always be my favorite Tera Melos release but I really like X'ed Out (a whole lot more than I liked Patagonian Rats) and I look forward to what they'll do next. They're a band that keeps you on your feet and I appreciate that about them, with so many bands just sticking to the same sort of sound."
mathrock,3b779d,jamesismynamo,2,Fri Jun 26 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"I understand why they did it. Writing the kind of stuff pre Patagonian rats is extremely difficult, especially when you are doing it collaboratively and sometimes across state lines. But I wish Nick would have found a way to keep going with it because now Tera Melos just sounds like a watered down, boring version of it's former self."

mathrock,3b779d,Soupstorm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"Patagonian Rats was their high point for me. I like their earlier work too, but I'm just not as into songs/albums that are a torrent of improvisation and solos. X'ed Out was decent but not great. I hope they do something more exciting for their next album."
mathrock,3b779d,squoose23,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i love th new stuff more. I like experimental weirdness, too, but the melodic new material is golden. the vocals help a lot and the music behind it is still crazy. i think musically they figured out how to keep an audience more interested, the old stuff was even more of an acquired taste."

mathrock,3aurj5,rx-bandit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:22:21 2015 UTC,These guys have recently become my favourite things. Both albums are incredible. They really pushed the boundaries of metal (especially the first album).   I'm so psyched for their new ep. It's only 4 tracks but from the updates it seems they're really happy and think they've thought outside the box.

mathrock,3at6os,IcarusAscended,2,Tue Jun 23 09:35:18 2015 UTC,Why have I never heard of this band before? They are amazing. Guitar work is similar to Six Gallery and vocals are great. One of the best math rock bands I've heard in awhile.

mathrock,3am149,xxthanatos,5,Sun Jun 21 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"Think it's run by a fairly small team local to Bristol. Would be really surprised if they did a US version. Even if they did, it'd probably just be a franchise.   For what it's worth, it's an amazing festival. Not just the line up- everything is done the right way from the beers to the location.   My mate is getting married on the 20th next year so I'm really hoping they move it back a week."
mathrock,3am149,ox_,5,Sun Jun 21 17:47:11 2015 UTC,I can't make this year's festival and am more than gutted. Last year was so incredible.  You're right about everything being just right. One of my favourite things was the singular security guard standing between the fields throwing jokes at the many people rolling around on mdma.   And the silent disco was actually really good too (silent discos usually suck balls).
mathrock,3am149,rx-bandit,3,Sun Jun 21 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've got to miss this year too. Bad timing all round really since i think it's the best line-up yet. I thought the silent disco was great as well. It's weird being at a silent disco that plays math rock and everyone knows the words!"
mathrock,3am149,ox_,3,Sun Jun 21 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm gutted about missing fall of troy and dillinger. And I hate missing the opportunity to see lite. Those guys are incredible.   Haha yeah, the music was amazing in the silent disco. Although in my, very off my face, state the dedicated Mars voltage channel was a bit too intense."
mathrock,3am149,rx-bandit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:19:28 2015 UTC,Math Rock and MDMA? :0  That actually sounds incredible though LSD would probably be something else with the music.

It's that i see the term math rock as an umbrella word now that almost everything is math rock... i just want a concrete definition.  I always thought math rock was constant odd time signature switch ups... but, i dunno, there's so many sub genres it doesn't really matter anymore."

mathrock,39m5kl,hohodood,3,Sat Jun 13 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"Not totally sure on the definition of finger style, but I like to do two handed tapping for some math-y riffs. I bummed the technique from Absinthe Party by Minus the Bear, great song to sharpen up your tapping chops if they're not up to par.   One cool way to utilize that is to hold a chord shape (I usually do A major) and tap higher up notes in that scale, so when you pull off the chord tones ring out. Then you can change the chord shape (maybe B minor or D major) and keep hitting the same high notes, it's a cool sound. I've made a few riffs this way, I can provide a link to a rough demo if that would be helpful or make a video tomorrow when I'm at home. Good luck!"

If you are skilled in a classical guitar style of playing, picking up some easier TTNG songs shouldn't be a problem. Try I'll Forgive you for throwing that rock, or Panda. Those were the easiest for me to learn. After that, try Chinchilla or And I'll tell you for why. Little Tybees guitarist also has some really cool videos displaying some really rad tapping techniques which are fun to try. I've been using both styles in my playing for awhile now so feel free to ask questions and I'll try and answer them.

They were typically spot on, well rehearsed with little room to deviate from the recordings, as the parts were all so painstakingly choreographed. On two occasions, I witnessed the music completely come apart and go to shit, but can you blame them?  It was fun to see them go from poorly attended church basements to having a line down the street at the Beat Kitchen before doors opened. At that particular show, some no name band from columbia college called Maps and Atlases opened for them.  They played one show at the Fireside Bowl on Fullerton, where they opened up for Volta Do Mar. It was VDM's last show (or maybe last tour?) and they apparently played incredibly well and then smashed a bunch of shit. I remember the photos, but sadly not the show. I was a junior in highschool, grounded for smoking pot. I had the opportunity to sneak out and go to that show, and to this day, not doing so is one of my bigger regrets in life."

Haha, I've wondered about this when it comes to math rock/post rock. Toe, for example, makes really wonderful songs, but I've never seen any clips of them truly improvising. When I see Instagrams or whatever of Yama picking up a guitar, he just seems OK. He sort of just durdles. In general, it seems like people inclined to write this sort of music care about just that, writing, more than the high level of musicianship required for improv. Anyone have any counter examples?"

mathrock,39ar75,lhoffl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"They're not math rock but rx-bandits play some rather intricate music and do a lot of improvising live. They've recorded most of their albums, since the resignation, mostly live and you can hear it in how he albums sound so loose and flowing, yet tight. Live they have a number if songs (like ""overcome"" and ""only for the night"") where they go into ten minute long jam sessions then dive into the final part/ outro of the song.  They also do a lot of jamming between songs that leads into the next song.    As for mathrock bands I don't know. The music is often so intricate and hard to play that improve would require insane musicianship to sound good. I'd agree that a big part of the genre us based around the writing and it seems most bands don't tend to put very much into the live improve aspect."

mathrock,38z4zb,WhiskyTech,2,Mon Jun 8 03:08:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. I just wasn't sure how to word it and keep it within my 300 characters
mathrock,38z4zb,WhiskyTech,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:34:46 2015 UTC,There's no need for such a long title in the first place. It's not like Death Grips is some tiny indie band that no one has heard of.
mathrock,38z4zb,mellamosatan,13,Mon Jun 8 03:40:41 2015 UTC,I was just making the connection for people who didn't know how this song was math rock
mathrock,38z4zb,anonymous_rhombus,4,Mon Jun 8 03:59:56 2015 UTC,i play drums a lot in the DIY scene in a mathrock band. always breaks my heart when someone excitedly asks if i like death grips (zach hill connection) and i have to explain i don't like them at all despite being a mathrock nut.   i just hate the nonvocals/nonlyrics and how zach's percussion is more or less nonexistent on the recorded stuff. i'm sure i'd love that shit live when he is shredding out of his mind
mathrock,38z4zb,mellamosatan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"Kind of the same problem for me but I find myself really enjoying the instrumental Death Grips albums that they released. Zach really is doing some cool stuff, just nowhere near as cool as the stuff we're used to."

mathrock,38ttvp,vaultfull,6,Sat Jun 6 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen this pop up a lot in this subreddit.  There is plenty of ""That's not really math rock"" floating around.  Thankfully it seems to be more welcomed than shunned when a band comes with other influences that seems to ""dilute"" (pun not intended, but very welcomed) the mathy-ness of the rock in question.  I suggest you check out the book ""This Is Your Brain On Music"" by Daniel Levitin.  There is some really good insight and research on how our brains understand, perceive, categorize, and view the expertise behind music in there.    Chapter 5 hits on the topic of how our brains categorize things including music.  There is an idea about prototypes of things.  We tend to make prototypes of music based on what we come across first.  That prototype influences everything we come across going forward.    There is also the idea of categorization of music.  Things can easily be placed into different categories based on the parts of the music.  The author points out that it's difficult to put things into specific categories like all of The Beatle's music being ""truly Beatles music"" when you look at songs like ""Number 9"".  Along those lines, it's difficult to say some new song you've heard is ""purely mathrock"" or ""truly djent"" when a lot of the music that comes across this subreddit tends to have a lot of influences from other types of music.  It's just part of the prog of prog rock and the experimental side of the music we listen to.  Anyway, it's a super good read and sheds a revealing light on other things like talent as well."

mathrock,38n825,WhiskyTech,2,Sat Jun 6 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"Jazz, particularly bop, is primarily triplet based, whereas is this is straight. Not to mention style of the drumming is rock.   Edit: I do think that this is better classified as jazz rock or fusion than mathrock though."

But this stuff might need its own sub or something. It's the Kenny G of ""mathrock."" (I keep using quotes because this doesn't sound at all to me like mathrock - it's just chromatic phrases bundled together.)  Just like fusion has a place in jazz (albeit tenuous and questionable sometimes), this is to mathrock."

mathrock,38g0wl,CancerBear3000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:15:53 2015 UTC,Honestly I find her to be a more dynamic piano player than a guitar player. There's some amazing clips of compositions on piano on her Facebook page.
mathrock,38g0wl,Enigma_Toaster,3,Thu Jun 4 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"i feel like she's been playing this same one tune for a few months. i know i'm the minority here, but i'm not intensely impressed by yvette young's style altogether. tapping is all well and good, but half of this song sounds the. exact. same.  only once you get to like, 2:50 does the song start feeling actually dynamic, like something's going to change. even then, not feeling it so much.  i can't help but feel like, also, if a guy with similar chops recorded videos of himself doing this, that he'd not have nearly as many views as yvette does. that's a bummer, but make sense."
mathrock,38g0wl,birdvsworm,0,Thu Jun 4 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"I mean clearly she gets a lot of hype for being a girl but I think she's still pretty damn good at what she does and deserves the recognition she's getting.   As for the song, I dig it a good amount. In all honesty, I find this style played in open tunings a bit boring but I feel that she's definitely one of the better people appealing to that style."
mathrock,38g0wl,hohodood,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's neat, but I do wish she did more of her acoustic stuff. Acoustics EP was absolutely fantastic, but this seems complex for the sake of being complex. Tapping can get out of hand fast and 8films by Uchu Conbini is one of the few tracks I've found where less would not have been more."
mathrock,38g0wl,xelested,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:21:44 2015 UTC,This was pretty good but I've got to admit I enjoyed the playthrough she posted a while back (guitar only).

mathrock,38778b,WhiskyTech,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Math pop is like a sub-sub-genre under math rock.  It's just the term given to bands like TTNG with the clean, twinkly guitars and soft vocals to differentiate it from from the more post-hardcore, spazzy sounding math rock like Hella for example.    Basically, I think a large portion of the stuff posted here would qualify as math pop."

Almost every song has a video on youtube, his channel is awesome!  Edit Somewhere To Run To Not math rock persay but he does this harmonic galloping thing that is really cool.

Look forward to listening through this album a few times.   They have slightly mathy themes, combined with some jazzy riffs and chords and pop-like melodies decorating most of the songs.  Really, one of the better bands I've stumbled across recently."

Some of it is older than the name math rock and might not for fit the term entirely, but these helped lay the fundamentals for the genre.

mathrock,37xhip,I_am_Skittles,1 point,Sun May 31 12:51:38 2015 UTC,no they're not. Meshuggah is considered djent I believe and I think TesseracT would be considered that as well
mathrock,37xhip,WhiskyTech,2,Sun May 31 13:46:55 2015 UTC,MFW Meshuggah isn't math metal
mathrock,37xhip,I_am_Skittles,0,Sun May 31 19:17:07 2015 UTC,Math-metal isn't a term because metal with odd timings is prog-metal. It already exists in this genre and when you lose the post-hardcore aspects of math-rock it's really not comparable.
mathrock,37xhip,WhiskyTech,1 point,Sun May 31 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"It takes literally 2 seconds with Google to demonstrate that you're wrong.  Relevant sections from wiki:   The band is often labelled as math metal (for using elements of math rock) and progressive metal  Mathcore, also known as math metal"
mathrock,37xhip,I_am_Skittles,0,Sun May 31 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"When it comes to music genres Wikipedia is often very unreliable. I find stuff that I disagree with on basically every single genre page.  Instead of lazily throwing links at me why don't you disprove my argument with logic? Tell me why a term like math-metal even needs to exist? Also, please tell me how it relates to math-rock when there's no post-hardcore elements."
mathrock,37xhip,WhiskyTech,2,Sun May 31 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"I think the notion that math rock requires post-hardcore elements is complete bullshit. Bands like Clever Girl, Time Columns, or El Ten Eleven are obviously math rock, but have no more in common with post hardcore than Tesseract does. Beyond that, I think that the fanbase for bands like Tesseract and Meshuggah overlap with the fans of math rock. Regardless of whatever circle-jerky bullshit genre police like you spend way too much time and energy devising, it's makes sense in a recommendation thread to, oh i dunno, fucking recommend stuff that OP might like."
mathrock,37xhip,I_am_Skittles,-1,Mon Jun 1 01:44:42 2015 UTC,You seem very confused by the genre if you think El Ten Eleven is math-rock and not post-rock. Clever Girl you could argue is more of jazz off-shoot rather than a math-rock band. Same sort of territory as Mouse on the Keys. I think these are good examples of combining genres and thus are very bad examples of bands that would exemplify math-rock.  I don't think you're aware that math-rock derives from post-hardcore and you also seem completely unaware that prog metal exists and predates math-rock. Djent is also not math-rock. You seem to like to combine anything you like under wide umbrellas because your mind can't parse out the differences between styles. You can like a variety of music but that doesn't mean it's all the same type of music.  Also I don't see how one gets to Meshuggah from Native so the recommendation doesn't fit at all.
mathrock,37xhip,skulltree,0,Mon Jun 1 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"And you seem to really into extremely rigid boundaries for what defines a genre. I assume you're either a Hessian or extremely into black metal, because you certainly sound like that kind of gatekeeper."

mathrock,37teja,THHoughton,3,Sat May 30 13:32:30 2015 UTC,Personally I could never get into Meshuggah because I feel like it lacks in the upper register of sound. Just rhythmically interesting. Whereas AAL does some interesting things in both. All the insane guitar techniques aside they use a lot of interesting chord progressions.

It's frustrating when people only look into the technical aspect of music and disregard things such as its atmosphere and whether it's tonal or atonal music.

mathrock,37mg5s,jealousbones,1 point,Thu May 28 19:02:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I kind of feel the same way about Tangled Hair. I do like a few of their songs but for some reason Colour just stands out more.

Apples had that kind of jazzy feel to it though, a lot less poppy and catchy with the exception of Forty Winks. I like the new songs a lot more but definitely prefer Colour out of the two."

mathrock,37nhpl,oldheads,1 point,Thu May 28 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Hiya oldheads.  Instrumentation and composition for this is great man!  Songs are well written, the band is tight!  My main critique would be that the drum tones need to be a little bit more developed and the guitar could have a few changes in tone throughout to give it a bit more texture.  The piano reverse effect is awesome.  Great work guys."

The composition is fantastic, everything flows very naturally, very sophisticated texturing and harmony. The instrumentation is great too. I definitely hear the Haisuinonasa and even Toe influences in the Rhodes and acoustic guitars. I think Anchors is my favorite but it's an entirely solid LP. Great work! I look forward to your future endeavors. If you guys are ever in the Boston area, we should try to play a show together!"
mathrock,37mjj9,Reubek,9,Thu May 28 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion around here, but I really do not like Yvette Young's music and have a hard time seeing what it is about her music that is interesting to so many people.   Her songwriting lacks purpose in my opinion. Her progressions (or complete lack of) don't go anywhere and her songs end up sounding more like a montage of mathrock  / emo cliches than a single focused idea. The songs seem centered around what cool guitar parts she came up with instead of a natural, flowing idea (also her tapping is extremely sloppy).   It's very impressive that she can play her difficult guitar parts while singing, but her vocals are very bland. She sings similar melodies in most of her songs, and they very rarely sound inspired or unique.  It's just the same ascending / descending pattern over and over.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I just can't find anything intriguing in her music. Maybe someone who does like her music can explain what aspects of it they enjoy."
mathrock,37mjj9,13monsters,4,Thu May 28 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"I don't pay too much attention to this subreddit, so I'm not sure what the general opinion on Yvette is here.  That being said, I have plenty of personal friends who share your feelings, as well as a solid few who enjoy her music as much as or even more than I do.    IMO, her particular style (which reminds me a lot of Damien Verrett) isn't nearly as experimental as most artists in the genre.  This is mostly a result of the chord progressions, which you mentioned.  I haven't listened to many of Yvette's songs, but even in this particular one, she really only has a few small root movements that she keeps repeating.  Also, sometimes it feels like her primary goal in songwriting is to show off her skills as much as possible.  Her band Covet seems to improve on these issues somewhat, but I've heard similar complaints still and I think they're valid.    That being said, I have some points to counter with.  Yvette's tapping technique is sloppy at times, yes, but she still absolutely pulls it off.  It's worth keeping in mind that two-handed tapping can be an incredibly difficult style of play to master.  In this particular video, she's playing on acoustic too (and if I'm not mistaken, that's a steel string), and that undoubtedly makes things a lot more difficult.  With that consideration, there should probably be some room for error.  Even still, I don't think she needs very much of that room to begin with.  In terms of vocal quality, I don't have much in the way of constructive criticism or praise.  I'm rarely very picky about vocals, usually because there aren't as many experimental/math rock bands that have a heavy emphasis on vocals parts.  It is this particularly distinguishing feature of the genre that I think actually makes it easier for me to appreciate Yvette.  Her voice is, by my standards, very beautiful.  It's soft on the ears and communicates a lot of powerful emotions (I definitely know what you mean with the emo clichés thing though).  Her voice doesn't do a lot, but let's be honest, that's not really what you're supposed to be paying attention to, and what she does with her voice doesn't all detract from anything else.  It seems to me that her voice is an accompaniment for her guitar, rather than the other way around.  This should be taken into consideration when making any judgement.  Again, my opinions on her voice are purely subjective and are based pretty much entirely on how I feel when I'm listening to it, and I know that they don't necessarily make for a compelling argument.  Truth is, I'm not familiar with everything Yvette has done.  I haven't sat down and actually focused on listening to her Acoustics EP (it's usually on in the background when I'm occupied with something else), so I can't speak to the variety of her songwriting.  However, from what I have heard of her, I can confidently say that I'm at least curious enough to pay attention to music she writes in the future.  But we are all perfectly entitled to our own opinions, and you weren't a dick about voicing yours, and that's really cool of you.  I hope that people more familiar with her music can get in on this discussion and make up for my sort-of shitty arguments :)"
mathrock,37mjj9,13monsters,3,Thu May 28 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well thought out reply! After reading the few in here I think I can understand why people enjoy her music. It's relaxing without sacrificing technicality, and there isn't too much music around like that."
mathrock,37mjj9,HaveANiceDeath,3,Fri May 29 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"I can see how that's a viable perspective. Especially if your introduction to her music was everyone's hype and freak-out-posts instead of just stumbling upon it randomly. She don't pride herself in her singing and doesn't plan on including vocals in Covet. I kind of like the almost thoughtless laid back vibe of the vocals... they are just kind of there as an extra texture. If I remember correctly, she said she didn't write those acoustic songs for any reason other than catharsis and they ended up getting way more attention than expected/intended. And music made for self is always more appealing to me than music made for an audience. I'd rather have something personal than something perfected. As someone who tries playing guitar but isn't good, it's impressive and entertaining (for me) to see someone just go off and play complicated stuff on an extended range guitar. Even if it feels like she's just noodling around sometimes. She's still growing and learning and that's another cool thing to watch happen. You have good personal reasons thought out and that's cool because it doesn't come across as hating. Good comment. Cheers.  Edited to add some thought. Edit again: looks like she mentions some of this stuff in the video, haha. oh well."

I should also mention that this is my favorite style along with math rock and Fingerstyle guitarists are in another world as far as skill and technicality goes.

mathrock,36tokg,Ghosts_and_Vodka,4,Fri May 22 07:41:46 2015 UTC,What you most likely mean is that you fingerpick. Fingerstyle is a whole genre of its own based on the classical approach to the guitar.
mathrock,36tokg,jsullivan1331,1 point,Fri May 22 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I would argue that while this song doesn't employ any strange time signatures, the complexity and style of the playing is reminiscent enough of math rock to belong here. Also, This Town Needs Guns has a lot of fingerstyle playing!   Either way, this song is gorgeous. It's amazing to me how every note he plays sounds so crisp and sustained."
mathrock,36tokg,AnjohnsPez,0,Fri May 22 11:40:02 2015 UTC,TTNG using fingerstyle guitar doesn't really mean anything though. Any person who plays guitar without a pick is playing fingerstyle guitar.
mathrock,36tokg,toeboy,2,Fri May 22 13:23:30 2015 UTC,incorrect. THIS is fingerstyle - just using your fingers is called 'fingerpicking'  there is a fine difference between the two .

mathrock,36d8vr,kehrx,3,Mon May 18 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"Don't waste money buying anything fancy when you start off, you might be shit and hate it. Any of those guitars/amps will get you a decent sound to start with - I'd go for the Mustang or maybe an Orange Crush amp if you're after more a clean sound."
mathrock,36d8vr,at-idiot,2,Mon May 18 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"For me, the biggest concern (when making math rock specifically) is maintaining a balance of a solid tone with the ability to vocalize my parts correctly. For example, should I use the bridge pup or the neck pup? Both are going to alter your tone and it's a matter of trial and error in determining what you like. Personally, I find humbuckers to be better for math rock than single coils, so for you I'd maybe recommend the Epi Les Paul Special. If you can go a little bit more expensive, Fender Telecaster '72 customs are really great at creating math rock (or really any telecaster for that matter). Lastly, not that it's super important, is your choice of neck wood. Maple is, imo, the way to go. Much brighter and (for whatever reason) more fun to look at.  Amps are a bit less important for just starting out, but I'd advise you to stay away from Line 6. Fender makes really, really great amps and I'm sure you can find one within your price range (just make sure to google reviews and listen to demos AND try it out... if you can). Building an arsenal of stompboxes is something to consider also. With guitar pedals, you'll have the freedom to sculpt your tone exactly how you want it. You'll also become familiar with math rockers' gear, and in turn you can draw inspiration from it. Nick Rhineheart of Tera Melos is a perfect example of this.  If you have a basic understanding of theory, then you're already one step ahead of the game. Once you have the gear you need, it's just a matter of practicing, practicing, and more practicing. Use a metronome and learn your scales and arpeggios, and don't forget to become comfortable with meters that aren't just 4/4!  Feel free to PM me with any more questions! I'm happy to help!"

mathrock,36d8vr,trpdrpr,2,Tue May 19 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"I support this person's gear suggestions. If you get a line 6 and eventually want to join a band you are going to need to get another amp or else you will sound like absolute garbage. Also, might be a no-brainer, learn what all the knobs do on your guitars and your amps. A solid command of your eq can go a loooooooooong long way."

No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, listening to the album as just one long song, or streaming a video. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp."

I found learning various voicings for chords helped. Also getting comfortable with extended chords such as 7ths and 9ths and being able to arpeggiate those whenever you need to is helpful. Tapping is big. Playing with a really nasty drummer who can take you through various time changes and rhythmic motifs can be really eye opening. Think like a drummer, or a pianist--be a percussionist."

mathrock,35anxi,WhiskyTech,2,Sat May 9 08:03:14 2015 UTC,heavily blues influenced for the first part of the first song. gets mathy influenced at best in the 2nd half but it mostly just sounds like you're jamming out without much structure. the second song i can see a post-rock influence but it's really not very textured so influence is as far as it gets.  IMO you just need to keep writing and writing more and invest in some effects pedals (or learn better how to utilize) to mix up the sound more.  lost interest at that point.

Or I've heard ""Tech metal"" also. They also were the original ""djent"" band. Also semantically, I would argue that Meshuggah fits into the description of mathrock on the sidebar, which should be the conclusive definition of what ""math rock"" is to this subreddit.    I think the better question is, ""if you tell people who like x genre about y band, do you think the people would like it?"". The genre label is only really significant for this purpose -- to help people identify broadly if they might like something.    Typically this subreddit prefers math rock that is actually a subgenre of pop with an exceedingly heavy focus on twinkly guitar."

mathrock,34t5yi,WhiskyTech,0,Tue May 5 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"If you are going to pull some ideological ""this is and this isn't math rock"" bullshit, then I really don't care to listen.  Odd time signatures and the use of multiple time signatures are not something that is only found in math rock.  Love Is Stronger Then Justice a sting tune that I would categorize as adult contemporary, country/pop is mostly in 7/4 but also switches to 4/4.    If op has trouble finding math rock tunes that are in 4/4 they might be having trouble finding the time, or could be confused by Syncopation."
mathrock,34t5yi,DanceWithYourMom,3,Tue May 5 03:22:40 2015 UTC,I'm aware that math-rock didn't invent odd time signatures. That wasn't my point at all. I'm somehow who frequently calls out this list when people try to claim anything that isn't 4/4 is somehow math-rock.
mathrock,34t5yi,WhiskyTech,-5,Tue May 5 03:28:14 2015 UTC,What is your point?
mathrock,34t5yi,DanceWithYourMom,4,Tue May 5 03:30:17 2015 UTC,"Defining a genre is always going to murky territory, and this is probably not the thread for it, but I agree with many academics' assertions that math rock is simply the combination of the distorted sound of punk and hardcore mixed with the metrical complexities typical of 70's progressive rock (e.g. (i) https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1135710228; (ii) http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/bitstream/88435/dsp019g54xh80g/1/Brown_princeton_0181D_10903.pdf ). So saying 'most math rock is in 4/4', with consideration of recurring motifs in the history of math rock, is probably a stretch I think.  And yes, odd time signatures obviously aren't exclusive to 'math rock'. However, they were a definitive constituent to the evolution of this music, in the same way that, I dunno, blast beats and tremolo picking were definitive constituents of black metal evolution but are also quintessential to other genres. And you probably can have math rock that is in 4/4 that has other oddities (key and tempo changes, angular melodies, counterpoint) that makes the overall sound initially hard to parse.   I dunno. I'm just a guy not doing work right now."

I recently returned from touring our LP and have been on a roll with writing, so I have some completed and tons of works in progress. I've churned out this stuff the past two weeks:  Monochromance - a hip hop-inspired track. Incomplete.  Losing Susan - starts slow, ends fast. Instrumentals complete.  Syllables - my try at new-wave. Complete.  Feel free to pick my writing apart, as I've been trying for a math pop sound and I don't always feel successful!"

I know that GP6 and Finale are far more powerful (as I'm familiar with them), but they take a ton of extra effort as well. GP5 feels like a pretty solid middle ground."

mathrock,34lbmd,christlarson94,1 point,Sat May 2 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"Quite a lot of this song is varied, stop and start rhythms, quick movements, and a few complex signatures in there. I don't see how this isn't relevant to math rock fans, especially with the rest of the band's (and Oso's) discography. The heavy last part feels post-rocky, which is fine with me, but they are doing it with layered, intricate instruments, a guitar 'soloing', and in 6/8 as opposed to the 4/4 power chord fuzz wash of much post-rock."
mathrock,34lbmd,roachwarren,0,Sat May 2 22:09:12 2015 UTC,I didn't say anything about its relevance to math rock fans. Just that its a good post rock song.

mathrock,34lj5d,DavidsonEscPlan,3,Sat May 2 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"https://thebulletprooftiger.bandcamp.com/album/you-wanna-kiss-about-it  This and most other modern math-rock is on Bandcamp.  No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, or streaming a video. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp. This is very important when we're talking about a new album because albums cost money to make and new album also means new tour."

mathrock,33q89f,UnicornEagle,5,Fri Apr 24 18:45:38 2015 UTC,I'm not. I'm really enjoying the tracks. Some of the tones on this record are out of this world. Really fascinating record overall from the first few listens.
mathrock,33q89f,UnicornEagle,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"The tones are unreal and some of the guitar work is super playful, but i just feel like the vocal work isn't really adding anything to there music on some of the songs. I'm definitely going to continue to listen to it, I think my mind is still a bit stuck on there last album."
mathrock,33q89f,llamafromhell1324,2,Fri Apr 24 22:25:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I see what you're saying. I didn't mind the vocals but everyone I've talked to about it agrees with you. If I was disappointed about anything it was the shortness of the tracks and the lack of a cohesive feel of an album. It sounded a lot like a collection of really good songs but it didn't feel like an album.
mathrock,33q89f,MexicanMouthwash,2,Fri Apr 24 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"I think the cohesion is a big issue for me too since ASIWYFA has always had some of the tightest flowing albums, as most post-rock bands often do."

I could be wrong though!  Also, that's the only EP released by that Clever Girl. There's another band called Clever Girl that sounds pretty similar, but is an entirely different band.

He posted a bunch of clips of them in the studio on his Instagram a while ago, you should be able to find them easily if you haven't already seen them!  He also posted pictures of a string quartet in the studio around the same time, so maybe there might be some strings in a new toe song - or it could be for another thing, since he's a recording engineer it could be another band. It was in the same timeframe as the toe clips though so here's hoping!"

If you're strictly limited by strumming and muting with your right hand and arm, you could probably develop an open-note style with left-handed tapping, open tunings and capos above all. Since you cannot logistically bar chords with your right hand anyway, you'd only be missing out on note speed (which you can work on with your left hand instead)  Don't give up! I'm sure you can develop your own style in time. Good luck!"
mathrock,32s34i,AceFaith,3,Thu Apr 16 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"Open tunings will definitely help with this, and I always think new tunings can be a great way to accidentally come up with new ideas. When I think of one handed tapping I often think of In Your World by Muse where the main riff is one handed tapping. It's basically just tapping notes with open notes in between. So if you add open tunings to that you could be a lot more playful and move around the key a lot more https://youtu.be/Z87-xz2bTyo"
mathrock,32s34i,steevilweevil,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"I've been experimenting with open tunings for a few weeks now. Definitely not as easy for making chords, but they help for tapping."
mathrock,32s34i,tefnakht,2,Wed Apr 22 16:36:50 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the advice! I'm going to keep practicing and figuring out my style of playing.
mathrock,32s34i,anamorphism,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, clever use of pitch shifters/harmonisers could get you far with open tunings. Could do stuff like blend a signal with the pitch shifted up a fifth, or down an octave to get a harmonically complex sound going. Or recording a melody into a looper and then playing a counter-melody pitched shifted."
mathrock,32s34i,parrot94,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of a pitch shifter before, I'll check that out!"
mathrock,32s34i,PowerGrill,2,Wed Apr 22 16:41:00 2015 UTC,you could also get something like an ebow and just hold it over the string you want to be vibrating. requires less dexterity than strumming a bunch on one string.

mathrock,32qc9h,wordsarepegs,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"""But, this one goes up to seven...""  I love songs with odd time signatures for some reason. Jesus Lizard's ""Whirl"" or Brubeck's ""Blue Rondo A La Turk"" for instance. Buddy of mine once wrote a song that consisted of one bar of 7 followed by a bar of 8. Utterly brilliant but he had no idea what he had done and it took a lot of patience and hard work to figure it out. I think our drummer would have preferred not to, but eventually I wrote a bridge for it and we really enjoyed it."
mathrock,32p8g0,alloway,6,Wed Apr 15 16:35:16 2015 UTC,"They are definitely progressing their sound away from a lot of what they started out as. I've never hated when bands progress their sound. It's not something that has ever bothered me, but so far I'm not 100% sold on everything I've heard from this album so far. This song feels very uninspired. Not sure why I think that yet, but I do.  I remain optimistic, and while I am sure they will still turn out a solid record, it may just not be what I am looking for in an ASIWYFA record."
mathrock,32p8g0,ASIWYFA,2,Wed Apr 15 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"I feel you there. I think ""Wasps"" is my favorite track so far only because it's most reminiscent of what I expect an ASIWYFA track to sound like. I loved All Hail Bright Futures, but a little part of me misses that huge sound on Gangs. Maybe that was what Tony Wright brought to the band, and All Hail was the first album without him. This album doesn't seem to be a return to form for me, it seems like a new sound altogether. Optimistic that I'll really enjoy this album, but like you I'm a little worried about what I've heard so far."
mathrock,32p8g0,ASIWYFA,2,Wed Apr 15 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"It seems either  Tony was a major influence for the way ASIWYFA sounded before he left, or they purposefully decided to start going in a different direction once he left"

Still, it was a good album, and I expect the new one will also grow on me very quickly. And let's face it, it's going to be a hell of a lot of fun at festivals this year."
mathrock,32p8g0,treefuxxer,2,Thu Apr 16 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"I like what I've heard from it so far. Its not as epic as Bright Futures, but I'm a firm believer that, even when you branch out with your sound and flop, that sets you up for releasing another unique masterpiece down the road. We don't need another Gangs or Bright Futures, and I'm pretty stoked that ASIWYFA is still pushing themselves to create novel music."
mathrock,32p8g0,rx-bandit,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"I've always loved bands who progressed their sound, in the right way. Some bands nail it, while most don't.  I think bright futures was an absolute masterpiece and thought that from the first few listens.  I partially agree that this doesn't have quite the same energy, and soul as bright futures did but I'm very optimistic. I'll give it a proper judgement when the whole album is released."

People just like to lazily lump in with this because of some of his labelmates.  Unless you people are also claiming Chelsea Wolfe is math-rock.
mathrock,32kr6l,WhiskyTech,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:55:45 2015 UTC,"Well the genre itself is vague,  but I also said this when Tera Melos was on Rolling Stone in '13 for X'ed Out. Seeing bands you been following for several years and enjoyed either playing with or seeing live, (some through this subreddit) get mainstream exposure is really cool. Like I saw this band Hop Along get put on the MeWithoutYou tour for this summer. That's super rad!  I'm not going to knitpick genre titles, but if someone who has never heard of him and goes ""Oh wow I really like this style of music what else is out there?"" Chances are they will find his label mates interesting or go searching and might end up at a place like here. That's why I said its a ""pull"" for the genre."

There were dozens and dozens of bands composed of music majors and professors, yet the best band (talent and exposure-wise) was the three piece high school band that had nothing to do with the college and played at none of the popular venues in town."

There's a lot of great underground bands out there and the only thing they lack is exposure. Since math-rock.net is shutting down and there will no longer be youtube compilations such as this one r/mathrock comps could be a great alternative.   I thought about where the money would go if people do decide to pay through the ""pay what you want"" option. There's two routes- split the money between bands or donate everything to charity. I feel that splitting the money between bands could become an issue and would have to be handled delicately if we all decide that's what the community wants.

I wouldn't actually have anything finished to contribute until summer maybe, but I would definitely be interested in doing so when I can.  As for how to do it, one potential method would be to create a submissions thread.  Everyone posts their songs, the 10 or so with the most upvotes get on the comp.  Once you have been on a comp you are disqualified from entering again for some length of time.    I think one flaw with this method is that everyone would have already heard all of the songs before the comp.  Maybe submit a previous song you had written and then have anew one on the actual comp?  This was just off the top of my head, so there's probably a better way but I figured I'd contribute some basic ideas."
mathrock,31xc79,jefebrown,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"That is a good idea, though it has the potential for vote fuzzing/trolling. In the short term, it has a mass community appeal if we accept everyone, but in the long term we'd want to keep the quality up so people don't think they're wasting time when they listen to it. Things like muffled audio/ weird mixes etc.  I don't want to outright discard submissions that people place and I would work with them so we can get everything sounding good.  I'd like to release this first one by the end of May and if it goes well maybe one at the end of July.   Thanks,  -Taylor"

mathrock,31om8w,mp5_Blights,5,Mon Apr 6 22:58:32 2015 UTC,Don't really like the vocals. Could be the mixing though.
mathrock,31om8w,butt_noodler,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"It seems every critique we've gotten so far has been about the vocals haha, do you mind elaborating on what it is you don't like about them?"
mathrock,31om8w,butt_noodler,6,Tue Apr 7 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"I kind of gave it a cursory listen last night so I gave it a good listen through to make sure my opinion isn't incomplete. Take my shit with a grain of salt because I'm an amateur musician at best. Nor am I a vocalist.  The guy has a strong, deep voice that I think clashes with the instrumentation at times. There's a few things, kinda hard to kind of put my finger on it because it actually works in some places namely ""Space Cowboy"" and ""Lost Inside"" or when he's singing at a higher octave like in ""Wow Them With Science."" In Space Cowboy the harmonies at ~10:30 and the droney mixing kind of making his voice less intense, which leads me to believe it could be helped with some mixing techniques.  In Lost Inside, particularly the intro, the instrumentation is a little lighter and it's his voice that's actually driving the song so it doesn't sound clashing until the instrumentation picks up in the latter half of the song, then when the instruments fall back again I find myself enjoying his voice (same thing in Wow Them With Science during the claps at ~6:55). Which is further proof (to me at least) that it's not necessarily bad vocals but kind of a disconnect between his vocals and the overall composition? Not sure if that makes sense or helps.  Edits: Typos, I blame day drinking."

mathrock,31om8w,Ninja-Penguin,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, I definitely agree that some changes in the mix could improve it greatly.  I really like the vocals, but sometimes they just feel like they're sitting on top of the music, instead of being part of it.  I believe this is due to his lower timbre fighting with the other instruments more.  A higher vocal can kind of ""soar"" over the instruments, with this, I would recommend really carving out a spot in the mix for the vocals and maybe bringing up the high pass on the vocals to give the instruments some more room.    This was just from a quick listen so don't put too much stock in my opinion, and I actually did enjoy the vocals, but some changes to the mixing may help give them that extra nudge."
mathrock,31om8w,Ninja-Penguin,5,Wed Apr 8 00:50:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool! Doesn't sound forced, which is important."
mathrock,31md7m,happyguyxlii,3,Mon Apr 6 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"This is an incredible split.  I usually think of a split album as a promotional gag to provide publicity to a lesser known band off the back of a more well known band, but in this case, I see two very talented individuals who have done something truly interesting.  They clearly have both overcome some unique challenges in covering the other artist's song.  I was surprised to find out how well these two mediums worked together.  I almost would have preferred the order to go ABBA instead, so the cover would follow the original in both cases.  It's such a cool sound at the midpoint of the album when RC PRO JAM ends, and Pete's cover comes in with the same riff tapped. But I suppose that would result in the same artist bookending the album, which maybe they didn't want to do.  Or maybe it just sounded better like this, who knows.  Anyway, great album!"

There was a straight up weirdness to stuff like Don Cab's titles or Storm & Stress's or Hella's that got lost somewhere, and the post-rock trend of trying to sound like a Burt Lancaster quote is not super compelling to me anymore.

Their album ""Alemeda"" is named after an area of the town about 5 minutes away from Old Town.  Extremely talented individuals who, unfortunately, ditched their talents for hard drugs, from what I hear.  To relive their memory, I tend to listen to this album every now and again.  Only one of the members continued on with their music; he played at the Seattle Treefort music festival this year.    If you're interested in buying the album, it is only $8 for a hard copy.

(if you somehow have not listened to them before) has a decent assortment of moods/atmospheres in their songs. For example they have some really happy upbeat tunes, but they also have tons of songs that are less happy, and more into the realm of... introspective, I guess? This album is a fantastic spectrum to express that. Specifically, the second track could be what you're looking for.  Also, if you're into metal at all, check out Intronaut.

mathrock,30tr0n,sourapples,2,Mon Mar 30 17:24:44 2015 UTC,I was so mad that I wasn't able to make their Boston date when they came in 2013. So glad they're coming back! This seems like a recurrent thing now!

mathrock,30tr0n,intuitiveline,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Never been to U st. music hall, but i have been to black cat (the dodos) and RnR hotel (TTNG). Is it a bad venue?"
mathrock,30tr0n,lovethemix,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"Walked out of El Ten Eleven halfway through the set it was so bad. It seemed like the sound guy had severe hearing loss cause the mix was nothing but super bass and screeching highs.  All the stage lights were pointed directly into the audiences eyes, and not in a cool light show kinda way, more blinding. And even if it were a neat light show, right next to the stage is the florescent lit entrance, so, major mood killer.   There was a disproportionate amount of douchy security lurking about all grumpily for the size of the venue/audience. I don't think you need an army of meatheads to police a bunch of flannel wearing hipsters at a postrock show. A couple of bouncers by the door would be fine, thanks.   All the ""graffiti"" in the bathroom seemed fake, and the drinks were expensive.   Black Cat and RnR have simillar capacity/ticket prices. I have no idea how booking works, but I imagine bands only play U st. cause they don't know better."
mathrock,30tr0n,skitztobotch,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you had such a bad experience at U st. I've been there 3 times and every time the sound has been amazing (granted 2 of the shows were the same artist who I think is super anal about his sound).  And interestingly, I've have not-great experiences at black cat and RnR (mostly black cat). When I saw white denim there last spring vocals were feeding back the entire time, and the singer was trying to work with the sound guy but for some reason he thought turning up the reverb would make everything better. It did not."
mathrock,30tr0n,ASIWYFA,3,Thu Apr 2 01:58:01 2015 UTC,I'm always a bit baffled by what cities get included/excluded on tours like this.  Y U NO Austin?!!

mathrock,30tr0n,ASIWYFA,2,Mon Mar 30 20:43:09 2015 UTC,I feel like that has to kind of do with how American cities are represented to people internationally. There are a lot of bands that used to not tour in Boston because they would hit New York and I guess they thought that those two places were close or something(?)
mathrock,30tr0n,sourapples,2,Mon Mar 30 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a 4 hour drive isn't that bad if it's a band you love. I have driven all over Florida to see bands."
mathrock,30tr0n,EarnestMalware,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, if it was REALLY worth it then I might do it, but 4 hours to NYC does depend on traffic and stuff due to people's crazy commutes.

mathrock,30lwj3,gibweb,2,Sun Mar 29 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Knudson's history in Botch is probably what makes this connection. Nothing about their sound says math rock to me. It's contemporary rock, some bluesy stuff, some indie stuff, some loud singing, some soft. Pretty safe structures and instrumentation, which makes me agree with you that they don't really touch on ""math"". I enjoy some of their material, but their rhythms are most often simple and conventional, their melodies are (for lack of a better descriptor) too melodic, and what they do for experimentation is mostly just production/electronic effects."

I had never heard the term before, but a close friend made me a mix tape that essentially consisted of these guys (Pattern is Movement), An Albatross, and the Dillinger Escape Plan (the later two leaning more towards ""mathcore""). I was blown away by the complexity of the time signatures, syncopation, and dissonant melodies. Anyways, I don't expect this to get too much recognition (especially compared to modern bands like TTNG, CHON, etc.), but I thought you all would appreciate a little blast from the past.  Enjoy!"

mathrock,304q4f,David1405,2,Tue Mar 24 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"First off, this is great. I really enjoy it. I have some criticisms though, and mind you, these are just my opinions.   Near the start, the first ""drop""/section you built up to had really underwhelming bass. Maybe if you emphasized the bass movement with a punchier kick? The first kick into it had a lot of punch, but the rest of them just kind of meld into the sound.  Also, overall it sounds like some things are just mixed down a little too much and don't stand out enough. The piano is one of these, and could be brought up a little bit as well as sounding a little more impactful, like with a stronger attack. It's pretty noticeable in the refrain because the vocals were basically masking the piano almost completely. The snare sound is another, where I felt it too could have been a little snappier (edit: not too much, more listens made it sound better, haha). These points of impact really engage the listener by shifting their focus a bit, and when everything is sort of mixed down for the vocals, it sounds a bit uneventful.  Despite these minor things, it's still really good. Your take on the melody concerning the repeated guitar is great, and the vocals are beautiful (there's one blip where it sounds like they move into harmonies not in key, bur I couldn't find it on a second listen). May I ask how you did the vocals? Thank you for sharing!  As an aside, does anyone have links to that other producer who was doing stuff with amfb? Used a lot of samples as I remember."
mathrock,304q4f,sweeppick09,5,Tue Mar 24 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for the constructive criticism! Really appreciated!  The issue with the kick's and snare's not retaining much space in the mix was because I tried to use sidechain compression as little as possible in this. This is why the first kick sounds really pronounced, it's actually the bass end of the spectrum from the subs kicking in getting distorted slightly as it initially goes through the limiter that I have on the master channel to crush the dynamics. I didn't really want to change up the kick to something heavier, maybe just out of personal preference, as this actually started a lot more like an IDM track than what it ended up becoming! I do see your point though, I'll take that into consideration on my next project. With the snare lacking snap, that was probably due to the compression I had active on the low mids of the master, I compressed it quite a lot because that's where the majority of the transients were hitting much louder than the rest of the mix and were causing some issues for my limiter.  Mix wise I kept everything rather low as it was getting really hectic, and with my lack of sidechain compression it was starting to go a bit all over the place. I did initially turn up the piano in the refrain, but decided against it as there was some serious sibilance frequency issues with the amount of highs I was trying to push through, so for the sake of the vocals I compromised!  The vocals were processed with Melodyne for some pitch correction and shifting for harmonies (probably why you heard something not in key at some point, my vocals wavering probably threw the note transition off a bit), then put through Waves CLA Vocals to glue them together. After that I threw on Ableton's vocoder that was carrying a patch I made in NI Massive that was playing the same chords the piano/strings/organ/guitars were!  Cheers again!"

mathrock,2zll1q,samuable,6,Thu Mar 19 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"Their first full album is a chance to showcase their best stuff and reach a lot of NEW fans who haven't heard them yet.  For that reason, I'm fine with older songs. I like the new tracks and I'm really happy about how everything sounds (also figure in that youtube is lower quality than what you'll get on CD later too!).     The cool thing about liking a young band like this is that they have plenty of time to do whatever the hell they want and you can follow them as they mature (from a music perspective).  So you don't like a release, that's fine.... check out their next one.     I grew up listening to a band called Mock Orange out of Indiana.  They started out as cookie cutter pop punk and went through several huge changes in their sound while still remaining themselves. I would get hyped about their next release,  and sometimes it took a little while for me to accept what they were doing, but it's not like I had any say in it.     I can't believe how thoughtless and callous so many comments are, especially on youtube, about what they should or shouldn't be doing. Are they supposed to get together as a band and say ""well, here's what all the comments said, lets incorporate all the criticism into our next album"".  man, fuck that... keep the negative shit to yourselves. It doesn't help anybody.    I can't wait to see what Chon does next... it's not often you see young dudes tearing it up with such precision."
mathrock,2zll1q,KingTelephone,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"Plus, though I love Knot, I feel if they were gonna rerecord old material, they should've done some some songs off Newborn Sun, which I think is so much better than Woohoo"
mathrock,2zll1q,DrGags,11,Thu Mar 19 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"I honestly disagree. I think the new Knot ending needed to be in a studio version, rather than just on the live recording, and the tone/remastering of the other old stuff sounds better, in my opinion. Like, a lot of the stuff that they do live that I preferred over the studio stuff showed up on the re-recording, so I'm a big fan of that stuff, but I totally see where you're coming from.   The new stuff is a lot softer, and shows off Drew a lot more, which is great because he's a really good bassist and a lot of the stuff he was playing before frankly wasn't all that interesting. I'm a big fan of all of the new songs, too. In regards to the vocals, I'm kind of on the fence. The lyrics are meh, but Drew's voice and melodies are really nice. Ecco definitely needed the re-record, too."
mathrock,2zll1q,carnut11,5,Fri Mar 20 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"An interesting note about the bass: Mario actually said that Erick both wrote and recorded most of the bass parts for the album. Mario himself wrote and recorded the bass parts for the ones Erick didn't do. So evidently Drew isn't actually playing bass on the studio recordings...

mathrock,2zll1q,jamesismynamo,5,Thu Mar 19 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"I love the album and am not disappointed at all that they rereleased songs--for me, the step up in sound quality made me fall in love with the songs all over again. The new (to studio) outro of Knot is also so good it warranted a rerelease.   I would have agreed on the whole ""get another singer if they're gonna do vocals"" point but Drew definitely stepped his game up, with some ""studio enhancement"" they didn't have at their disposal before haha. I think his voice is just fine now.  My only wish is that they'd write another song in the same vein of Perfect Pillow or something else from their first demo. But I guess they've been playing with a chilled-out fusion-y style for quite some time now so I guess this new sound is here to stay."
mathrock,2zll1q,A_KOd_Koala,6,Thu Mar 19 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"My only wish is that they'd write another song in the same vein of Perfect Pillow or something else from their first demo.   Same, their first 7 songs are too good, I really miss that style. But the new tunes are real good too.  If you want more like early CHON, maybe check out Save Us From the Archon"
mathrock,2zll1q,theseyeahthese,3,Thu Mar 19 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"Worth mentioning that Save Us From the Archon is like listening to an extreme version of CHON.

mathrock,2zdkfc,SalmonSlammingSamN,8,Tue Mar 17 22:07:03 2015 UTC,"An undeniably fun listen. Their compositional tendencies are so musically satisfying. However, a couple things about the release do bother me. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love chon, the following things just kinda irked me a little: - the rerecorded songs aren't significantly better than the originals. I actually think some of them got a little worse. The guitars seem to lack clarity. Wish we would have just gotten more new songs instead of remakes of the already-awesome originals. - I'm not against chon having vocals, I just really don't like what drew does. Just pop-y note choice and questionable lyrics. - why'd they get AAL's drummer to play beats Nate could have played? Haha I was expecting some crazy AAL drumming that Nate can't handle  Am I alone in thinking these things? Just want to get some more opinions. Anyone agree or am I being irrational?"
mathrock,2zgoi9,sputnikorbust,2,Wed Mar 18 13:05:23 2015 UTC,This is really sick. I listened to For: a while ago and thought highly of it. This definitely surpassed my expectations for a sophomore release.

mathrock,2zci0e,AnjohnsPez,-1,Tue Mar 17 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd be happy to take a shot at some tracks too, there could even be collaboration between multiple guitarists. I can do guitar and vox."
mathrock,2zci0e,imapeasant,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:09:35 2015 UTC,hi there! which website did you use to find people to collaborate over the Internet? I planned on doing the same thing for my materials
mathrock,2zahz0,mackenziersg,4,Mon Mar 16 23:37:22 2015 UTC,check it out (and their other stuff) on bandcamp!  http://wakingaida.bandcamp.com/album/eschaton

mathrock,2z6944,filementary,6,Sun Mar 15 23:15:11 2015 UTC,This is sick man! What tuning are you in?
mathrock,2z6944,Halervane,2,Sun Mar 15 23:19:53 2015 UTC,thanks! this one's in DAEAC#E.
mathrock,2z6944,CorgiMilitia,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:44:59 2015 UTC,Why does anyone ever play in standard when they can play in this?
mathrock,2z6944,Halervane,4,Mon Mar 16 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"I still play in standard sometimes, but unfortunately, when ever I play in standard I am usually guilty of just playing Jazz/ writing jazzier riffs/ soloing over chords on my looper. I mean there's nothing wrong with playing a jazzier style but i've been doing that for a long time so alternate tunings are new and exciting for me haha."
mathrock,2z6944,sixthreetwo,2,Mon Mar 16 01:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've been in Open E lately trying to write Invalids-like stuff, but I'm always down to find new tunings"
mathrock,2z6944,sixthreetwo,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"Man that was so awesome! Checking out that bandcamp for sure. Excuse the embarrassing question, but you drop the low E, leave the A, raise the D to E, raise the G, raise the B and leave the high e?  Do you have to do anything to the truss rod/make any adjustments to protect the guitars neck? Or a lighter string gauge? I'm so down to experiment with gnarly tunings but don't wanna fuck up my guitar, so any tips would be sick."
mathrock,2z6944,NeuralLotus,5,Mon Mar 16 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's exactly the tuning sequence I did. I haven't done any adjustments to the truss rod or neck. In terms of the string question,  i'm using a lighter string gauge (10s) than is usually suggested for a Jazzmaster (i.e 11's and up). The string tension in this tuning definitely is weird on my guitar and requires a lot of force. It took a while to build the arm/hand strength to play a more articulately in this tuning and honestly I still think I need to work on that. So far I haven't noticed my guitar degrading to any extent but i'll have to keep an eye out for that. I certainly haven't been all that attentive up this point haha...  Thanks for the questions!"
mathrock,2z6944,spell_negus,2,Mon Mar 16 02:44:14 2015 UTC,Thank YOU for taking to time to explain it to me. Keep on keeping on with your awesome tunes and playing style!
mathrock,2z6944,pizza_burrito,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"That would explain why your playing seemed to be a little off. I don't mean any offense by that. It's a great song, and I like all of your other music. But I did notice some buzzing here and there and a couple of transitions that were off some fraction of a second. Which I would assume isn't directly due to the tension. But more due to the tension just making playing feel different. I was initially thinking it might just be needing some more practice."
mathrock,2z6944,kylestephens54,3,Mon Mar 16 03:39:02 2015 UTC,None taken whatsoever! I definitely know that if I keep practicing this song I can get it cleaner/tighter. It just requires more strengthening and conditioning. I really appreciate this comment and this is really insightful feedback about what I need to focus on. Thanks a ton!
mathrock,2z6944,kylestephens54,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'm inexperienced with alternate tunings besides half-step and full-step down, so I was wondering if tightening the B string to a C# for example could break the string very quickly. Or is it something you don't even worry about?"
mathrock,2z6944,pizza_burrito,4,Mon Mar 16 21:01:02 2015 UTC,Holy shit! Incredible!!! Please release an EP or setup a Patreon. Anything so we can support you making more of this magic.

A lot of bands that sound like math-rock but lack the compositional elements that really make it up. Just because you tap your high treble single-coil fender, you aren't immediately math-rock.   I dunno I enjoyed the song but really what's the difference between this and pop."

I enjoyed it even if not as technically astounding as some other artists."

mathrock,2yq4xa,TheRustlerOfJimmies,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:22:57 2015 UTC,I love the super full feeling of the bass. Gives another dimension that a lot of math rock bands miss out on.
mathrock,2yotok,harpandu,11,Wed Mar 11 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm normally not into more... uh, how would you describe it... twinkly math rock, but I was digging this quite a bit! I really liked the bass line that kicked in around 1:04, and felt that it helped add to the transition at 1:10.  And the syncopation that kicks in at 1:50 is particularly awesome, considering the transition from that is to a much more funky, slowed down groove.   From 2:12-2:46 is a great crescendo-decrescendo, IMO. Then from there on it plateaus onto such a pretty outro. A really solid song. Also, I want that Strat.   And I probably shouldn't comment when I'm high on xanax and caffeine."

mathrock,2ypc8z,loxodon_smiter,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:20:23 2015 UTC,Dude I love the way it just starts. Most mathrock/pop bands have that problem of super boring intros. This just hits.
mathrock,2ypc8z,HaventLivedAfroPop,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"You guys sound good, so please don't take any offense to any musical criticism I have.   I felt like although the music sounded pretty, nothing about it was really ""wowing"". The best part by far was from 2:53 and onward. Nothing wrong with your vocals or your musical style-- you all are clearly talented musicians, but I've just heard this style done a thousand times before. It honestly sounded like every basement math rock house show I've been to.   However, you guys clearly show a lot of promise, so keep making music! If you guys work into having more intricate grooves like the outtro of your song, you guys will go from sounding good to great. Because I was really digging that last bit, there."
mathrock,2ypc8z,Gatekeepah,2,Wed Mar 11 18:36:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the constructive criticism! This was our first album and we recorded it in  a dorm room in Olympia!

mathrock,2yn3t3,Gatekeepah,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:22:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have a bunch of massive playlists under different genres. I use them at work as well. I have 8.5-10.5 hour shifts so it's nice to have massive playlists of music. Makes it easy to edit as well. When I hear a song I don't like I just walk over and hit delete!  Really happy you are enjoying it!
mathrock,2yn160,Afterglow375,0,Wed Mar 11 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"This song is so damn energetic and happy. I remember ASIWYFA being way more focused on the post-rock side of things. Then again, I haven't listened to this band in years (and trust me when I say YEARS).   From 3:00-onwards it just gets so damn dancy that I want to jump all over the place. I see why this subreddit posts them so much! Maybe I should stop listening to only Cheval de Frise, Yowie, Ahleuchatistas, Zu, Zs, and Hella, lol."
mathrock,2yn160,Gatekeepah,2,Wed Mar 11 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"You should check out another Sargent House band, Fang Island, if you haven't and you're digging this song."

mathrock,2yl6zl,xthecharacter,2,Tue Mar 10 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"my all time favorite metal band, haven't actually listened to test of submission at all, i really really liked psychic maps. IMO Colin Martson is hands down the most creative and skilled musician in progressive metal."
mathrock,2yl6zl,THHoughton,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:05:04 2015 UTC,Please listen to this album then. It's incredible and IMO better on the whole than Psychic Maps (though some of my favorite songs are from Psychic Maps).

mathrock,2yjw9g,ryan6767,3,Tue Mar 10 13:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are and I really like them.  like a mixture between pop punk and math rock, very good mix of the two and they pull it off amazingly"
mathrock,2yjw9g,theseyeahthese,4,Tue Mar 10 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"Tommy Boys is another great mixture of pop punk and math rock, though it sounds a little different than Invalids-- a lot less tapping."

mathrock,2yjw9g,jamesismynamo,2,Wed Mar 11 01:23:51 2015 UTC,They're more math pop but I for some reason find their tapping to be similar to Pete Davis. Yvette Young  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hFNi_AAmE Natalie Evans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXdwFN9STcs
mathrock,2yjw9g,freshcelery,2,Wed Mar 11 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"Invalids started because Pete listened to this Maps & Atlases album, definitely check it out. Most similar thing you'll probably hear"

mathrock,2ygn5g,xelested,3,Mon Mar 9 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"Crystal Fuxx is one of the last releases they made before changing their name to MTKPCC (or something like that), and it's worth seeking out if you haven't heard it.  It sounds like what modern math rock might have sounded like had it been around in the 1980's, and I've never really heard anything else that sounds quite the same.  I can't say I recommend anything they've released since the name change, but anything they released under the name Riding the Dipodoc was excellent."

mathrock,2y6lad,daren_james,2,Fri Mar 6 23:12:17 2015 UTC,Tiny was great! We did the second half of San Mai Niku in the (then) new B-room. This was our first time tracking in the A-room and it was definitely one of the most relaxed sessions I've done. The engineer we worked with was fantastic and I'm really happy with the sounds we got (this was a tape dump with flat faders) and how much we got done (we had a day to write/rehearse and then 1 day to do all the recording!). Thanks for checking it out :)

mathrock,2y1765,carnut11,7,Thu Mar 5 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"I like this more than Story, it's much fresher. And RE: vocals, his voice is so chill and easy going; the lyrics reflect that to me, they don't need to be anything deeper. The focus is always on instrumentation with CHON, the vocals are just adding an extra layer while the guitars take a step back in this one."
mathrock,2y1765,jealousbones,3,Thu Mar 5 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"I prefer Story, and this shift in style was pretty unexpected of CHON.  BUT this song is super dope and I agree that it's much fresher. I love the blend of RnB chill vibes and the usual melodic CHON riffs! Drew really stepped it up with his vox (with the help of generous amount of studio magic).   Although I agree about instrumentals being a priority, I would like to see them make vocals a priority in the future for some songs to see what Drew can really do with his vocal work.  Anyways I'm really glad they added chill vocals since my main squeeze for chill math rock vocals will disband soon (Uchu Conbini)."
mathrock,2y1765,Kuma-San,4,Thu Mar 5 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I pretty much made the same statement on youtube, but the vocals sound a tad too filtered or processed and the lyrics are empty. I hope the album leans more toward the sound of Story.   edit: this song would be awesome if they took the vocal lines and made them guitar lines instead"
mathrock,2y1765,samuable,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"the vocals sound a tad too filtered or processed   Yep, definitely agreed. It's not going to sound anything like this live."

mathrock,2y1765,theseyeahthese,3,Thu Mar 5 19:42:32 2015 UTC,There's a lot of improvement over the song with vocals on their last album.  I'm getting more and more excited for this project.

mathrock,2y1765,AnjohnsPez,4,Thu Mar 5 20:34:01 2015 UTC,Vocals are kinda ruining it for me. They sound pretty good but the lyrics are just so bland.  I also think that in order to make the track not just be completely saturated with sound they make the guitars much more basic and that takes away from the song as well.  As long as there are more absolute bangers like that last track they previewed this should be a solid effort.
mathrock,2y1765,WhiskyTech,5,Thu Mar 5 16:21:40 2015 UTC,Vocals are kinda ruining it for me. They sound pretty good but the lyrics are just so bland.   Vocals and lyrics are two different things. Just ignore the lyrics if the vocals sound good. That's what I do with 90% of music.   I also think that in order to make the track not just be completely saturated with sound they make the guitars much more basic and that takes away from the song as well.   So basic is automatically worse? I think the song flows pretty well. It would sound a lot of worse if there was a bunch of insanely intricate guitar work during the vocal parts.
mathrock,2y1765,AnjohnsPez,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of lyrics so it's hard for me to ignore them. But I'm sure they know the lyrics are shite, so I don't know why they didn't just make it a lovely guitar line with the same melody like someone else in the thread suggested. I think that would have gone over a lot better.  And no, basic is not automatically worse. But I listen to Chon because they go hard and groove like not many others can. So in this case I think the more basic and straightforward structure of the song and guitar work has made it worse for me."
mathrock,2y1765,WhiskyTech,2,Fri Mar 6 06:06:15 2015 UTC,"IDK man. I grooved party hard to this and literally thought of the word ""groove"" while I was listening to it. This wasn't something I thought up of after reading your post. It's slower and not as a masturbatory guitar fest but that doesn't fit they didn't make this work."
mathrock,2y1765,AnjohnsPez,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, the complexity of the lyrics is lacking and the guitar work seems to have gotten more simple. I can't help but miss the ""old"" CHON but I realize they are going in a new direction and I have to try to get used to the new sound."
mathrock,2y1765,eblue33,2,Thu Mar 5 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Well it's not just that, it's that they can't seem to decide on a direction to go in. Cause there's a track like this right beside a track like ""Story"" being released as singles. I'll definitely have to wait for the album to come out though. Because even the singing track on Woohoo! actually fit quite well into the flow of the EP. So maybe this track makes more sense in the right context."

They are a hard band at times to grasp. (The Gap for example, but that is another long long story.) But the ones mentioned below are fucking amazing, confusing, enticing, and downright great albums.   Start with: (In Order)   How Memory Works  (The best record in my opinion) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnYPqNZSAqI     A Portable Model of (Very close 2nd) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V3XbnpJ6zg    Dick Cheney, Mark Twain ( I think its a concept album? but great jams.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW7OrEjOpLQ    Everything At Once (I believe its mostly acoustic and much more laid back , but some great lyrics on here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oTYpW_QcRM  Cap n' Jazz have a more limited discography, so you can breeze through that no problem.

We are currently putting our funds towards recording/printing a full length album this April and then plan on touring in June/July. So a split wasn't really in our plans at the moment but it is definitely something we are interested in down the road.  Anyways our bands should keep and touch show swap soon.  Although what did you have in mind exactly for the split? (Digital and/or physical release? Number of songs etc.)
mathrock,2xqjfs,KLKid,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"Makes sense! No worries. PM me your Facebook or email and we can keep in touch. Originally the idea for the split was to knock out 2 or 3 songs for each band. A few months ago we added another guitarist to the group and this was supposed to ease him in and show our updated sound to people! We have plans in the works to travel out to Toronto this summer to record a full length, Were just in hopes we could do a small digital release before then if possible."

mathrock,2xhzw9,Almostlastplace,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:18:35 2015 UTC,Also they have some amazing unreleased demos on youtube too.  My personal favourite - Baltic Seadog Rescue. Sounds like there's a cut or two in the video and the sound is poor but hey   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUUxIYcEMG0
mathrock,2xhcja,mattscherbatski,3,Sat Feb 28 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"I like most of it, the bass tone bugs me for some reason. But whatever, very nice, Boston strong!"
mathrock,2xhcja,TheMSPaintKing,2,Sat Feb 28 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"Cheers, thanks. And yeah I get that, I don't have much gear so I recorded the bass through a Blues DeVille so the bass parts - especially the bass chords - sound like garbage."
mathrock,2xhcja,TheMSPaintKing,2,Sun Mar 1 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a tip that I tried out once. Get a small amp, and split the signal using a chorus or a delay or something. Run the bass into one amp regular, and run the other into the other small amp with the highs rolled off and the bass way way up. Put the microphone in between the two amps. Put your dirt if you want any in the amp with the regular amp, have the lows unaffected.   It doesn't add much bass, but it adds bass presence, which is helpful for math rock to help add a different timbre to the field of guitars."

mathrock,2xhcja,imapeasant,2,Sun Mar 1 00:24:42 2015 UTC,How do you do your drum sounds? - can't figure if it's plugin drums or a kit. I'm leaning towards plugin but they're pretty realistic. Nice songs man
mathrock,2xhcja,winstonville,2,Sat Feb 28 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I generally just use ProTools' Xpand plug-in sounds and spend a lot of time EQing, mixing, and varying velocities to make it sound somewhat realistic."
mathrock,2xhcja,ClarenceGarcia,2,Sun Mar 1 05:50:54 2015 UTC,this is goood. it has some Toe influence in it. at least thats what i think. good job!

mathrock,2xjo2j,filementary,2,Sun Mar 1 09:47:43 2015 UTC,Not math rock. Just a few pull offs
mathrock,2xistv,iamagmilf,8,Sun Mar 1 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"For the love of the math rock gods, listen to Rooftops."
mathrock,2xistv,DontSayNoToPills,2,Sun Mar 1 06:13:02 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Rooftops is amazing. Band members from Rooftops are in a new project called Detlef. They haven't released more than a few cell-phone videos of material yet, but it is sounding amazing and is sure to explode when they get an album out."
mathrock,2xistv,McDungle,6,Sun Mar 1 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"Side note:    I really think you should listen to Don Caballero's Discography in order. It really showcases the path in which Mathrock in the early 90s was being formed, and how their last record (American Don) really pushed the genre into a new way. Its funny to note that this record and Hella's first release were around the same time, and yet entirely different but both considered mathrock. The genre is mixed and has a lot of different angles, and Don Cab sort of paved the way for that.     If you want the abridged version, Listen to What Burns Never Returns, then go right into American Don. It's nuts."
mathrock,2xistv,HaventLivedAfroPop,0,Sun Mar 1 20:01:11 2015 UTC,American Don wasn't the last Don Caballero record. You're forgetting World Class Listening Problem and Punkgasm.
mathrock,2xistv,WhiskyTech,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"In the realm of original lineup and the most importantly the  Williams/Che dynamic, yes, American Don was the last ""Don Cab"" record. I'm fully aware of those two albums and they are both awesome in their own regard, but in terms of the 90's the group encapsulates the overall sound ending with American Don."
mathrock,2xistv,HaventLivedAfroPop,-1,Sun Mar 1 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Williams had no input on the first record but you still include that.   Though Ian Williams is credited on guitar for this album, he only joined the band shortly before For Respect's recording and had little substantial creative influence"
mathrock,2xistv,WhiskyTech,2,Sun Mar 1 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that's important from the historical standpoint. What was that, 93'? This genre was more formulated and established when the later post-Williams records came out. It's not to say don't listen to them, but they do stand on their own from the rest of the discography, and to introduce the genre, start with For Respect to American Don. (What Burns and American Don are my sophie's choice of records.)"

mathrock,2xistv,HaventLivedAfroPop,3,Sun Mar 1 07:15:57 2015 UTC,No one specified it had to focus on history. Dude said math rock to get into

As much as I am not a fan of parodic meme rap either, I think they get points for execution, style and certainly their flow. I forget which track it is from their first LP, but it's in 5/4 accented with triplets. It's not easy to bust rhymes in that meter.  Anyway, I got more into it with that first LP. Bam. I'd ask you to check it out if only to try to persuade you that they're pretty damn good. Give it a chance!"

mathrock,2x19kg,killinhimer,2,Wed Feb 25 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"Recorded in summer 2013, released now? There's a story here...    Otherwise I like it. Solid direction with the sound."
mathrock,2x19kg,ericless,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"You're so right haha  We were planning on pressing this to a 7 inch but several things ended up complicating that, including half of us living away at school. This lead to a good amount of delay but we're stoked to finally release it."

mathrock,2x19kg,wootywootP,2,Wed Feb 25 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"Fantastic ep, you guys make good use of your sound for sure. Guitars got me like hnngh"
mathrock,2wzu5b,Diet_Doctor_Thunder,5,Tue Feb 24 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"It'd be pretty cool if 'C' was a reference to the toe song of the same name. Great stuff anyway!  edit: Apparently Takaaki Mino (one of the guitarist from toe) 'recorded,mixed and mastered' this album. Knew he was an audio engineer, but I guess I never checked out his stuff he worked on out of toe."
mathrock,2wzu5b,Moniitor,4,Tue Feb 24 22:30:54 2015 UTC,This is really fucking good.

mathrock,2wzifh,jacknash,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:19:10 2015 UTC,If you are in London come see them on the 9th of March.
mathrock,2x0h9w,winstonville,2,Tue Feb 24 18:07:42 2015 UTC,You can learn a lot from Wiki actually.

mathrock,2x0h9w,AceFaith,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia article on math rock about covers it like the other guy said. The most common AND oldest link to math rock is typically Don Caballero, Shellac, Slint and Hella, being based in the late 80's to mid 90's.  However, if you're looking to also present the contemporaries of math rock, it's worth mentioning that the scene is also divided regionally. This means that you generally have flavors of math rock from the US, the UK and Japan as the regional epicenters.  I want to say that math rock is kind of on a second prolonged wave since the mid 00's, but I'm too young and new to really verify this. It just looks like tons of bands formed and grew since then (and shaped the contemporary sound at the time): TTNG, Adebisi Shank (RIP), Battles, Foals, 65daysofstatic, Dutch Uncles, Foals, and just a ton more. Do note that this second wave seems to start in the UK, all the bands I gave as examples except Battles are from that region."

mathrock,2ww0ot,JazzyAndy,5,Mon Feb 23 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"10/10, would recommend. These guys are super cool, and great live, too. Local to atlanta, so if you're ever around, keep an eye out for shows.  Edit: This one gets even mathier at the end! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7XbiF9ovQ"
mathrock,2ww0ot,denkyuu,3,Mon Feb 23 22:16:16 2015 UTC,"Fantastic band! Definitely recommend picking up an album or two from them, you won't be disappointed."
mathrock,2ww0ot,j0cks0n,3,Tue Feb 24 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"I fucking love this band. The lead guitarist is so goddamn talented, blows my mind. Anyways, he does that sort of triple tap/glitch tap thing in one of his videos on youtube, shows how he does it and it's a really good technique for all you guitarists out there."
mathrock,2ww0ot,Structure3,4,Mon Feb 23 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Yes I would love to copy that guy entirely when I'm done copying TTNG and American Football
mathrock,2ww0ot,holladaddy,0,Mon Feb 23 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"Haha I got the TTNG tab book for their latest album and it took about a year to get the first two bars of ""Havoc in the Forum"". Granted, I had to learn the whole fingerpicking technique from scratch, and I can't even use it to show off at the guitar store..."
mathrock,2ww0ot,Redequlus,2,Mon Feb 23 20:58:25 2015 UTC,Thanks!
