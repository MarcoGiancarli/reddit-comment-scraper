I do like productive though for how I can set certain habits to once a week on a certain day (so I meal prep on Sundays and that habit will pop up on sundays only which Way of Life doesn't do).   So there are pros and cons and that's why I have both :) I'd say give WoL a try (I think it only allows 3 habits before you have to buy the full version, but it will give you an idea)."

Now you might happen to have to make a run to the store at that time.  A traditional timer will just ring and ring until you shut it off.

It also became too complicated with categories and tags.  OneNote just uses a hierarchical folder structure within each notebook and you can open or close notebooks whenever you want.  The formatting is standard for Microsoft, there are hand writing and drawing inputs on most platforms, and there's more flexibility with easy note linking and sub-pages than there was with EN.  Password protection and sharing of notebooks is an added bonus, plus its cross-platform access is convenient.  What really sealed it for me were the more advanced features like tag summary sheets, templates, and page merging, which is where you can merge pages from a divide into another divide.  Example: For me, after I finish a class, I summarize my notes and then merge them with a single divider/folder so that, when the semester is over, I have one folder with all of my notes that I can then place into my Grad School notebook under a semester tab group.  http://imgur.com/sGQLI0B  This shows my grad school notebook with a divider tab on the left and tab groups on the right (where you can group divider tabs together however you want within a notebook)."

So I read them when I'm the least productive (before bed or right after dinner).  Sunrise with Todoist integrated. This todo-list app connected with calendar is a great combo. Writing things down in todo-ist + scheduling them in sunrise = perfect planning.  Simplenote for all plaintext notes. Writing things down is one of the things that make me more productive. Simplenote is fast and serves this purpose perfectly.

productivity,3dkdcg,_Its_not_your_fault,3,Thu Jul 16 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"Lived on just an archive folder for many years now. I've personally axed all other custom folders, such as a-z, action, and waiting as the article suggests. Just about all mail programs these days have an archive button, which moves your message to an archive folder. So much faster to hit archive or delete then shuffling to custom folders.   My zero inbox flow goes as follows.    Not actionable, but not trash, archive.  Actionable under 2 minutes, knock it out.  Actionable longer than 2 minutes, forward message to OmniFocus and archive.  Trash, you know what to do.    The idea is to get in and out as fast as possible. I check all email in the morning, and rarely do I check a second time that day. Messages are processed quickly, and I then move to OmniFocus (you can pick whatever task management software) for my things to do that take time and thought.  Hope that gives you a few more ideas."

Actionable items of 2 minutes or less get done immediately.  Things I need to do later like .pdf bills are forwarded to OmniFocus.  Things I need for reference like receipts get forwarded to Evernote.  Sometimes it might seem like 3 inboxes is a lot to keep organized, but I tend to batch-process them only once or twice a week. The time of keeping on top of 3 inboxes is much better than the time wasted by having all my personal GTD mess all over the place."

These then move the email to my action folder and create a task for the appropriate time frame.

If you use your iPhone more than your Android devices, IMHO the better approach is to use iOS Notes, and icloud.com/notes when on a desktop.  There are a few Android apps that promise syncing with iOS Notes, but none of them actually work.  If you really need cross-platform integration, you can setup iOS notes to store the notes in your Gmail account (or any other IMAP account). It will add an IMAP folder ""Notes"" and it works without major issues."

Meaning I would only do game design, logic theory, or whatever I needed to work out on PAPER first. Then on the weekends I would just put all the time into programming. After drawing, and having it sit in my brain all week, coding it out was much easier.  I find it's best to separate the work/home life from gamedev. Your body wants to make games but that costs energy, and it's a lot easier to just play games. So you have to want to make games more than your body wants to store energy! Meaning an abundance of energy will help you fight the loss in productivity.  Take naps, clear your mind, take longer showers. Clear your mind again. Force yourself to sit there for 20 minutes and don't think about anything. Just count to 1200 and don't think about anything else. Eat healthy, exercise a little bit (enough to get your heart rate up), drink coffee or energy drinks (I prefer caffeinated tea or coffee personally) to keep you going.  Gamedev can be incredibly difficult, so never feel discouraged if you can't finish whatever by Sunday night. Just make some notes in your dev journal and forget about it for a day. By the time Friday rolls around if you did what I practiced you will usually have the solution ready for code. Never fret over a deadline- if it takes four weeks to do something you thought would take a few days, then so what? It balances out, because you will also encounter problems that you think are really complicated, but turn out to only take you several hours of programming to implement.  Gamedev is for FUN. If you're not having FUN just slow down and approach the problem differently.   relevant motivational link"

Take your laptop to a coffee shop, your office or the library and see if you can get down to business there.  If you have a house you can try setting up an office. Never do anything but work on your hobby in there. Keep it neat and clean. Make it so all you have to do is sit down to start working. Don't have any distractions in the room and close the door when you go in. This doesn't work as well with computers/programming though since the internet is a big distraction in itself.

I think it's all very individual, so I can tell you what worked in my case. It was one thing at a time. I got interested in meditation first, to clear my mind and relax and to try be more present and aware of things happening around me, because I was always thinking about something different from the thing I was currently working on.   I started to meditate in the morning, for a few minutes at first and gradually realized that 10 minutes period suited perfectly for me. Because of that, I started to get up 10 minutes earlier than usual (so it was another good habit).  My inconsistent workouts really bothered me and I had problems to get myself exercising after my work-day, in the afternoons, so I gave it a thought and decided to do a simple workout in the morning, after the meditation. This meant I needed to get up another 10 minutes earlier. I started with a simple workouts which target most of the muscles, and gradually got to the 3 sets of 8 reps squats, pushups, pullups and leg raises. Sometimes I do burpees instead of wide pushups, bulgarian squats instead of squats and do an extra set of ab excercise, like hanging l-sit.  Also, I like to eat well before going to work, so I choose what to eat the day before, so I don't have to think much and panic in the morning :)   TL;DR: decide what you'd like your morning routine to be. Break it into smaller steps and strongly decide to do one thing at a time, be consistent, and after some time you'll have your own perfect start of the day! Good luck!"

Although meditating for a minute is better than not meditating at all, I find myself more calm and relaxed after 10 minute sessions than those of 5 mins, like I have more energy and willpower afterwards. Again, it could be a personal experience and it does not need to work for others.  From my experience: gather information from various sources, tryout different approaches and find what suits you best. I don't think there's a general rule (as for anything in life)."

They are always reliant on a net connection, which, having lived in a rural community during the days of dial-up, is what I consider a serious crutch.  If you're worried, pick apps like Dropbox and Evernote that have a degree of local (stored on your computer) presence. Or do text file syncing. Or download the google drive app. Whatever way you can to keep your data in your own hands.  Second, find a local IT guy and pay him double his hourly to teach him everything about backups. Ask what a RAID is and how it works. Ask for a copy of acronis tools. Buy a hard drive (not a western digital plastic-encased user friendly thing, I mean a HARD DRIVE) of at least a terabyte, get a dock for it too, and just straight up learn how to back up your computer, and do it often.  Finally, everyone I know questions why I have an alienware laptop which I never move instead of a desktop computer. Well, when the power goes out, I have no loss of computing horse power, and I have 6hrs of battery, plus my phone and tablet! So power outage, if they are over quickly, have yet to prove problematic.  If you haven't the luxury of reevaluating your computer choices though, and uninterrupted power supply can sometimes give up to an hour of useful computer life.  I've always found a little paranoia, plus persistence, goes a very long way. I like to remind myself each time I'm doing something ""How could everything be lost here"" and then just prepare for it. Save the document you're working on. Do it on paper, since it never ran out of battery. With the gym example, Make do with free weights or for crying out loud put on some shorts and run.  The trend with lifehacks is to look for this easy, timesaving efficient way, but I found it leaves one unprepared when it comes to do anything the hard way, so, don't get too caught up in it I guess."

productivity,3cfddv,Sagath01,5,Tue Jul 7 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"While this is true, it is imperative to understand very clearly the forces at work in society that are very heavily based on exploitation. Noam Chomsky is worth listening to for a couple of hours, some people have trouble completely agreeing with him but there is no arguing that he can offer a ton of very scientifically valid correlations and strong points in regards to matters that effect workers and their business relationship.  If you make a mistake and it's in your own personal enterprise, say in landscaping or construction, that is one thing because those jobs are impossible to send overseas and very hard or not worthwhile to bring a foreigner worker over for.  But if your mistake is related to some corporation, like you have failed to get a job after getting out of university or something similar for example, well that might actually not be your mistake but part of a very active trend that is occurring right now. It would be better for you to be aware of that and realize that you are not failing others, but others are failing you and the social contract is not being obligated. Then you can better formulate a plan that helps you deal with the actual conditions of life, instead of having mistakes and failures are more based on ideological conditioning that really has no basis in reality. Many, many people are running into mistakes and failures because their ideas of what business life is are radically different from how it actually is and they form an over reliance on extremely unreliable structures. And those mistakes have their cost because people often blame themselves, when in reality they are subject to a system that is outside of their control.  Realizing that opens up many different options and success, and then your failures will really count for something. But if you are not attuned to what is going on, then you are just going to end up blaming the economy, and that is quite stupid because there are no real sound economic reasons why the economy should be this bad. The economy is built to fail at this point and the damage that is occurring to people is measured around 9 trillion dollars, as far as the housing crisis was concerned. That is a mistake or failure, but that comes from honest people trusting in the system. They weren't doing anything wrong, it's just that they weren't looking out for themselves and the people at the top aren't looking out for them either - actually the only thing you can expect from the bankers, etc, is that they will use every opportunity to put it to you. So you really have to protect yourself or you will fail and for absolutely no good reason, especially since you don't need to fail to learn these lessons. Save your time, money, energy, and will to live by educating yourself with a couple of books or even a couple of hours on youtube."

I'm not going to get into alcohol because there is a plethora of information available if you want to take the work involved to look into it, but as for coffee I would say that there is a long term negative consequence from having your muscles so tense all of the time. Tense muscles are related with a mind that cannot settle, the more you can relax your muscles then the more clearly and relaxed your thought process is.   I say coffee could help perhaps in the morning, if you are like me you are just so tired and physically obliterated every day when you wake up. But to continue drinking it through the day is just going to make you tense and even induce some crashes. That alone is enough to cause you to ask why you are having problems with your energy levels and may induce a depression as an offshoot of that, because if you're too tired to do anything then you are missing goals and that's causing problems in your life.  Even then you might want to question even drinking it in the morning. Because that is when you're most naturally relaxed and calm because your muscles completely relax all night. Maybe it is not healthy to just go from completely relaxed to completely stressed and tense at the start of every day."

If I'm killing it all week, Friday would be open to retire early, usually around 2-3pm.  I plan my week out on Sunday, booking my time solid with a technique similar to this . So there's a push to get things wrapped up before the weekend, and if I manage to pull it all off say by Friday morning, the reward is an early weekend start.

If ur manager is down with a 6 hour workday plan though I'd be really surprised.

I've had very flexible time at all of my jobs. It's nice to decide how I work my 40 hours every week.  Anyway, I should start my saying I'm hourly. Some of my coworkers are salaried, and I'm sure they would view this differently, but I'm hourly. This is nice because my hours are directly tied to what our clients need. I've worked close to 80 hours  (including travel/flight time). Sure, this has less to do with productivity and more to do with earning good overtime hours.  I absolutely love what I do. I love coming in, meeting with clients, facing new challenges, and ensuring I put the highest quality in my work.  It seems to me that the younger generations don't work as long as the older. In my experience, older people have become accustomed to putting in eight hours a day and heading home. Most wake up extremely early to make this happen. Personally, I generally work more of a 9 hour workday starting later (around 9) and getting every other Friday off. Since I love my job, I do not feel like it negatively impacts my work. I have the choice to work an extra hour so it doesn't bother me. I am also a big fan of the Pomodoro Technique. This means I take lots of small breaks throughout the day (even just timing bathroom breaks and refilling my water bottle when I feel stuck on a problem).  Just my $0.02. I would like to work 6 hours if I had kids waiting at home, but for now I see no reason why I would want to work less."

I felt like I got more from the first two chapters of this book than I have a years worth of reading blog posts.
productivity,3c43v1,themantucket,2,Sat Jul 4 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"The depth that books (not all some are fillers) go into most of the time is extremely valuable, in which the detail they go into in establishing context, and diving into the micro level of a topic is extremely helpful. Most articles will provide the main overall point without the depth that usually aids in better understanding that also includes multiple examples that books also provide."
productivity,3c43v1,cannabisgrower,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:12:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your posting. I think I will consider reading a bit more. I need to study for college and I find that some of these textbooks burn me out and I haven't been able to learn about topics I really care about like running, productivity (no pun intended), or even something crazy like the science behind the human brain!"
productivity,3c43v1,intothemysterious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:51:23 2015 UTC,I also highly suggest listening to audio books while you're driving or even when just going for a jog or something. Choosing to listen to audio books instead of music will give you that extra time for books you might not be able to find.
productivity,3c4xdl,nahamed,3,Sat Jul 4 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! It will. Specifically running has been shown to relieve depression and increase mental alertness. However, anaerobic exercise is great as well! Just going off the cuff here, weight lifting requires consistency and persistence if you want to build muscle. And that's something that is super useful in all industries. Consistentcy and continuous stable motivation to conquer goals, extrinsic or not. Good article, but I though they needed  science proof or case studies."
productivity,3c4xdl,intothemysterious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fact about weightlifting. I think anything in life needs consistency and repetition, otherwise your skill becomes stale. Thanks for the feedback."

productivity,3bzhoc,Blueaugustine,2,Sat Jul 4 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"Most of the time after reading a book I try to relate it with real life situations, try to relate some characters of books with my friends & Family members which help me to remember."

It'd be really nice if I could queue courses. I don't like having to go in every ten days and scroll through the list and try to remember which ones I've already done.

Something like this happened to me today, as a matter of fact. I spent all day, from nine in the morning to about three this afternoon, bashing my head against my computer trying to finish a small project for a training course I'm taking with wholly inadequate software and very little experience using it, without access to the instructor (today). I got to the point where I just had to finish the final layout, but kept screwing it up, and had to keep starting over again. Finally I just gave up and emailed her to tell her I was going to take a mulligan on this one.  Then I took a nap- I had intended twenty minutes, but ended up sleeping for ninety. I woke up somehow knowing how to do it. I immediately emailed her again, told her to forget everything I said, finished it in another ninety minutes, and sent it off. Done.  Sleep helps."
