civcirclejerk,3ax5uo,Crazywackymeme,10,Wed Jun 24 05:31:14 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, story time!  Isabella sighed as she looked over the round table hosting the world leaders. She had no real point in being there as Natural Heritage Sites had already passed with flying colors. The heat of the midday sun made her mind wander and when her mind wandered her eyes were sure to follow.  Natural wonders were her thing but she'd sent her explorer's out to the four corners of the globe and she'd found and settled them all. She needed more.  Her gaze fell over the Polynesian leader to her immediate left and Kamehameha's bronzed chest gleamed under the midday sun. His muscles rippled as he leaned over the table, listening intently to whatever was being discussed. The tease was always showing just enough skin to make her wonder what was really hiding behind that orange crotch flap. A natural wonder indeed, she thought as she bit her lip.  To her right was William in his ridiculous pants. Tall, though and a good jaw line. Not quite as an impressive physical specimen as Kamehameha but she was bored and suddenly feeling flushed. She leaned over and whispered into the Dutchmen's ear, ""I've got a polder I need you to inspect.""  As she spoke, her left hand settled on Kamehameha's lap and immediately she felt a swelling there. Sight unseen she could tell her imagination hadn't been incorrect at all; a powerful island empire wasn't all the Polynesian had been endowed with.   With a quick motion William's hand found its way through her skirts and down to her spot. She suppressed a moan when his fingers found their target. Her hand moved into the crevice between Kamehameha's thighs and found the firm thing waiting for her there. Her fingers played along the shaft as William stroked gently between her labia.  And it spread. Soon enough Kamehameha's left hand had disappeared into Maria Theresa's bodice and the old bat's eyes were rolling heavenwards. How long. . .she gasped as William hit a sweet spot. . .had it been since the elderly Austrian woman had had a specimen like Kamehameha?   The first time Isabella came was when she glanced across the table to see Alexander's mop of curls working fervently in Gandhi's lap. The Indian's head was tilted back and his face was a mask of ecstasy. To his left Boudicca squirmed in her tartan, begging for Ghandi to back his words with his nuclear weapon.  Boudicca was probably the only one wild enough to handle the Khan and on his left was Elizabeth, legs propped up on the table beseeching either Genghis or Shaka to use more than their hands.  Isabella lost count of the orgasms eventually. Soon she lost count of partners, too. Catherine's pale skin moving beneath her as Shaka moved above her. Bluetooth drilling every hole he could find in Alexander. Kamehameha and Nebuchadnezzar filling either end of Wu Zetian. Boudicca sitting astride her as Ghandi filled her again and again.   After is was over, they went back to work and all of them agreed to not ban salt."

The AI also often likes to go piety which nets them a super fast religion as well, depending on their flavour. (I'm assuming you're already aware of the typical scout>scout>shrine opener)  You can sometimes try something like a scout scout shrine scout or scout scout scout shrine build and pray religious CS are near you, which is probably your best bet sometimes. Even deity AI are shit poor at scouting so you can occasionally meet weirdly placed religious CS first and snag a decent panth that way.  On Emperor (and higher SOMETIMES) you can rush Stonehenge most of the time, but requires at least a half-decent start and non-aggressive neighbours next to you.

I use God-King to get a boost in faith even if I don't have any faith-generating tiles around, or missed out on the pantheon that would have used my faith-generating tiles (grr, starting on desert as Morocco but not getting Desert Folklore ... I did snipe Petra though, so HAH)."

Even if you do manage to get a desent religion going, you can be sure that someone (or more than one) in the neighbourhood eventually will undermine your religion with missionaries, prophets and general pressure from their tons of cities. I often get more frustations equipped with a good religion, because it will not be that useful as hoped for. I struggle on deity anyway, so better players might manage to work it better."
civcirclejerk,387hlz,War-donkey,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah one thing that is super annoying is the whole mechanics for the chance at a Great Prophet.  Recently I ran a casual game on Emperor as Shaka (""I don't always warmonger, but when I do, I do it with Impis"") Despite a decent faith-generating start (Incense) my first Great Prophet was eight turns overdue.  In a game with both Ethiopia and Byzantium I still managed to be the second one to a pantheon and the second one to be eligible for a religion ... but founded the fifth frickin' religion.  Thank $deity the AI is allergic to Tithe, at least I got that.  My enhancer GP was way overdue too, though I don't remember how long.  Definitely long enough that I didn't get any of the beliefs I normally go for.  Then Portugal and Byzantium went missionary-happy.  I took great pleasure in seeing my allied city-states capture them and then make then wander aimlessly in their enclave.  Or capturing them back from barbarians and deleting them next turn."

No one liked Beyond Earth, so there's no new content there, which kinda just leaves dank starts, salty polders, and nuked by Gandhi posts.   The other thing you could do is bring a discussion about the dank start posts here.  Maybe you could bring up an important discussion and change the course of the subreddit.

To simulate the fact that historically, India did not have polders, Gandie was given a 1. However, adopting a Democratic government further reduced the probability of building polders by 2 (to simulate the fact that polders were monarchist propaganda). This would have placed Gandie at -1, but because the system couldn't handle negative numbers, it instead looped him around to 255, the maximum. This led to Civ players being very confused when, as soon as Gandie adopted Democracy, he would immediately begin converting the entire world into polders."

It is useful in conferring a degree of protection to practitioners outside the radius of the nuclear fireball but still within sufficient range that by standing upright death or serious injury is certain. As a countermeasure to the lethal effects of nuclear explosions, it is effective in the event of both a surprise nuclear attack, which might come at any time without warning,  and in the more likely event of sufficient warning of a few seconds to minutes being given, but not enough advance notice to permit an effective evacuation.

Here are the main points:   This game is almost a complete abstraction. It is literally spreadsheet after spreadsheet.   2.You have memorize literally hundreds of icons. All these spreadsheets are almost completely without text, as they rely on icons to give significance to the numbers.   The spreadsheets are not set up so that the relationships between the data points are clear. And the overall meaning of each spreadsheet isn't summarized anywhere. The tutorial is trivial. I did the entire tutorial, and learned about 5% of the game. There's no obvious way to learn the rest of it. There is no manual...except on Steam. Because of Steam's many problems, this makes the manual functionally unavailable. So prepare to spreads LOTS of time scrolling through forums trying to get simple questions answered. I bought the game on Amazon, and then found all I really had was a game key I had to redeem on Steam. Steam, as many gamers will attest, is a buggy mass of problems. I specifically bought this from Amazon because I didn't want to go anywhere near Steam after my last experience with it, but now I'm stuck with it.   Once again, I'm saddened to write this. My suggestion, save yourself $50 and 30-50 frustrating hours trying to figure this thing out and look elsewhere for your next game."

He also said the Jews should have killed themselves en masse to ""prove"" how bad the policies of Nazi Germany were (but also spoke fondly of Hitler) and was an unabashed racist and proponent of segregation. He was actually a fucking asshole.   We here in America are quick to scrutinize our own historical figures and demonize them for their slave ownership and for being rich and white (and as well we should), but when it comes to non-white historical figures...well you're not really allowed to dog on them, even when they absolutely deserve it."

They are typically made of glass for chemical inertness; and in modern days, they are usually made of heat-resistant borosilicate glass. There is at least one tubular section known as the neck with an opening at the tip. Two or three-necked flasks are common as well. Round bottom flasks come in many sizes, from 5 mL to 20 L, with the sizes usually inscribed on the glass. In pilot plants even larger flasks are encountered.
