If you were your own boss, would you actively lower your income and put your business at stake just because patriarchy?   The wage gap is a myth made by some dishonest or simply stupid feminists.   The 77 cents for every dollar earned is actually true. But only if you compare all the women with all the men regardless of industry.   Since more men than women study in a stem field, more men than women become engineers etc.   So over all men earn more.   However, female and male engineers make roughly the same."

The .77 cents to the $1 is only if you factor in men vs women, nothing else. When applying position, experience, education, etc, that difference virtually disappears. Maybe if you stopped being a women's studies major you might not make less than an engineer?  On top of that, you'd think if women really cared about equality, then it doesn't matter if its a small fraction, it should be represented equally.

In 2014, ESPN‚Äôs SportsCenter dedicated 2 percent of its on-air time to covering women‚Äôs sports, according to a study published this week in the journal Communication & Sport.

Seriously, ESPN barely even touches hockey, and even the worst teams (based on attendance) draw on average 10k fans.

facebookwins,3co5f9,juancho393,30,Thu Jul 9 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"FIFA is a worldwide organization. The fact that Americans watched it doesn't mean anything when comparing the sheer number of viewers worldwide.   Plus this was one game that Americans watch every 4 years. If you compared the cumulative viewers of 4 years of NBA finals or Stanley Cup vs 4 years of women's soccer it wouldn't be close. And what if team USA hadn't made the final? Then what? your point would be meaningless if it were China vs Japan because not even the few Americans that watched would have tuned in.   The bottom line is, just like the Olympics, the women's World Cup is a novelty. We only pay attention every four years, their professional careers are almost nonexistent and the only reason Americans watch is because we have one of the best teams.   How could anyone possibly compare a sport that generates little to no revenue to the NBA or the NHL? And why would anyone expect to pay one group that generates nothing the same as a group that generates billions? Just because their women? Now that's fucking sexist."

They don't make a conclusion wrong; they just show that premises may be untrue. They don't invalidate an argument; their presence merely means that the argument is unsound (not irrefutable).   If you can't argue against it by any other means but pointing out fallacies, then you're not refuting the argument in any way. It's like pointing out that a movie wasn't acclaimed by critics when it still made over a billion dollars; the 'authority' on movies says it's bad, while it still is shown to be good by other evidence. It doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong, just that the premises could use some polishing.  Btw, if you're pointing out fallacies in the OP, straw man probably isn't the one to go for. The straw man requires an initial argument to have been presented for him to misinterpret.  And if you don't understand any of the above, then maybe you should go and learn some logic before you spout the names of fallacies that you learnt from neckbeards on reddit.

It's been a long time since I have seen an unabridged performance (and honestly that play generally infuriates me because everybody is being stupid - so I am especially curious about angles I missed).
facebookwins,3ccgcm,MamaDaddy,11,Tue Jul 7 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"OK, so Paris goes to Juliet's tomb to mourn her death, while there his servant warns him that someone is coming (Romeo) so he hides.  PARIS (scatters flowers at¬†JULIET'S¬†closed tomb) ""Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew‚Äî O woe! Thy canopy is dust and stones‚Äî Which with sweet water nightly I will dew. Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans, The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.""  PAGE¬†whistles  ""The boy gives warning something doth approach. What curs√®d foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love‚Äôs rite? What with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.""  Remember Paris believes, like everybody else, that Juliet took her life because she was mourning Tibalt so in his mind Romeo indirectly murdered Juliet when he killed Tibalt. In addition to this he believes that Romeo must hate the Capulets so much that he has come to define the tomb:  PARIS (aside)¬†""This is that banished haughty Montague, That murdered my love‚Äôs cousin, with which grief, It is supposed the fair creature died. And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. (to¬†ROMEO)¬†Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague! Can vengeance be pursued further than death? Condemn√®d villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey and go with me, for thou must die.""  Romeo begs him to just leave but is eventually forced to kill him on the steps of the tomb. With his last breath he asks to be laid next to Juliet in the tomb:  PARIS (falls)¬†""Oh, I am slain! If thou be merciful, Open the tomb. Lay me with Juliet.""  And Romeo, being a good egg, agrees.  Here's the rub though, poor old Paris isn't a villain, he was introduce to Juliet as a suitor and fell madly in love with her. He only confronted Romeo as a defender and was cut down for it, even Romeo doubts his own motives:  ROMEO ""In faith, I will.‚ÄîLet me peruse this face. Mercutio‚Äôs kinsman, noble County Paris. What said my man, when my betoss√®d soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so?‚ÄîO, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune‚Äôs book. I‚Äôll bury thee in a triumphant grave.""  And all of this comes before one of the most tragic moments in theatre history, on top of that once the moment has passed all the town watch and family's turn up causing chaos. This as a whole spoils the tender ending to a love story.  (All copy-pasta comes from sparknotes.com and can be found here:  http://nfs.sparknotes.com/romeojuliet/)"

facebookwins,3c63rr,Hidanas,4,Sun Jul 5 07:17:05 2015 UTC,I question the wisdom of a boss telling an employee to bring his ass in to work on FB.  Somehow that seems like a really bad move.  That and writing down on FB that he's going to write him up or that he has to bring in a Doctor's note.  Seems like HR would have a field day with this one.

If a pool of enough employees existed, then it'd be much easier to find somebody to take hours--I'm sure somebody could use them if you have employed the appropriate number, and not just the bare minimum. Unfortunately profit margins are more important that an employee's quality of life to most of those types. What they see is that factories have produced a certain number of goods and their goal is to sell them all before they are replaced by newer models or whatever.   It's nice to know somebody gives a fuck about employees. If more people were reasonable, I'm sure people would be more inclined to work that much harder too."

We went with someone much more experienced around 2500 and the photos were amazing.

facebookwins,3bfd26,jedrekk,7,Mon Jun 29 05:43:12 2015 UTC,"Wedding photography is a pretty specialized gig.  People complain about the price, but look at it this way: You're hiring 2-3 people to work for you for a day (if your photog doesn't have an assistant, find a new photog) + the time they spend meeting with you beforehand + the post-processing they do of your images afterwards + prints. They usually have $15-30k of equipment. They can shoot weddings 3-4 months a year, about 4 days a month tops, because that's how long wedding season is in most of the US and Europe. Outside of the south, almost nobody gets married outside of the summer. And everybody gets married on a saturday.  The reason wedding photographers can charge the money they do is because they're worth it. I have never heard of anybody going cheap on wedding photography and not regretting it down the line. Serve fried chicken instead of veal and salmon, but don't cheap out on the photographer."

Whether you agree or disagree with how the costumer views marriage you have to admit he was not belligerent or insulting.  The owner of course has 100% the right to respond the way he did and if they signed a contract with a non-refundable retainer then legally the owner is all clear.   It just comes across as a it insulting and unprofessional.   As a customer who tries not to let the politics of the owner affect my purchasing power I would  avoid his/her business only because of how he handles costumers they disgree with
facebookwins,3bfd26,DesolationRow,15,Mon Jun 29 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's very insulting to ask for your money back from a business because they don't discriminate, even if they do it in a polite way."
facebookwins,3bfd26,whitedynamite81,-7,Mon Jun 29 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"I can understand that...but ultimately where a consumer spends their money is up to them.  And to this person this particular issues is a deal breaker.  We don't know if they are a Westboro ""God hates fag"" sign waving monster or a person of religious conviction that feels marriage is a Christian tradition that has been high-jacked by the government and is now being changed on them.   And really regardless of any of those issues a business and a business owner should be above reproach and never sink to the consumer level. I've been taught and practice that the consumer is the one who pays my bills and only in the most extreme me situations do I not showed them respect..even when I tell them I can't give them their money back"
facebookwins,3bfd26,DesolationRow,7,Mon Jun 29 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"To me it doesn't matter what part of the spectrum their discrimination is on, they still want people treated differently when it literally has no affect on their own life. Don't confuse this we me saying they don't have a right to believe what they want, but they don't have a right to force other people to live their lives by what they believe, which is exactly what people against gay marriage want. They want to be abel to tell someone else what they can and can't do even though it has absolutely zero affect on their own lives. Sorry i've just never heard an argument against gay marriage that made sense for this country of the free we live in, considering no one is forcing churches to preform gay marriage.   Now for a business owner being above reproach, yes I think that's a good goal to have. I also think he can run his business how he wants, and I think pointing out how ridiculous there stance is great, and part of the reason the country has moved so far in the last few years is we have started calling bigots out on their bigotry."
facebookwins,3bfd26,Angelwind76,-5,Mon Jun 29 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"The best argument I have heard for legality of the ""Christian"" form of marriage that the government has endorsed is that it gives a legal foothold to put pressure on Christians and church organizations.  If this situation were flipped and it were a Christian photography company we all would expect them to do homosexual weddings and now legally they are held accountable."
facebookwins,3bfd26,DesolationRow,5,Mon Jun 29 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand that argument at all.  No one can be forced to do weddings or anything outside their beliefs.  Stores can refuse service to anyone for any reason, as is their right.  No one sues McDonalds because they refuse to sell some rude customer a cheeseburger.  No one can sue a church because they won't hold a same-sex wedding there.  Besides, why would you want to force someone to do something they don't want to do when there's more options out there to find people who will give you the services you want?  Seems silly to me."
facebookwins,3bfd26,Angelwind76,-2,Mon Jun 29 18:26:27 2015 UTC,Actually there are several situations where homosexual couples have sued Christian run family Business because they won't do a gay wedding or put pro-gay marriage messages on cake.
facebookwins,3bfd26,DesolationRow,2,Mon Jun 29 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"But did they win?  Did they have contracts signed beforehand?  You can sue anyone in this country for anything, but I'm not familiar with the outcome of those cases and if they succeeded or not."
facebookwins,3bfd26,Angelwind76,-4,Mon Jun 29 19:32:11 2015 UTC,They did win and the business had to comply as well as pay large legal fees
facebookwins,3bfd26,whitedynamite81,4,Mon Jun 29 23:42:34 2015 UTC,"So I did some research on the cases and found two cases and this is why they are different but correct:  1) The bakery that got sued broke the law, discriminating against the couple wanting the cake in defiance of the pubic accommodation laws that say businesses are not allowed to discriminate.  I found the awards to be a bit excessive to the point of killing the business, but they broke the law by refusing service based on discrimination.  2) A bakery in Denver refused to put an anti-gay saying on a cake, the man sued for discrimination.  He did not win because the bakery did not discriminate against him.  The difference here is because she still offered to make the cake for him, and then offered the use of her frosting for him to write the anti-gay message on his cake.  As she was still willing to provide the service, she was not discriminating.    So there's your answer.  Offer your services to the best that you are comfortable, and it will be up to the customer to refuse the service, and you can't be sued for discrimination.  I didn't know about public accommodation laws until now, so that's good to know.  I looked to see if there were any other cases like this.  I found one other in Ireland, that has similar public accommodation laws.  So I don't see a rash of bakeries going out of business because people aren't getting their cakes."
facebookwins,3bfd26,Angelwind76,4,Tue Jun 30 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"So the argument is that if we allow gay marriage to be recognized by the state, then one day we may be forced to do gay marriages in church, even though no one is trying to force that and religions have always been allowed special exemptions, so therefore no gay person can get married anywhere. That best argument is still trying to force ones beliefs on someone else. Still haven't heard a good argument against gay marriage. Religious organizations are allowed certain exemptions, public business are not."
facebookwins,3bfd26,Angelwind76,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"Where are public businesses not allowed to exempt?  Should I sue all the gas stations that say ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service"" because they're being discriminatory against my Hobbit feet?  No, that's their right.  Now if you're talking about employment, that's a different issue altogether and its own can of worms."
facebookwins,3bfd26,whitedynamite81,-2,Mon Jun 29 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Good, I was hoping I wasn't the only one seeing this.  Legalities aside, if the retainer is non-refundable, fine, you're in the clear.  But even as horrible as customers can be, never let yourself get that low.  Obviously that $1500 didn't hurt the photographer enough that they could afford to give it away to a charity.    And we don't know their backstory.  Weddings are really expensive (if that's what you want), and they could have been saving for years to finally have one.  They are entitled to their opinion, as all customers are, but if they didn't care that much about the money, they should have at least engaged the customer and show professionalism on their part.  Otherwise this just comes off as kind of a petty f-you, just because."
facebookwins,3bfd26,DesolationRow,2,Mon Jun 29 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"well not just because. Because they want to force their beliefs on others. They have a right to not like gay marriage, they don't have right to tell other people what to do with their lives."

Now, I could be the one in the wrong here, and I am not at all implying that you're homophobic, I'm just saying that homophobia is still considered to be less unacceptable than racism or antisemitism, so people can get funny around it."
facebookwins,3bfd26,JilaX,-3,Mon Jun 29 16:45:39 2015 UTC,We have no idea if this person is homophobic (which is a irrational fear of homosexual people)  there is no text supporting they fear or even hate homosexuals.   What we do know is they have an idea and believe of marriage that they want to keep and this business is counter to that.  They may have lots of gay friends or not care if a person is gay.    The point is we don't know and of the only information the photographer has is the same information we have then it was pretty low and unprofessional of him to respond in that manner.   I think it's important we don't water down the word homophobia (which is a very real and dangerous problem) with the idea that just because you want to keep marriage the same way it's been for their whole life.

facebookwins,3ae6ph,thewhackcat,13,Fri Jun 19 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"I actually Googled the etymology of the word ""wool"" a few weeks ago. I was actually bloody fascinated...probably typical wool behaviour but here we go.  When Liverpool used to be the major sea port for Europe from South America, foreign sailors used to come over and export wool. When they took the bags of wool off the boats, the wool strands would cover their clothes so Scousers used to see them around town and know they weren't from Liverpool because they were ""a wool.""  Am I the only person that thinks that's interesting?"

And a lot of times someone even mentions transgender people I see either otherkin or the ""I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter"" meme jokes (at least on the internet).   One or two days ago I saw a post on /r/nottheunion about that ""transracial"" woman and the top comment was along the lines of ""Is there really a difference between claiming you are transgender and claiming you are transracial.""   Sorry for the rant that's only slightly related to your question.

facebookwins,37x08c,Mandylost,8,Sun May 31 02:38:45 2015 UTC,That story sounds like bullshit. The cost for fuel would lose airline 10s of thousands of dollars with only one passenger.
facebookwins,37x08c,Xanthillium,2,Sun May 31 23:53:23 2015 UTC,"Hold up. Former airline pilot here. It's actually possible I was the pilot for that flight. Was it out of DC going to Newark? Here is the true backstory:  A few years ago bad weather along the east coast was causing huge delays. The weather at Reagan was okay, but New York was terrible, so our company ended up with three jets on the ground at all three of our gates. None of the flights were full, so when the flights started leaving (3+hrs delayed), they filled up the first flight, then the second flight with all of the passengers at the gate. That left my little jet with no passengers.   We were just getting ready to fly empty back to EWR when this guy comes running down the terminal. He is PISSED. I intercept him and he tells me all about how United's system has been dicking him around with different delays, and how he didn't want to show up at the airport only to wait for hours.   So after he calmed down a second I asked him how he'd feel about taking his own private jet (essentially) back to Newark? He brightened up pretty quickly.   Long story short, we had a blast with the guy on the intercom, and though I don't remember any Metallica being played, I'm sure the flight attendant had fun with him too. He was a super happy camper by the end.   This probably happens more often than you would think, and I doubt this was actually my flight (it was a while ago), though it's the right type of plane judging by the seat layout.   Anyway, if anyone has questions feel free to ask, but this is definitely plausible."
facebookwins,37x08c,drrhythm2,2,Thu Jun 4 15:17:01 2015 UTC,Even if this is fake. Airlines pay the airport for that time slot to fly. Its use it or lose it. Cheaper to waste fuel than to lose a revenue making flight slot.
facebookwins,37x08c,GMBaldassarre,2,Tue Jun 2 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"Also the regional airlines are flying these routes on contract from the Major carrier, so it doesn't matter how full or empty they are. Selling tickets is up to Delta / United / American, not the regional airline. Also, the plane needs to be in the right place for the next leg."

The airline that flies here has us as the absolute last stop on the flight schedule and I have been alone or with 1 or 2 other passengers many times and the flight attendant still does the safety speech in english AND french. so again a million times bullshit.

facebookwins,37bfk8,Isai76,30,Tue May 26 11:44:55 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand why people seem to think that television is automatically the worst thing ever and is constantly ruining American minds, as if television can't be every bit as intellectual and artistic as literature. According to some of these people, reading Fifty Shades of Gray is better than watching Twin Peaks or True Detective or what have you."
facebookwins,37bfk8,EcoleBuissonniere,10,Tue May 26 12:28:57 2015 UTC,"That's actually what kind of bothered me about Star Trek. Basically they suggest that human beings became our best selves and threw away things like television, instead focusing on more sophisticated pursuits such as reading, art, and blind cage fighting.   Never understood how a television show could actually push forward the idea that television and movies are not art."
facebookwins,37bfk8,SpikeRosered,2,Tue May 26 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought film went the way of the dodo because they had interactive holo-technology. Why sit and watch when you can actively participate? Enterprise (set before The Original Series) had movie nights on the ship but they mostly watched old cult films. I don't think Earth had holo technology then so it was weird to me that there weren't new movies or tv shows. Maybe that was the beginning of the end of people's appetite for film? I would've liked to see it still be as popular but hey it was a creative choice.   Personally, I'd be one of those people who made a comfy chair and let the holodeck/suite run the program around me for a lazy man's 3-D dream come true."

You should donate money to Ben Carson's presidential campaign and elect him president! Valve sucks and the Gaben sucks and Half-Life 3 will never come out! Michael Bay is an amazing director and should've won several Oscars! Kim Kardashian is attractive! Justin Bieber is a great musician! Porn is immoral and evil and you should stop jerking off immediately because that's what the Bible says! /r/TheRedPill are a bunch of entitled manchildren! Diet and exercise is the only thing that will make you non-fat and obese people should just accept that! The Baltimore and Ferguson protesters were just shiftless, criminal thugs who needed an excuse to loot stuff! Tumblr is full of insightful and intelligent social commentary and legitimate forms of political expression! Fedoras are an attractive fashion statement! Crossfit is a good way to lose weight and get in shape! Raising the minimum wage will only benefit the lazy people who are already poor and deserve to have low-paying jobs! Transgender people have a mental illness and shouldn't be encouraged!   C'mon, people, don't disappoint me! Let's see if we can make it all the way up to -100! We can do this!"

I think I know why it's hard to find ice cream trucks anymore and it's because it's expensive for the driver.   The ""company"" he worked for The drivers pay to use the truck, pay for the ice cream, pay for their gas, and then when it's all said and done you pay the company a cut of your profit on top of everything else. So you end up giving them like 70% of what you make. That's why ice cream off of the ice cream truck is so expensive and hard to find them anymore."

facebookwins,3664kx,Euan_whos_army,-47,Sat May 16 20:58:00 2015 UTC,"This is bringing back horrible memories of arguing with bus drivers. I smoked when I was 15 and they always cited that as their reason for not giving me a child fare. My argument was always that it doesn't matter what I'm doing, I'm still 15 and they can't charge me an adult fare.  Absolute cunts the lot of them."
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,94,Sat May 16 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"If ye want to act like an adult, ya can fookin well pay for an adult ticket ya wee shit"

facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,1 point,Sat May 16 18:02:18 2015 UTC,Now could you legally smoke at the time?
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,4,Sun May 17 09:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. It was illegal to buy them, not to smoke them."
facebookwins,3664kx,officerthegeek,-5,Sat May 16 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"You're the cunt tbh. If you choose to use the privileges available only to adults, you shouldn't expect to be able to use the privileges specifically not available to adults."
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,-1,Sun May 17 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous way of looking at things. You don't become an adult by doing something restricted just to adults and you shouldn't be treated like one.  Child fares are 4-15 years of age and what I was doing in my personal life doesn't effect that rule. It's not up to the bus driver to make a judgement call based on an individual. If I can prove I'm fifteen then it's totally out of his hands.  Also bear in mind that when I was 15 years old the smoking age was 16 to buy them, and smoking was a lot more accepted than it is now. People could smoke in shopping centres, restaurants, pubs and no-one would bat an eyelid.  The point is that the bus drivers were being deliberately antagonistic with no reason."
facebookwins,3664kx,officerthegeek,-2,Sun May 17 09:08:59 2015 UTC,The smoking age was 16   Why should others obey the rules for you when you don't obey them yourself?
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,3,Sun May 17 09:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's his job. My smoking didn't effect him in any way.   You don't get to change the rules based on what others are doing, you just do your job."
facebookwins,3664kx,officerthegeek,-4,Sun May 17 09:29:02 2015 UTC,It does affect him you smelly fuck.  Here's the thing - you're not doing your job by following the rules. Why don't you do your job before expecting anyone else to? You're like a criminal who was sentenced to a month in jail who's complaining that the government is oppressing him. You did something wrong - expect consequences.   What was the difference between the child fare and the adult fare anyways?
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,3,Sun May 17 09:31:51 2015 UTC,It's not illegal for a fifteen year old to smoke and it was not my job not to smoke. He was getting paid to be a bus driver and enforce the rules of travelling on it.   How does it effect him?
facebookwins,3664kx,officerthegeek,-4,Sun May 17 09:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's not illegal, yet the smoking age is 16?  ""It does affect him you smelly fuck""  Honestly, from this exchange, seems like you're a way bigger cunt than any Glaswegian bus driver could be."
facebookwins,3664kx,Elliot850,2,Sun May 17 09:42:05 2015 UTC,"You can believe that if you want, but I'm just trying to put my point across without resorting to calling people smelly cunts. Personally I think if the point you're trying to make centres around insulting the other person then you're probably not making a good point.  It's not illegal to smoke at 15. It's illegal to buy them. Never would a 15 year old get stopped in the street and told to stop smoking because of their age.  I'd really love to know how it effects the bus driver."
facebookwins,3664kx,officerthegeek,-2,Sun May 17 09:45:46 2015 UTC,"Read that insult again. Is it an insult, or is it an insult alongside the reason the bus driver wouldn't like you in his bus?  Also, however much you want to disagree with this, smoking is an adult thing. If you want to do adult things, do all adult things. You don't get to choose (and when you try to and fail, you don't get to call everyone else a cunt)."
facebookwins,3664kx,Rye631,-16,Sun May 17 09:50:09 2015 UTC,Why does the bus driver care what price he pays? Do they get some sort of commission? Do they just hate everybody or trying to teach a kid?

I made an email specifically for people to send pictures to so that we could consolidate them well.  I posted it on the page.  I added it to my accounts in Mail.  I get multiple emails from scammers and spammers a week and sometimes reply to them if I'm bored.  Their stories don't really go very deep.

I honestly never thought this stuff was real before, because I'd gotten those infamous emails and replied like I was legit going to send money but never heard from the scammer again.  I was selling this motorized rolling chair for $1500 on craigslist and was contacted by this middle eastern guy who wanted to buy it, but also wanted to send over an additional $2000 to give to a moving company who would be delivering the chair somewhere. I knew it was fishy and kept telling the guy to reconsider but I was making $1500 off it so whatever... It didn't help that he said his name was Timmy-John, his 2 email addresses had different ""user-friendly"" names attached, and a 3rd grader would kick his ass in the English language.  He sent over a cashier's check for the full amount and immediately started messaging and emailing me 10+ times a day about urgency and time sensitivity. The bank couldn't verify the funds for 2 weeks but eventually it went through (surprised the hell out of me). When I found out the company I was to send the money to didn't exist, the supposed recipient's name changed twice... eventually I just put the money aside and said the delivery people were welcome to contact me any time. The guy eventually stopped contacting me altogether.  Sorry so long, it was just the way the guy tried to continually use my name to 'engage' me and was in such a rush so as to not let me take any time to reconsider helping him, it immediately popped into my head when I read this post."

It reminds me of those bots/idiots that msg you saying they wanna cyber sex you up and eventually try to get you to click some link to buy a cam site subscription (yes, I play along out of boredom and curiosity). They'll say their name is Andrea or something, their IM name says it's Nvidia Noob Saibot or something, send pictures of Angie Varona (always her for some reason), and link to a site run by ""Amanda"".

facebookwins,361rhg,fuyunoyoru,1 point,Fri May 15 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"I worked in a bank for a while and dealt with this all the time. Most of the times, they just pick an account for a business, use that routing number and account number, but put a different name on the check. So sadly, a lot of good, legitimate businesses get their accounts drained this way due to scams like these. Because fund are electronically processed now, nobody is manually checking if the name on the check matches that of the account holder."
facebookwins,361rhg,TheKeiron,1 point,Fri May 15 22:14:53 2015 UTC,Are you saying that someone can withdraw money from a business account only by using their account number? That's terrifying if so. Can the business get the transaction reversed once they determine its fraudulent?
facebookwins,361rhg,straigh,1 point,Sat May 16 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"Someone isn't able to just walk into an account and withdraw from a business account. But if someone has a fraudulent check that has that business account's account number and routing number and it makes it thru without it being stopped, yes. Those individuals who turned in the check can be paid, since it was a good routing number + account number.   And often times, they recoup their losses due to having insurance for stuff like this. There are also ways to reverse the transaction, yes. But then it gets messy because you're messing with other accounts in addition to the business accounts. And not just those accounts of the scammers, but SOME innocent people who have no idea it's a fraudulent check. Because a lot of times, a lot of older and younger people receive these checks and assume it's good. And they cash it. And they get paid, not realizing it's dirty money, essentially."
facebookwins,361rhg,shalene,1 point,Sun May 17 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, interesting. It seems like it'd be an issue specific to cheques as you wouldn't be able to achieve the same thing through electronic transfer without access to the account, right?   I'm surprised how prevalent cheques are in the US. I'm an Australian living in the USA and need to pay my rent via check every month.  Back in Australia, usage of cheques is very very rare."
facebookwins,361rhg,yvonneka,1 point,Sun May 17 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"Well. You SHOULDN'T be able to access this with electronic transfer. There is plenty of wire fraud out there, but they have much more stringent rules in order to send and receive wires, so it happens less frequently. And less on this type of level. But I have seen it happen before.  I actually witnessed someone hack into an online banking system, find users that had done external electronic transfers (because they had to set up security protocols) and then set up periodic electronic transfers to other accounts. And since people don't like to check their bank accounts every day, they didn't realize what had happened until their accounts had been drained. Hackers and scammers are getting far too smart.  I absolutely hate the usage of checks, and hate it even more after working in a bank. I would much rather pay everything electronically. Like you, I have to pay rent via a check each month. It's quite dumb."

My point would then be that actively suppressing ethnic minority immigrants is very different from establishing cultural standards in a free country, and expecting aspiring permanent citizens to meet those standards rather than established citizens be expected to change their entire culture to benefit the entitled few.  If it was wrong for European settlers to harm the culture of tribal natives through colonialism, the same principal should apply to new immigrants coming to the United States and Europe from countries suffering various forms of endemic violence and poverty.  If you're arguing against privilege across races and generations and nations, it should begin with giving up your own."

For a child, being hit for having done something wrong does not teach them any real world consequences of their actions, in fact, their brains are not even mature enough to get the link between the punishment and their actions (regardless of how much you say it to them), nor does it make them respect their parents in any way. If anything, treating the kid this was is just going to motivate them to continue doing it but just make sure the parents don't know what they are up to, rather than actually wanting to behave merely to make your parents proud. Respect is mutual. You cannot earn someones trust and respect without showing them trust and respect in return.   Edit: Sources as requested -  Spanking in Early Childhood and Later Behavior Problems: A Prospective Study of Infants and Young Toddlers, Slapping and spanking in childhood and its association with lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a general population sample, Spanking by Parents and Subsequent Antisocial Behavior of Children, Stress, maternal depression, and negative mother‚Äìinfant interactions in relation to infant attachment, Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: A meta-analytic and theoretical review.

facebookwins,35dcd6,JEesSs,11,Sat May 9 12:15:02 2015 UTC,I'm sorry your getting downvoted. Apparently personal anecdotes are totally better evidence than your list of actual scientific studies.
facebookwins,35dcd6,alias-of-a-girl,8,Sat May 9 18:03:33 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yes apparently.. I just don't understand why people cannot acknowledge that physical punishment can have negative consequences. It is so outdated.
facebookwins,35dcd6,JEesSs,6,Sat May 9 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was spanked as a child. I don't remember it very much, but I'm pretty sure you could count the number of times it happened on one hand, so that's probably better than it could have been. And yes, I turned out okay. But that doesn't mean it was good for me. My relationship with my parents is fine, but that doesn't mean it wasn't damaged in some way. The fact that people are going ""well I turned out okay"" is baffling to me - no one is suggesting that spankings automagically turn every child into serial killer.   But how do any of them know that, when they feel aggressive or antisocial, that's not at least partly encouraged by the physical punishment they experienced as a child? How on earth can they say for sure that they wouldn't be slightly less inclined to start a fight with that guy in the bar if their parents hadn't inadvertently taught them that violence is an acceptable response to anger?  Hell, I've been in a couple of car accidents, too, and I'm fine. Doesn't mean car accidents are inherently healthy, either."

facebookwins,35dcd6,Reverend_Twitch,5,Sat May 9 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what is fine. Humans are good at hiding their personal flaws and being hit/spanked as a child may affect you in more subtle ways.   My point is - they may appear like normal people but them being hit by their parents as a kid might have altered them in ways that they are not aware of, just because they are used to it.   Us humans are good at adapting and getting used to having various flaws. Once you get used to dealing with one you stop noticing it."
facebookwins,35dcd6,guy_from_sweden,2,Sun May 10 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. We do justify everything. Especially the things our parents do. I mean, think about it, admitting that your parents caused you physical harm that had negative effects on you is not an easy thing to do. Of course, the parents did not know better, hence why they did it, but still. That thought must be difficult for some."

And yeah, as previously cited research suggests, it appears to generally have pretty negative consequences. I also just found a thesis what children think about physical punishment, and it didnt have very positive results either."
facebookwins,35dcd6,JEesSs,-9,Sun May 10 08:14:47 2015 UTC,"My opinion may not be well received but I will have to disagree with you on this one. I'm from India, our culture includes parents having the right to spank their kids if they do stupid shit, and everyone I know have been hit by parents and even teachers. I think we all turned out well. I for one am glad I was spanked, sure it wasn't fun then but I don't do stupid shit now. Of course, you can only hit your kids to a limit, I know at certain point it becomes abuse. It entirely depends on the parents and their intentions."
facebookwins,35dcd6,xZebu,11,Sat May 9 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"But why would you be glad to have been spanked? To contrast I can say that I am from Sweden spanking your children is illegal (which goes for all other nordic countries too). I have never been spanked and I don't know anyone who has. We all turned out fine too, and so did the generations before us. Spanking is not necessary, and as the cited evidence indicates, it can have pretty bad effects on children.  You wouldn't solve arguments or try to assert your dominance using violence in any other setting, so why on earth should you do it on your children? Is it not better to tech them the real world consequences of their actions instead? I mean, say you had a child that was violent, for example. You are definitely not going to stop this child from being violent by using more violence towards them. Parents need to learn how to control their children by building good relationships with them instead."

Fact is, less white people (by % of population) are putting themselves in positions to be shot and killed by the police. Much of this is due to Socioeconomic factors, rather than outright racism of authorities, but it is most certainly the case. All this statistic shows is that white people, do in fact get killed by police too, trying to infer other points beyond that is absurd because there are too many factors to look at one piece of data."
facebookwins,35590x,ANumenorean,10,Thu May 7 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"Right. Poverty is over-represented in crime, and black people are over-represented in poverty.

To play, you must spot (i.e., see) an unknown dog (no pets, neighbors' pets or otherwise known dogs) and report that spot to the group. Photographs are entirely optional, so as not to discriminate against those without cameras.  Based on a series of rules, your spot is then given points. If the dog spots you spotting it, all points go to the dog. If the dog is acting violently, points are subtracted from your total. It's simple Dogspotting, guys ‚Äî get on board."

People tend to scan and thus the titles of links have a very short period to catch your attention enough to get you to click.  Thus clickbait titles are used.  Why does is work so well?  A lot of people don't care because they are on the internet looking for things to catch their interest.

facebookwins,32tb0y,prplmze,5,Fri Apr 17 02:24:55 2015 UTC,It says she awoke to her daughter's boyfriend having sex with her.  Meaning he was having sex with her before she woke up.
facebookwins,32tb0y,thegoldenone777,5,Fri Apr 17 02:36:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for pointing that out. I missed that paragraph. I has referring to where she stated she had sex with the 18 year old in the bathroom.
facebookwins,32tb0y,prplmze,-12,Fri Apr 17 03:07:24 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's only rape if it's non-consensual. If she was happy with waking up like than then it was fine."
facebookwins,32tb0y,innitgrand,8,Fri Apr 17 07:12:42 2015 UTC,You can't consent in your sleep.  That's rape.
facebookwins,32tb0y,thegoldenone777,-5,Fri Apr 17 08:18:30 2015 UTC,"If your girlfriend wakes you up with a blowjob, is that rape? No, not if you consent. If you wake up while she's doing it and you don't want it then yes it's rape. Consent needs to be given but it can be given beforehand or even after the fact. I know it's not a popular opinion but it's what I think."
facebookwins,32tb0y,innitgrand,0,Fri Apr 17 09:10:24 2015 UTC,So if I were to rape you in your sleep and be done before you woke... would that be all right with you?
facebookwins,32tb0y,Elliot850,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"Of course not! I don't know you, I'm not going to give consent to you. Point is if you give consent afterwards then it's not rape. If somebody woke up to a blowjob and said: keep going! Then that's not rape. My question to you then is this: if your girlfriend wakes you up with a blowjob, will you tell her she raped you?  My point is, consent can be given before and after but not actively during (because you're drunk, asleep etc.) If somebody is fine with it then it's not rape. Rape is the lack of consent at all, not the lack of consent during the fact. Obviously actively telling somebody no during the fact is the withdrawal of consent but if there is never any withdrawal of consent and they know about it then it's pretty much fine."
facebookwins,32tb0y,innitgrand,0,Fri Apr 17 14:52:42 2015 UTC,"Rape is the lack of consent at all, not the lack of consent during the fact.    I think that's where you're wrong.   It's also an entirely different issue when it's with someone you're not romantically linked to. When you're in a relationship there's an aspect of implied consent.  We're talking about someone waking up to find their daughters boyfriend having sex with them. You can't (and shouldn't) even try to justify that."
facebookwins,32tb0y,Elliot850,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, implied consent is a real thing! This may have been the case with this woman though. I'm saying that this isn't necessarily rape. It could be rape if she just went to sleep and woke up to him fucking her but maybe she went to sleep in the same bed, they had sex and dozed off. Now the dude is horny and starts up again figuring she'll wake up. She wakes up and joins in. I'll agree that the dude is an asshole but not necessarily a rapist.  The fact that she didn't press charges and the framing as waking up during sex seems telling that it was less rapey then we might normally imagine. We just don't know."

facebookwins,32ljwd,obrapop,33,Tue Apr 14 19:48:47 2015 UTC,the most poignant talking point I've heard on this was from a mother who pointed out people would rather have dead kids than autistic kids. That's fucked up.
facebookwins,32ljwd,Noumenology,17,Wed Apr 15 04:25:52 2015 UTC,"Some parents of autistic children would say that. It's very very difficult on them and the rest of their family. I know a couple whose marriage quickly fell apart when their second child was diagnosed with autism. Autistic children can need a carer for the rest of their lives and cost a lot of money to properly take care of. I've seen siblings of autistic children testify that they don't want to go home because it's so horrible for them.   If you could somehow detect a child had severe autism at an early stage of development in the womb, I would probably want an abortion. Although there is a huge difference between a toddler/baby and a fetus.   That ugliness aside I'm sure there are heaps of parents who love their autistic children, there are heaps of autistic people who can function fine in society. I'm sorry if I offended either group that's my opinion on the issue.   Also I can't possibly stress this enough. I don't believe Vaccines cause Autism in any way and more importantly they don't regardless of my or anyone else's opinion on the matter."
facebookwins,32ljwd,Wehavecrashed,48,Wed Apr 15 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the logic of these parents even if vaccines did have side effects like autism.  ""I can't let my child be anything but perfect so they will remain perfect for their 35 year life expectancy."""

The big beaks were to for the doctor to fill with aromatic things to mask the smell.   The implication is that people who don't vaccinate their children are pretending to know what they're doing and aren't doing a good job of it."
facebookwins,32ljwd,Sloop_man,4,Tue Apr 14 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"Plague doctor:       A plague doctor (Italian: medico della peste, Dutch: pestmeester, Spanish: m√©dico de la peste negra, German: Pestarzt) was a special medical physician who treated those who had the plague.  They were specifically hired by towns that had many plague victims in times of epidemics. Since the city was paying their salary, they treated everyone: both the rich and the poor. [dubious ‚Äì discuss]  However, some plague doctors were known for charging patients and their families extra for special treatments and/or false cures.  They were not normally professionally trained experienced physicians or surgeons, and often were second-rate doctors unable to otherwise run a successful medical business or young physicians trying to establish themselves.

Honestly not a bad idea based on the knowledge they had at the time, flawed as we now know it is."

facebookwins,30ud1z,powerfulsquid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"No idea to be honest but we all went to public school together and he lives in a neighborhood similar to my own growing up. Doesn't mean anything without knowing their financials or connections, of course. His brother started it, he was 2-3 years older, and this guy joined him shortly after HS. They didn't become this successful until recently (last 4-5 years I would say) so it's not like his brother was his ""in"".  My understanding, based on their website listings is not that these guys sell big, expensive houses. They post on FB about receiving awards from Remax, being top-ranked, etc. I believe it's income made on volume and by hiring many close friends I guess they are able to get more out of them versus a regular employee hired off the street (this is, of course, the exception not the rule).  The other thing to note is that this guy is part owner of the agency so he gets a percentage of all the other agents commissions. That adds up over 2 dozen or so agents selling multiple homes monthly."

Comment - I foresee some non-banana related uses for those...  Response - Maybe, but due to their clamshell design, these would make poor cups and ineffective carseats for children. We'd suggest sticking to fruit protection."

The more tactical deployed teams and brush equipment are coordinated and deployed by the Forestry Service.  Most wooded land in NJ is not like the West. Alot of it can be accessed by vehicle designed for offroad, and very few if any are expected to hike a distance to reach their objective.

It was a 58¬†cm (23¬†in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. It was visible all around the Earth and its radio pulses were detectable. The surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the larger Cold War.

facebookwins,2xljbn,swigglepop,8,Sun Mar 1 22:12:17 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, so don't stomp me to the ground for saying this, but I think a well-functioning democracy is a better safeguard against tyranny than assault rifles are. Rather than being so ""what-if"" oriented, maybe your average American should be more focused on maintaining and improving democracy in America right now? It seems to work rather well for the rest of us.  edit: and don't get me wrong, guns can be fun. Back here in Norway we have tons of them. However, they are only seen when people go hunting or when they go to gun-ranges as part of a rifle-club or something. There is simply no need to have them ""out in society"". Hell, even our police officers don't carry arms, as they, and most politicians, think it would rob the police of their civilian character. When the population are not armed to their teeth, having a friendly, non-feared police is quite possible as well, and honestly; it feels pretty great."

You don't have to agree with our country's policies. If you don't like them, don't live here. I don't care too much for 90% of Europe's policies either. You guys (and I realize I've stupidly lumped the entire continent together as one here) don't have it all correct either, and your mostly suffering economies are a testament to that. To be blunt, those of you with your same arrogant, uninformed, or otherwise miseducated mind sets and/or opinions, are assholes, all due respect. We saved your asses, most prominently in both world wars, and countless other times throughout history, and if it weren't for us ""self-envisioned"" sheepdogs you'd be speaking Nazi- German, or wouldn't exist at all because your ancestors would have been killed. To paint all of the USA with the broad brush you're using, saying that we're reckless, delusional, blood-thirsty, gun-toting maniacs is ridiculous. But you know what? It's true, and you're right. And that's why no one can fuck with us and everyone hates us. But I'd be willing to bet that if some invader were to show up on your doorstep tomorrow, you'd be begging for us to come save your ass again.

facebookwins,2xljbn,ThatLeviathan,19,Mon Mar 2 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Troll bait? Are you dim? It's a personal opinion that I happen to share with a sizable portion of the world. I'm not trying to prove that Europeans are superior to Americans, start a flame-war or anything like that. I'm trying to say that the whole world-saviour-complex that seem to have befallen you lot lately is not that much appreciated abroad, believe it or not.   Your contribution to both world wars was great, and I would not be lying when I say that most Europeans are thankful for that, but you are a fool if you consider the two world wars as an American one-man show. There's this saying attributed to Stalin going like this:   ""The war was won by British brains, American brawn and Russian Blood.""  Notice how this sort of implies the whole war to be a team effort? Where all contributions were essential for victory? No? Because that is exactly what it implies. Try attempting a Normandy landing without 90% of German forces occupied with dying in the east, and you might think again before you start these ridiculous claims about the USA being the only reason we're not under the boot of a Third Reich by now.   And what are all these ""countless"" other times you've saved our asses? Because right now, the only conflicts that spring to my mind  are the kind of conflicts that make a lot of people resent American involvement abroad. You know, like the one where you invaded Iraq on false premises, dragged us down into the dirt with you, and plunged the region into instability and death yet again?   And also, who exactly is it that you think you are protecting us against? Terrorists? Because we all feel so much safer from them after all the good work done down in the Middle East. Good job, thanks for saving us there, mate. Russians? Even if it ever would come to armed conflict, NATO works pretty well, even without the USA in it. You do realise that we keep quite the armies ourselves over here, right?  The Chinese? The Mafia? Brown people? The Irish? Who are these unidentified enemies that you so gallantly protect us from?  This turned out way more crass than I intended it to be, and I'm sorry for that, but the attitude you show there is the sort of attitude that make a lot of people around the world very angry about your country, helped along by other morally dubious policies like drone-bombing, and a history of acting with utter disregard for other nations and peoples."

facebookwins,2xljbn,Hamaja_mjeh,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"I love modern European-style socialist democracies.  I'm not being facetious.  The welfare systems, single-payer healthcare, the not-wasting-trillions on pointless wars against brown people halfway around the world; the fact that America can't get there is our national shame.  What terrifies me, however, is that getting there requires moving our nation to the left to the point where our gun rights will be eliminated.  Europe has little gun crime, that's true, but that's not because of strict gun control, but in spite of it.  Violent crime is very nearly statistically unrelated to gun ownership by private citizens.  Poverty is far, far greater an indicator of all crime than gun ownership.  There are small towns in American where very nearly 100% of the homes have guns in them, and they haven't had a murder in...well, ever.  And there are major cities that have had de facto bans on private firearm ownership who have hundreds of murders a year.  At the moment, the only gun I have is an old semi-automatic .22 rifle, but that's just because I don't have a lot of cash on hand.  When I have some, I'm going to buy a good gun safe ('cause I have too many kids) and a nice AR-15.  Why?  Partially for home defense, but like 99% of it is I just want one, and I'm legally allowed to own one, because there's no good reason I shouldn't be.  ""No one needs to have an 'assault rifle'"" is a stupid reason to ban them.  No one needs to have cars, either.  And swimming pools?  Why should anyone have their own?  If you want to swim, join the Y!  Wait, are you telling me you have your own computer?  But you have kids in the house!  Doesn't that seem unsafe?  Couldn't you just use the computers at the library?  You've got a lot of balls keeping a gassed-up lawn mower in the garage, that's crazy!  If you want your grass neatly trimmed you should just hire a service.  I get the fear about ""assault weapons.""  The media makes a shitload of money out of making people terrified that everybody with an old AR is just waiting for the right time to head to the local elementary school and murder scores of kids.  The fact of the matter, though, is that while that does happen and it is a horrible tragedy, it's statistically insignificant and almost impossible to prevent.  Even if you could eliminate every ""assault rifle"" in America, that doesn't do anything to stop a crazy asshole who, say, loads a U-Haul full of fertilizer and blows up a federal building in the middle of Oklahoma.  Or some psychopath who hijacks a plane with a shard of glass and flies it into a skyscraper.  Crazy shit happens.  The more we give up our rights for ""safety,"" the less safe we are, no matter how comfortable we may feel."

Im more scared of a ""hunting rifle"" than an ""assault rifle"".  The rounds they fire are far heavier and far more powerful.  And what about those super dangerous assassin silencers that reduce gunfire to nothing more than the sound of the action!? (Not true btw, they're still about as loud as a jackhammer) They hand them out like candy in the UK because its COURTESY to not have loud gunshots.  Not in the US though, I have to pay a super premium for them, plus a $200 tax stamp, plus register it, then wait around for a year to even pick it up after i've already paid for it.

This happens at least twice a year for me. Great way to not get robbed and/or stabbed!  The reason I started doing this is because a good friend of mine was robbed at gunpoint by 2 guys when he was trying to sell his iPhone on Craigslist. They basically held a gun to his head, grabbed the phone, and drove away. The city I live in is very safe but sometimes this stuff happens!"

He seems to just be saying that the UK will have difficulty controlling immigration, which is what they keep promising to do. He never gives a reason why immigration is bad. And also, it's just one bloke.    Apply your logic to an issue like climate change...you'd take your political stance over demographers or scientists. No point in making an inference that world populations are growing.   What? Are you saying that I'd take my political stance over demographers or scientists to decide what I thought about climate change? Are you being sarcastic again? No, I fucking wouldn't. If 99.9% of scientists agreed that climate change is real and terrible it doesn't matter what my political stance is one iota."
facebookwins,2sw6iu,TheRingshifter,-4,Mon Jan 19 10:03:21 2015 UTC,Hard to believe some people have yet to find out almost everyone here is a descendant of an immigrant
facebookwins,2sw6iu,Cl4pTr4pp,13,Mon Jan 19 10:26:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that type of immigration was pretty different than todays immigration. For example, late 1700s and 1800s. With population difference and what the government has to offer in terms of social service, the importance of the immigration being legal or not changes significantly."
facebookwins,2sw6iu,lethalweapon100,3,Mon Jan 19 02:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was different. In the past the U.S. government was much smaller in scale than it is in modern times. This isn't something that has only happened in the U.S. The increased influence on people's daily lives is something that has happened across the world as the world becomes more globalized.   Back then, Europeans came to America claimed the land for their own, imposed their religion upon the natives and inadvertently killed millions of them with diseases the brought from the Old World.  What have modern-day immigrants (mainly Latin-Americans who are  the only ones in most people's minds) done that is so terrible? They come to the United States to work menial labor jobs that no one else wants to do for minimum wage or less. I've seen these people working on the houses in my subdivision and believe me when I tell you that no person with papers would want to work a job like that. They pay taxes including income and sales taxes but receive no government benefits such as Social Security, welfare, or unemployment insurance as many people like to believe. If you don't believe me, here's a link to irs.gov.  Xenophobia is nothing new. ""Nativists"" have complained about foreigners since the beginning. Irishmen, Jews and the Chinese in the 19th century, Italians in the first half of the 20th, Germans and Japanese during WWII, and now it's the Latinos that get all the hate.  It's a never-ending cycle. One day we'll probably be seeing the descendants of illegal Latinos acting in the same childish way as Americans do today.  Edit: Some typos"
facebookwins,2sw6iu,TheChance,4,Mon Jan 19 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"Legal immigration is effectively impossible for most of the people who come here illegally. It's not like they're just being lazy about paperwork.  Where quotas aren't a problem, there are still tremendous barriers to entry that most people will never overcome. But they still need out of where they are and in to a less brutal society.  So they sneak in, and live like fugitives, and most of the time wind up doing incredibly valuable work without receiving the benefits or protections of citizenship. And we hold the whole thing against them."
facebookwins,2sw6iu,Cl4pTr4pp,0,Mon Jan 19 04:09:29 2015 UTC,Yes. That type of immigration involved theft and genocide.

If there were other pertinant signs, such as a smell coming from the house, or a neighbor filing a police report about witnessing drug dealing at that address, then yes, a warrant would be easier to obtain.

facebookwins,2saley,potatohats,18,Tue Jan 13 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, I had to google it. Fucking ridiculous.   Some key points from an article:  Typically, they are done a day or two after a woman has had her period in order to detox and heal any imbalances in the vagina, cervix and uterus. Vaginal steaming has also been known to ease anxiety in women as well as tackle several other health issues-  and this one:  After you have determined the best herbs to use for your personal health needs and are ready for the vaginal steam, you can boil as little or as much filtered water as you like; typically, women use about 8 cups and then once the water has boiled and has cooled enough where it is no longer boiling, add about 2/3rd of a cup of your fresh and/or dried herbs. Do not add them while the water is still boiling as this can lessen the potency of the herbs. After the herbs have steeped for about 10 minutes, pour half of the contents in a bowl and proceed to squat over it or sit on a vagi-stool (a stool with an opening in it). To maximize the steam, have a large towel or blanket that wraps around your waist, making a tent around the bowl and allowing the steam to go up into the vaginal opening.  I can't believe people are this stupid."

Even when you find something and put the kid on restriction by what you found they will find a way to circumvent restriction. Especially with technology, what you should do is teach your child better. They should have better judgement by their upringing than to do ""bad*"" things. Snooping and restriction just creates sneaky kids who lie.    *bad as in things you would disapprove of or not allow  Also you can't and won't be able to track everything your child does, they will find a way to do what they're going to do.

The various legislation these people are bitching about doesn't compel you to hire underqualified people. It compels you to hire a variety of qualified people, instead of staffing the whole state house with white men.  Also, the ""you"" in this context isn't you. It's ""public institutions"". The government.  So, unless you're of the opinion that women/not-white people cannot be as qualified as the equivalent white dude for <insert civil service job>, the first guy had no point whatsoever."
facebookwins,2p1riz,TheChance,1 point,Fri Dec 12 11:06:51 2014 UTC,"I mean the way I interpreted it, he was essentially saying if you have one position ad there are three people being considered, one being a woman, one being a minority, and the third being a white male, if the white male was more qualified than the other two people then he should be the one who is hired.  The way I see it, minorities and/or women shouldn't get an advantage just because of their status, nor should they be unfairly profiled against. Ideally the government should hire people purely on the basis of their qualifications.   That is the ideal scenario, but then again life isn't fair. I see what you're saying though"

Couple weeks later and the charges are dropped and the dude never committed a crime. The girl that he was involved with herself said he never did anything wrong and shouldn't have been arrested.  The comments he made that day were glorious. Those people were put in their place and hopefully they learned something about the process.

facebookwins,2o5utt,Musicly2343,5,Wed Dec 3 20:12:36 2014 UTC,"While that is sometimes the case, it is hardly a valid generalization. False rape reports are pretty rare, they are just publicized on reddit so much that they appear to be a huge issue. Is the legal system unfairly geared towards the accuser in some rape cases? Certainly, but for the great majority of cases justice is properly served. Accusations have implications before anything has even happened. If I accuse you of assault and make a police report, even if you did nothing, you will be arrested and put in jail before a judge. Once things go to trial it's a different story, but police and the justice system can't simply ignore every accusation until the court date."

What else is there to go on? DNA tests right? Well to get the most accurate results, I understand the sooner the better. So the victim should go to the police station before they've cleaned themselves after being raped. And then there's the chance of dismissive policeman who would assume the girls a slut and call it a day.      But seriously, was that a statistic you used for your statement?"
facebookwins,2o5utt,Musicly2343,3,Wed Dec 3 22:04:39 2014 UTC,"As soon as alcohol is noted to have been involved, the victims reliability as a witness is severely hampered.   I believe the victim having been drunk counts in the victim's favor, as it show she didn't have the level of judgement needed to consent (at least in some states).   What else is there to go on? DNA tests right? Well to get the most accurate results, I understand the sooner the better. So the victim should go to the police station before they've cleaned themselves after being raped.   The sooner the better, and you should refrain from cleaning up yourself and the scene of the crime to preserve evidence. If you went to the police station, I'm pretty sure they would simply give you a ride to a local equipped hospital where you would be treated and cared for and, most importantly, be administered with a 'rape-kit'.   And then there's the chance of dismissive policeman who would assume the girls a slut and call it a day.   Thankfully there are medical and care specialists that can verify your claim, provide you with support and protect your interests. Not to mention the aforementioned policeman might be biased the other way and inhibit justice the other way.  My question is: Why make a comment like yours? It's basically saying: 'If you've been raped just give up because no one will help you.' Is it worth it to trump up outrage?  Here is the RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) site. If you think you might have been the subject of abuse, please visit it for information as well as help."
facebookwins,2o5utt,Another_sealion,1 point,Wed Dec 3 23:56:29 2014 UTC,I'm not looking to trump up outrage. Nor am I saying you shouldn't bother going to the police if you've been raped. I'm outlining some of the major points that would prevent a successful report to the police. Because another commenter said that the majority of rape cases end in the rapist being charged. And I've seen a few statistics that say the complete opposite.

Not saying I agree with the practice of police on social media, its really complete shit to smear someones name in the dirt before they are actually convicted of anything. However... note that its been going on for a LONG LONG TIME already. How else do you think we get ""Breaking News Stories"" in the hours after someone is arrested for something? The event of shaming a persons name with said criminal activity happens from the moment a police report goes public.  Obviously this is a good thing & a bad thing because otherwise EVERY POLICE REPORT EVER would be ""Jon/Jane Doe Charged with Manslaughter - Check back in 2-3 years to see if they are convicted because our court system is outdated and slow""  Don't worry. I'll take my logic and leave.  EDIT: My god... I didn't mean ""I'll take my logic and leave"" as a dis to the people here... but in the sense that it doesn't really matter what I think is logical because no politician or govt official is going to listen to a dam word I have to say and that its highly unlikely this behavior will ever change."

I think the whole justice system and how it operates, ESPECIALLY the whole ""guilty until proven innocent"" precedent that now sweeps police & social behavior needs to be brought up to 21st Century standards.

Black kids obviously don't possess keys or ever open doors, so he must have been trying to pick the lock!    Also cops never deescalate.  Military learns how to deescalate, while police never deescalate.  Once they stopped, an arrest had to happen... or worse.   Wouldn't wanna make those cops look like they can't make good decisions.."

It seems like there are endless situations where a few officers could wait things out, rather than armoring up and escalating the situation.  Sadly, I guess we should be glad that it sounds like no one was shot to death."

That means they were there, and they waited for a while, while holding guns and watching the place. It says nothing about why they didn't go in immediately, or, which was the question in the first place, WHY THEY WERE THERE. In this case, it appears that someone called the police because they saw a black guy enter a house with a key. Sort of like the recent case where someone called the cops because a black guy was walking through the neighborhood with his hands in his pockets on a cold day.  Not every 'standoff' is like the movies with lots of gunfire and exciting Michael Bay explosions. Sometimes, it's a SWAT team standing around going ""you think we should beat the door down now?""

facebookwins,2nn0be,TheRingshifter,32,Fri Nov 28 11:37:05 2014 UTC,"I think he's a scumbag.  I can see the point of people that approve, but at the end of the day, your friend doesn't know what's going on, and he could have potentially put a very pregnant woman in very real danger.  You don't know if this guy has a history of abuse.  You don't know if he's willing to just leave her at the park.  And on the flip side, you don't know that the guy isn't just her brother.  It's never a good idea to stick your nose into situations like this, and yeah, it makes your friend look like a serious ""Bros before Hos, bruh"" douchebag.  Why was he straining to read the girl's texts anyway?  That's just creepy.  Your friend is a serious douchebag, OP, and as a word to the wise, be very careful what you say to him in the future.  He clearly isn't worried about consequences for other people, and clearly isn't worried about invading people's privacy, and clearly isn't worried about ""retaliating"" over situations he doesn't have anything to do with and isn't involved in.  Definitely keep this one at arm's length.  edit: for all the people going through and trying to downvote my entire reddit history:  Have at it.  I really couldn't care less about internet points, tbh.  Also, for all your future downvote-brigade endeavors, just be aware that reddit has algorithms set in place which prevent you from being able to cluster-downvote a person more than a few times at once.  What this means is that if you really want to downvote my old posts and comments, you're going to have to upvote a few as well.  Happy reading."
facebookwins,2nn0be,MAINEiac4434,18,Fri Nov 28 17:21:27 2014 UTC,"I think I disagree.   Firstly, lets discharge one thing. It does not matter AT ALL if it turns out Jason was her dad/brother/uncle/son whatever, because then they will just laugh it off and no one will be harmed.   Next, if he's abusive, does that still mean she's right for staying with him? I mean, possibly if he's emotionally black mailing her, or has some crazy pre-nup or something, but come on, how likely is that?   I honestly feel it is THIS attitude that is vaguely sexist... assuming that all women who are talking romantically to another man are doing so because there husband is abusive/a monster/a child rapist or some shit. I'm not saying women are more likely to be philandering than men, but I do think women are more likely to just be philandering compared to the chances of their husband being some kind of Machiavellian monster.   I mean, if the sexs were reversed in this situation, and a man was texting someone he was having an affair, would you assume his girlfriend/wife was abusive? Yet some studies show that women are just as likely to abuse their husbands as vice versa. Many at least show it is far closer than usually imagined (65-35) (this page is very interesting - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_domestic_violence)"
facebookwins,2nn0be,teh_booth_gawd,2,Fri Nov 28 13:27:00 2014 UTC,"I think your last question is a very good one, and it's similar to a question I posed above.  Unfortunately, I'm not the right person to ask, as I think everyone should be minding their own business anyway, and I equally wouldn't find it acceptable (for the same reasons) if the genders were switched.    Just to touch upon something else you said, though: ""Next, if he's abusive, does that still mean she's right for staying with him? I mean, possibly if he's emotionally black mailing her, or has some crazy pre-nup or something, but come on, how likely is that?""  I really don't think that any of that is the point.  Whether she should be with someone abusive is a different conversation entirely, and whether or not we're going to start guessing likelihood for his abusiveness is irrelevant.  The point is that we just don't know, so as onlookers, we should stay out of it.  The scumbag could have put her in real danger, and put her baby in real danger, for no reason other than a vague sense of ""fuck cheating bitches, yo"".  Lastly, I'm not assuming he's violent, I'm just saying it's a possibility, so for you to suggest I'm sexist is way out of line."
facebookwins,2nn0be,JuliaDD,6,Fri Nov 28 19:50:15 2014 UTC,"Well, I guess if you'd honestly say it's the same with the genders swapped it's not sexist... I still think it's crazy though.    The point is that we just don't know, so as onlookers, we should stay out of it.   This is the root of the insanity, IMO. This applies to literally every situation in the history of all human existence. And I don't think much more so here than in many other situations."
facebookwins,2nn0be,TheRingshifter,26,Fri Nov 28 15:21:36 2014 UTC,"I see a lot of people opposing this implying that the woman may be in an abusive relationship while criticizing OP's friend for being ""presumptuous"".  To me, your comment just as, if not more presumptuous than OP's friend. There are literally NO indications that this is an abusive relationship, but there is an indication that this may be a cheating relationship.  And if it is her brother, why would she hide the phone whenever she texted?  I also know very few adult men who would put there arms around their sisters, in public, but maybe they're in the minority, who knows."
facebookwins,2nn0be,JuliaDD,3,Fri Nov 28 18:35:05 2014 UTC,"Kind of a bummer, this sub is usually sane.  Sure it's possible something other than the apparent is going on, but it's unlikely as hell.  Facebook win for sure."
facebookwins,2nn0be,TheRingshifter,5,Fri Nov 28 19:12:59 2014 UTC,"The point is that none of us know.  There are lots of situations that could be true, some of which are really unsavory.  It's not presumptuous in the least to say that these possibilities might exist, and I'm not sure why you think it is.  In no way am I saying that I think he's abusive, just that there's a chance that he could be, and I think i was pretty clear about that in my original statement.  And in my point of view, if there's even a chance that you could put this stranger in danger, you don't risk it.  Also, just to be clear, I don't think anyone should ever insert themselves into a stranger's personal business anyway, unless there is an imminent threat of physical danger.  Lastly, and I know I'm changing the subject, do you think that all the guys on here supporting what this douchebag did would feel the same if the roles were reversed?  How would you feel about it, for example, if it was the guy who was texting every time the girl looked away, and this stranger had given this note to her, instead?  Would that change anything for you?  Do you think the douchebag would have even given her the note?  Just something to think about.  *edit: i kan spel gud."
facebookwins,2nn0be,JuliaDD,5,Fri Nov 28 19:38:23 2014 UTC,"I feel this attitude is kind of insane. I mean, there's always a chance anything you do will backfire. It doesn't matter that there's a chance - you just can't afford to think of things in this binary way! You have to guess at what those chances are, and I feel in this situation, the ""risk"" of this backfiring is far less likely than the ""reward"" of it not.   I mean, if you donate ¬£1000 to heart disease research, there's a chance that it get's funneled through the mob and is used to buy a gun and shoot 20 people. If you try and help an old women cross the road there's a chance that you'll go at the wrong time and both get run over..."
facebookwins,2nn0be,TheRingshifter,-1,Fri Nov 28 18:03:41 2014 UTC,But there is no reward for the scumbag.  He only has the self-satisfaction of inserting himself into someone else's business without actually knowing what's going on.

facebookwins,2nn0be,TheRingshifter,9,Fri Nov 28 18:38:28 2014 UTC,"How? Explain the difference. I don't think there is. I think you're being crazy in this case...  There is a theory (that I pretty much subscribe to) that there is NO such thing as an 'altruistic' act. EVERYTHING someone does for ostensibly 'selfless' reasons either makes them directly feel good, or makes them feel like they're paying a social debt, or makes them feel important.  You are literally saying it's bad because ""there is no reward"". THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID. LOOK:    But there is no reward for the scumbag.   HOW ON EARTH IS THAT A BAD THING? HOW? Would that mean it would be better if, after giving the man the note, he would be payed for doing it (somehow)? How would that make it better? Imagine, hypothetically, he DID get payed, THEN you could say:   But the scumbag is just doing it for the payment   THAT is a criticism! That's a BAD thing!

Go ahead and tell me how I'm ""way out of line"" for misconstruing your argument.  You know damn well you made assumptions about this situation too.  Assuming that a man is likely to abuse his SO upon finding out that she's (possibly) being unfaithful is exactly the same as reading those texts over her shoulder and assuming she's cheating."

[SHOTS FIRED]  First of all, you're saying the ""ooh you don't know if she's philandering"". Well, it doesn't goddamn matter because if not, it should sort itself out.   Your main point of ""it could put here in physical danger"" is basically the only point you have. And I just feel that is so unlikely as to be almost negligible. I mean, out of the women who are cheaters, do you seriously think more than half of them have abusive partners? Because that would basically have to be the case (IMO) to make your tactic the superior one.    of some misplaced feeling of retaliation for what he perceives [...]   How is this misplaced? This seems completely well-placed to me. If she was cheating, then it's perfectly reasonable to feel sorry for the person getting cheated on.   I mean, let's imagine, hypothetically, a different scenario. Say that instead of reading messages that implied she was being unfaithful, he read messages like ""I've gave him the first doses"" and ""he should be out of the picture within the week"". And, as before, she had hid the phone when he was getting close. Would you consider interfering here? I mean, you don't know she's poisoning him. And also, he could be a serial rapists/Nazi war criminal, and she could be doing the right thing. Guess you just shouldn't interfere.   Granted, that is a more open-and-shut situation than this one, but I feel it is pretty analogous."

Over the past winter we had a couple snow days, nothing like the amount they got so quickly, but a good 4 feet over a couple days non stop. Later in the winter we had a ""cold day"" as the wind chill was -26 at 7am, but the next day we had classes again and the schools main page had a frostbite calculator that you put in temp and wind speed and it'd tell you how long you could be out and exposed before frostbite. If that's a necessary thing, you should close the damn school."
facebookwins,2ms8o5,Festavis007,5,Wed Nov 19 22:57:59 2014 UTC,"You aren't going to get frost bite in that many minutes if you wear a coat, hat, and gloves.

I wore my snowmobile gear and was fine but there are the idiots that leave the house on those days without gloves or a hat. It's those idiots that lose a finger or ear that throw a wrench in the whole system and fuck everything up for the rest of us. Even so, after they put the calculator up entered the current numbers at the time and were given 7 minutes before it could set in. On a campus that takes over an hour to walk end to end it shouldn't have been open simply because of the idiots. And yes, I still walked to class, goggles and all."

The original first edition published by Alfred Knopf featured illustrations by Nancy Ekholm Burkert. However, there have been various reillustrated versions of it over the years, done by Michael Simeon for the first British edition, Emma Chichester Clark, Lane Smith and Quentin Blake. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996. The plot centres on a young English orphan boy who enters a gigantic, magical peach, and has a wild and surreal cross-world adventure with six magically-altered garden bugs he meets. Originally titled James and the Giant Cherry, Dahl changed it to James and the Giant Peach because a peach is ""*prettier, bigger and squishier than a cherry.""  *    Image i     Interesting: James and the Giant Peach (film) | Tim Burton | Henry Selick | Roald Dahl   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Second, it's not the woman releving her self for her own pleasure or need, IT'S THE KID EATING! If you're gonna compare it to anything then compare it to you sitting on a park bench having lunch, because it's the exact got damn same thing. That guy is a complete tool and this is not a win."
facebookwins,2lq60g,Paul_Dirac_,-3,Tue Nov 11 18:42:26 2014 UTC,"Ok, I think public breastfeeding should be OK and public urination not.  But for the sake of dissecting your arguments:   First of, public urination is illegal, breast feeding is not.    ... what makes shaming someone for breast feeding considerably different from urinating, I give you that. (Shaming seems to be the matter at hand.)  But on a greater scale doesn't that mean, if we can't prove a considerable difference between breast feeding and urinating public urinating should also be allowed? (or public breast feeding should be forbitten)    Second, it's not the woman releving her self for her own pleasure or need...   So it's the kid relieving its needs. How is the need to excrete in a philosophically important way different from the need to eat?   And before you argue with germs be advised that urine is sterile. And while there are germs at your penis that you don't want on your hands, there are also germs on your hands you don't want anywhere else. (Penis or breast.) The question if you have more germs on your hands or penis seems to be undecided (found no reliable source.)   IT'S THE KID EATING!    Yeah, what I said. Also does that mean, if someone likes to drink my piss it's okay to urinate into his/her mouth in public?  Or could I lick my girlfriends nipples until she is lactating? Because that would be the exact same thing.   That guy is a complete tool and this is not a win.    It is a win. Not because his assumed opinion is my opinion. But because he had a great rebuttal to the girl's argument.   Class means you can applaude an opponent even if you think his opinion is total bullshit."

facebookwins,2jyihc,JalopyMaster,12,Wed Oct 22 16:25:29 2014 UTC,"Honest question since you're a pastor, what do you say to people that bring up these messed up passages of the Bible? Why are there so many contradictions everywhere? What are people supposed to believe?"
facebookwins,2jyihc,alfrednugent,14,Wed Oct 22 18:15:16 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the REALLY slow response - it's a long story as to where I was!  I work predominately with the youth, so when they ask me questions like this, I usually ask them to get together with me for food or something and have them come up with a list of their top questions. And then we sit and talk about each of them for a while.  The biggest thing (from my perspective, obviously) is that there is no quick answer to these questions. Which I'm grateful for, because I want the kids to question and think about anything and everything. Since I'm convinced that the Bible is true and God is true/real, then I want them to ask every question they can think of in their search for truth. And I end up  spending a lot of time answering their questions about things like this, which I think is really important.  I've seen a lot of places (and been in a few) where questions like these are ignored or hushed up with ad hominem attacks, stupid pithy statements, or just twists of logic and the Bible.  So I always teach the students to keep asking about everything and let them know I'm always there any time--day or night--to answer any question, even if they want to tell me that they think God is unfair, doesn't exist, or anything else.  I'll try to get back to answering your questions.  1) I tell them that we should get together to talk about it. Most of the time the reason it seems to be a big contradiction is that it's not looked at within the context of of where it is in the Bible, the historical context, and even within the greater context of Bible. That doesn't mean that the passages aren't troubling, but they make a lot more sense when taking those three things into consideration. Then it becomes a question of, ""do I really believe that God is who He says He is, or no""?  2) As far as what to believe, I can tell you what I think. I apologize in advance if it sounds preachy.   Specifically with problems like punishments for not being a virgin, homosexuality, etc and the seeming contradictions, I suppose I would start with saying God is perfect. And He has created a way that we are intended to interact with Him and each other. And if we did it, there would be no loneliness, sadness, hurt, malice, between any of us. Only complete fulfillment in the relationship we have with God and with each other--a deep intimacy where we can all love each other and nurture each other even though we don't need anything.  And a lot of what is in the Old Testament is   1) God providing for the people that He's chosen. He chose them just because He did--His plan for #2 required He work through someone.   2) God working to bring back humanity to what He had intended - a relationship with Him where He would provide for all humanities needs and allow them to enjoy fellowship with Him and each other.   3) He's giving them instructions for what His perfect standard is, that is, what behavior will bring them closest to what He intended while He works His plan out in history.  A lot of times with #3 we look at all these passages in Leviticus and see these horrible passages about stoning people for having sex in various situations and it looks terrible. But in Genesis and other passages on King David and others the Bible shows that there are some serious consequences for not taking these things seriously. And part of showing the level of seriousness for following certain guidelines is having a serious consequence for it--death in this situation.   It's a whole different discussion on what sort of sexual freedoms humanity should feel entitled to and whether it comes from social, biological, or other influences.  But even a large focus on the standards of behavior and repercussions for violating them places too much emphasis on it. That's not to say that we shouldn't be trying to do everything right as a Christian, but I think the Bible makes it quite clear that we're all beyond help as far sin and not doing what God wants us to do.  And so when I read the Bible, I see the focus as being (yes, that there are consequences for not following God's rules because it separates us from Him and each other) that God, in His mercy and grace, He decided to fix the problem. And that He early on said what He was going to do, and then worked in history to bring it about (even in unlikely situations recorded in the Bible like Ruth) through Jesus dying to take the punishment I deserved, and then rising again to show that it wasn't the end. And as a Christian I need/want to share this with everyone I come across because I realize that there is nothing that makes me better than anyone else in the world, without exception.  So when I read some of these passages I'm reminded that God is serious about His standards, but that He doesn't take any joy in having people die (because this is stated over and over again). And I'm reminded that the most important thing, above all, is showing every single person the same grace and love that I believe God showed me through loving me while I was still His enemy.  Sorry for all the preachiness!  There are lots of other in-depth discussions to be had about conquering the promised land and other things that seem to go against God being a God of love. But maybe that's a chat for another day.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Or just a funny meme. Thanks!"

Don't eat pork or shellfish, not because it's wrong, but because they were consider dirty, disease-carrying animals because they rolled around in shit all day or lived at the bottom of the sea floor in piles of fish shit. Thousands of years ago, knowledge of the causes of disease was lacking and they didn't know simply fully cooking the pork and shellfish would make them as safe to eat as fish and lamb.  They just knew shit wasn't good for them, so shouldn't eat things that spend a lot of time in it.  Man shouldn't lie with man because, once again, shit.  They didn't want a man putting his dick in another man's ass and getting shit all over it, then going home and having sex with his wife and getting shit from his dick in her vag, and end up impregnating her with a shit baby.

Others pertain to the Gospel of Jesus Christ (such as the diction to avoid homosexual behavior), and are found in the NT as well.

facebookwins,2jyihc,Haephestus,1 point,Wed Oct 22 14:25:34 2014 UTC,"Apologies. This may look like a wall of text. This question deserves some context and some carful understanding.  The Law of Moses - God gave laws through Moses to the house of Israel to replace the higher law that they had failed to obey (Ex. 34:1-2). The Law of Moses (also known as the Mosaic Law) consisted of many rules, ceremonies, and rituals that were used to remind people of their duty to God (they forgot this constantly). This included burnt offerings, sacrifices, and cleansing ordinances, but also included aspects that are found in modern Christianity, such as baptism, repentance, and keeping commandments (such as the ten commandments).   The ""Law"" is also known as the first five books of Moses, also known as the Pentateuch.   We've already discussed that Christ did not ""come to destroy the law, or the prophets: [He did not] come to destroy, but to fulfil"" (Matt 5:17 KJV). We also know that Jesus taught extensively from the principles of the Mosaic Law: ""Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets"" (Matt 7:12 KJV).  The ""Law"" contained the basic principles of the gospel Christ was coming to fulfill and preach, but it was a preparatory law--a crutch.   Paul explained that the Mosaic Law was given because of blindness and transgression, and that God acted as a ""schoolmaster"" (or guardian, depending on your translation) to teach the ""children of God"" to seek righteous things. He uses this allegory to demonstrate that the children of God are no longer led by a schoolmaster, and now need to live by faith:     But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.    For most Jews at the time there was no such thing, could be no such thing, as a law higher than the Law of Moses. Nor could Jews talk about a distinction between the letter of the Law and the spirit of the Law, for they conceived of the letter and the spirit as identical. Furthermore, most Jews of Jesus‚Äô day had come to believe that salvation came only by observance of the Law of Moses as the highest possible expression of God‚Äôs will, and in no other way. These were a few of the reasons Jesus was Crucified--he was teaching an end of the old law.  The principle that modern Christians should take from this is that the spiritual component of the Modern Law is now a ""graduated"" version of the Old Law. The ceremonial portion of the law (or the ordinances of cleansing, etc) are the parts which fall away. The moral or ethical principles remain, however, such as the ten commandments, though it has fallen out of fashion for some of them to be practiced by many faiths today. Note sabbath-day observance, for example. I happen to believe that we should live all ten commandments.  Now we approach the root of your question (""About time!"" you say?)  With Christ crucified, resurrected, and ascended to heaven, the apostles spent their lives traveling and teaching the gospel while writing epistles to believers in various places teaching them about many different subjects, including this one. ""Which laws do we have to keep now?"" seemed to be the common question. What sincere seekers of the Gospel should note is that Paul responded to many concerns, sometimes harshly. On the subject of homosexuality he said:   ""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God"" (1 Cor. 6:9-11).   It is not the intention of sincere seekers of Christ to search the scriptures only to justify what we might inwardly believe to be sinful behavior. If we consider that Paul was an anointed messenger from God, then we are to believe that his words are from God and not his own.  I should mention that is also not the intention of followers of Christ to condemn others for holding different beliefs or positions or to ridicule others for them. In the passage I posted Paul taught that many new followers of Christ were formerly sinners. Christians often repeat the mantra that we should love the sinner, regardless of how badly we hate the sin.   Other questions we have mentioned, such as divorce, are questions of policy and not questions of religious doctrine. Some of these are principles that may be observed by secular people in one way and by religious people in other ways. I happen to believe strongly in happy marriage, but recognize that it is not always possible."

It makes the timeline like this:    God creates the Old Testament. Acts as ""schoolmaster""  God enters the world as Jesus, faith is come, etc etc.   OH YEAH, BTW GUYS. I TOTALLY DIN'T MEAN WHAT I TOLD YOU GUYS, 200 YEARS AGO. YOU NEED TO DO, THIS, THIS AND THIS.   It's completely absurd to believe that there would be ANY reason for Paul to be ""anointed"" by God.

facebookwins,2jyihc,SkittlesMacGee,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:43:04 2014 UTC,"Hey, sorry this took so long.   Wikipedia has taught me a few things I didn't know... Read here in the ""history"" section for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce  One notable example of divorce was Henry VIII of England, who broke with the Catholic Church in order to obtain a divorce. Before him, it seems that people were generally unable to obtain a divorce, as it seems that the scriptural authority largely forbids or condemns it. As far as I can tell, I can't find any scriptures that say ""ok, you can go ahead and divorce each other now."" My best answer is that rising divorce rates can be attributed to A. secular pushback against religious states and B. religious relaxation of doctrines to correspond to secular popularity.   Now, I'm not sure if this is going to be the answer you're looking for, but the leader of my faith gave a talk several years ago about marriage, noting that marriage is a blessed union made before God, and that whatever ""God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."" (Matt. 19:6). It would seem from my perspective (take it as you like, and I apologize if this isn't properly answering the question) that divorce is not the ideal perspective for families to take, and that followers of Christ ought to try to create a gospel-centered home built to avoid the tragedy of divorce.  As for long hair for women... I have a guess, but not much more than that. In my faith we talk about a thing called ""For the Strength of Youth"", which is a personal appearance and behavior code for young men and women to follow. Included is a dress and grooming standard which our leadership teaches our members to follow. I can only surmise that the ""long hair"" thing has something to do with old-timey dress and grooming standards, but to be honest I have no idea. :/  (BTW, this kind of stuff is really good for my personal study, lol.)"
facebookwins,2jyihc,projectoffset,2,Wed Oct 22 18:59:35 2014 UTC,"Divorce:       Divorce (or the dissolution of marriage) is the termination of a marital union, the canceling and/or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country and/or state.  Divorce should not be confused with annulment, which declares the marriage null and void; with legal separation (a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a de facto separation while remaining legally married) or with de facto separation (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting).  Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries it requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process. The legal process of divorce may also involve issues of alimony (spousal support), child custody, child visitation / access, parenting time, child support, distribution of property, and division of debt. In most countries monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another; where polygyny is legal but polyandry is not, divorce allows the woman to marry a new husband.  Divorce can be a stressful experience: affecting finances, living arrangements, household jobs, schedules, parenting and the outcomes of children of the marriage as they face each stage of development from childhood to adulthood. If the family includes children, they may be deeply affected.   The only countries that do not allow divorce are the Philippines and the Vatican City, an ecclesiastical state, which has no procedure for divorce. Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987),  Ireland (1996), Chile (2004)  and Malta (2011).

We were also poking smot. So she drops me off at my house, and I'm just baked. She asks me t throw out the White Castle garbage. So I have my cherry coke and the bag with white castles garbage in one hand, and my comic books and an empty white castle cup in the other. I throw the White castle bag and my cherry coke in the garbage, realizing my mistake I threw out my comic books and stood there looking at an empty white castle cup in my hand.

facebookwins,2iz0f9,bananaraptor,13,Sat Oct 11 20:30:04 2014 UTC,"I was driving by Little Caesar's today and had the following thoughts:  ""Little Caesar's?  Nah, I don't hate myself today...""  ""...Ah fuck it, it's only $5."""
facebookwins,2iz0f9,stellarbeing,5,Sat Oct 11 22:49:59 2014 UTC,Can confirm: worked at Little Caesar's. Said same thing before I put in job application.
facebookwins,2iz0f9,legion_of_discord,3,Sun Oct 12 03:43:58 2014 UTC,"What happened to Little Caesar's? They used to be at the top of the shitty pizza pile...better than Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, etc. They could even contend with some family places for quality. Then they stopped airing commercials and became a kiosk in K-Marts??"

facebookwins,2iwt6j,Abroh,13,Mon Oct 13 03:38:34 2014 UTC,Speech jammers are hilarious though - and they work. I have an app to do it on my phone.  videos:  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=speech+jammer
facebookwins,2iwt6j,innitgrand,4,Sat Oct 11 03:09:20 2014 UTC,Whats the app called? can you do it over the phone to the person on the other end?
facebookwins,2iwt6j,Morticiagoldbunny,6,Sat Oct 11 03:11:14 2014 UTC,"Its called speech jammer. Not sure if the app store still has it. It doesn't do it over the phone, just relays their speech throug the headphones"
facebookwins,2iwt6j,Darkerthansmack,2,Sat Oct 11 03:13:42 2014 UTC,That is a fantastic idea.
facebookwins,2iwt6j,random_dent,10,Sat Oct 11 11:05:44 2014 UTC,"The way it works is that it plays your own voice back at you delayed about half a second or a quarter of a second. This is incredibly confusing and will make you stutter or start speaking in a weird way. Counterintuitively, it is often used as a method to stop somebody stammering. QI had a nice episode where they tried it: http://youtu.be/wnt8qWZAflI. It worked for some people but not for others."
