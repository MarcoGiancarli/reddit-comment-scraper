If the whisky has been stored properly, though (upright, in the dark, and between 60-67 degrees F), then it's probably fine. If the whisky was not stored upright, contact with the cork will influence the taste in a negative way.  Even the best seal may let in some air, and eventually the whisky may go bad, but that may take many decades. Whisky that has gone bad will smell off, or have visible signs of mold.

pics,3e2d3w,Rudimentary_Peni,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but stretches do jack shit for preventing injuries. What you need is to train your muscles in balance. For instance, your rotator cuffs (especially the external rotators) and rear deltoids should be strong if you want to keep your shoulders healthy. You also have to care about posture, and there again, strenthening the upper back, with attention paid to activation the lower and middle trapezoid muscles, can do wonders.   If you always focus on using full range of movements on most exercises, you need to do very little in terms of flexibility. Your body limiting your range of motion is its way of keeping you from putting your muscles in a weak position. Of course, whatever you do, you have to be progressive about it. Idiots using weights too heavy for them and suddenly trying to do some stiff legged deadlifts with poor form may injure their hamstrings or lower back; someone being smart about it will develop strong and flexible hamstrings, which goes a long way into preventing hamstrings injuries. Leg curls, another hamstring exercise, will do not be as good for preventing injury because you are not developing strength in the ways the muscles are going to be used when you go walking/running/hiking/going down stairs etc.   The list goes on."

(The second picture helps to clarify but more complete information can be found here).  James Dyson was inspired by M.C. Escher and came up with the idea of this fountain.  It was built by Derek Phillips for the Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show  in 2003.

pics,3e205p,I_drink_your_tears,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"It works via gravity, water flows downwards and bubbles float upwards due to gravity."
pics,3e205p,andy_hoffman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:14 2015 UTC,But doesn't all fountains work via gravity in that case? What is so special about this one to call it a gravity fountain?
pics,3e205p,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding the design of the fountain right, it doesn't require a pump.  Most fountains require a pump to move water to the top, but this one looks like it functions through siphoning, with the 'siphon' being the stream of water coming out the top of the fountain.  As long as the flow is steady and strong enough to prevent air from entering the top of the triangle, the siphon should be consistent."
pics,3e205p,Spartan2470,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"According to the BBC article about this:   Water is pumped in at the bottom, and comes out of the opening at the top. At the opening, some of the water is diverted back down the ramp, covering the glass in a thin layer of water.  Compressed air is also pumped in where the water enters - bubbles then travel up the ramp to the opening. These bubbles, combined with the thin layer of water going downhill, are what create the illusion that the surface of the ramp is not just a glass lid."

pics,3e205p,IanCal,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:42:58 2015 UTC,When I get home tonight I'm going to have to see if my idea for siphoning is actually physically practical   That would be a perpetual motion machine.
pics,3e205p,Toklankitsune,0,Tue Jul 21 17:46:53 2015 UTC,I always Wonder d if something like this would work with capilary action
pics,3e205p,mxzf,9,Tue Jul 21 18:19:27 2015 UTC,"A bit of googling indicates that even if it does work, it'd be pitifully impractical.  The meniscus of water in a glass tube raises ~14/r mm, where r is the radius in mm, which means that a 1mm diameter glass tube would lift water barely over 1"" and a 0.5mm diameter tube would get 2.2"" of rise.    Assuming the effect could make the turn and face back downwards for the water to fall, you'd be getting a slight drip of water from 1-2"" in the air.  So, if it works, it might be enough to be annoying, but it wouldn't make for a good fountain."
pics,3e205p,Toklankitsune,28,Tue Jul 21 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"but what if you had hundreds of them? again super impractical and would be stupidly expensive to make im sure, but was just a thought"
pics,3e205p,mxzf,4,Tue Jul 21 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kind of.  But it's really a gravity driven machine more than anything.  It's not performing work without an opposing force, it's gravity and pressure.  I'm essentially wondering if using a 1-way valve will allow siphoning from one container back into the same container.  I've got some tubing somewhere and might have a one-way valve, so I'll have to test it.  Logically it doesn't sound like it'll work, but stuff like siphoning isn't always apparent why it works at first glance.  At the very least it's worth looking forward to trying as I sit through the work day."
pics,3e205p,Spartan2470,5,Tue Jul 21 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"It sounds as though you're describing something like Boyle's self-flowing flask.  If so, ""It appears to fill itself through siphon action (""hydrostatic perpetual motion"") and involves the ""hydrostatic paradox."" This is not possible in reality; a siphon requires its ""output"" to be lower than the ""input."".  With that said, I've found trying experiments myself often teaches me more than reading about them.  So have fun and let us know if you find anyting unique."
pics,3e205p,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point.  I was hoping I could make it work with a one-way valve or something, but it sounds like that still wouldn't work.    I've always wanted to make a fountain somehow, but it sounds like it does require pumping to actually make one that works long-term.    You're right, it's always fun to experiment, even when it doesn't turn out the way you were hoping.  It's still worth looking into at least, even if it's unlikely to work like I hoped."
pics,3e205p,Pm_me_yo_naughtybits,6,Tue Jul 21 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"but there is no way to get the water back up, yes a siphon will work in one direction but unless that same water is recycled back into the fountain it isn't a fountain just a fancy water spigot."
pics,3e205p,spthirtythree,17,Tue Jul 21 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'll save you some time: the siphon only works if the water is flowing from one body to a second body with a lower surface. If you're trying to siphon water in a circle, it won't work, because at some point the water would have to flow into a body with a higher surface.  If you're thinking there may be some trick by keeping all of the surfaces at the same height, that won't work either because there is a slight loss due to friction between the fluid and the pipe wall."
pics,3e205p,mxzf,60,Tue Jul 21 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I was hoping I could use the pressure differential to make something like this:  |----| |    | |     <- Hole |    | |    | |    | |-^^-|          | |               | |---------------|   Where the ^ is a one-way valve.  And I was hoping the pressure difference from the water flowing out the hole would pull water from the bottom up through the valve with a vacuum, assuming the size of the hole and valve were of the appropriate size to generate the negative pressure.  The more I read, the more uncertain I am that it'd work though.    Oh well, it's at least worth theorizing about and experimenting though"
pics,3e205p,jjbpenguin,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:12 2015 UTC,Nothing that complex.  It actually uses a pump as shown in the second picture.  The defying gravity look is just an optical illusion caused by bubbles below the surface of the inclined plane traveling up the ramp which makes it look like the water is flowing uphill.

pics,3e205p,jjbpenguin,12,Tue Jul 21 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"Siphoning can only work if the outlet is lower than the inlet.  So while it could climb up the incline between 2 layers, it will never reach the initial height so it can't be self sustaining.  You will need some sort of power source to get the water up to its initial maximum height."

pics,3e205p,nobodynose,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:53 2015 UTC,"Or to be even more clear each wedge is full of water.  There's two openings in the end of the wedge where it's the highest.  Water comes out of both openings.  The lower opening makes the water look like it's falling off of the highest point.  The top opening lets the water flow DOWN the ramp (the wrong direction, yes).  Water is constantly pumped back into the wedge which causes water to continuously flow over the ""lip"" and back down the ramp.  The second part of the trick is to shoot bubbles inside the wedge.  Because the wedge is ramped UP, the bubbles travel UP the wedge (remember it's INSIDE the wedge).  Bubbles like to travel up and it'll just flow up the ramp from inside.  The fact that the bubbles are going UP the wedge makes it LOOK like the water flowing DOWN the ramp is actually flowing up."

pics,3e205p,nobodynose,5,Tue Jul 21 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"The pump just needs to take water from a low point and force them into the wedges.  When the wedges get full they'll automatically empty out where they can, which is the top edge."

pics,3e205p,chejrw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:49 2015 UTC,a one way valve on the sucion side of the pump would probably pull in a fair number of air bubbles.  You can probably get away without an air compressor for this build

pics,3e2kem,Ramrod312,27,Tue Jul 21 13:50:03 2015 UTC,I understand 2 of those things
pics,3e2kem,Gockel,34,Tue Jul 21 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"Camera model D3200 by nikon (It's a DSLR camera body). Kit lens means he used the lens that came with the cam when he bought it (they are exchangeable). This lens has a variable focal lenght of 18-55mm, means it goes from wide angle to portrait style focal lenght by using 3x zoom. Exposure time should be clear - the shutter has been open for 20 seconds, allowing light to fall into the camera for a long time.   1600 ISO means the sensor has been set to be relatively sensitive to light (allowing a brighter picture with details in darkness). Aperture f3.5 means relatively large opening in the lens while the photo is taken, so a large amount of light can fall in. 3.5 is not the largest (1.4 is often a number you see with high level lenses), but still pretty wide open (compared to for example f22 - higher number smaller opening)."
pics,3e2kem,drgojirax,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"Let me add to your explanation of aperture.  The number is ratio of the maximum opening.  So the lower the number, the larger the opening.  So if you have an f4, it would be 1/4 of the maximum opening or 25%.  An f2 would 1/2 of the maximum opening, 50%.  More clear?"
pics,3e2kem,NiffyLooPudding,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"That's not quite right. The aperture is a ratio of sorts, but is the ratio between the focal length and the surface area of the element of the focal center of the lens. The ""opening"" you speak of is the aperture, and the number is a ratio equal to focal length/surface area of the glass element at the focal center of the lens.   This is related to the inverse square law of how perceived light brightness decays away from the source, essentially meaning the longer the focal length of a lens, the larger the surface area of the focal center of the lens will need to be to maintain light levels. So an f2 50mm lens will need a much smaller sized focal center element than a 200mm f2 lens, which will need to be pretty big, though both will project the same amount of light for a given area at the convergence point on the film or sensor."

You see our sun at the top right. The Milky Way isn't a sphere ... it's disk.  Look at the ""Edge on view of the Milky Way"" part. If you're inside the Milky Way and look in the ""up"" direction, you'll see dark sky and stars from other galaxies.  If you look in the ""left and right"" direction, you start seeing other stars from your own galaxy.

Andromeda is the closest galaxy and it is a small smudge to most people with basic equipment.  The stars you see are all a part of the milky way galaxy.   When you look up or down across the flat plane of the Galaxy, you see relatively few stars. When you look towards the outside you see through more stars. When you look towards the middle you see the largest density of stars.   People lack a real grasp of the size of space. The voyager spacecrafts are leaving the solar system. They are way beyond Pluto, on the edge of influence from our star, aka the sun. They have been traveling for 40 years. At this rate, they could reach the next closest star, in the milky way galaxy, in 10,000 years. Space is so big it's nearly impossible to grasp. One day Andromeda and the milky way will pass through each other. From what I recall it's likely we won't notice it because of the vast void of space in each. As space continues to expand we eventually won't be able to see any other galaxies, just the starts in our own."

There is the possibility of seeing extra-galactic phenomena while looking ""up"" or ""down"" relative to the galactic plane.  Quasars and type 1a supernovas are able to be seen from other galaxies themselves.  It is true that looking up or down, most of the starts seen will be from our galaxy, and the reason for that is because of how dim the light is by the time it reaches us from other galaxies.  This article has a pretty good picture of what Andromeda would look like if it were crazy bright.  For some more reading, here is Oblers' Paradox with some explanations on why the night sky is so dim when there are so many sources of light."

He upped the ISO to as much as he could have afforded with his camera (3200 or so, hard to tell). Look at the mountain in his picture is basically bunch of noise all around, so he squeezed a lot more light from his stars than you did, because your ISO looks to be at like 800 at most.  Second, he used quite a bit of post-processing, probably made the darks darker, vibrants to the max and so on. Really helps out to contrast the stars against the dark sky."

pics,3e2kem,GruntGuy,11,Tue Jul 21 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, a high ISO is pretty much required unless you want an hour long exposure for star trails or something. Try bumping up to 1600 or 3200 and you should be able to see everything a lot better at night!"

pics,3e2kem,terattt,8,Tue Jul 21 17:55:23 2015 UTC,You should've kept the ISO low and aperture small too.

Exposure time during night photography = star trails, which is exactly what you don't want with a shot of the Milky Way. Using the 400 rule for cropped sensor cameras I was able to have a maximum exposure time of ~22 seconds for 18mm focal length. Making a smaller aperture or lowering ISO would've made the image way too dark to recover."

pics,3e2kem,Globalwrath,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"We'll be going to Lake Tahoe next week, and I'm super excited to do this now. I didn't think a standard SLR would be able to get anything remotely close to this.  My questions, though, is this manually focused? In super dark conditions, my Canon t3i won't focus for shit if I have the lens set on A/F. Also, are you using the ""delay"" setting (sorry, I can't remember what it's called. The setting where you have a 10-29 second delay before the shutter opens) or are you using a remote? I'm asking because even on the best of tripods, I always get a little wiggle in it after I push the button, and it ruins any lowlight pictures I try to take."
pics,3e2kem,Dmitriy11,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"There's a trick for manually focusing star shots! It's super helpful. Switch your camera to Live View (so you can see the picture on the LCD screen rather than through the viewfinder) and use the little zoom button for the screen (that you'd use to zoom into a picture after you've taken it to check it out) to zoom as far in as you can go on a really bright star or the moon. When you're at that point, focus manually so the star is a bright point of light or the moon is in focus. Boom, you're focused perfectly! Just don't touch the focus ring from this point on or turn on auto focus and you'll get perfectly focused star shots.   As for the shutter, I did use a 10 second delay for this. It really, really helps with long exposures. I am investing in a $20 cable release when I get a chance. If you don't have a remote or cable, the 10 second delay is plenty good enough."

Their kids can in theory be enrolled in schools, but even then they can't claim free school meals or uniform support...  If they do want support, they will need to normalise heir presence in the UK, which will generally mean an immigration process, asylum is hard to get, immigration even harder, so broadly they might get some support (housing) temporarily, but obviously if they are removed (or are supposed to be..) they can no longer claim that support either.  It's a different matter if you are talking about inter-EU immigration, and legal immigrants obviously, but for people jumping on lorries, there isn't a whole lot of access to the welfare state, you have to be known to be in the country to get support after all.."

It's just way easier when a government does this (so you can refer to a definitive authority in contracts), instead of several competing companies.  But somehow, when the EU makes rules like this, it's bureaucratic nonsense and a violation of member states' national autonomy. Really? You're going to fight for the right of member states to regulate their own quality classes for fucking cucumbers? That's the worst EU regulation you can think of?  The entire point of the EU is to have laws like this that are commonly accepted as useful but where the specifics are entirely unimportant. It's not productive at all to have different rules in different countries, which would make international trade much harder for no benefit at all.  I can get when people protest EU regulations that actually take away some national autonomy. But the fact that people keep complaining about cucumber regulations is ridiculous."

I was responding to a comment directed at me saying that if I donate clothes ""that"" is where they go. Whatever that means, I'm in the US, so apparently my clothes that I donate go to France, according to the person I was responding to.  All of these people are wearing leather jackets that fit and don't appear to be torn. I do not often see those at my local goodwill and furthermore, most people who wear donated clothes don't hang out in groups where they all have the same style and match each other; they take what they can get.

Bigger and deadlier than your average dog, I'd say, and people are mauled to death by dogs all the time. The lack of human deaths is probably mostly down to behavior and lack of opportunity.

By comparison, German Shepherds top out at about 85 lbs or so and can easily kill an adult."

pics,3e1q3j,Coopernicus,21,Tue Jul 21 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"Probably in the US? In The Netherlands, it's relatively common for women to work on garbage trucks.    That is still 'not very' common, but because the work isn't physically demanding (no lifting anything, they just roll the containers and place them in a line so the truck's mechanism can pick them up two or four at a time), there is no reason they couldn't do it.    Quite a few female students I personally know have done this job for 6 months or a year, because it's decent pay. On top of that, if you claim benefits and there is a shortage of waste service personnel, you eventually have to take the job you're offered, man or woman.  edit: on top of that, what ridiculous photoshoot would shoot from behind the window of a car?  You can see the reflection in the picture..."

pics,3e1q3j,FranciscoBizarro,154,Tue Jul 21 09:46:41 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't know whether or not being a woman and doing a particular job is ""feminism in action"" - that could be a personal thing, whether or not the woman herself was motivated to do so by feminist ideals.  If not, it's just a woman doing a job.  But definitely, definitely, it's beneficial for gender equality when women make in-roads into traditionally male-dominated fields.  It's progress, it sets a precedent, and it makes it more normal for women to participate in that particular field going forward.  So, in that sense, a woman simply doing a job could do more good for feminism than most feminists can with their words alone."
pics,3e1q3j,N4th4niel,103,Tue Jul 21 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"Well I mean without feminism, the woman wouldn't have been able to get the job, so it is still an example of feminism in action."

pics,3e1q3j,Magnum256,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"Well it's the breaking down of gender barriers, whether it's a conscious decision by these particular women to pursue this job for that specific reason or not is irrelevant, the fact is that there was a point in time not so long ago where this would have absolutely never happened. This is the kind of feminism I can get behind; women in traditionally male dominated careers doing the job just as well as the guys. This is equality.   edit: an example from the opposite perspective (men in tradionally female careers) would be Nursing. I hear more and more about men getting into the nursing field, and it carries less social stigma with it than ever before. Really great that this is a time in history where this can happen. Hopefully both genders continue to equally benefit and become more empowered in a fair way."

I work for volvo trucks and over 90% of the labourers are union members, more relevantly the union of my local garbage collection agency just managed to have two executives fired. Apparently 75% of my country's employees are union members, especially in a larger company it's a no brainer to join (in my very unionized sector it's only 30 euro/year), but even in small companies the administrative and legal support in case of firing, unemployment, or just general questions make it worthwile to join."

pics,3e1q3j,forRealsThough,85,Tue Jul 21 15:39:05 2015 UTC,Because its a slippery slope once you acknowledge that a glass floor exists. Now we have to talk about conscription and prison population diversity
pics,3e1q3j,fencerman,119,Tue Jul 21 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"Okay -    Conscription should be banned, but if it happens it should apply equally to everyone. Women not being included is an example of sexism against women that assumes they are incapable of physical jobs.  Excessive imprisonment is a problem in general, and does tend to fall excessively hard on males, especially visible minority males; that should be drastically reduced as well. It's also closely tied to poverty and racism which should also be addressed to avoid any narrow discussions about imprisonment alone."
pics,3e1q3j,whtsnk,71,Tue Jul 21 15:11:35 2015 UTC,I see conscription as sexism against men.
pics,3e1q3j,fencerman,135,Tue Jul 21 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"In a sense, all sexism is against both men and women to some degree or another, since it depends on reinforcing gender roles and assuming all members of either gender are the same.   In the case of conscription, it is based on negative perceptions of women's capabilities, and it also negatively harms men by making them the only group being conscripted.   Of course, that's why feminism is generally a good thing for both genders, since it breaks down the social assumptions on both sides."

But if we really want to talk about these jobs: coal mining, garbage collectors, etc. I think a bigger focus should be placed on making working conditions safer and labor benefits better. No young boy or girl jumps out of bed every morning in the hopes of working at a place that isn't that good to work at."

pics,3e1q3j,Lou__Tennant,18,Tue Jul 21 15:02:36 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that conditions need to be improved in these occupations. However, I think some of the criticism of feminism comes from when feminists ignore poor and low social status men. Feminists often point out that men are more likely to have high paying and high social status jobs. While this is true, why would you ignore the men that have low paying and low social status jobs? If you want scholarships for women in science, shouldn't you also want scholarships for men in areas like nursing, for example? How often do you hear feminists campaigning for this? I certainly don't hear it very often, if ever. In the mainstream media in Australia I often hear about how few billionaire and CEO women there are. Is this really an issue that we should care about? These people make up a very small proportion of the population. Very few men have the opportunity to become billionaires and CEOs too."

And then the brigades all but disappeared, even when the new CEO literally said that free speech isn't what the company is about, which was one of the brigade's main complaints supposedly.  It's apt that we're discussing this in the comments of a picture of people working with garbage because, despite there being good people on this site, I think we are all complicit for not doing more to take out the garbage parts of the community."

I was young enough to appreciate Minecraft and the ""pre-holo-VR age"", where everything wasn't inside your eyeballs ...... but I was old enough to adapt and fully enjoy our current technological era ... one where I can go on Skynet and think [pizza in pants](temporal-link::skynet.pizzainpants.nsa.comcast.com) and find a NSA approved simulated reality experience in 5 miliseconds."

pics,3e1gd1,Neokev,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"This.  When I was little, my father was famous. He was the greatest samurai in the empire. And he was the Shoguns decapitator. He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty one lords. It was a bad time for the empire. The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out. People said his brain was infected by devils. My father would come home, and he would forget about the killings. He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him. Maybe thst was the problem. Then, one night, the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house. They were supposed to kill my father, but they didn't. That was the night everything changed."

""Don't take candy from strangers.""  That's all my parents needed to tell me. I stayed safe and they weren't worried. This was well before cell phones too. Parents are connected to their kids 24/7 nowadays, if anything they should feel safer. If someone kidnapped me when I was a kid, there would be zero chance of tracking my cell phone or someone catching a video of the incident ... nowadays, that's a realistic way to track kids down.  I think the fact that we're exposed to so much more information nowadays is what spurs neurosis in parents. Everyday, thanks to the wide load of information we can get in a day, we're exposed to stories of kidnap and rape and theft and violence. It makes the world we live in seem really dark, and makes parents much more worried.  It's mental, like constantly talking about illness. When you constantly tell people about how they might get sick, eventually they're going to feel as if they're sick.  As for kids not going outside anymore ... it just doesn't happen.  My parents still live in the same house I grew up in. I went over there for lunch yesterday. When I was growing up, a Monday afternoon in July would see the streets packed with kids. We'd be playing Wiffle Ball and basketball, riding bikes and waiting to buy a WWF Ice Cream bar from the ice cream man.  Yesterday, it was tumbleweeds. Nobody was outside. That's the norm now.  Nowadays, when kids are actually outside, they're looking at their phones or iPads. They're not playing sports or exploring, they're simply doing their indoor activities outside.  I feel like an old man talking like this, but it's depressing. The world seemed wondrous for me when I was a kid, with so many nooks and crannies to explore, and memories to be made.  The idea that somewhere a 13 year old is spending his summer sitting in front of the TV watching Breaking Bad on Netflix, instead of going outside and making memories ........ it saddens me.  I know someone will retort with, ""Well, those TV shows provide memories! Let them enjoy their summer how they want!""  No, sorry, it's not the same.  When I was young my parents couldn't keep me inside. They had to stand on their porch and yell for me to come home for dinner at 6pm, and then I went right back outside until the sun went down.  That's a foreign concept to kids today."
pics,3e1gd1,camerota,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, that deserted tumbleweed neighborhood?  The kids grew up and moved out just like you.  Go to one of those new spec home neighborhoods that attract young families and you will be more likely to see a lot of kids outside.  Source:  my childhood neighborhood and my current neighborhood far away both have homes that were built decades ago, and kids grew up.  Last neighborhood I lived in was just getting built and saw kids outside all the time."
pics,3e1gd1,zeno82,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  Whenever I head home I can walk through my town (it's pretty small) and tell the age of the average resident purely by how many kids are playing outside.  If I go to the newer (and generally younger) section of town, there are kids all over the place.  Playing basketball, tag, riding bikes, throwing rocks at cars, ect.  When visiting my folks I routinely catch kids wandering through peoples yards after dark, wanting to stay outside just a little while longer, pretending they don't hear their parents calling for them.  If you head to the area where I grew up, most of the residents are older than my parents.  All the kids have grown up and moved out.  Many of my childhood playmates have their own kids now and are spread across the country.  There are no kids left in my childhood neighborhood.  It seems like a lot of people in this thread go back to their own neighborhood and see there are no longer kids there and assume that means that all kids do is sit in front of the tv now a days.  While that metric has certainly increased in recent years, it is by no means true to say that's all any of them do."
pics,3e1gd1,Silas13013,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Glad I am not the only one who has made that connection.    Yes, kids may stay inside more now, but you can't judge that by going to the same neighborhood you grew up in.  The small neighborhood I'm in right now only has like 8 houses with kids.  The rest are retirees.  But 15 years ago?  Lots of kids.  And its not like we didnt have books, television, and video games when we were kids. I remember exploring the woods nearby all the time, but I also remember playing NES w my friends and their parents shooing us to play outside."

pics,3e1gd1,illuminerdi,8,Tue Jul 21 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot about businesses doing this - basically the corporation or parent company becomes a glorified real estate company and makes their money on renting the land or space to the occupant store, not on the actual products themselves.  The reason being that it's much more steady and consistent income since every store just pays X amount in rent, meaning that profits and losses are a function of store additions and deletions, rather than being a function of consumer whims and shopping trends.  The business world is weird..."

You are totally correct in the land-owning thing, yet there is still a HUGE expectation for your store to do well, and up-sell everything you possibly can. You'll notice Family Video employees will always offer you candy for a special price, a deal for a little bit extra, even free things. Such as, when you rent a game, you get a free dollar movie or if you rent 3 new releases (older new releases/ones still on the new release wall) you can pick another one for free. All these numbers are looked at continuously and they expect you and your store to improve upon them no matter what. The only cool thing was that they did offer a very small commission if you convinced them to get a special (usually just rang up due to them having the required elements)"

First, check out their yelp ratings.  Those aren't people buying porn.  Second, their prices are really great.  Our location always did this thing where you got a free older movie with a new release.  It ended up being like $3 for two movies.  Also, free kids movies is amazing if you have kids.  Finally, our store had customer friendly policies.  We didn't have to pay the fine until it was over $5.  That builds goodwill.  Above and beyond that, though, it's kind of fun to go and pick out a movie at the store in person.  We live a couple of blocks from an amazing library that has a great Blu-Ray selection, and we do this all the time, despite having netflix and being able to torrent whatever for free.  There is something about browsing the aisles with your SO and then debating and settling on a movie that is satisfying."

All you have to do is give a bullshit excuse as to why it was late, and we'll waive it, or simply say ""I'll pay it next time."" The only time you have to pay a ""late"" fee, is if you've had the movie for more than I think it was...4 weeks..? The computer assumes you're never bringing it back, and charges your account the full price of the movie, as if you were buying it from the store. There is no way to waive that, you have to pay that before you can rent again.  The gumball machines (One in every store, has a random color of the week for a free $1 movie rental) Pay for the company's jet fuel....yep. Our jet was powered by quarters.  Also, if you rent a brand new game, there is a deposit on it, (Like $20 or something) that gets refunded when you bring it back, you only have to pay the deposit if you've spend less that $125 in the store on your account with rentals, candy purchases, etc."

pics,3e1gd1,paternal_sugarcane,5,Tue Jul 21 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"Former FamVid manager here. Yes and no. We always did our best to be aware of customers who are flagrant abusers of the system, but every once in a while one would slip through. That being said, if a balance is 60$ (assuming that's not just some arbitrary number) then that isn't so bad, relatively. There are many customers who have racked up hundreds of dollars in late fees. We would never tell you that you cannot rent your movies, at most we would limit you to older new releases or the like until you are able to get your account back in good standing. Also, if you do have a balance of a good amount, talk with your local FamVid employees about it. In many instances they will be willing to split the difference with you."

Get dinner and a movie delivered to you. And maybe a jug of milk too cus you're running low tonight. I wanted to start at least the movie and pizza place. However I would be so broke right now. Thank god I was too young to fulfill that idea. It's great to see someone made it happen! I wish them luck. Probably the only reason they're still going.

Here's a full Resolution Download Link  Ok, sorry to everybody who has been asking questions all night - I went to bed right after I took it and never expected front page status!    So to answer your questions:   It took me 3.5 years to acquire the right combination of skills, gear, location and conditions.  Years 0-1: I lacked the skills.  Years 1-2: I had some skills but my gear wasn't good enough (astrophotography has some unique lens requirements).  Years 2 - 3.5: I could never get the right conditions.  I live in a major city, so I have to plan trips out to dark sites well in advance.  And every time I would drive or fly out somewhere nice and dark, there would be complete cloud cover or haze from forest fires.  Location, Equipment and Settings: I took this photo from a campsite in/around the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota.   It was shot using a Rokinon 24mm f/1.4 lens mounted on a Nikon D610, using the following settings:  F/2.0, 20 second exposure @ ISO 2500. I did not use a star tracker. Other:  A lot of you have pointed out that there are literally thousands of similar pictures of the milky way out there.  You are absolutely correct!  And most of them are even better than mine.  But in the same way that the existence of incredible works of literature like The Count of Monte Cristo or Harry Potter doesn't stop new authors from writing and being proud of their work, I won't stop trying to take great photos. Uniqueness(?): A lot of you have noticed two things: the existence of clouds and the existence of two streaks of light (one vertical in the middle left of the frame and one in the top right).  These are actually satellites and while some people think think they are blemishes, I quite like them.  It's a reminder that we as humans are making progress and that one day we will be able to see even more magnificent things in our galaxy.     Edit:  I'd be happy to post this full resolution for people to download.  Which service should I use though?  My own website would crash from the Reddit hug-o-death."

One day a man looked up from his porch during his daily re-read of the most recent newspaper. He saw a man walking by with a cart full of extremely low quality gemstones, little more than colored glass.  As he watcued, people came up to the man, and in exchange for a pleasant word or a photograph deposited a gemstone into his cart.   'Why does he work so hard to get gems?', the man on the porch wondered aloud. Everybody and thier mum has backyards full of them.'  His neighbor, who happened to be sitting on his own porch reading his own version of the days paper, overheard the first man. 'Everyone knows the stones are useless, some just make a hobby of collecting them'. He replied.  'Huh.' Grunted the first man. He looked up at his neighbor and his eyes widened in surprise. 'Say, are you wearing a horses mask today?'  'Why yes, I am.' His neighbor responded cooly.  The first man chuckled. He reached into his pocket.  'Here, want a tigers-eye?'"

So, galactic center is only visible for about half the year. Out of those 6 or so months, you'll have about 18 nights of truly dark moonless skies. Then you have to factor in weather; Clouds, humidity, etc.   Also, depending on where you live, you may have to drive a couple hours to get away from the light polluted skies. What if the months new moon falls on a Tuesday night and you were unable to take off work the following day. Well, there's always next month. Let's hope it's not as wet and humid as June!"

pics,3e115c,KarmaBot200,180,Tue Jul 21 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, sorry to everybody who has been asking questions all night - I went to bed right after I took it and never expected front page status!    Edit 2: OP Delivers.  Here's a full Resolution Download Link  So to answer your questions:   It took me 3.5 years to acquire the right combination of skills, gear, location and conditions.  Years 0-1: I lacked the skills.  Years 1-2: I had some skills but my gear wasn't good enough (astrophotography has some unique lens requirements).  Years 2 - 3.5: I could never get the right conditions.  I live in a major city, so I have to plan trips out to dark sites well in advance.  And every time I would drive or fly out somewhere nice and dark, there would be complete cloud cover or haze from forest fires.  Location, Equipment and Settings: I took this photo from a campsite in/around the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota.   It was shot using a Rokinon 24mm f/1.4 lens mounted on a Nikon D610, using the following settings:  F/2.0, 20 second exposure @ ISO 2500. I did not use a star tracker. Other:  A lot of you have pointed out that there are literally thousands of similar pictures of the milky way out there.  You are absolutely correct!  And most of them are even better than mine.  But in the same way that the existence of incredible works of literature like The Count of Monte Cristo or Harry Potter doesn't stop new authors from writing and being proud of their work, I won't stop trying to take great photos. Uniqueness(?): A lot of you have noticed two things: the existence of clouds and the existence of two streaks of light (one vertical in the middle left of the frame and one in the top right).  These are actually satellites and while some people think think they are blemishes, I quite like them.  It's a reminder that we as humans are making progress and that one day we will be able to see even more magnificent things in our galaxy.     Edit:  I'd be happy to post this full resolution for people to download.  Which service should I use though?  My own website would crash from the Reddit hug-o-death."

pics,3e115c,stillsleeping,19,Tue Jul 21 09:39:30 2015 UTC,I'm going to take a guess and say this was a multiple exposure. Anything longer than 20+ seconds would usually need a startracker and then an exposure for the trees.
pics,3e115c,Groundchucker,7,Tue Jul 21 07:00:02 2015 UTC,Don't know why you're getting down voted. You're right. But this is probably single exposure because of the satellite
pics,3e115c,taintedblu,5,Tue Jul 21 08:24:18 2015 UTC,Why does the satellite tell you it's a single exposure?  Serious
pics,3e115c,SirFappleton,9,Tue Jul 21 08:36:40 2015 UTC,A multiple exposure is a picture where you stack 20-400 pictures of the same object to reduce noise which results in better details. And since things like satellites are moving pretty quickly and will probably be visible in 3-4 pictures you wont see them in the final image
pics,3e115c,SteveOtts,4,Tue Jul 21 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"Astrophotographer here, you can go to 30 seconds without star trails if you are using a wide enough lens like a 14mm."

We waited till she was out and put in the rocks, next day we figured out she can move them enough to get in and out of the hole still. It's great, I don't have to feel bad for evicting our guard toad, and the area near my driveway looks landscaped. Toadbros for life."
pics,3e0kqo,Descriptions_of_Gifs,6,Tue Jul 21 05:49:04 2015 UTC,Toads can travel a mile or more away from their water source and their skin is less permeable so they lose less water. As long as they have a damp place to hide during the day and a light source for bugs at night they are happy.

He has emerged from under a filthy burrow of concrete and brick, and gazes out at the world he once knew.   There was a marsh here once. A home. Once he fathered twenty-three children here, but every one of them is dead now. Every one he once knew is gone, killed to pave way for this dead temple to those who destroyed them.  A woman kneels down and snaps a photograph of him. He has too much dignity to deign a look her way. He stares out at the marsh, thinking of his revenge.  He whispers a quiet croak to himself. Soon."

pics,3e0kqo,CallMeTedTurner,30,Tue Jul 21 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"It has been a week since that fateful night when Martha and I went to Fly Queen for a fly sundae.   We had been in love since we were tadpoles. It was born unto us from The Fates. We were meant to be. The years passed and our brood grew plentiful, for we spawned scores of young, seventeen of which lived long enough to spawn us grandtadpoles. Four of those have lived to mate.   That fateful night, Martha and I spoke of our ageing, joking that soon, Death will come for us naturally, and not at the hands of the human's car tires or the jaws of the alligators or the beaks of the heron like many of our friends and our young.   Martha promised me this. She said, ""When we pass from This Mortal Coil, we shall become new stars in the sky, it is The Gift Bestowed upon us, from The Frog God, those that die of age.""   After saying this, a star brighter than daytime shined upon us, hypnotic in its brightness. Martha ascended towards the light, but I did not.   The light faded, became red.   ""Martha, no! It is not our time!"" I pleaded. The red light grew more distant, and I made chase. It stopped in front of a human's dwelling and I followed.   Into the human's yard I went, hearing the screams of our kind. I found Martha there, slain and thrown like rubbish upon an automobile like the ones that had ended the lives of many of my children. She lived yet, but the wounds were mortal.   ""Gary,"" she gasped. ""We shall see each other again in the sky.""   With that, Martha was no longer of this Earth.   Now, I hunt the Heavens for my beloved. I hunt for her star which has yet to come."

pics,3e0gxf,PussyWhistle,235,Tue Jul 21 03:35:20 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Once you pass 100k karma you start with a few features and get more as you pull more karma. I think it tops out at around 750k or so.

However, no matter what the husband does sexually, the woman never achieves orgasm. Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to ask the rabbi. The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion: ""Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm."" They go home and follow the rabbi's advice. They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. But it doesn't help and she is still unsatisfied. Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi. ""Okay,"" says the rabbi, ""let's try it reversed-Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them."" Once again, they follow the rabbi's advice. The young man gets into bed with the wife and the husband waves the towel. The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and the wife soon has an enormous, room-shaking, screaming orgasm. The husband smiles, looks at the young man and says to him triumphantly, ""Now THAT'S how you wave a towel!"""

The trip was a big thing, with a couple of dozen parents and kids in vans and trucks hauling tools and materials. the first night we all had a nice dinner, then camped out in the local church.  Well, sadly, the expedition was robbed in the night and the thieves got away with a lot of tools and materials. :-(  Fortunately for us, the little blinking red LED on my van (with associated ""security system"" label) seems to discourage them and we didn't lose a thing. And yup, it was nothing more than a blinking LED and label, if you'd busted out the window or opened the door nothing would have happened. Lesson Learned..."

They just drove around the middle class neighborhoods and knew most of the people were working and the Kindle Fires were going to be delivered that day.  What they didn't really take into account was that Amazon just bricked the devices and sent out replacement units.  I believe they caught the driver of the truck but never did see a follow up on what happened about it on the news.  I did get a chuckle out of it."

I knocked on their door, they weren't home. So I just took it. Even though it was mine, I still felt sketchy doing that and expected to have the cops called on me. For some reason, it is really only fed ex that messes this up. UPS doesn't have a problem, and vary rarely usps has a mix up, but we always get it worked out."

In fact we now have a service where you just get a virtual street address issued to you that routes your packages to a post office of your choosing to begin with.

One was Amazon, one was Zappos and another was a custom-made lamp shade that we had been waiting like 8 weeks for.  That one really pissed her off.  The next day, she put out an empty box, stuffed it with some trash for weight and put a note in it that said we had them on camera, and we were going to take their photo to the police, show it to nearby neighbors, apartment managers, and employers in an effort to catch them.  It also said, if they brought the boxes back, we would let it go.  The next day, Thanksgiving morning, she opened the front door, and all our shit was back. It was pretty awesome..."

pics,3dzinb,gravshift,14,Tue Jul 21 12:53:57 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I see two very divergent perspectives, here.    Option 1  The motivation's good, but the substance is being undercut by the style.  First, ""raped"" means something - and it's unlikely it's being used correctly.  (If it is, my objection is withdrawn - with my apologies.)  Abuse of tasers when the situation should instead be deescalated without (even nonlethal) violence is already a big enough problem that exaggeration just isn't necessary.  It just gives those who would argue with the core message something to latch onto, a way to talk themselves into ignoring the information intended to be conveyed.  That same reason is why grammar and spelling also matter.  Does the fact that ""notice"" and ""taser"" are misspelled make the message being communicated any less important?  Of course not!  But it does let people talk themselves into ignoring the message, via an implicit ad hominem.  Good message, but the manner in which it's being communicated undermines its effectiveness.    Option 2  Except actively-chosen style also means something.  Who's to say we should ignore it?  That the individual who designed, paid for, and put up the sign didn't care enough about his or her own message to give the means by which it was to be communicated enough attention validly speaks toward the strength of their convictions - and the degree of care and attentiveness we can expect in their other dealings.  If they can't be bothered to write out a sign correctly, why should we trust them to be rational and dispassionate in their understanding of the situation that led to their being tased?  The manner in which this message is being communicated provides insight about the speaker, and, therefore, perhaps there's more to the story than a direct interpretation would suggest.    Edit And option 3, of course: Lulz, Alabama and spelling and a beaten up truck."

Supposedly, one of the best demographics for scammers to prey on is men between the ages of 30 and 50, because those guys are often in positions where they're making decisions about large amounts of money on a regular basis, so they'll willingly send a couple hundred bucks via email without giving it a second thought."

It could show them that if you know where to look, you can always find people who have similar interests.  Maybe a few seniors in your class could come out of it with pen pals, who could help them practice emailing.  A lot of redditors (myself included) would love to be helpful and make that connection.    Reddit would probably be very interested in their unique perspective: the challenges they might face if they're new to computers in general, and the ""discoveries"" they have when they find a new interest.  Being able to see the internet from the eyes of someone who's just learning about it is often heartwarming.  The Finebros ""Elders react"" video series is living proof of how entertaining this can be to the average joe.    And an AMA would undoubtedly result in a nice list of resources or websites for your class to try out.  Who knows what the users of reddit can offer them?"

One day the older guy says he bought his girlfriend a new Samsung phone (when they came out with that exciting ""big one"" a few years back) and was able to get one for himself also.  He barely knew how to use the flip phone he had before.  That said, for being in his 70s, he picked up the phone pretty quickly with some help.    Not long after he got it, we were talking about our childhoods growing up in small town Montana.  Both of us lived in rural places before many of the things we take for granted now arrived.  His story involved his memories of when his hometown first got power.  When returning from a trip, they would come over a hill in the car and they would see their little town all lit up with lights.  He said the first time he saw it there was a song called ""Harbor Lights"" on the car's radio and it was like magic to him.  I grabbed his big, new smartphone and went to Youtube...typed in Harbor Lights...and had the man weeping within 10 seconds.    I love technology and it is amazing where we have come in such a short time....but yeah...those devices are capable of so much more than leaving a bad pho review or taking pictures of fat people in Wal Mart.

The castle was built in 16. century and heavily renovated in 19. century. In 16. century it was still called Czech lands and was part of Habsburg monarchy. In 19. century was part of Austria-Hungary but still in Czech part of if.

I had a fellow TL enthusiast switch those out for me when I first bought my TL last year. Supposed to be an item that can dramatically increase shifting quality due to known problems with these pressure switches which can be culprit in the bad TL tranny issue known in the community.
pics,3dz1dg,nist7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:07 2015 UTC,Yea Ive been on acurazine for a couple years. Have modified headlights and tails from Bruce on there. Also been swapping pressure switches every year (takes 20min) and using type f transmission fluid. Still have a harsh downshift at 40mph it will skip from 5th to 3rd. Been like that for a couple years
pics,3dz1dg,durtydiq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:20 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'm gonna have to wait a bit until I can do some more mods due to a bit tight financial situation.  Im loving what some people are doing to the TL so I'll need to get on that later.  But so far my trans has been lucky. Its a 06 base TL with the 5AT and the last owner had it serviced regularly entire life at local dealer and so far trans is shifting very smooth. Gonna do some more drains and flushes this weekend probably.   Every year pressure switches seems a bit frequent though? Though it would be ok every 60k mi or so?
pics,3dz1dg,nist7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"Try to go with coilovers, it was my best purchase. :)  I drive about 30k a year so pressure switches arent a must but doesnt bother me to do since they are about 60-70 bucks to do and 20min of my own time. In the thread on azine about pressure switches they claim its more about year rather mileage but can be done every other year."

They told us flat out that it doesn't cover any commercial activities and that the non-coverage of things like that is a nation wide standard.  (we ended up paying out of pocket for all damages to both cars, luckily, no injuries.)  Sure, when you get the job, they ask to see proof of insurance before they'll let you drive.  But they don't check to make sure it's the correct insurance.  Now, every time I see a teenager in a beat up car doing delivery, I assume they're uninsured and if they hit me, I'm just up a creek."

If a Smart gets rammed by an SUV, the energy may not be enough to destroy the frame, but all that energy cannot be absorbed by the car's smaller frame.  The energy is transferred into the airbags, seatbelts, and passengers.  Which, regardless of how much padding you have, being rapidly accelerated in the opposite direction you were travelling will cause damage to the human, and if at highway speeds, potentially death.  Especially if the recipient of a T-bone."

pics,3dym7o,Oh_Look_A_Camera,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Try again.  After 12 years in the fire service, cutting people out of cars, I can see that there is significant impingement into the passenger compartment.  There is buckling at the A-post/roof junction, Firewall/Rocker panel junction, and bucking near the Nader bot which indicates that there is outward movement of the lateral strengthening structures built into the doors.  The position of the dummy implies lower extremity defect as well as femur/pelvic/lumbar spine implications.  Displacement of the steering wheel and column suggest significant upper body impact as well as the markings on the airbag suggesting deflection to the left side instead of a square impact.    Crumple Zones are designed to absorb energy without impingement into the passenger compartment.  This vehicle may have had crumple zones but they have been defeated by the energy imparted on the vehicle."

pics,3dym7o,doubleUsee,6,Tue Jul 21 10:19:23 2015 UTC,I've debated getting one just cause of the long commute. Hows the gas mileage? I was told they can be dangerous at times on HWYs when merging with traffic just because they struggle to get up to speed.
pics,3dym7o,zeke342,6,Tue Jul 21 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"Mileage depends heavily on how you drive and where you drive. I get mid 30s most of the time, but if I spend a lot of my time in stop and go/city traffic it's more like 40mpg. They do take premium though.  It's not a fast car, but I haven't ever had problems matching speed merging onto a highway. You just have to get used to flooring it so the automated manual drops a couple of gears, or just use the flappy paddles and do it yourself.  edit: I should have mentioned 34-35mpg is my number with most of my driving 75mph or greater. I'm not a good example of mileage on these probably."

pics,3dym7o,erickgramajo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is for all intents and purposes an automatic. It's very different mechanically than what you're thinking of from the eclipse though. There is a dry clutch like a normal manual transmission car would have, but it is controlled by the computer instead of pedal. Only mentioned it because it's one of the strange things about the car."
pics,3dym7o,smerf,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"There's no clutch pedal, but there is a clutch. Basically, you can drive 'automated', but that just means that the car in pushing in the clutch and shifting gears for you. Or, you can actually shift the gears like you're driving a manual using the flappy paddles or the gear shifter, except you don't have to push in a clutch pedal. It's literally an automated manual."
pics,3dym7o,canteen007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"It's a lot worse than it sounds. The transmission in these is seriously the worst of any vehicle i've ever driven, and i've driven everything from beat up shitty trainer motorcycles to city buses.   A real automatic shifts gears basically instantly unless it's slipping. The smart transmission takes like, seriously, 2-3 seconds to shift sometimes. And it always seems to choose to do this when you're coming up a steep hill and going through an intersection... Then suddenly, you have no power.   It has to pop out the clutch, rev match, then pop it back in. This also involves throttle control, so the throttle always feels INCREDIBLY laggy unless you're in ""manual"" mode in a low gear."
pics,3dym7o,thinkythought,4,Tue Jul 21 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Huh I would have expected more mpg.  My Kia Rio hatchback gets about that now and sits 4 comfortably with plenty of room for storage in the back.  I wish it had more power but it's surprisingly light on its feet given what a small engine it has in it.  Of course, gotta disengage Eco Mode if you want anything resembling quick acceleration, but even still it gets close to 30 mpg in my experience.  I just wish the gas tank was a little bigger.  I swear it's got like a 10 gallon tank in the thing."
pics,3dym7o,angrydeuce,4,Tue Jul 21 01:32:27 2015 UTC,Huh I would have expected more mpg.   wait till you find out they take 91 octane fuel!
pics,3dym7o,callmesov,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:51 2015 UTC,"Man, fuck that.  That's like 60 cents more per gallon than 87 around here.  I don't see how you're saving anything if you're actually putting in 91 every time you fill up, especially when you're giving up seating room for two."
pics,3dym7o,angrydeuce,2,Tue Jul 21 09:38:05 2015 UTC,You probably could use 87 but the car is going to change ignition timings and lead to even worse gas mileage...

pics,3dym7o,JonnyShips,2,Tue Jul 21 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Talk of the Smart Car gearbox brings up memories of early new top gear Smart Roadster. That gas mileage seems awful honestly. I get 34 MPG minimum with my manual Mazda3 Hatch, 38+ on a long trip if you keep it at 65 MPH on cruise. And it runs on 87 octane."
pics,3dym7o,a_lol_cat,3,Tue Jul 21 01:25:47 2015 UTC,My mileage is probably quite a bit lower than others. I  spend a great deal of my time keeping up with traffic at 75+mph.  I like strange cars. That was a big factor in picking this car.
pics,3dym7o,smerf,4,Tue Jul 21 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"the gas mileage is heavenly. I don't know about miles and gallons (being as European as I am), but I know that on the long stretch averaging about 60 mph it takes about one liter per 13.5 miles. Which, is not much. It accelerates like a beast until you hit 50 mph, after which it loses it's power really, I prefer going slightly under the speed limit on the highway, so that I won't have to pass people (going from 60 to 65 takes it's time). It's not really a highway monster, it's got a top speed of about 75, but honestly you don't want to be on that, it's not comfortable and bad for the engine too.   Merging into traffic hasn't been an issue for me, it gets up to acceptable speed very quickly. The main issue I have is people not giving me right of way because they underestimate me. For the rest, you can park just about anywhere, the car is light, and small, and surprisingly fun to drive."
pics,3dym7o,doubleUsee,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"I was hoping some km and liters since you're European. Your liters per miles are confusing; are you from the UK? Anyway, there's going to be some conversion on what follows:  I routinely (unless it's winter) get 37.3 mpg going 68.8 mph on the highway with my Hyundai Elantra GT (hatchback). That's even with the AC on. I can get much better than that going slower; my best is around 47 mpg going at 56.25 mph . I'm not sure I would be willing to sacrifice the comfort and convenience of having space in order to get a few more mpg."
pics,3dym7o,Max_Thunder,3,Tue Jul 21 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"The comfort isn't a big sacrifice - though it depends on the environment. It's a bit bumpy, but that teaches you to drive more careful - which is better anyways. The seats are great, heating works like a charm, and it's overall comfortable and not cramped. I'm 6""3'  and I can't drive in it with the seat all the way back. I bought it from my 6""5 teacher, who also loved it. I've driven it with my dad, and even with two broad-shouldered men you're not packed together. The space thing depends on what you do with your car. I'm living with my parents, if I need to transport big loads I use my dad's car. But 99% of things I can take in the Smart; groceries, DIY supplies, computers - normal loads are no problem. it becomes an issue if it's your only car and you want to transport bigger objects (furniture, planks/beams llonger than 2 meter, bulk loads) or trailers (my 2003 smart ForTwo isn't allowed to haul any trailers at all).   I found a converter for our things. I'm doing 51.75 MPG on longer hauls at 60 MPH. on short hauls with lots of starts and stops it dips to like 50 MPG. Do note I drive an automatic (it shifts for me) and it's not switching gears as efficiently as I would do it myself.   The AC hasn't made a notable impact on fuel use age, it's not a very heavy one, I feel.  The engine has it's pro's and cons too. It's a high RPM motor, it won't mind if you it 6000 rpm every now and then, giving it a very sportsy feel. However mine does take a bit of engine oil overtime, and the mechanic said that this is normal. It's a hassle to add oil every few weeks. The engine doesn't have a belt, but a chain instead (I think it's the Timing Chain, but I'm not sure) so that doesn't need replacing as often as a belt.   I'm not from the UK, I'm from mainland Europe.  If you're very interested, feel free to ask whatever questions you have. (i'll be answering in about 8 hours, going to bed now)"

The thing is huge on the inside and has enough pick up where its not scary merging. U turns are a blast because you can just do circles in intersections. My biggest complaint when I drove it was the tranny is weird and the peddles have large dead spots sorta thing right off the start.

It's also so small that I actually still smile while parking.

Not that that's the military's primary purpose, but it's still important.  More important still is that massive military's role in preventing war, and not just attacks on the US. What exactly is preventing Putin from claiming even larger chunks of territory than he has lately? The US military is part of it.   Why not cut a chunk of that off and give it to NASA   I agree that we should. But keep in mind that there are plenty of people in this world who don't give a shit about space, but care a whole lot about murdering innocent people who don't happen to share their religious views.

pics,3dxx6r,madhatter703,93,Mon Jul 20 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Was this actually your drawing at Thatch Caye? I went to Coco Plum Caye last October for my honeymoon and walked across the shallow area between the two islands to check out Thatch Caye. They were doing renovations at that point so I think it was close until Spring. Did you have a good time?
pics,3dxx6r,madhatter703,169,Mon Jul 20 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"No way! Small world :) Yup, /u/AlexRuiz drew this in the guestbook at Thatch Caye a few days ago. We paddleboarded around Coco Plum and wondered what a stay there might be like :) What a beautiful little area of Belize!  It's still under construction, but even with all the construction going on it was an absolutely wonderful stay. The staff was just incredible, the accommodations were very comfortable, and we really, really enjoyed our time there. We look forward to going back once renovations are complete!   That little shallow part was one of our favorite hang-outs!"
pics,3dxx6r,tokomini,34,Mon Jul 20 15:28:42 2015 UTC,"That is awesome! What an amazing place. Belize itself is so beautiful. Coco Plum was awesome. The rooms were very nice, clean, and accommodating. Had an AC unit in each hut and pretty much anything else you can think of that would be in a resort/hotel room - except it was just a free standing hut with a front porch and Hammock.   The food was amazing. All freshly made by the cooks there. And the bar tenders and wait staff were as friendly as it gets.   Did you go to the main land at all?"
pics,3dxx6r,madhatter703,33,Mon Jul 20 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"They told us Coco Plum and Thatch Caye used to be one island, but a hurricane separated it into two! I can't imagine what being out on an island like that during a hurricane would be like.   And yeah! We went into Dangriga, ate beans and rice in town (so good!), visited Marie Sharp's factory (and now regret not buying a ton more hot sauce and jam while there...), and then ziplined in Bocawina National Park. I wish we had spent more time on the mainland! Next time :)"
pics,3dxx6r,thisguy883,15,Mon Jul 20 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Sweet! We did the Zip-lining thing too, as well as Cave tubing. We didn't see Marie Sharp's factory, but sailed by her private Island retreat on our way to some snorkeling. (Which was absolutely amazing) Unfortunately, we weren't as well prepared and didn't have any water proof cameras...Definitely needed in the rain forest.  I can't imagine what its like during a hurricane either because we were there for a Tropical Depression and it was pretty intense already especially knowing I'm going to sleep in a hut on an island..."

But if you can farm and sustain a life in the country side, or if you are rich and can buy a beach house haha then Belize is absolutely beautiful.   The landscape is made up of mountainous rain forests with sparse little farming villages. There are also orange tree farms everywhere. Belize is also home to the world's best living Reef. (That's what the locals told me as they take great pride in protecting the reef as opposed to Australia) Also, everyone there speaks English and its a 2:1 exchange rate on the dollar."

They also provide you with a list of fun adventures and things you can do both on the island and on the mainland. I really, really recommend it! There are other resorts along all of those cayes, and I HIGHLY recommend Belize! It's currently their rainy season though, so take that into account!"

You have YouTube, too, which he didn't have, and there are countless tutorials and free resources to teach you the basics.  Go for it.

For instance, the shapes of all the roles in the first picture are fairly irregular. Don't get me wrong though, everything is still looking great and you'll only get better. You absolutely nailed the roll in the 4th picture. That one looks perfect!  The majority of sushi restaurants would be perfectly happy to serve these, and I as a customer would be perfectly happy to have those served to me.  Just a bit of constructive criticism, not trying to be negative. You've clearly got a knack for making sushi. With a bit more practice (or maybe just a little bit of extra care) you'll have all those pieces looking identical in no time! Plus, it's FAR easier to make good food in a restaurant setting where you've got a workspace, all the ingredients, etc. I'm assuming part of inconsistency is just because you have to prepare all that shit at home.  good luck, hope you get the position!

pics,3e0j3z,TohkYuBong,7,Tue Jul 21 02:50:24 2015 UTC,"No problem man! And honestly, consistency is literally one of the easiest things to improve upon.  You clearly have knife skills, and you clearly can make great-looking and delicious rolls. I'm not sure what the accepted name for this roll is, but it takes a lot of attention to detail and skill, just like most of the other rolls.  You've got the skill, you just have to decide to use it every single time you make a roll! It comes down to attention span or laziness (also, making shit at home really takes a toll. After tons of hours preparing all the ingredients its easy to go 'fuck it'). I'm sure you can identify which rolls aren't consistent. All it will come down to is how often you decide to apply your skills =D  If you're consistent every time, you've already got the skill to be better than 4/5 sushi chefs. Capitalize on that man!"

pics,3e0j3z,goatcoat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"Google it and just dive in.  I have been making it a few months now, so let me give you a couple pointers I wish I had when I started:  Buy a rice cooker, I paid like $35 for mine and it makes perfect rice every time.  If you buy a 50 pack of nori you get a free rolling mat, that's $11, don't buy some starter kit, it's a big waste of cash.  All you really need is the mat, the nori, a good sharp knife and the rice cooker.  Before you spend dough on sashimi grade fish, just get some fake crab sticks, sushi rice ($2.48 for a 2lb bag at Wal-Mart), a cucumber, and a ripe avocado, you can now, for literally $12 in materials, make about 6-8 ""california rolls"".  Sushi doesn't have to be expensive!"

pics,3e1jhk,Dinosoarman,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"I live in D.C. and brought my friend from out of town to see the monuments. We waded RIGHT in. It was basically 4,000 degrees and not all of the water fountains by the mall work. Honestly, everyone did it and I didn't think it was disrespectful. No one was ""wading"" out past more than a couple feet. No one was playing in the water or doing anything besides posing for pictures or cooling off. No guards/MPD were asking anyone to stop doing it.   It actually was a lot easier to reflect on their sacrifice with your feet in the water since you weren't concentrating on how ungodly hot it was. You can still be respectful even though the government has decided the best way to keep the pool & fountains in tip top shape is to keep people out of it. I'd rather spend a little money allowing people to not get heat stroke, personally."
pics,3e1jhk,Aztecc,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the problem. The Mall is HUGE. From the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, in hot, swamp-ass weather, with no place to cool yourself down.   If they want this to stop, make a place specifically designed to allow folks to relax / cool down before continuing on down the Mall. How about a mist-spewing shallow pool dealie that gives you a chance to chill in between monuments."

In which case, he's a masochistic jackass, because he just ordained I'd say that.  Two, our consciousness is the result of a domino effect of physical, electrical, and chemical reactions. One stimulus causes a series of reactions we perceive as thoughts. This has more interesting applications. For example, if someone is a 'bad person', then his chemical reactions are predetermined to result in an action with negative consequences for society. Can we 'reprogram' that, so that instead he becomes a 'good' person? Or is it better to merely excise them from society?"

Generally speaking the layout person should catch this and move it or talk to the section editor and ask for copy to be moved around to prevent this.  In some extreme cases, when contracts permitted and they usually have a lot of wiggle in them anyway, I would pull one ad for the week entirely (we were a weekly paper) and run the ads in opposite weeks so they never appeared in the same paper.  In other words, this is either 2 papers stuffed together to look like the same edition or a stupid layout person/team."

pics,3dxke2,Minardi-DK,72,Mon Jul 20 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe not the editor, but somebody should have caught it. It's not as easy as you think though. Typically there are competitive separation policies in place (as a hypothetical, Ford would have in their contract, ""Must be the first automotive ad, and have 3 pages minimum separation from other automotive ads""). So if it was a simple competitive issue, the ad director or publisher or someone on the revenue side (edit being the other side), would see the layout, and say, ""We can't have two car company ads on opposite pages. Call Chevy and tell them we have to move them a few pages further back than usual, but we'll upgrade them to a right hand page"" or something along those lines. When this paper was laid out, the company names were there as a placeholder, and they don't compete, so no red flags were raised. With everything being digital these days, the actual ads may not have even been seen until the paper was being laid out for print, and the person doing the layout doesn't know/doesn't care about ad content, just that the creative meets spec, and he has it on time.   If this happened in the US (and I only say that because I know the US industry policies), both companies would get make goods (free ads or something later on) because of this."

If this happened to my client, as long as the advertisers aren't in the same business sphere, I would do a placement upgrade for both and I would address layout to prevent further issues. I may even recommend a change in creative to differentiate the ads and their overall branding. In all honesty, in this case, it may likely catch more attention than not for both advertiserd. In terms of branding, this is funny and eye catching enough to garner some good top of mind awareness."

Newspaper will not be in any way be involved in ad creation, neither would a client want that (if an ad goes in ten different newspaper, then each ad is created separately by the individual newspapers?!). The ads were most probably done by different ad agencies, at different places, so very very unlikely that it was done by same person.  Its the editorial team which should have caught it, unless it played out like what u/DumbStupidBrain points out.  [Edit] Yes, of course for small local newspapers, the newspapers themselves would create an ad for next door Mom-and-Pop bakery shop.

The point being journalistic integrity of not having advertising effect the articles, etc. I will also say each page is laid out separately.  You wouldn't ever see the two pages next to each other on screen... you wouldn't until it was printed.  If the ads were made in-house, this should have been caught, but they probably weren't.  Two separate companies sending in ads... the layout designer is just given the size of the ads, and lays out the boxes where the ads will go on each page.  Each page is proofed by itself before going to the printer.  It's entirely possible the two pages were proofed by two different people.  It's easy to see how this could happen."

pics,3dxke2,SovietK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's fair, it wouldn't make the client happy if they didn't have the decency to alert both clients BUT unless you've ever worked a print day/deadline day (yes, usually clients leave it until print day to get the ad across to you) then you can see why pulling a FULL PAGE AD can be seen as a massive no-can-do. What they should have done was move the ad as a compromise, but (usually) to find another client to fill a full page ad on print day, you're having a laugh. At the very least you'd need to bump up a half page ad for free to a full page to cover it, you'll need to hope they have a different formatted ad else you'd have to bump up a QUARTER page ad to a full page (portrait->portrait).  Again though, generally speaking, the publisher doesn't care what your ad looks like, sometimes they will kick back if it's under 300dpi, but usually if the timing is off they just won't care.  PS. The language on this particular photo looks like this might not come from a slick first world country."
pics,3dxke2,overcloseness,0,Mon Jul 20 21:42:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I would just expect them to move it to a different page. I'll admit though I care way less about ads on print day. Ideally they should all be in place by then. I'm a Layout Editor myself.

pics,3dxke2,theidleidol,15,Mon Jul 20 13:39:45 2015 UTC,It's clearly a newspaper. Aren't newspapers like that in the States?

pics,3dxke2,SQUID_FUCKER,48,Mon Jul 20 18:47:46 2015 UTC,It's an English daily newspaper in Malaysia called the New Straits Times (NST). Adverts in Malaysia are often multi-lingual partially because Malaysians generally speak between 2 to 4 languages daily with their preferred languange differing depending on their ethnicity.  Also the NST was a once great paper that is now a super politically biased paper full of garbage - not surprised that stuff like this happens.

pics,3dxke2,anacche,8,Mon Jul 20 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"No, this is just a case of not having a large enough stock photo library.  Malay stock photos are increasingly hard to come by, and especially so for Hari Raya themes. This photo is from inmagine (or Corbis), and it's one of the only few sets that comes in a series of several shots. I've used it before as well, and coincidentally, have done ATL work for both MCIS and Uda.  Many corporate companies just won't shell out money for a new studio shot, and opt instead for stock photos. Hence, the continual nightmare of seeing another company (same industry worst case i.e. banking) use the same stock."

I had to ponder a bit why the building would not allow two entirely different films to use their building.  My conclusion was that it was to prevent this kind of thing happening - two movies released the same year that looked too similar?  That it was something the studio contracts with the building tried to prevent. My best guess."

pics,3dxpx4,wybird,26,Mon Jul 20 18:16:49 2015 UTC,Additional fun fact: the name Audi was suggested by Horch's son who was doing his Latin homework while they were trying to decide what to call the company.

It is a parody/exaggeration of the Edsel, a similarly disastrous automobile designed by Ford Motor Company.  http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer  The storyline of a controversially styled car causing the company to fail both echoes that of the Edsel and the Tucker Torpedo. The Edsel was a controversially styled car that bore the name of Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, and is now considered one of the biggest car flops in history. Production of the Tucker Torpedo, which introduced many new features, was shut down amidst scandal and accusations of stock fraud in 1949.[3] Homer wants the horns of the car he is designing to play the traditional Spanish folk corrido ""La Cucaracha"".[5] The Pope shows up for the unveiling of Homer's new car.[5] Herb berates his staff for suggesting that the company name a new car ""Persephone"" after the Greek goddess of fertility in Greek mythology. Herb tells the staff, ""People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads! They want names like 'Mustang' and 'Cheetah'—vicious animal names,"" referencing the Ford Mustang and Lamborghini Cheetah cars.[6]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F"

pics,3e0ujj,Drennor,10,Tue Jul 21 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link. For anyone too lazy to click it, here's an excerpt.  P.s. Fuck this shit!!!   Giant hogweed is a phototoxic plant. Its sap can cause phytophotodermatitis (severe skin inflammations) when the skin is exposed to sunlight or to ultraviolet rays. Initially, the skin colours red and starts itching. Then blisters form as it burns within 48 hours. They form black or purplish scars that can last several years. Hospitalisation may be necessary.[9] Presence of minute amounts of sap in the eyes can lead to temporary or even permanent blindness.[12]  These reactions are caused by the presence of linear derivatives of furocoumarin in its leaves, roots, stems, flowers and seeds. These chemicals can get into the nucleus of the epithelial cells, forming a bond with the DNA, causing the cells to die. The brown colour is caused by the production of melanin by furocoumarins.  Authorities advise that children should be kept away from giant hogweed, that protective clothing, including eye protection, should be worn when handling or digging it, and that if skin is exposed, the affected area should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and the exposed skin protected from the sun for several days.[9]"
pics,3e0ujj,Hivmonster,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:51 2015 UTC,This is also true of poison parsnip which looks very similar but with yellow flowers.  Its amazing to me that more people haven't heard of poison parsnip as it is everywhere in the midwest.

The hogweed is a real nasty SoB and has become a huge problem this year because of a massive boom in prevalence. The biggest problem is that there are many innocuous plants with similar flowers but this is the perfect example for why you need to be aware of your surrounding while spending time outdoors.

I'm pretty biased considering I was born and raised here, but I find that too many people think that it's just some giant desert wasteland. Yeah, you have your desert in central and south of the state, but it isn't just some expanse of sand dunes. Palo verdes and mesquite dot the land, while washes run through the dirt. Canyons carve through the rock. You just have to look at Antelope Canyon to see one example of what Arizona has to offer. Not to mention the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona. Near Flagstaff, you have your San Francisco peaks which by themselves contain some pretty diverse climate and geography. It's home to your stereotypical desert plants, as well as woodlands and pine trees. Even an arctic-alpine zone, which is home to San Francisco peaks groundsel which is only found there.   Honestly, I could go on about this state for hours. I moved to Virginia for school in the past year and it has really led to a much bigger sense of appreciation  for my home state, and I just want other people to understand it as well."

I fought for a summer, and had a blast. You learn a great deal, meet so many great people and have your eyes opened to many things about the natural world. I remember a few good friends I made had spent seasons in Australia, and some years Australians had come over here to help with our fires. It's a really important part of our government."

pics,3dwovi,ThisNerdyGuy,11,Mon Jul 20 14:30:33 2015 UTC,"Both of my parents worked for the NPS for a good long time, and suggested I get into it while I was young and able bodied, so I did while in college, as a summer thing. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. The problem was mostly that I couldn't get back in after having graduated college and not having been back for a couple years - I took summer courses for two years to finish my degree - and I would have had to retake the pack test, as well as refreshers on all the wildland classes. I also didn't get my degree in anything Ag related, so it didn't make sense for me to do something like that as a career path, because I'd have to go back to school and get another degree if I wanted to do anything higher than basic crew. Plus, while I was at school I met my girlfriend and that's a little more important to me right now, even though it was a great experience.   If you're wanting to get into it, I highly recommend getting over to your local park (whether that be Forest Service or National Park) and getting in some volunteer time. If you want it to be a career, I also highly recommend getting a degree in an Agriculturally related field. Some schools will have courses more directly related to fire, especially wildland, and those would be the places I'd recommend going if you still haven't started looking. But definitely start volunteering today, if you can. Go and talk to the people at your local park, and ask them what they did, and what they recommend to do yourself - almost all of the guys and gals I've met have been incredibly helpful and willing to go out of their way for you, at least to inform you. If this is a career path you definitely want, you have to start as early and as young as you possibly can. Volunteering says ""Hey! I'm here, I want to learn, I want to help make a difference! Show me how!"" And that makes every bit of difference, especially when it comes to moving up once you get in. Another important thing, is that you need to build yourself a resume on USAJobs.gov and you need to be applying for as many jobs as you possibly can, in as many related fields as you possibly can. It's very tough to get in, especially now. So, if you get a seasonal job (which is where you'll likely start out) make sure the entire time you're on crew, that you're learning as much as you possibly can, and building that into your resume on the site, and searching and applying for new jobs every week, at least once a week. While you're on the crew and before you get on one, think of resume building and applying as a small, second job. It may sound silly, but if you can keep up with it, it makes an enormous difference because the hiring process for these jobs can be four months or longer. So you have to get to it as soon as you can, and make sure you stick with it.   All that being said, it is something you can do for fun and a genuinely good time, which is how I looked at it after being unable to get back into it. I'm not old or anything, but I'm not at a place in my life right now where I could get back into it. I definitely would if I were.   Sorry for the book! Let me know if you have any questions!"

Are there volunteer programs for this? I.E. not have it be my main job but can participate a few weeks out of the year and just do training the rest of the time? Really hope so, I'd jump on that bandwagon faster than Sandy can finish one of her faster than quotes to Spongebob."

Essentially, they get people signed up in the winter then come back when it's dry in the spring, mark your property boundries with you, then use it as training for this type of firefighter.  They would lite the pastures on fire, control the burn, etc so it was live training.

I have an uncle and several cousins that fight forest fires in Russia.  They are sent to forest fires either by helicopter or parachuted in. Then they have to anticipate the movement of the fire (and that requires knowing the geography, the weather and biology- different plants burn at different rates from other plants and the burn rates change due to time of season and other factors) and then they plan where they are going to cut down trees and dug trenches. At the same time since they can’t carry around unnecessary items like food, water and shelter they have to find it on their own. They could be fighting fires for weeks at time and still live off the land at them same time. But they all love their jobs."

pics,3dwovi,McSprocket,12,Mon Jul 20 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"Because firefighting is seasonal and situational, if one part of the country is experiencing extreme fire danger, the rest of it also has the problem that it could burst into flames. Those other areas need to hold back a portion of their firefighting personnel to put out any home fires that might happen. Bringing in outside personnel to get 24/7 fire coverage is a good option. I don't think people realise that big operations go for a week or more 24 hours a day. They need to give the people they do have rest periods too. Having more fire fighters is better, who gives a fuck where they are from. These are also remote area specialists with training in things like winching from a helicopter, strategy, and advanced firefighting skills beyond what a regular firefighter gets trained in. There are less people with that kind of training then you would think."

Funny enough your restrictions on allowing people in with DUI's and other crimes of that sort limits a lot of people from coming up and helping. A squeaky clean record and a passport is not something everyone has. As far as cost goes, fire is expensive, what us folks on the ground get paid is a drop in the bucket, no matter where we are from. Aviation and supplies/ logistics will always bump up the bill.  Edit: Not to mention it almost takes an act of congress to get sent up there because yeah, we have our own shit to handle lol"

pics,3dwovi,LongStories_net,2,Mon Jul 20 15:48:32 2015 UTC,I know a bunch of teams took off for Canada yesterday to help out. I imagine they've used as many Americans as can be spared and need to start looking outward for help.

You'll find cheaper ones of course, but the durability might be limited, and you'll find that the very cheap ones smell of plastic for ages and are poorly manufactured. That said, Amazon is a good overall source, but you might find the same tent in some outdoor shop a bit cheaper - 10-15% would be my guess."

Turns out the guy that owned it previously went camping frequently with his cats; but had developed a bad case of grout and decided to sell the tent.  We still have it, came in quite useful when my friend Harry got kicked out of his house and had to kip outside in my backyard.  We don't talk to him anymore though, heard some odd things walking past him inside that tent.  Heard him yelling in weird languages, and calling himself a wizard or some shit."

Be sure to check the Mora Ranger station if you will need a wilderness permit or not (sometimes you can self register), but you can camp on the shores north of the Hoh River. Edit: it appears for Second Beach you don't need a permit, http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/upload/WildernessMap.pdf but you should still go out and check out Mora Ranger Station.  To the South of the Hoh River, you can't legally camp on the beach overnight, and you will find the NPS LE rangers asking you to leave at a rather inopportune time of the night."

pics,3e1448,rockerchick821,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:25 2015 UTC,"Hey :)   So we were at a waterslides concert, for youth groups. It was night time and freezing cold. I spent the whole time in the hot tub trying to stay warm (It wasn't working, the cold water from the pool keep cooling it down!!) when my friends came by and said ""Come on, go for a slide!"" I replied ""Not a chance!"" and off they went.  Not even 15 seconds later, I kid you not, a loud voice was in my ear that said ""JUST GO!"" so I sucked up the cold and ran up to meet them.  While sitting on the stairs waiting for our turn, quite cold and annoyed, my friend Jenny started talking to this other girl (Tiffany). Tiffany was there with Dan, and we assumed Tiffany and Jenny knew each other, so Dan and I started talking. (Fun fact, Angel by Shaggy was playing)  We went down the slides and at the end we decided we would meet up to watch the fireworks after Dan took a friend to first aid for whiplash from another ride.  The fireworks started and I couldn't find Dan. To be totally honest I was pretty crushed even though we had hardly talked. Suddenly he popped up, we had awkward conversation and watched the fireworks (Yes, we saw fireworks the day we met ;) ) After they were done, I asked for his email, which he wrote from my wrist to my shoulder up my arm so I wouldn't forget. Then we went our separate ways home.   Now, you might find this to be stupid, but at 15 I had been dating this guy who was a total jerk to me often. The night before the slides I prayed. I said ""I'm so done with dating at 15 already, I just want to find my husband."" I think thats where the ""Just go!"" came from.   I got home around 11 pm that night, walked in the door and my mom asked"" How was your night?"" I told her ""great, I met my husband"" she rolled her eyes and told me to go to bed.  We started dating a month later... and besides 2 trips in our first year of dating, we havent been apart for more than a few days.. (Minus a few trips for his university course)   We now have a 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son :)"

I don't know just putting my opinion on this."

pics,3dwbk8,scrumbly,14,Mon Jul 20 07:44:14 2015 UTC,"This particular thing makes me feel uncomfortable so I understand it and I'm sure it's a real phobia for some people, but I'm pretty sure it's like ""OCD"" where everyone likes to say they have it but most of them don't have anywhere near what would be a phobia.  I mean, before Reddit none of these people had even heard of this phobia but now they all have it.  As for subscribing to it, I think it's more of a fascination or curiosity thing. If it makes you feel a certain way, it's interesting, and looking at it more gives you that repeated feeling of ""What the hell, why do I feel creeped out by this picture?"" It can be interesting to know that you're thinking about it rationally but still have no control over how your body is reacting."
pics,3dwbk8,down_vote_magnet,6,Mon Jul 20 08:19:07 2015 UTC,"I think the ""nobody knew about it, now everyone has it"" thing comes from not having a word for it before. It happens a lot with things like trypophobia, where you ARE affected by it, but you don't know why or what the word for it is. Then someone mentions it, and it ""clicks"".   Also, the term trypophobia is just referring to the reaction to these sorts of images. Many, many, people aren't affected in a way that most would count as a ""phobia"" (actively avoiding the images, being scared of things like it, the classic screaming/mental breakdowns/general freaking out), but still have an adverse reaction to it. I personally hate these kinds of images, as they make me extremely uncomfortable and I feel ""itchy"" (quotes because it's the closest word I can get to how I feel, without it actually being an itch) and just wrong while looking at them. However, I wouldn't really classify it on the level of a phobia, just that it fits under the term ""trypophobia"" as a distinguisher from something that makes everyone uncomfortable, whether they have a ""phobia"" of it or not. Hopefully that made sense, as I haven't gotten much sleep in the past 24 hours."

I go there because I think ""surely I'm not affected by i- HOLY SHIT YES I AM GOODBYE"""
pics,3dwbk8,helensis_,8,Mon Jul 20 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Trypophobia is a natural fear in humans, but to varying degrees. Those who have the full effects of it, when it can truly be called a phobia, are uncommon (similar to most phobias). You not having any issue with the images just shows that you are affected less than others. I myself am made uncomfortable by the sight of such images, but usually only when imposed upon human tissues. Everyone feels differently about it."

You've seen magazine ads that are designed to look like articles... the are labeled ""advertisement"" at the top. I imagine that they are required to be labeled as such because of a past deceptive practice whereby consumers were led to believe that an ad was something other than an ad."

Ogden McNally! I look in the mail, and this whole box is Ogden McNally!   So I say to myself, ""I gotta find this guy! I gotta go up to his office and put his mail in the guy's goddamn hands! Otherwise, he's never going to get it and he's going to keep coming back down here."" So I go up to  Ogden's office and what do I find out, Reddit? What do I find out?! There is no Ogden McNally. The man does not exist, okay?   So I decide, ""Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper."" There's no Ogden McNally? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Ogden! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to Carol in HR and I knock on her door and I say, ""Carol! Carol! I gotta talk to you about Ogden."" And when I open the door what do I find?

pics,3dvuq6,AudiFundedNazis,6,Mon Jul 20 06:58:12 2015 UTC,"I believe it is the herbicides and pesticides were found to be causing this. Freshly cut grass (and clippings) was thought to increase exposure.   The real fun part is this can cause lymphoma in children exposed similarly to dogs outdoors or commonly tracked indoors from the dog's fur.  Children petting a dog contaminated in this manner, who may not yet understand hygiene, run increased exposure risks.  The second part above is speculative applying known causes for cancer, exposure and transmission from dogs, levels necessary for harm, etc   TLDR: Your pets and children are far safer on a lawn if the herbicides and pesticides contain natural or known safe chemicals.

pics,3dvuq6,mackinder_heartland,8,Mon Jul 20 04:45:54 2015 UTC,From the look of the mountains and architecture is could be somewhere like Austria or Slovenia.   I could be wrong though... I would like to know too.

pics,3dvuq6,PrestonLayne,3,Mon Jul 20 04:59:11 2015 UTC,I was thinking that it could also be America because it's so big. A country can have have a pretty diverse landscape when it's that size.   I just don't know much about America.
pics,3dvuq6,ryangaston88,5,Mon Jul 20 05:04:33 2015 UTC,pretty sure it`s anywhere in the alps. My guess is Austria because we have a lot of those churches you can see in the background. But could be swizerland or germany too.

pics,3dyd46,CinnamonJ,7,Mon Jul 20 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I find the continuous puzzlement with how people moved large stones thousands of years ago to be a bit puzzling in an of itself.  It's not that hard, people with ropes, levers and inclines can move just about anything.  There's ample evidence of this in the form of thousands of heavy stones that were moved thousands of years ago.  There's a guy in Michigan who has been able to build a replica of Stonehenge, single handedly.  I think it's just a massive failure of imagination on the part of the people who can't figure out how they moved the stones."

Being said that, it takes guts to move those, not an easy task."
pics,3dyd46,soparamens,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is the intellectually trained people who are researching this sort of question have an appropriate set of skills for archaeology etc.  They don't have any real knowledge, training or experience in what is really a simple, blue collar issue.   I'm sure any professional rigger could move a stone of any size considered here with locally sourced materials and their ingenuity."

They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that Olmec derive in part from neighboring Mokaya and/or Mixe–Zoque."

It's much more efficient and less costly to have a labor tax in place which draws upon your own people for short periods of time, usually in the agricultural off season."

pics,3dvw4y,decidedlyunfortunate,87,Mon Jul 20 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, IDK about California, but in Boulder Colorado they have the same thing because people were hardcore collecting rainwater. It was so bad that it started to effect the ecosystem and sort of causing a false drought."
pics,3dvw4y,navysealassulter,23,Mon Jul 20 04:43:52 2015 UTC,"Pardon my ignorance, but why exactly does collecting water in buckets cause harm?"
pics,3dvw4y,ssesf,28,Mon Jul 20 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"I believe it has something to go with the water cycle. If you collected all rainfall in buckets (hypothetically), there would be no more clouds or rain, just what you have stored. So, if the government isn't regulating it, and a shit ton of water is being stored in everyones backyards, it would cause a ""false drought"". But at the same time I know little about anything I just talked about, its just a theory."
pics,3dvw4y,victoriarosie,47,Mon Jul 20 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"You're essentially right. Instead of buckets however, you have 500-1000 gallon tanks next to people's houses. Or people putting up artificial dams on their property (that happened once in Oregon). Enough people collecting rainwater can impact streamflow.  A house with 2000 square feet of (flat) collecting surface would harvest 167 cu feet of water per inch of rain, about 1250 gallons. If you had 5000 houses you'd be looking at 6.25 million gallons collected. Or the equivalent to stopping my local river (medium sized 5th order stream about 40 feet across in most places) for 25 seconds. Or 10 olympic swimming pools if that figure works better for your imagination.  So I could see this being a problem for an area that only receives periodic rain storms, you could impact the ecosystem relatively heavily by removing that much water."

pics,3dvw4y,Sanc7,36,Mon Jul 20 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"No matter how much rain falls this summer California reservoirs will still be hovering around the 10% capacity level. Water supply in the western U.S. Is determined by snowfall in the mountain ranges. What we have all experienced this year is the predicted future climate change impact. Some areas may receive more overall precipitation but it is falling as the wrong type. Rain won't last through the hot, dry summers whereas snow is released more slowly and consistently. I heard one Californian politician call for more reservoirs to combat this, grossly misunderstanding what is meant by the term storage. Besides screwing up hundreds of miles of habitat reservoirs lose large amounts to evaporation.  Want some more bad news? The vast majority of California wildfires are started by lightening from summer storms. The scant precipitation isn't enough to dampen the vegetation to prevent this.  Oh, and thanks to the overly successful Smokey the Bear campaign public fear of all wildfires have led to a policy of fire suppression at all costs. This means that all the small brush and trees and the all the downed wood have not been cleared by small, low intensity fires. It's a disaster in the making and California isn't alone in this."

Twenty-nine (29) competitors were allotted 30 hours over four days to create their masterpieces from nothing but sand and water. Parksville Beach Fest Society awarded a total of $43,000 to sculptors Sunday evening.   2015 winners:  http://www.parksvillebeachfest.ca/cms.asp?wpID=35  Here are some of the other Sculptures below.  http://i.imgur.com/pSXoQtX.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/cJ9ylBQ.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/p6xBxuy.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/cYK9eIH.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/BoTLZ87.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Mtl6ILS.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/qQBGFbk.jpg"
pics,3dvk9z,Tacoking,200,Mon Jul 20 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"Actually it is a little more than sand and water, but not by much.  First of all, the sand isn't from the beach, they need a very specific kind of sand trucked in for the competition because it has to be able to hold itself together properly. Not just any sand can be used.  As for the extra ingredient: Elmer's Glue. Once the sand sculptures are done they have a very short shelf life due to wind and other elements. So when they are done they combine the glue and some water in a spray bottle and cover the outer Surface of the sculpture. This preserves it for a few days so people can come around d and take a look.  Source: grew up in the next town over, went to this every year and learned stuff."

I didn't mind any of this. The company made a donation to our building fund and I loved the show so I was really looking forward to seeing the episode.

There's been a little debate going on about a memorial to Confederate soldiers on our town's (Denton, TX) Courthouse lawn. Overnight, someone graffitied ""This Is Racist"" on the arch of the monument.   This of course caused a shit storm. Denton's a liberal college town with a great music scene, but it's still in Texas. There's a lot of people on both sides of the debate. A few protesters with signs that read ""The monument should be moved to a Confederate museum"" showed up at the site today. Shortly after, a guy with an AR-15 came to apparently protect the monument. The cops showed up within minutes and made the guy leave."
pics,3e0oqq,brittyr,8,Tue Jul 21 01:44:09 2015 UTC,He's not wrong though (I mean in legal stances). In texas it's totally legal to walk down the street with an AR. Source: took a CHL class yesterday and learned that this is legal but a handgun is not.

Brandishing is ""to hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured.""  He's angry, and he is holding the rifle in a ready position with his hand on the grip and his trigger finger on the trigger guard. Note that it is the anger and intent that move simply holding a firearm up to the charge of 'brandishing'. This man is not defending anyone. He is not defending his property. He is there with his firearm for the sole purpose of instilling fear in others.  Don't like my definition? It's from the US Concealed Carry Association."

pics,3dxodo,bendingmarlin69,10,Mon Jul 20 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"I treated it with Iron (III) Acetate.  If you're rusty on your chemistry, here's the recipe I used:  CH3COOH + H202 -> CH3CO3H + H20 4CH3COOH + 2Fe -> Fe(CH3COOH)3 + 2H20 + 02  Where CH3COOH = acetic acid      and H2O2 = hydrogen peroxide   I used 4% white vinegar and 3% hydrogen peroxide because it's what I had on hand.  The hydrogen peroxide is a lot lighter than the acetic acid, so by my calculations I needed about 4.5 times more to get to the 1:1 ratio in my balanced equation.  This is kitchen chemistry, though, so rounded quite a bit and went with the following:  16 oz   mason jar 1/3 cup 4% White vinegar 1.5 cup 3% Hydrogen peroxide   Mix them together, and BAM! nothing happens (at least that you can see).  I then tore apart one 0000-grade steel wool pad and plopped in in the mix.  It starts reacting right away, but it's nothing spectacular really.  You should probably let this go for a day or so.  I put mine in a hot water bath to speed things along, but be careful--one of your products is O2, so exposure to open flames might not be the best idea.  This makes the nastiest iron oxide (rust) foam as the oxygen escapes from solution.  I cleaned it up pretty easily with Barkeeper's Friend, but it looked pretty bad at first.  You might even try a bigger reaction vessel. . . that's actually probably the best idea.  After the reaction is complete, you'll probably have some leftover iron bits in there.  I filtered mine out with an old T-shirt, but a coffee filter would have been a better choice.  I'd let it sit for a couple more hours just to let any residual particulate matter settle to the bottom.  What you'll be left with is a slightly opaque yellow solution with some rusty iron at the bottom.  Test that solution on a sample of your wood and see how it goes.  Remember it fades as it dries.  I wanted a more pronounced effect, so I rubbed my tabletop down with black tea and let that dry.  Black tea is full of tannins, and that's what your iron (iii) acetate will react with to form the grey color complex.  I'd love to see how your project turns out!"

Every time I walked in the back, a big walrus would come over to the door. The doors are partitioned so that the top half swings open. The walrus put his big head on the door ledge to greet me and I got to see his whiskers up close. They are huge and they are hollow.   Over at the Wild Arctic exhibit the animals can be viewed from thick glass and many times the trainers have to cover the walrus exhibit because he masturbates. Lol."

After heavy close-quarters overnight fighting, Russian positions on the hill were overrun and most of the soldiers were killed.  Attempts by the 1st and 3rd Companies, as well as the rest of the 4th Company, to rescue their surrounded comrades or to stop the breakthrough were largely unsuccessful. Eventually, badly wounded Captain Romanov allegedly called for fire support on his own position before being overrun in the final Chechen attack. According to the Russians, 84 of their soldiers were killed in combat at Height 776, including all of the officers. Only seven rank-and-file soldiers survived the battle, four of them injured[1] (some Russian sources acknowledge only six survivors, not counting the seventh who had answered a call for surrender and was then beaten, stripped out of his uniform and abandoned by the rebels[9]).  According to the article in Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, separatist casualties in the Argun Gorge area totaled approximately 400 dead, including 200 bodies allegedly found at Height 776.[1] However, the official federal estimate was later raised to about 500 enemy dead, according to the Russian government website,[19] and in 2008 the state-controlled English-language TV station Russia Today spoke even of over 700 fighters killed there  On 12 March 2000, President Putin signed an ukaz conferring Russian state awards upon participants of the battle.[7] 63 soldiers received the Order of Courage and 22 (all 13 officers and nine enlisted men) were awarded the country's highest medal and title of the Hero of the Russian Federation.[25] In comparison, only 65 medals of the Hero of the Soviet Union medal were awarded for the entire duration of the 10-year Soviet intervention in Afghanis   TLDR: 90 VDV troops fought off an enemy almost 27 times larger, and suffered 84 casualties (with 4 being injured and 2 not being grazed by a single bullet).

pics,3dyyh3,RogerioCo,-10,Mon Jul 20 18:06:30 2015 UTC,ELI5: How is the Confederate battle flag a racist symbol?
pics,3dyyh3,camsprouse,25,Mon Jul 20 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"I will preface this by saying that I do not believe all people that fly the flag are racist, but most that do either are racist, or they don't understand the history behind the flag. There are several facts that give this flag a racist background:    The flag was - one of - the battle flags of the south in a war that had a strong race-based motive. While the north did not start the war based on slavery, it was one of the stated reasons the south fought, and a key motivator to all by the end.  The flags designer was a documented white supremacist. He even redesigned the flag to have a white background to show white supremacy (which was also later changed because it a white flag in battle already had a significant meaning).  After the war, the flag was not flown over state capitals. It wasn't until the Civil Rights movement that states started flying the flag again in protest to this movement.    I'm all for showing pride in your heritage, but sometimes symbols need to die - especially ones from dubious times in history. There is a reason why nazis fly the confederate flag where swastikas are banned and the KKK is holding protests about the flag being taken down."

How dare you tell somebody else what something means to them. I'll illustrate with an example. Let's take a picture of a baby.  To some, is represents love and family.  To others, pride that someone will carry on your family line.  To others, a baby is a symbol of something that holds you back in life and a commitment you don't want to make.  And finally to others, who may have lost a child or cannot have a child of their own, it brings sadness.  Who is one group to tell another group what a picture of a baby should mean to them?"

Compare it to a baby all you want but it is a symbol born of racism.

pics,3dyyh3,wpbart19,-4,Mon Jul 20 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree. There's no abridgment of free speech in telling someone ""you're an asshole"".   There ARE some people who are advocating abridging people's right to fly this flag. I know I'm not one of those. But I do insist that people expect consequences for their actions and their speech. And if you're going to fly a flag of hate, you're going to attract a lot of hate.   Does it have a chilling effect? Yes. It does.   Me? I'm okay if, in confederate cemeteries, they want to decorate CSA soldiers graves with the flag of their regiment (or of the navy). But that doesn't apply to all the regiments. After all, the southern cross was never a flag of the CSA as a whole, but of certain regiments battle flags - or navy. The southern cross hardly represents every CSA soldier, just as the NJ flag doesn't represent soldiers from Connecticut.*   *Yes, I know armies were arranged in not-so-regimented form in the civil war so that you could have anyone from any state in any state's named army."

pics,3dvo8u,SoCalNerdGal,280,Sun Jul 19 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"As a pre-teen, I experienced the very real struggle of a large ball pit.  I was visiting Sea World with my family.  My cousins attacked me; the younger ones tackled me to my knees and the older ones pelted balls at my face.  At some point, I flipped and became prone.  My face was fully submerged under the balls.  All I could hear was the muffled bark of the teenage employee yelling, ""keep your head above the balls!""  Every time I would make my way to the light, I would be bashed with another 5-6 balls and I'd go down into all-consuming ball darkness once more.  This went on long enough for me to start to feel slightly panicked.  For whatever reason, I genuinely couldn't get my hands or feet under me enough to keep my ""head above the balls"" and this seemed to enrage the ball pit manager.  My cousins were eventually cleared from the enclosed area and the worker fetched me with what appeared to be a life saving device for a swimming pool.  I grabbed on to the loop and, shamefully, allowed myself to be pulled to freedom.  It wasn't my most proud moment.  I haven't been in a ball pit since that day.  That struggle ... the ball pit struggle... is indeed real."

There will never be cities on Mars. The age of manned exploration of the cosmos is over, the Dream of Stars is dead. This society could afford to start exploring and using the Solar System. We could afford to create cities on other worlds, farms and factories and mines in the sky and observatories on Farside. We won't. We will dribble away our treasures and our powers on petty squabbles until the oil runs out then this city culture will die. The species may survive the end of oil for a while, but it won't be like anything we would see as human. And it will soon be extinct. Humanity has a choice, become eternal and ubiquitous or die. Those with the Dream of Stars see this world as the cradle of a great, star-striding species of many cultures on millions of worlds; our leaders see it as nothing but a grave. The ultimate goal of our leaders is for everyone to die and to be rewarded after living. That is both stupid and sick. It is suicidally insane. It is amoral, immoral and evil. Humanity should be swarming over many worlds by now. We could still manage it. But if we wait until the oil becomes expensive, until it starts to run out it will be too late and this world will die. All our songs will be lost forever. There will never be a second space-faring species from Earth. Man has used up all the easy, cheap energy. No successor species can ever build a new global city-culture. Once Man has failed, once Man has committed itself to the grave instead of the stars, once Man has died, there will be no second chance. We have a choice, to live forever among the stars or to make a grave of this world. We should vote in and support no leader who does not make getting Man off this planet his single most important task. We should refuse to countenance any Party or church that does not make its primary mission the creation of a Human Galaxy. Everything else, everything else is a vast distance secondary to this one objective. It is simple, we take the stars or we die.     And I have little hope of any politician, priest or other parasitic growth being able to see the Big Picture so I expect we're dead.     There were twelve men on the Moon. There will never be a thirteenth."

One simple question: where does the power to mine the rare earths come from? And the power to cook them out of their ores? And the power to make the photovoltaic cells? And the juice to transport these to where they are needed? And how is USAlia going to convince Chad, Tunisia and Liberia to give up their sovereign lands to power USAlien homes? North America doesn't get sufficient light to do the job, especially not when she's in the dark which she is one hour out of every two.      But none of that matters. When the petrol starts to become too expensive for the average USAlien motorist to afford, wars will be fought over the dregs. Entire countries and peoples will be steam-rollered to keep the ""World Series"" on the air and to keep the AC going. But it will all be in vain for oil is finite.    Once it has gone, this city-culture will collapse far, far below barbarism. And no other can ever succeed it. A civilisation can not be built on animal muscle and wood. Not a civilisation spanning the stars.     There is a solution. There is a way for Man to survive. It demands sense, vision and co-operation from our politicians. Does anyone see that happening?"
pics,3dxfb5,OdBx,3,Mon Jul 20 11:52:23 2015 UTC,"Solar energy is, for all intents and purposes of our current needs, infinite.

No, I have this infinite team of monkeys who have finished doing the plays for young Billy and so have lots of spare time for me.  :)      .    .    The flux from the Sun is, so far as we are concerned, infinite and eternal, true but it is rarefied, sparse, thin on the ground. The very best it can do is about 100 Watts per square metre and that is at noon, in Summer in equatorial desert country. You won't get all of that 100W into your car's engine and you certainly won't get all of it back out to push you along the road, run your heater, power your music and drive your sat-nav. For an easy to see comparison, 100W is the power a human uses to stay alive. It is about the peak output a human could pump into the electrical grid using a bicycle-style generator. It is easy to work out how many square metres of unused, sunny land there is on our little planet and to calculate how many Watts we can suck out of the sunlight falling on them. The numbers are quite huge. But ... To collect that juice we would need to coat all of those many squares with solar-powered PV cells. That costs both money and oil. Solar cells are not mere black glass, they have rare earth metals and alloys in them. We would need those metals, too, tons of them. It could be done, theoretically. We could, barely, power the culture we have with sunlight. We would need to coat entire countries in cells, and these would be countries we are not entirely friendly with, but it is within the realms of the possible.  As is dragging icebergs from Antarctica to flood the Sahara, putting solar-powered microwave-emitting power stations in high Earth orbit, clearing up the many plastic gyres and a host of other things. Hell, reducing the human population to sustainable numbers is possible. Getting the churches to stop killing us all is possible. Only an idealist would see any of those as in the least bit likely to ever happen. Besides which, the effort to plate the planet in PV cells would be horrendously expensive. And the results of doing this would be unpredictable changes to our climate, weather and ecologies. (Also, somebody has to fix the damned things when super-tornadoes rip mile wide gouges out of them.) Seeing solar power as an alternative to oil is exceedingly misguided. It is useful for powering a hand-calculator during daylight. It is hardly a good choice for a football stadium, and all the vehicles carrying the crowds, on a Winter day in UKland. Solar power is as daft as wind. Maybe worse. For ever so many reasons.    It is infinite but that is not a useful attribute when it is unusable."

Only 7% of wars were fought for primarily religious reasons.  Photovoltaics are just one way to extract energy from sunlight.  We have over 1000 years of thorium reserves for nuclear energy.  We have hydroelectric, wind, tidal, algae, etc, so solar doesn't need lift the whole load, just part of it.  We have a tokamak in Europe with Q > 1.  Some day we won't need any of the above!  Our city culture will gradually decline as our population contracts, then more rapidly as people move off world.  The technology to create them will still exist, but society will desire more natural spaces as the pressure to constantly expand within limited space is lifted.  But yeah, I get it.

In the birthplace of civilisation there are thousands of people murdering other thousands of people while destroying twenty millennia of irreplaceable historical artefacts over something so trivial, inane and utterly insane as which set of rules their invisible big daddy in the clouds wants them to live by. D you really think people like that will co-operate with anyone merely to keep the species alive? Or that ""keeping the species alive"" is even a meaningful concept in their mindset? If the zealots had a kill-the-planet button, they would press it rather than see us live in peace. We visit Cape Canaveral to see the mighty rockets, to stand in awe at the achievements of our kind. They would visit to stand in a crowd of children and to suicide-bomb them. ""Human's instinct to survive"" is a poor joke. People can be convinced to die, and to take many others with them, for the most idiotic and daft of reasons.     Knowing all of this, is expecting the nukes to be used really all that pessimistic?     Without that Atlantic island, without Yellowstone, without the next dinosaur-killer, humans are quite capable of annihilating themselves. Throw in the possibility of an impact or a super-volcano or a mega-tsunami on the Atlantic coasts and the prospects for the long-term survival of Civilisation on this planet are not good.

The one thing that people were pointing out is that the flag is floating despite no wind, which is stupid, there's no wind in a studio either, I would even say it goes towards proving the image is real since any momentum in the flag would be kept much longer if there is no gas around it to absorb the energy, only the pole.

pics,3dxfb5,Tired-John,5,Mon Jul 20 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"I see no stars in the sky   For the same reason you don't see them in daylight on Earth, too many bright things around. Even though the lunar surface is about as dull as tarmac it reflects sunlight. To a camera it is far brighter than any star. You can demonstrate  this effect yourself by taking a picture in a car park at night with a search-light illuminating the scene.  Even though a search-light is nowhere near so bright as our Sun, it still washes out the stars. If you took the original negative film and processed it until everything you see in that image was horribly over-exposed there would be stars in the sky.     Two more examples: on the ""New Horizons"" website, to see the little moons, Charon and Pluto must be over-exposed and clipped from the images, and to see a planet circling another star that star is vastly over-exposed."

pics,3dxfb5,ColdShade,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"Dynamic range. The eye has more than cameras do. Most cameras. And the eye's sensors don't tend to bleed across from one to another as film and CCD's do.    That said, you can film Venus, Jupiter, Sirius and the Moon (that one's easy) during the day. You can see those with the naked eye, too.  You only need to know where they are and to have very good seeing conditions; good, clear skies.    The Apollo cameras were very good. It was the film that was a compromise. They needed film that worked and cameras that could be clicked while wearing EVA-suit gloves. The science behind their choices is fascinating, if you are into that sort of thing. :) Remember, every ounce of film they lifted to the Moon cost many, many dollars in fuel and represented an ounce of other stuff they couldn't carry. They needed film that would perform first time, every time under a multitude of lighting conditions. No one was going to get a second chance at a picture. Not for at least 46 years. :)"

It wasn't easy to keep her in sight and finding her again when I lost her was difficult but I did it.  Naked eye, no aids.  No aids apart from corrective lenses for myopia. :)      And you're right, the Moon is easy and it's in daylight one week out of every two. Though it does get a bit iffy when it is a slender crescent as it is then close to the bigger, brighter thing.       Anyone who is really interested in why those images don't show stars should seek out the sites that debunk the moon-hoax lunatics.

Even a searchlight is many thousands of times less bright than our local star. Sol is very, very bright and anything reflecting sunlight, even coal, will be far brighter than a star.    Stars are tiny. It is a testament to the versatility of the human eye than they are visible at all. :)"

The ground was too bright, they couldn't see any stars in the ink black sky.  But as Buzz Aldrin (in OP's post) reports, you can see the curvature of the moon while standing on the surface.  This is due to it being 1/6 the size of earth and also they could see all the way to the horizon clear as a bell due to no atmosphere."

I've had 4 ultrasounds before this one, and I only shared this one because this is the clearest image of a hand in a standard ultrasound I've ever seen. I was honestly hoping other people might post other pictures of similarly impressive clarity in the comments.  But its okay, since it's related to my personal life I guess that means I'm turning reddit into facebook. Nevermind the fact that people constantly demand original content, which is intrinsically related to people's personal lives here in Pics, which is a subreddit devoted to individual pictures. If you produce OC here, it's most likely related to your personal life."

It's not that it's related to your personal life, it's just a very mundane picture. This is the kind of shit you clog up your Facebook feed with so that your family get to see it and the remaining 95 % of your friends get a warning about you becoming a parent. This is great because now they can block any future update from you, since it's just going to be baby's first ____.

pics,3dv9p4,az_max,3,Mon Jul 20 02:20:01 2015 UTC,They're becoming more common as the 25 year import limit comes up. Originally only four years (93-97) were imported meeting US spec (called NAS Defenders). Older Series Rovers were brought in under various grey market deals. Now ones with the actual Defender badge can come over legally.

pics,3dz29b,essidus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:06 2015 UTC,My ears started bleeding while I tried to figure that out.
pics,3dz29b,drunkbusdriver,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:52 2015 UTC,It is really not that hard. I think all the signs made it more convoluted than it needed to be. All the parking meters in my city are like this and it takes about 5 seconds to understand the first time you use it.  1.put your parking card in.  2.Put your credit card in.  3.get your credit card then your validated parking card back.
pics,3dz29b,GeneralDogsbody,5,Mon Jul 20 20:20:54 2015 UTC,Bingo.  This only looks difficult because some numpty has tried to simplify it into moron with all of the arrows.

pics,3dzh2r,MichaelPlague,5,Tue Jul 21 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I mean a vegetable that isn't almost entirely starch. That thing will start breaking down into sugar before you even swallow."
pics,3dzh2r,Boringbear,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"That meat is doing far worse for you to be worried about the potato. Nothing wrong with sugar when you get it from your fruits and starchy foods like rice or potato; adding straight sugar sure, but that is different."

pics,3dzh2r,wwickeddogg,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:07 2015 UTC,Because she watched you eat prime rib and filet mignon?
pics,3dzh2r,mrbaseball47,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:50 2015 UTC,They both look really good. I'd have no complaints with either plate.

pics,3dzh2r,xwing_n_it,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:50 2015 UTC,Because she is eating more steak so she has the strength to fight off predators?

pics,3dzh2r,jstevewhite,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Due to human sexual dimorphism, I would expect you to be larger and bulkier, and therefore eat more total food. Also, ditch the potato and replace it with a lot of broccoli or other good veggies, and you're not even eating ""unhealthy"", as long as you don't eat this meal three times a day. :D"
