TechnicalDeathMetal,3dl7dc,webb71,3,Fri Jul 17 04:14:04 2015 UTC,Everything about the album is amazing...but the only thing i cant get over is how bad that snare sounds. There are ways to make it have a lot of attack and not sound like you are popping a balloon.

TechnicalDeathMetal,3dl7dc,chronologicalist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:45 2015 UTC,Strange. Maybe they ran out because the digipack was limited to 200 copies.  Did they give you a refund at least?

TechnicalDeathMetal,3di256,ComplexOrganisms,2,Fri Jul 17 12:43:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they went for the spacey airy sound but missed by overshot. So many sonic waves lost by compression.
TechnicalDeathMetal,3di256,The_Hammersmith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"This album feels like tech death mixed with the band Zombi with a 80's action movie flair. Which is pretty interesting. For whatever reason though, I really get into it in the second half of the album and then its over. Chemical Cave is probably my favourite song off this album."

I had listened to the singles when they came out, but I couldn't get around to actually buying and listening to it.  I already love Ruination and Demonocracy, but this is simply next-level.  Funny thing I've realized: Each of their releases had one-word-titles. Doom, Genesis, Ruination, Gloom, Demonocracy. Sun Eater is the first with 2, which fits the sudden inclusion of prog"

TechnicalDeathMetal,3clf6q,Kaffein,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:57 2015 UTC,Not a single frontal focused shot of their new bass player.    I guess because the studio performance audio that was used for the video was done by Forest.

TechnicalDeathMetal,3ckby5,Lagerbottoms,3,Wed Jul 8 17:18:02 2015 UTC,JFAC have been putting out great Death Metal ever since 2009 with Ruination in my opinion

TechnicalDeathMetal,3ckby5,chronologicalist,2,Thu Jul 9 11:40:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of the JFAC hate comes from the stuff pre-Ruination. After that album I think a lot of people saw the potential they had, and they really showed it with their most recent release."
TechnicalDeathMetal,3ckby5,Lagerbottoms,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. The Doom EP especially was too much Deathcore for most, though it was good at what it did. After that everyone wrote them off as that Deathcore band with the skulls on the covers :D  Ruination and Demonocracy are very solid Death Metal albums in my opinion, but Sun Eater is obviously by FAR their best. I just bought the CD yesterday, when I stumbled upon it at my local music store and I like it even more than I did before :D"

They kicked ass despite the venue's muddy sound with a set that included a mix of tunes from their debut and their current album Misery, but unfortunately they did not play this song. I definitely prefer their new stuff. It's got a really cool slamming brutal death metal meets Gorguts/Ulcerate/Immolation type vibe.  P.S. I also saw a guy at the show with the most amazing mullet I've seen since the eighties. Mind you, this wasn't some hipster being silly, either -- it was the real deal."

Its definitely a cool way to come up with riffs, and using this in conjunction with other random pieces of theory i know barely (pitch axis theory pretty much, youtube it) produces some interesting sounding progressions."
TechnicalDeathMetal,3c6ra2,Anyfire,3,Sun Jul 5 11:05:57 2015 UTC,We really need that new album to drop…  A man can dream.
TechnicalDeathMetal,3c6ra2,kabuto,3,Sun Jul 5 11:10:00 2015 UTC,Holy shit.. I wish i could play as clean as this guy! Check out his youtube channel he made awesome tech death covers!!
TechnicalDeathMetal,3c6ra2,xvw,3,Sun Jul 5 12:41:42 2015 UTC,Karl Sanders replied to him on his cover of Enduring the Eternal Molestation of Flame where he nails one of the solos:   KarlofNile 2 years ago  Holy Fucking Shit. Thats REALLY REALLY CLOSE.  Amazing job. There's only a few minor details - but OMG .  Wow. You picked all that out by ear ?  Mind boggling.  Now I have have check out some of your other songs. Excellent !
TechnicalDeathMetal,3c6ra2,chingwraithism,3,Sun Jul 5 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"Practice practice practice.   If you can't do it 100% clean, then drop the speed down until you can. Just gradually increase the speed until you're you're satisfied.  Also, if your playing strains anything, you're doing it wrong. You can permanently damage parts of your body, and it makes it easier to form bad habits.   I know that you didn't ask for a lesson on how to get better, but I'm just throwing it out there in case you read this and find it interesting."

Their lyrics are really great. You guys should look them up if you haven't.  It's sad to think that we'll never see any more releases from Viraemia. One of the greatest tragedies in death metal.
TechnicalDeathMetal,3b1e1u,SadPianist,2,Thu Jun 25 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"Usually I hate this type of tech death, but some for reason I really enjoyed these guys' EP. Absolutely brutal breakdowns and their bassist is crazy. Shame they couldn't make it work."

TechnicalDeathMetal,3aztro,jorrev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:49:39 2015 UTC,Jaron is no longer the bassist for Archspire because of health problems. He is now the vocalist for Eye of Odin. The bassist that they are referring to is Clayton Harder who couldn't end the tour because he had to go back to British Columbia to finish school (he's only 17).
TechnicalDeathMetal,3aztro,OZONE_TempuS,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:36:07 2015 UTC,Oh wow I didn't know that. Is he planning on returning to Archspire as bassist?
TechnicalDeathMetal,3aztro,jorrev,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"As far as i know Jaron is still relearning/mastering his bass techniques. He had a stroke and basically had to start 20 years of playing from scratch. I'm sure Clayton will be the one to appear on their next album, he's more than capable. The boys are shaping him exactly how they want."

TechnicalDeathMetal,3aq5yj,Lagerbottoms,2,Tue Jun 23 09:25:29 2015 UTC,"I can definitely appreciate that these guys are good (Omnipresent Perception is one example of how great these guys really are) , but I couldn't get into them no matter how hard I tried. This might sound really dumb but the vocal style isn't my thing. I know it sounds ridiculous complaining about vocals when its mostly the music itself that makes tech death enjoyable (to me anyway). I'm not really a fan of high pitched vocals and screams, which some tech death bands do sometimes. That kinda reminds me of core which a big no no to me, even though I know these guys are not core, but still, when it's present in most if not all of their songs, I can't get into that.   I could just be old fashioned, I've listened to a tonne of Spawn of Possession, Necrophagist, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Nile, etc, I'm more a fan of that style. I'm always open to new things though, and this didn't really do it for me, vocally. Musically, definitely. I sound hypocritical because this is something bands like Psycroptic started to a little bit more with each record (given they did change vocalist) and I love them, so idk, I could be a giant idiot"

It could take another 11 years to release a new album, I would just be happy knowing that he is still working on it.  I keep telling you guys I'm working on the new QV regularly and that what I'm working on takes a long time to develop and when the time is right I'll let everyone know.

Favorite guitar was a Jackson DKMG with a Seymour Duncan JB in the bridge and a Double distortion in the neck, usually with DR 10s. (Drop D)  The amp set up is gone now but I picked up a kemper profiler recently and it's excellent.   Tip- Practice with a metronome. Start slow and speed up."

For a more modern death metal tone, I use the preamp gain on the lead channel. Tuning is BEADGBE or ADGCFAD."
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,DanceMasterFlash,3,Fri May 22 03:07:04 2015 UTC,The Boss HM-2 is soooooo good. My dad has one which I now use on my guitars.
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,PMmeTechDeathMetal,2,Fri May 22 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"I have an Ibanez RG7321 (seven string) guitar with Seymour Duncan Blacks for both pickups.  I love this guitar, it's not top of the line, but it works really well.  Low action, good feel.  I use D'Addario EXL110-7 strings (10 13 17 26 36 46 59)  I have a Boss Metal Core ML-2 distortion pedal.  It's ok, but I'd like to replace it at some point.  I have a Crate FXT120 120 watt amp that I'm not a big fan of.  The tone is a bit murky.  I plan on upgrading once I have some disposable income.  As far as getting better, I got a lot of use out of the Guitar Pro tab software.  Whenever I look up tabs, I can use it to slow the music down and play it back to me.  This makes it way easier than just having a metronome.  There are a couple of other guitar tab programs that probably work similarly well, like Power Tab and Tab Pro.  I had Power Tab years ago and decided it lacked some functionality.  I haven't tried Tab Pro but I've been thinking about it.  I'd recommend checking out the band Death.  They're one of the early death metal and technical death metal bands that helped revolutionize the genre through the 80s and 90s.  Their songs are fairly simple compared to today's technical death metal, so it's a great place to start, particularly their albums Human and Symbolic.  In terms of technique, just take it slow and make sure you can play something nearly perfectly about 95% of the time before you move on.  Try not to tense up your picking hand/arm, and really try to contain your picking strokes to your wrist and not your elbow.  And get used to using all four fingers when fingering notes.  You're going to need them."
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,PMmeTechDeathMetal,2,Thu May 21 17:16:45 2015 UTC,Should I do excersises? Like how do I improve my speed and stuff?
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,PMmeTechDeathMetal,2,Fri May 22 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely.   Picking exercises are important.  Practice alternate picking on a single string first.   Then progress to where you can alternate pick with both ""inside""  and ""outside""  picking on adjacent strings.    ""Inside"" picking is where you downstroke on the higher pitch string then upstroke to the lower pitch string.   The pick remains mostly between the two strings.   ""Outside""  picking is the opposite, upstroke the higher pitch string, downstroke the lower pitch string.   The pick stays out of the area between the two strings.  Once you can do that on two strings next to each other, start trying it on strings that aren't next to each other so you can better your ""string skipping.""  After all of that, sweeps are very good to know, but don't start them until you have everything else down."
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,iwanttobearockstar,1 point,Fri May 22 16:19:09 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot :)  I have just acquired my electric guitar ( a bc rich warbeast trace) so I am super hyped. I have a crappy amplifier right now but with 20 mins of fine tuning I can get a half decent chugging sound. Anyways thanks again for the advice
TechnicalDeathMetal,36r19q,PMmeTechDeathMetal,3,Fri May 22 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.     One last bit of unsolicited advice:  you're going to suck.  You're supposed to suck when you start, everyone does.    That's just part of it.   It might take two weeks before you sound any better than you did on day 1;  that's fine.  You're rewriting parts of your brain so you can operate off muscle memory instead of thinking about each movement.   It takes a while to get that really going.

Any German speaking indivdual will notice that this post has some serious grammatical issues, as if this person took the text straight from the google translator.  Of course, this does not negate the fact that a new Necrophagist album may come out this year. Like you said. ""I just want to believe :(""  Edit: I apologize in advance, if I disappoint someone."

Only the author of this article states:    which may or not be titled The Path to Naught and Death to the Faithful.   I think my comments are being misunderstood. I never expressed any doubts concerning the release of a Necrophagist record. I only expressed my doubts that this profile of may be fake, due to the German language skills the person behind this profile used."

TechnicalDeathMetal,36nzmo,Lagerbottoms,2,Wed May 20 21:53:47 2015 UTC,Yeah Sun Eater was one of the years biggest surprises. That fretless tone was killer and JFAC have just stepped up their game since they began!  edit: Just checked out the link and thats awesome! Reminds me so much of Obscura

TechnicalDeathMetal,36nzmo,ayk00t,1 point,Thu May 21 06:06:31 2015 UTC,"Augury is what you want. Maybe... Bassist is Forest, formerly of Beyond Creation. Their album Fragmentary Evidence is a Progressive Tech Death masterpiece. It's a lot more proggy and out-there than most tech death, but it's still REALLY good. They also have some interesting vocal styles across the record  another band with great bass tone is Pronostic. This album is very melodic and far from any of the bands you mentioned, but it's really groovy and enjoyable for me."
TechnicalDeathMetal,36nzmo,chingwraithism,2,Thu May 21 08:39:24 2015 UTC,Yes I didn't mention Augury because they're more prog but Fragmentary Evidence is one of my favorite records. I'll check out the other you mentioned though!

TechnicalDeathMetal,36mjoq,Lagerbottoms,1 point,Wed May 20 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"Augury is really good. They have the same bassist that played on both Beyond Creation records. The music is way more progressive than most bands mentioned around here, though"

TechnicalDeathMetal,36mjoq,Lagerbottoms,3,Thu May 21 06:00:58 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of my listening is done through Custom One Pros while I am at work or in my car which is equipped with a pretty adequate Bang & Olufsen sound system. In both situations I tend to listen fairly loud. Never more than thirty or so minutes at a time unless I lose track of time.  It depends on my mood, but generally I just hit shuffle on my Thumbs Up playlist in Google Play. If I feel like a genre or band I will listen to the entire album in full from start to finish in order. Lately that has been happening to Sarapanitum quite a bit, but mostly I do it with some of my favourite albums like Incurso, Concealed, Obscura, Fables of the Sleepless Empires, Truth Beyond..., The Towers of Avarice, Mabool, This Godless Endeavor, etc.  As for BTDM recs, have you checked out the following:   Abnormality Abysmal Torment Defeated Sanity Infinitum Scrambled Defuncts Wormed"

TechnicalDeathMetal,36mjoq,Lagerbottoms,2,Thu May 21 07:24:20 2015 UTC,"I put on my headphones, put on the album and smoke a big ass bowl."
TechnicalDeathMetal,36mjoq,GingaNinja150,2,Wed May 20 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends. I listen both with speakers at home and with headphones on the go.  I listen to everything in very high quality. I have amazing in-ears and speakers and use mostly FLAC files, for best audio quality.  I love both full albums and single songs. The great thing in great death metal is, that you can listen to just songs and have a great time and also listen to a full album and have an even greater time...  For me there are two types of Tech Death.   the progressive and ""beautiful"" type. I like to listen to this when I'm not doing much else, and I'm able to focus on the music. Examples: Spawn Of Possession, Beyond Creation, Augury, The Faceless, Death, Revocation, Decrepit Birth the heavy, groovy, fast, engaging type. I like to listen to this while riding bike, mostly. I bike a LOT... Here I don't have to force myself to focus, because the groove and the extremity of the music basically forces itself into my attention. Examples: Decapitated, Soreption, Archspire, Suffocation"
TechnicalDeathMetal,36mjoq,dieandrot,2,Thu May 21 08:50:32 2015 UTC,Ahh I get what your saying. 'Cycles of Suffering' by Suffocation was actually one of the first songs I got into from death metal in general. I too classify it somewhat like that except I'd add Obscura to the prog and beautiful type. Anyways thanks for the reply.  P.S. What are FLAC files? And how do you use them?
TechnicalDeathMetal,36lu2o,dilanm55,4,Wed May 20 09:50:35 2015 UTC,"Listen to Sun Eater, it's a great album with a nasty fretless player"

TechnicalDeathMetal,36lu2o,Petro1313,3,Mon Jun 1 20:41:13 2015 UTC,Newer albums are. They dropped the pig squeal vocals on demonacracy and haven't gone back
TechnicalDeathMetal,36lu2o,genghiscoyne,3,Wed May 20 10:59:43 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they stopped doing them on Genesis

TechnicalDeathMetal,36ksuh,Tesseract91,1 point,Wed May 20 02:53:22 2015 UTC,This is a good band. Love the use of tremolo picking. I'm glad to see this band doesn't overuse chugging.

All I'm really missing is Soreption and Beyond Creation. Maybe Necrophagist and Archspire  edit: Gorguts aren't tech death in my books. that's more prog/avant-garde. Luc Lemay even said in his interviews that he's not a technical guitarist. He just does what his instrument of choice allows him to do, to compose tracks..."
TechnicalDeathMetal,3533ha,OZONE_TempuS,1 point,Sat May 9 12:20:26 2015 UTC,"Obscura, Beyond Creation and Archspire would've been on my list, but this certainly got some good ones!"
TechnicalDeathMetal,3533ha,RNGmaster,0,Fri May 15 22:50:43 2015 UTC,I really liked the list up until Planetary Duality. That album is SUCH garbage and whenever people talk it up as being a landmark tech death album it makes me cringe.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zvne,webb71,2,Tue May 5 23:01:11 2015 UTC,FUCKING FUCK YES!
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zvne,michpely,2,Tue May 5 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I honestly didn't think I'd ever see it happen"
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zvne,JamSaxon,1 point,Wed May 6 01:13:10 2015 UTC,can't fucking wait for this album to drop.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,MeshuggahIsLife,11,Tue May 5 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"Necrophagist, Obscura, early Decapitated."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,iwanttobearockstar,8,Tue May 5 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"Psycrpotic, Neuraxis, Beneath the Massacre, plus a bunch already listed: Necrophagist is possibly the best technical metal band ever, early Decapitated and Nile is fucking awesome if you're going for a more death metal heavy sound,  Decrepit Birth is solid...  ...but,  if you want to be blown away by some fucking awesome musicianship with fast as shit guitars,  some of the catchiest/grooviest riffs ever,  and all around eargasm inducing bliss: GOROD!!!"
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,dxcowboy,7,Tue May 5 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"Ever listen to Nile? Very technical, amazing drummer, relentlessly brutal stuff, but once you get past the somewhat overwhelmingness of it, there are some incredibly catchy hooks and melodies in there too. Meshuggah and DEP have been favorites of mine for a long time but if I was stuck on a desert island nowadays with one band to listen to, I might pick Nile. I can just listen to it over and over and over.  edit: search Youtube for their drummer George Kollias too -- cool guy and pretty notable drummer."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,mackstann,4,Tue May 5 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm listening to some songs from ""Annihilation of the Wicked"". They're pretty good! I really like the song ""Lashed to the Slave Stick""."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,mackstann,4,Tue May 5 22:37:42 2015 UTC,That song is a classic.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,Tesseract91,2,Tue May 5 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"Their debut, Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka, and Annihilation of the Wicked are probably my favourite Nile albums but each of them has something to enjoy. Solid band all around."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,webb71,5,Tue May 5 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"Check out toiletovhell.com they have a weekly tech death post called tech death thursday and there are some great gems in there. Their other articles are fantastic as well. I would highly recommend Vale of Pnath and Irreversible Mechanism, Hadal Maw, Allegaeon, Diskreet, Fleshgod Apocalypse and Primordium to name a few. I could keep going but we'd be here for days. Also on the off chance you haven't heard it, Cattle Decapitation's Monolith of Inhumanity is the best thing since sliced bread. Also check out Unhuman. They are batshit insane in the best way."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,blindbard,1 point,Wed May 6 00:58:20 2015 UTC,I back this. Have checked some Tech Death articles in that blog and they are very good to check new releases.  Irreversible Mechanism last record is very good and it's Name Your Price in Blood Music label Bandcamp.

TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,HamiltonWeyman,5,Tue May 5 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"These may not be ""brutal"", but definitely technical and musical.

TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,acceptyourself,2,Thu May 7 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"Really like the bands you listed and will check out the ones I don't know!  I would just recommend The Contortionist and Scale the Summit (latest album ""The Migration"" is best). Neither are the most brutal, but they are somewhat brutal, and both are technical as fuck with good drummers. They are both definitely musical too."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,acceptyourself,1 point,Wed May 6 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"I LOVE Scale the Summit! The Migration was one of my favorite albums of 2013. And I remember listening to The Contortionist's album ""Exoplanet"" I think it was, and thinking it was okay but didn't really grab my attention. Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times? Is their newest album better?"
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,h3lme7,2,Wed May 6 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you love Scale the Summit too! :) Yes, I would suggest trying their newer/newest album(s) over Exoplanet. I prefer the newer stuff and you might too."

TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,h3lme7,2,Tue May 5 23:24:02 2015 UTC,Obscura and Cynic are pretty great. Forgot to mention I was a fan of them. I'll go check out Archspire.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,ElasticConcatenation,2,Tue May 5 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"Archspire is much more technically-oriented.   I would give you more suggestions, but the bands you listed are kinda all over the map and don't really form a pattern next to each other.."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,michpely,1 point,Tue May 5 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"I'm open to whatever you have in mind as long as it fits the 3 criteria I listed at the top. More than anything, I want bands that do something to set themselves apart from other bands and be unique."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,Mentioned_Videos,2,Wed May 6 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"Those 3 elements aren't very specific, looks like you'll have to just do the work like the rest of us!"
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,ianto7,2,Wed May 6 00:22:33 2015 UTC,I'm not looking for a specific sound. I just want people to list some of their favorite bands so I can find some new music.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,Warass,1 point,Wed May 6 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"Vale Of Pnath, Decrepit Birth, Alterbeast, The Zenith Passage"
TechnicalDeathMetal,34zpcv,Boggars,1 point,Tue May 5 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"As long as you can handle something more in the brutal realm, I would check out Inherit Disease. They are not going to be for you if you dislike the heavy ass gutteral vocal style, but they have some pretty tasty tunes and I'm a fan of the drums, especially dat snare.  I used to really dislike Origin, but like with nearly any band - especially tech death - you really need to listen to a decent amount of it to get an ear for their sound and how they use it. Origin has some of my favorite catchy tech riffs, and you can't help but deny John Longstreth is a badass.  I got a handful more that may be more obscure but I'm off to chow down on some grub. I'll update later this evening."
TechnicalDeathMetal,34uhe4,webb71,3,Mon May 4 17:43:40 2015 UTC,That whole album is fucking fantastic.
TechnicalDeathMetal,34uhe4,Echo8me,2,Tue May 5 03:05:46 2015 UTC,It is man. Probably my most anticipated album after Cattle Decapitation.

TechnicalDeathMetal,34njk8,diablo_man,2,Sun May 3 07:38:22 2015 UTC,Never heard of these guys before. Glad to see they are playing at Calgary Metalfest so I can check them out live. This sounds awesome!

TechnicalDeathMetal,33wvag,Turtley,2,Mon Apr 27 17:43:56 2015 UTC,Fun to watch. I think it sounds a bit like guitarpro though.
TechnicalDeathMetal,33qyyj,ayk00t,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty good!  I dig it.  I have an issue with bands lately mixing the bass drum too loud.  It ends up muffling the rest of the song, especially when you're rolling them for the whole song...  Vocals are a bit loud as well. Not a knock against the band, just a convenient platform for my grumbling."
TechnicalDeathMetal,33qyyj,Rikaru536,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:57:31 2015 UTC,"I love these guys, but i agree about the mixing, like whats up with the guitar solo tracks being 200% louder than any other part of the album??"
TechnicalDeathMetal,33qyyj,Sy-lo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Ya, it seems out of place.  It didn't offend my sensibilities as much, but strange mixing decisions...  I think the overmixing of kick-drums is a rampant problem for TDM bands, especially within the past 10 years."

TechnicalDeathMetal,334u12,vomitwolf,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:34:02 2015 UTC,"LOL, I can understand that sentiment, but I actually prefer sloppier playing like this to the kind of soulless, quantized playing heard in a lot of modern death metal."

I used to hang with Ryan, during his Allegaeon days, and he was super stoked to work with that shitbag, Lambesis. Now, he's been silent, in the metal community, after whatever didn't happen with Wes Hauch, when he moved to California. But he's got a super attractive, and talented musician, for a girlfriend... So that's cool"

TechnicalDeathMetal,32lbhv,jarHead420,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:08:32 2015 UTC,Definitely. Martyr is one of those bands that I have listened to enough that I begin to take for granted just how amazing they are/were.  Hopefully they can work out whatever issues they had and continue on. Just glad I was able to see them live at least once.  Daniel is a beast; so fast yet so precise.

After seeing Martyr open for Atheist, it was just like, who even gives a shit about the rest of the show.  That's how good Martyr was.  Really wish Dan Mongrain would do another album.  I know he's in Voivod now, but Martyr is just absolutely insane.  To think this album came out in 2006 too."

TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,kevinjenova,2,Thu Apr 9 09:15:11 2015 UTC,"whatever with all these posts hating on the fact that they don't agree that it falls into the ""technical"" genre. I believe these guys have very technical aspects, definitley not as technical as a lot of new bands, but the drums in particular are technical in a lot of their songs. and these guy's use a lot of very strange techniques and effects to make their sound very unique. One of the greatest bands i've ever witnessed. Love these guys."

TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,psyroptus,2,Wed Apr 8 23:44:55 2015 UTC,How is it not?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojira_%28band%29
TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,shabackwasher,8,Thu Apr 9 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of Gojira, have all their records and seen them in show.. Never thought of them as technical, yet their wiki page states them as so .. you have a point, but ummm.. here is what metal-archives says : Progressive/Groove/Death Metal.  I think the description fits them more.  Looking at what is usually posted here, I don't think they fill the criterias of ''technical''.  Not because it is easy to play but .. yeah... Take Meshuggah for exemple.  They play highly tehnical songs.. They just arent posted around here because they are not the kind of technical we are looking for. I think that's what /u/DaVincitheReptile meant."
TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,Tesseract91,3,Thu Apr 9 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"I think your response is nice to see.  A good explanation of DaVinci's intention.  I personally think it would be great if we could just down vote instead of calling it out like was done.  It seems childish to me.    Gojira is absolutely technical, but I'm not sure I would consider them death metal (in the traditional sense).  Categorizing something as tech death comes from death metal's origins.  Progressing from those origins we get what we usually see in this sub.  I would categorize Meshuggah in the same way as they weren't really born from death metal.    It feels to me like all the labeling has gotten a bit out of control, but I do agree that Gojira doesn't necessarily belong here.  Either way, its a good song."
TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,DaVincitheReptile,2,Thu Apr 9 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"I actually just had a conversation with a friend of mine the other day about this after seeing From Mars To Sirius on RateYourMusic's Top Death Metal albums.  I love Gojira and From Mars To Sirius is up their on my list of favourite albums. They certainly have aspects of death metal, but I would never call them strictly death metal. To list them among Death, Morbid Angel, Immolation, et al seem to be quite the juxtaposition.  I agree that Metal Archive's description is most apt to Gojira."
TechnicalDeathMetal,31xm7x,DaVincitheReptile,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:31:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, pretty much. there are technical aspects, mostly the drumming and weird time signature wankage, and I love Gojira as much as the next person (best show I ever saw), but really, they don't fit in on this sub.  I also find it weird to cite wikipedia as a source when trying to determine a band's genre... all genres are mixed up nowadays..."

On paper they were completely my thing, but I have a knack of heavily disliking innovative death metal at first and FREAKING LOVING it after some time. It was the same for Hybrid.

TechnicalDeathMetal,30c8sn,Tesseract91,3,Thu Mar 26 04:47:09 2015 UTC,Braindrill are stupidly tech but a lot of people can argue they aren't the most structured in the way they play.

TechnicalDeathMetal,30c8sn,dana87,2,Thu Mar 26 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"One thing that we cannot let ourselves do is conflate technicality with good musicianship. There are many Tech Death bands that are super technical but very bad songwriters, so when you ask which bands are the most 'technical' you may not get the bands that you actually want, unless you really only want noodily wanking.  Some of the most well known technicality oriented bands I would consider would be Archspire, Beneath the Massacre, Brain Drill, Origin, and Spawn of Possession. They all know how to play their instruments, but only a few albums from these bands are what I would consider 'good'.  I didn't listen to Spawn of Possession for a long time because without having listened to them, I thought they were exactly like Brain Drill. And I'm sorry, but I think Brain Drill fucking sucks. Oh how wrong I was though... All three SoP albums are incredible pieces of work and many here would consider Noctambulant their best. I would disagree. I would say that Incurso is not only their mangum opus but it is also the epitome of the entire genre right now over either Necrophagist album.   Incurso has absolutely everything that I love from this genre, most important being the face melting, well structured and catchy riffs.  I listen to death metal all day everyday and Incurso feel just that one step ahead of absolutely everything else. I just about crash my car everytime one of those songs come on because it's so fucking awesome that I can't not head bang maniacally to it.  If we take away having to be extremely technical I would consider, as /u/Fishbone_V mentioned, Anata to be among the top tiered technical death metal bands. They are just simply amazing songwriters through and through that I don't think many other technical death metal bands have matched.  It's really hard to be objective about but the classic and essential albums that come to mind when I think technical death is the following (in order of release):   Demilich - Nespithe (1993) Cryptopsy - None so Vile (1996) Gorguts - Obscura (1998) Necrophagist - Onset of Putrefaction (1999) Lykathea Aflame - Elvenfris (2000) !T.O.O.H.! - Order and Punishment (2005) Anata - The Conductor's Departure (2006) Spawn of Possession - Incurso (2012)"

TechnicalDeathMetal,30c8sn,dana87,3,Fri Mar 27 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"Heh, kinda but not really. Back in 2008 while I was playing on Xbox Live I all of a sudden got disconnected because my gamertag was reported and I had to change it right then and there. At the time in high school I was really into physics and stuff and decided to name myself some variant of 'Tesseract' because it was cool and I thought I was cool.   I typed it into Google just to make sure I would spell in correctly. Google probably knowing I liked metal had one of the links being 'tesseract band' and on a whim I clicked it, was intrigued and listen to them. At the time I was into mostly metalcore, just starting to get into more death metal and I was blown away to say the least.  It was just a couple of months after they had released that 2007 demo, so I started sharing it around with as people I could and Kerrazy. And man I must have listened to that demo a couple hundred times.  Can't say I was impressed with the direction that they took later on with the tone and vocals when they finally released an full length album but I have gone and seen them live a couple of times. I still spin that demo every once in a while and highly prefer those songs to the album versions. Maybe it's because I had heard them so much that listening a different variation didn't still well with my brain. I dunno, I still respect what Acle has done with everything so far. Wish Fellsilent was still a thing too.  Anyway, I just carried over my GamerTag when I joined reddit.  Here's the demo version of Concealing Fate Part 1 if you're curious."

Drums are pretty great too, although it sounds like they were recorded in a concert hall. Hard to hear the bass but that could just be youtube. Vocals are wacky. But in a good way. Obviously not english butnot like it matters.     Seriously glad you replied because like I said before, this band was in my shitlist.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2znw9e,broketm,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"Obviously you don't have the same definition of ""Jazzy"", Gorod are jazzy as fuck, in the vein of Cynic which is exactly what OP asked.  Beyond Creation as a strong jazz influence in the composition, etc... It's maybe more subtle than other bands mentionned but it's definitly jazzy eventhough I would recommend Augury over Beyond Creation, I think it matches better what's he's looking for.  Trepalium is arguably jazzy but it isn't that technical, it's more like groove death than tech death..."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2znw9e,shabackwasher,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:26:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call sweep picking jazzy. I think there are a lot of techniques (that are technical, whoo!) in tech death that don't blend well with jazz. Machine gun-style isn't very jazzy, blast beats aren't particularly jazzy etc.   The drumming is technical in Trepalium, I'd say. But it is more groove-oriented, you're right. Imo it's miles more jazz than Beyond Creation."

It is utilised by many different styles of metal.  In Adam MacGregor's definition, ""the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.""  Blast beats have been described as, ""maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence"".

TechnicalDeathMetal,2yr7gg,MOSh_EISLEY,2,Thu Mar 12 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"This. They're all solid albums, but some are dated. Would like to keep a fresh one going in the sidebar, or a sticky."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2yr7gg,DanceMasterFlash,3,Thu Mar 12 23:31:15 2015 UTC,People have already listen some of my pics but I'm gonna post mine anyway.  Pestilence - Spheres/Testimony of the Ancients  Cynic - Focus  Suffocation - Effigy of the Forgotten  Death - Human/Individual Thought Patterns Atheist - Unquestionable Presence  Immolation - Dawn of Possession  Cryptopsy - None so Vile  Deeds of Flesh - Crown of Souls (Though there are older albums I personally like this one a lot)  Necrophagist - Epitaph  Spawn of Possession - Cabinet  I've probably missed out a lot of good albums but I would say these albums are good examples of classic tech death.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2ygcvd,webb71,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:02:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously. I was wondering if you would put it into the ""best album of the year"" or the ""best techdeath album of the year"" pool. There's a bit of a disparity on quality between albums on one list to the other sometimes, I've found."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2ygcvd,BatFromSpace,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"Probably best tech death, I'd say it's too early to say for sure though."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2xyj68,paultagonist,3,Wed Mar 4 23:04:50 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does their logo look very Inanimate Existance-ish?
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xyj68,MKAW,2,Thu Mar 5 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"Well let's see..   Continuum   Inanimate Existence  Yeah definitely! They are both drawn by Christophe Szpajdel, who draws a shit ton of metal logos, so that's probably why. Many of my favorite logos are drawn by him (without computer aid of any kind, for what it's worth). I go out of my way to save my favorite metal logos and he's done like 80% of them."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xyj68,ayk00t,1 point,Thu Mar 5 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"Christophe Szpajdel also has a book called ""Lord of the Logos"". It's really awesome and I would recommend it if you're into metal logo designs."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2xub1d,Metal_Malachy,2,Wed Mar 4 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'd think they would have been added to Metal-Archives under the ""side project"" rule. I guess they'll be there for their debut. Looking forward to it, this track is pretty killer."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xuw7y,1PooNGooN3,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"I like the raw and disharmonic sound, kinda progressive too."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xtdsd,Skvli,3,Tue Mar 3 19:01:17 2015 UTC,a little too melodic and over-produced for my tastes. lots of deathcore cliches mixed in. obviously good musicians. might not be the feedback that you were hoping for but that's my initial reaction.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xoxrw,webb71,2,Mon Mar 2 18:20:16 2015 UTC,Joe Haley is seriously a riff machine. Holy crap!
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xoxrw,_brendan_,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"I had high expectations for the album, but IMO the three songs released before the album are the best out of them all. Too bad, I wanted more songs like Echoes or Cold"

TechnicalDeathMetal,2xmmja,MOSh_EISLEY,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the most underrated albums of 2014. It's got so much variety, the riffs are fantastic and the songwriting as a whole is amazing. It's definitely one of my favorite albums of 2014, along with Archspire's latest album."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Anscharius,8,Fri Feb 27 20:08:36 2015 UTC,This album was one of the most pleasant surprises for me last year.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,HookerCooker,7,Fri Feb 27 21:40:24 2015 UTC,Nick Schendzielos was the saving grace for this album. I love every JFAC album but he makes this one really unique.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Dominoes282,3,Fri Feb 27 23:18:40 2015 UTC,that bass tone is amazing.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,gaztelu_leherketa,1 point,Sat Feb 28 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't know he was on this album until I checked the lineup after giving it a listen. I'm a big Cephalic Carnage fan and I gave this one a try (like I have with all JFAC's previous efforts, but to little avail), and I was practically drooling over that bass tone. By far their best and most unique effort to date, in my opinion."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Caize,4,Sat Feb 28 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to JFAC since day one. I never really liked any of their early death-supercore stuff but this album really highlights their change in style, they've gotten soooo much better"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,rpgoof,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:19:28 2015 UTC,The mood the guitar creates and the melody counterpoint created by the bass is brilliant. Best album of 2014 IMO
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,genghiscoyne,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:30:46 2015 UTC,One of my favorite albums of 2014. I love that they didn't just put out the same music they have in the past. Has a very proggy feel to it.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Bossman1086,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"Its annoying to see people say like ""wow what a twist"" when talking about JFAC. They havent been deathcore since 2007 and their last 2 albums have been pretty much borderline tech-death. This album seems to perfectly align with what they've been slowly going for, and didn't surprise me when its full on tech-death. Can't wait to hear what they choose to do next."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Frostcrag64,1 point,Sat Feb 28 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"I know a fair amount of people who have the same opinion as me regarding their previous efforts and kind of have the, ""wow, what a twist"" reaction when I think about this album. Basically, I thought their other tech-death-ish albums were all kind of watered-down and uninspired. Granted, it's all just a matter of opinion, but I found it difficult for any of their previous material to actually stick after a few listens. This is a ""twist"" to me in that it was surprising; refreshing. Totally not bashing your opinion on the matter, though. I don't wanna come across that way."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Caize,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"I agree its a big twist in the sense that it is their best album yet and is really good, but people are constantly saying like ""Wow i thought they were deathcore this is a turn for the better!"" And I'm just sitting here like come on man they've been either tech death or regular death metal for a long time"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,Frostcrag64,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:25:38 2015 UTC,These guys are techdeath now? Wow...
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,nunsrevil,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:53:10 2015 UTC,Have been since after their first album really. Their only properly deathcore stuff was their first EP.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2xdywm,malachymac95,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"They've been tech death since Ruination (2009), but this album is by far the best tech death they've made imo."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2x9eqb,xvw,5,Thu Feb 26 18:54:10 2015 UTC,I love the tech n9ne influence haha
TechnicalDeathMetal,2x9eqb,danlowlite,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:33:32 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting. Do you have a track/album to recommend from him?
TechnicalDeathMetal,2x9eqb,GingaNinja150,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's got a huge discography with tons of different styles of phrasing. I'll give you a song that I like, and then one that he goes fast in.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2x6upa,bbristowe,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:46:37 2015 UTC,Hopefully it works out. The Faceless seems to have an awful track record.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2x42m6,xvw,2,Wed Feb 25 17:10:44 2015 UTC,I'm so excited for their self-split. Hopefully that comes out soon.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2x42m6,Tesseract91,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"I just can't seem to get into this band. I think it's because of their muddy production. Thanks, though."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2wa71e,kevmal666,3,Wed Feb 18 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"The band has since posted an update, here's the quote: ""Hi everyone, Simon here. I would like to clarify some information about the fact that Dominic will no longer be part of the band. We know that Dominic’s contribution to Beyond Creation was a big inspiration for many of you and we can definitely say that he is an incredible bass player with a lot of skills and groove. But for some personal reasons, there was a decision to take and this does not mean that Beyond Creation stops with it. I have composed all the music and lyrics on both albums and a big part of the arrangements but each musician wrote their own arrangements and solos to put their feels on it. I also manage the business and the booking for the band and I have the chance to work and play with Kevin and Philippe that are incredibly talented musicians. I’ve started the band with high ambitions and dreams, and none of that has or will change…. This is only the beginning of a long career for Beyond Creation. We are all looking at the same goals and we will definitely continue to play, tour and record music for a long time. Do not worry, we will make sure to have a new bassist able to play and compose high quality arrangements , just like Dom has for our 2 current albums. Dominic still our good friend and we know he will continue to shred the bass with his other bands and future projects. We have big tours announcement coming soon and a lot of good things on the way so thanks to all of you for your support and we hope to see you on the road."""
TechnicalDeathMetal,2wa71e,caknuckle,2,Wed Feb 18 20:19:47 2015 UTC,Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. I mean how many great fretless bass players with amazing hair are there?

TechnicalDeathMetal,2ug5de,Unr1valed,3,Mon Feb 2 16:42:08 2015 UTC,This album is not technical at all. Some of their earlier stuff is more appropriate.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2u5ha1,chingwraithism,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:06:59 2015 UTC,I just noticed that on mobile this post doesn't open at the 9:11 mark as I wanted. The tune I intended to link to is the fourth one on this split EP between Nefas and another Italian band called Bastard Saints.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2u2yix,xvw,2,Thu Jan 29 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"Alkaloid is basically Obscura v2.0 This song is good, but I guess I'm kinda expecting more from this lineup."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2u2yix,Flunx,2,Thu Jan 29 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'd wait to see what Steffen Kummerer does with Obscura now that he's the main songwriter - Hannes mentioned that Steffen wanted to do the more catchy tech death songs like ""Anticosmic Overload"" while Hannes wanted to do more proggy stuff like ""Septuagint"" which this reminds me of moreso than older Obscura.   Liked what I heard, though it's a bit - off? Can't put my finger on it - probably just need more listens/a listen to the whole album."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2u1e9h,bouvre,3,Thu Jan 29 02:45:17 2015 UTC,That's wicked. This album is going to slay.  On a side note: Unique Leader has picked up a lot of killer bands over the last year and a bit.

I listened to it so many times that by the time I got to hear the album version I was already so accustomed to hearing it without vocals that I prefer the instrumental.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2rfc6d,JamSaxon,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:41:11 2015 UTC,Sounded more like straight tech to me but a little.  In Incubate the Wasteland they had a different vocalist and guitarist who left to form Decades of Despair. Not tech but blackened melodeath and id highly recommend. Alive is an amazing album by them.

TechnicalDeathMetal,2rdd6k,chronologicalist,5,Mon Jan 5 04:47:19 2015 UTC,"I fucking love this track. Quote from Karl Sanders:  ""The Burning Pits of the Duat"" features further collaboration with Dallas. I worked on the lyrics and Dallas set the to music. Dallas really felt that the lyrics and title unquestionably called for utter underworld socery - riffs so fast, chopping and iniquitous as to muscally capture the sensation of being consumed in pits of fire.  So Dallas went to work, and the infernal riffing he conjured was so overwhelming in its brutality and hellish in its technicality that for the rest of us to play the material correctly required weeks of intense rehearsal; not only to play the riffs clean and in time (and to legitimately nail the tricky changes), but for the drums to maintain the overwhelming 256 BPM blasting, constant quick beat changing and crazy fills.  This was the impossible song at Nile rehearsals - not only challenging but excruciatingly painful. I would return home every night with my wrist in so much pain that I begun to wonder if the song would end my career. After weeks of work, when we finally got the song rehearsed to the point of being able to consistently nail it, I breathed a thankful sigh of relief. I was reminded of the time when John McEntree (Incantation guitarist) toured with Immolation, and spent the whole tour with his wrists in agony, wearing wrist braces, because he was unaccustomed to the strain of using completely differing groups of wrist muscles neded to play Bob Vigny's unusual riffing style. Dallas had ""Vigny'ized"" me. The song is undeniably deliciously malevolent, yet fun to play, even if it fucking hurts like a bitch."""

I love that back story because it illustrates how much time, effort, dedication, and musicianship goes into creating the most brutal shit in existence.

The resulting conversation led me to believe that Anomalous was Max's studio only hobby band, and that they would likely never play shows.  Nate has since left, Marco left the bay area IIRC, and they haven't released anything since.  At best, we can hope for another album, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a tour."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,ElasticConcatenation,5,Mon Dec 29 22:27:42 2014 UTC,Vale of Pnath are worth a listen too.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,ayk00t,3,Tue Dec 30 14:12:46 2014 UTC,Great band!
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,vomitwolf,3,Tue Dec 30 15:49:57 2014 UTC,"These are some angry fast tech death bands: Vireamia, Malebolgia, Henker, The Infinite Within  This is more in the Archspire style: First Fragment, Cytotoxin"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,riversofgore,2,Wed Dec 31 02:18:55 2014 UTC,"Man, I wish Vireamia would release some new stuff. And Cytotoxin is pretty good, too. I will check out these other bands."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,jrowske,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:25:13 2014 UTC,"Dude no shit, where the fuck are they? That EP got (and still gets) heavy rotation at my place Edit: I just listened to Malebolgia, sick AS"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,jrowske,2,Thu Jan 15 05:39:50 2015 UTC,"You might like Beneath the Massacre and Fleshgod Apocalypse, though they aren't exactly like Archspire."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,jrowske,3,Mon Dec 29 20:50:17 2014 UTC,I'm familiar with both of them. They definitely have similar qualities. I think Archspire may be somewhat of a trend setter in their specific niche of modern death metal.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,jrowske,3,Mon Dec 29 20:58:00 2014 UTC,I completely agree.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,jrowske,2,Mon Dec 29 23:08:32 2014 UTC,I wish Monumental Torment had a new album. It's one of the angriest things I've ever listened to.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,slipstream37,2,Mon Dec 29 22:32:16 2014 UTC,Me too! Really blistering stuff.
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,IAmTheEngineer,2,Tue Dec 30 15:46:37 2014 UTC,"Archspire won album of the year for me. I don't think he does any inhales though. Check out the ""vocal play through"" video. The dude is a beast.  Others have said Monumental Torment. I'll second that.   I've seen Vale of Pnath mentioned too. That's a great band.   Posthumous Blasphemer is also good. Check them out. They are a little more slammy but the tech side is definitely there too."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,Tha_Doctor,3,Tue Dec 30 14:26:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely my favorite of the year. Maybe one of the guitarists does backups in Archspire? Check out around this part in this song. I'm pretty sure it's inhales, so it could be backups: http://youtu.be/WEuiZFb2wHY?t=2m4s I haven't heard Pothumous Blashpemer, and I love slam mixed with tech stuff (there doesn't seem to be too many bands who do). I'll check them out too!"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,HookerCooker,2,Tue Dec 30 15:48:23 2014 UTC,"It's not clear in the video if it's inhale or not, but it is clear that it is all him... http://youtu.be/LTOxsbyEHmM  The dude is a freaking beast. I actually don't mind the inhales if that is what he's doing. He kind of just accents with them and I like when vocalists use many techniques. The dude from Acrania is pretty good at having vocal variety too.  For Posthumous Blasphemer, check out this song: http://youtu.be/Z0FlvVyTGPo"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qqn6o,vomitwolf,2,Tue Dec 30 15:56:47 2014 UTC,"Ah, okay. Yeah, I don't mind either. That was just me trying to find something wrong with the band if I had to be super picky ha ha.  I'll check that out. Thanks for the link."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2qq34p,webb71,7,Mon Dec 29 17:07:57 2014 UTC,This whole album is so fucking perfect

Going to count Irreversible Mechanism as next year, since I missed it for the brief time it was out before they got signed.  Also interested in Alkaloid.  Probably most excited for Gorod.  EDIT: Almost forgot. The Schoenberg Automaton have Apus coming out early in the new year. Pretty excited for that, even if they're moving to Canada.  Arkaik have been teasing something due next year as well, that should be fun."

TechnicalDeathMetal,2qc3qs,Lagerbottoms,3,Thu Dec 25 12:21:01 2014 UTC,GOROD! But i'm also excited for the new Vale of Pnath and I really hope Diskreet will release some new stuff. Oh and of course the new album of The Zenith Passage!

We've now signed to them and are going to be finishing the artwork for the release, and it will come out again with a full digital and physical release early next year.  To those lucky few who were able to purchase the album during this time, please keep it private for now. Thank you for all the support!"""

TechnicalDeathMetal,2panzu,xvw,4,Sun Dec 14 21:52:31 2014 UTC,"This is fucking sick. This is honestly a prime example of how I like my tech-death, from vocal stylings to mixing/mastering.  I really hate when tech death is so over-produced that the finished product makes the guitars sound almost synthy, like the sounds were programmed for a video game or something.  And the drums in this track! They sound like fucking drums! So many modern tech death albums mix the drums to sound like mouse clicks or something.   It doesn't sound like robots made it, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I may even venture so far as to call this melodic tech-death."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2panzu,probablynotokyea,2,Mon Dec 15 22:17:45 2014 UTC,same feeling man!
TechnicalDeathMetal,2panzu,probablynotokyea,1 point,Mon Dec 15 22:25:15 2014 UTC,"I think this album is definitely going to be a ""guitarist's"" album. Just from the way the guitars are mixed, both in tone and volume, and the fact there are what sounds like 5 guitar tracks in some parts, and that noodly fuckin solo-intermission thing. I'm so stoked.   Maybe I'm biased because I play guitar, but I also love how the vocals aren't forced on the listener, if that makes sense. A lot of engineers will beef up the vocals such that you can't help but notice them, but it's nice and subtle here. Fuckin bueno."

My style lies somewhere between Melodic Death Metal, Tech Death, Black Metal, and Progressive Metal/Progressive Rock. I just try to stay as diverse as I can. Are you in a band?"
TechnicalDeathMetal,2p6ofz,tokegar,1 point,Sun Dec 14 00:56:21 2014 UTC,"Same here, but I still feel like there is a dearth in metal bands, especially in the New Brunswick area. I like to play stuff like Gojira, Mastodon, and Behemoth, and I often jam on styles much like the ones you do. I would be really interested in combining the kinds of things that we like into a larger entity. I am not currently in a band."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2p6ofz,tokegar,1 point,Sun Dec 14 03:28:04 2014 UTC,"I would definitely be really interested in jamming, if you're down for it? I know of a couple drummers and a bassist at the moment who are good and always down to jam when they can free up time, both of whom have similar interests of the bands you just named. I always like to start getting used to each other's styles of playing, and then take it from there."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2p6ofz,Rikaru536,1 point,Sun Dec 14 03:39:15 2014 UTC,I would absolutely be interested in jamming!

TechnicalDeathMetal,2ot4s9,Tesseract91,2,Wed Dec 10 20:36:57 2014 UTC,"Mindly Rotten is my favorite band out of the Colombian brutal death scene. I've seen them compared to other Colombian outfits like Internal Suffering and Carnal, as well as Desecravity (Japan), but they seem pretty unique to me.  The Most Exquisite Agonies was their debut and gained them some internet notoriety for being an example of the totally over-the-top brutal deathmetal coming out of Colombia. However, it's really chaotic and sloppy, to say the least. Moreover, the songs are less distinct than later releases and tend to run into each other. It took me a while to appreciate and I don't even try to justify my reasons for liking it to others, LOL. I recommend checking out their latest two albums.  Here are some links to YouTube and Grooveshark for anyone interested:  Their debut album: The Most Exiquisite Agonies (2005)  Their second album Proliferation of Disaster (2011) was my introduction to Mindly Rotten. I became an instant fan of theirs upon encountering the videos for Outside Forces and Primordial Absence. Totally insane!  The new album Effacing the Origin (2013) has the tightest playing, catchiest songwriting, and cleanest production of all three releases. It's catchy, but still really weird. Very different from their debut."
TechnicalDeathMetal,2ot4s9,Tesseract91,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:37:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the links.   Just listened to them both. Their newest album is definitely WAY tighter and groovy, I could see myself listening to it again."
