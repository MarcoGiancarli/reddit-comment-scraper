deadpool,3e2xw6,rokudaimehokage,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:24 2015 UTC,well there will be a deadpool and spider-man comic out soon so that's something to look forward to.

deadpool,3e2xw6,Gates9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:16 2015 UTC,I'm curious how the newly announced spidey and deadpool comics will unfold. I know both spidey and deadpool have a motor mouth but deadpool comics can be pretty dark and gory at times. But then again I haven't read that many Spider-Man comics.

deadpool,3e2vcy,MatticusVP,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:28 2015 UTC,Yeah :) I loved the cover
deadpool,3e4jdw,TherionSaysWhat,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"Im reading this one right now. It has Deadpool's first appearance in New Mutants, and then a 4 issue run called The Circle Chase that features Cable, Copycat, and Weasel. Then it goes to 4 issues of Deadpool from 1994 and the first issue of Joe Kelly's Deadpool from '97. Ive enjoyed it and am buying the follow up right now."
deadpool,3e4jdw,MatticusVP,2,Tue Jul 21 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it! The classics is the way to go, in my opinion. It's serious and touching but pretty fucking funny as well. And if the annual 98' issue is in the compilation, you get to see the weapon x program and what happened to Wade Wilson. It's a pretty fucking good way to get to know deadpool. And when you are done with the classics, I would suggest ""Cable and Deadpool"" or the run from 2012."
deadpool,3e4jdw,psychomis,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you want to start at the beginning, then definitely yes, that's what you want.    You will also note on the sidebar though that overall this subs favourite run is the Cable & Deadpool run, so if you wanted to, you could also start with this.  If you're reading in ""release order"", then you're going to read Cable & Deadpool after ""Classics"" anyway. The general order of the ""ongoing series"" is:   Deadpool 1997 (classics). Cable & Deadpool. Deadpool Vol. 2 Deadpool Vol. 3   Enjoy."

That is the entire conversation where the boxes appear. I noticed a couple of things when i was writing it all down.  1)The first four boxes say the same thing. I checked and there are no differences at all. 2) Many of the letters in the words are in the same line on a keyboard 3) Some words seem to repeat suck as B and A I think the code might have something to do with moving the letters over on a keyboard. for example if you wanted to type ""as"" it would be ""sd"" but i haven't checked. If you can help me figure this out it would be greatly appreciated. Im going to be posting this on some other threads such as /r/riddles, /r/codes, and /r/ciphers"

deadpool,3drio7,HGFantomas,7,Sat Jul 18 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"As DP himself is fond of pointing out, he has a different origin based upon who is writing him."
deadpool,3drio7,HGFantomas,4,Sat Jul 18 21:42:09 2015 UTC,"This. Also, the movie will address his origin. Bottom line: he's a solider then a mercenary. Finds out he has cancer. Is approached by Weapon X, volunteers, gets Logan's healing factor in him. The cancer accelerates the healing but also makes him insane. He's rejected from that program then tortured and tormented. The other rejects have a betting pool on who will die next from the torture. Wade beats the odds, escapes and becomes Deadpool, the merc with the mouth. His origin was a little shady like Logan's due to the experimentation. Later on its revealed that someone from the program has been knocking him out over the years and harvesting his organs."
deadpool,3drio7,1n3br14t3d,2,Sun Jul 19 08:10:10 2015 UTC,There really is no candid origin for Deadpool as many writers love to put their own spin on it which truly is the beauty of his character.

deadpool,3dmt9x,Fuzzypupy123,16,Fri Jul 17 15:26:43 2015 UTC,can we get someone smart to breakdown the trailer?  The green suit is obviously referencing green lantern.  no there isn't two fucking car crash scenes you goober.  its crazy to me she complains about using the same joke twice yet she also complains about minor differences in the car scene like angle of the camera or the fact the ending of the scene follows with a continuation of the story rather than deadpool begging for the movie to be made.
deadpool,3dmt9x,aadams9900,5,Fri Jul 17 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Right? She's comparing video footage of the official trailer that was recorded from a phone and leaked alpha test footage, test footage that wasn't even supposed to be released might I add and was just for testing.The test footage probably wasn't gonna be part of the movie anyways and its intent was just to see a visual of the scene before they actually recorded it in live-action form. I looked at this video and was looking forward to a breakdown not a commentary. A commentary that showcases examples of a very pixelated leaked video."
deadpool,3dmt9x,Tylertarian,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"In-depth breakdown on this ""in depth breakdown"".   First of all, this person is way too hung up on the TEST FOOTAGE being actual movie footage. The Test Footage is most likely in the garbage because they re-shot that scene completely and the new trailer pretty obviously relays that information. Is it that unbelievable that between the 10+ years this script has been being developed that it hasn't been rewritten in certain areas?  Is there really any doubt in your mind that Weapon X won't be bad? Why even say that in this video? We know they are bad because the actors working at Weapon X as Ajax and Angel Dust respectively have already made it clear they are playing the villains in the movie did you do ANY research? You remedy the ""green costume and animated"" portion of the video with that quick shot of Green Lantern, which I am thankful for because I almost blew a fuse during that part. Can you honestly tell me you can see a knee coming in that explosion?  She takes a shot at the VFX people with the whole ""green screen"" in the background from this hazy iPhone footage that we can hardly see, not to mention that Reynolds specifically said that the VFX in this trailer are incomplete and that is the entire reason it's not being officially released yet... Let me un-confuse you on the car scene, he doesn't re-use a joke from a previous scene, this was one of the CLEAR moments that you should have realized that this scene is being completely reshot and rewritten from the test footage. There are NOT going to be two scenes where Deadpool gets out of the van... The person walking by in that bar scene was Wade Wilson, this scene was put in as an Easter Egg as he is walking past Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld, and Reynolds even says his name in his hard to miss voice that even my mom caught on her first watch of the trailer. NEXT THING SIGHHHH, ""The error in film making"" from this high-quality piece of in-depth coverage is being stated as a mistake because it is too hard to believe a person can move? uhhhh what?   I'm sorry if OP is not the actual creator of this YouTube video, but using my keen detective skills I looked into OP's previous posts, and I can see more videos from the same YouTube channel so I will assume it is. This ""in depth breakdown"" actually made me mad watching it. I had to put my thoughts down or I don't think I could sleep. No offense to you personally OP, but this video was completely out of your depth not to mention you didn't even wait for the trailer to be released officially so you couldn't even get down to the nitty-gritty and the video will most likely be taken down due to copyright infringement. Sorry that this post turned into a rant, but I just had to get some of my thoughts down. There are a couple more things I didn't put in and OP as you said at the end of your video, I am happy to debate anything I have said with you. I have no disrespect towards you personally but like I said, I just had to get my thoughts down and I think that the entire reason for this video was to spark up conversation anyway."
deadpool,3dmt9x,Shutty,2,Sat Jul 18 11:00:31 2015 UTC,Got so hung up on the whole test footage crap. Nothing said the test footage scene is in the movie.
deadpool,3dmt9x,drummer0702,5,Sat Jul 18 02:15:17 2015 UTC,The person who made this video is an idiot. Just because a scene showed him using a joke from the test footage...doesn't mean he uses the joke in that scene. The sound could've been dubbed in. You never see his mouth move for gods sake!  Does this moron not know that there are scenes and dialogue in trailers that don't match and are sometimes not even in the movie?!?!?!?!?
deadpool,3dmt9x,physicscat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:46 2015 UTC,EXACTLY. It's called test footage for a reason. They were probably testing a possible scene in the movie with a CGI incarnation just to see before they actually filmed it in live-action.

deadpool,3dlis2,Guffrey,3,Fri Jul 17 06:49:36 2015 UTC,"Just cause the cover art looks bad, does not mean the writing or inner art may be bad as well. I have faith in Duggan taking over for Remender on Uncanny Avengers and putting Deadpool on the team."
deadpool,3dlis2,T-Baggins415,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"I'm just not a fan of how he drew it on the cover. It turns how the artist for this series, Ryan Stegman, is the one who drew the cover. I'm still going to buy the series but he DID NOT give me a good impression of his art."
deadpool,3dlis2,Guffrey,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"As well as, I'm very excited to see that Duggan is taking over as well. I have absolutely no worries about Duggan especially after his work in DP's solo series."
deadpool,3dlis2,SmokeySmokes,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"I lost all respect for Duggan after he tweeted that he thinks DP is bi-sexual.

My niece had a wish granted when she was 5 (many years ago) and she would be the first to tell you that it made all the difference. Stuck in a hospital for two years, chemo, the same walls, it would weigh on anyone, but especially a little kid. But, then here comes Make-A-Wish essentially reminding her that there is a life to fight for outside the hospital. She beat cancer and just graduated college with a degree in...wait for it...non-profit management. So, not only did Make-A-Wish make a difference in her life, it sent her on a path of making a difference in countless other lives. Also consider, had my niece not survived, at least Make-A-Wish creates a happy memory to hold on to instead of 'Remember those hours sitting in the hospital.'  Thank you very much for donating :)"

Because what has just been happening on the subs movies/comicbooks/etc last couple days? A plethora of SDCC coverage, including BVS trailer, Suicide Squad trailer, the Apocalypse info being put out there, now the F.F. newest trailer release... they would be lost in the shuffle.  So they're smart. Give it a month, let all of that backlog of hype get unloaded from the train, and then release the glorious HD trailer."

deadpool,3d8c3j,HydraInfinite,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:21 2015 UTC,I watched the comic con thing on YouTube and some people talking about it afterwards. Apparently Ryan Reynolds said he won't do any more superhero movies after this one and I want death to at least appear in it if they don't make another one.   But they totally could if they fucked up deadpools face some more and get a new actor
deadpool,3d8c3j,Char10tti3,6,Wed Jul 15 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"What Ryan Reynolds meant is that he doesn't want to play as another superhero. He wants to continue as Deadpool and only Deadpool. But if this movie fails and a sequel isn't possible, then this will be his last one. That's what he meant."

deadpool,3d72l9,snapdragonj,16,Tue Jul 14 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"This is why i personally believe that Ryan Reynolds was the ONLY logical choice for this role. He is such a huge Deadpool fan, and he fought as hard as he did for this movie because of his love for the character, and for the fans. The fact that he cried at the sight of how perfect the costume was... that doesn't surprise me at all, but it makes me so happy that he cares that much about how close to perfect this costume is."

deadpool,3d9jdv,imbatman_yo,8,Tue Jul 14 15:50:55 2015 UTC,Yeah and I'm almost positive it'll be significantly different because 1. He said the visual effects wouldn't be ready for a few weeks or something like that and 2. They might have to tone down the language so that it can be released in theaters. Unless they just say fuck it which also wouldn't surprise me. Either way I'm excited
deadpool,3d9jdv,redditmonkey85,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:39 2015 UTC,One thing I noticed with the leaked trailer. If you look closely at the fighting inside the SUV it looks as if the background is greenscreen. I mean it might just be the super low quality who knows how much of that trailer wasn't finished.   We've seen early trailers before that lack CGI. I believe Guardians of the Galaxy's first trailer looked good but a later one had the same shots but with CGI and color added.

deadpool,3d6rbu,T-Baggins415,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"Oh shit you were talking about Deadpool's game huh? Yeah I played that, the story and the dialogue is 10/10 for a Deadpool game, gameplay is pretty shit tho :("

deadpool,3d6rbu,T-Baggins415,2,Thu Jul 16 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"5/10 Type of shit gameplay, not extremely shit, but it ain't good if you played lots of good third person shooter/beat 'em up games. If you're getting the game for $15 or less than it'll be worth it, it's still a pretty great game for Deadpool fans. God fucking dammit, if only the gameplay was great this game would've been popular as fuck, once again Activision fucked things up :("
deadpool,3d6rbu,Lord_Chrisicus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"It's one of the best fighting games in terms of gameplay, who heard it wrong. This game is more than 5 years old and it still kicks ass and lots of people still play it online, on top of being the 2nd most played fighting games in every year's EVO (EVO is the biggest tournament for fighting games), the first most played fighting game is Street Fighter 4 but that's just another story for another day.  BTW EVO is starting in Friday, look it up, and watch some Marvel vs Capcom 3 videos, it'll increase your hype."
deadpool,3d6rbu,dogwoodfan777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"Nobody is a bigger fan of Deadpool than I am. I have his first appearance, first action figure, first #1, most of the comics he's ever appeared in and I'm working on getting them all except for the variants. When I learned he was going to be in Marvel versus Capcom three I was as happy as a little girl! Imagine my horror when I saw how MvC3 made his air combo so ridiculously hard to do what with having to tap jump again in the air halfway through his air combo. I could never get it down. Plus with Dante being so overpowered and everyone picking him and just raping if you picked any other character besides him just infuriated me. I gave up on that game maybe three months after it came out and never played it ever again.  I pray that if Deadpool is ever put in a fighting game again that all the characters are evenly balanced with power and they get rid of that stupid jump in the middle of his air combo. I'm a big air combo guy I love doing them. To make DP's air combo the hardest one in the game made me want to put my foot through my TV. Plus why was his teleportation unpredictably made to hurt him sometimes that is such bullshit."
deadpool,3d6rbu,Lord_Chrisicus,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:36 2015 UTC,His standalone game made for a lot of laughs too. I played the whole campaign at my friends place one night. Stayed up till sunrise playing it!!

deadpool,3czekx,awesomesprime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"I have to say:  The vulgarity seems childish.  Yes, vulgarity is a part of Deadpool, but Deadpool is also censored in Marvel comics.  Innuendo working around the censors is a big part of how he is written in Marvel.  Deadpool even sees when his word bubbles get censored and yells at the writers.  Deadpool is almost like a fourth wall breaking version of Bender from Futurama.  Making Deadpool drop constant F-bombs doesn't make him funnier, just like making Bender drop F-bombs wouldn't make him funnier.  If anything, it makes the writing feel lazier.  I know this is not a popular opinion, but I'd rather see a PG-13 Deadpool with censorship as something to be made fun of (see the Scott Pilgrim ""How are you doing that with your mouth?"" censored cursing scene), resembling the comics, and clever innuendo, than a movie that resembles Deadpool MAX or the video game, with language, sex, and drugs thrown in your face to make the movie seem as ""mature"" as possible.  Loved the meta Green Lantern jokes though."

deadpool,3czekx,ThatOneNerdyGuy,3,Mon Jul 13 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"Except that it's not. I read Deadpool comics.  I enjoy Deadpool comics.  I tried to check out the Deadpool video game.  The Deadpool game, and MAX comics, go out of their way to force vulgarity to the point that, for me, they cannot be enjoyed.  Here's the thing: In the comics, Deadpool is censored.  The fact that he's censored is joked about constantly.  He sees the censors on his word bubble.  Violence against very human characters is often shot at least partially offscreen (though aliens, zombies, robots and monsters get extremely gory dismembering) and sexual and potty humor totally exists, but it's kept subtle.  And the subtley is part of what makes it funny.  Deadpool comics are inherently PG-13.  Deadpool spinoffs seem to always veer in to R, because they double-down on the vulgarity.  It reminds me how Sonic games were remembered as ""fast"", but weren't actually that fast, but all the sequels have doubled down on making the games as fast as possible at the expense of the good gameplay that made the games good.  When I watch the video game, or this trailer...they're going out of their way to make Deadpool as vulgar as possible and dropping far more language than he uses in the comics, and it's trying to carry humor from crudeness, which for me, isn't funny.  It's just crude, and not really what I enjoy from Deadpool comics.  EDIT: Ok, analogy.  Deadpool is crude in the same sense that Bender from Futurama is crude.  I don't think dropping F-bombs would make Bender funnier."

Btw, Slade's son was kidnapped by some guys and Slade killed them but the kidnapped slit the kid's throat, causing him to be mute. Slade wife freaked out because Slade could've stopped it all by just telling the kidnappers what they wanted to know and she shot him in the head, taking out his eye. Also, there have been multiple Ravagers, including random other people and multiple Wilson's (including Slade himself) so really, who killed Ravager?"

The Ultimate Spider-Man comics, though, have Wadey Wilson and the Reavers, a bunch of mutant hating cyborg junkies (and for some reason only the Spanish version of the Marvel wiki has this picture of them)."

deadpool,3cx7yo,smishmortion,8,Sat Jul 11 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"Read deadpools 1st actual self titled comic series, started in 1997. (There were two mini series and a number of guest appearances including most prominently new mutants 98, and x- force.)  But the first series will show you:  Weasel, deadpool's lackey/friend?/arms dealer/computer nerd;   Blind Al, deadpool's friend/mother figure who we kidnapped and keeps on his house to mess with;   Ajax, a mercenary of Killebrew- the man responsible for deadpool;  Angel dust comes in much much later (after 2002) but is also in this movie.   Other characters include vanessa-copycat, domino- a mercenary that creates luck, and various others though are not going to be in the movie to my knowledge.  IMO the 1st series is by far the best. A tpb or hc will be the best route as issues from the 1st series are expensive (#1 goes as high as $100 slabbed)  As for the comment directly above yours, many in the deadpool community are butthurt about the influx of new fans because of the movie. This is bound to happen though, and while a dick move don't pay them much mind. Deadpool  is a fantastic character, comic, and enigma. And I'm glad newcomers are expressing interest!

Deadpool gives you a constant reminder that it is one thing to have superpowers and be cool because of that, it is an entirely different thing to have crippling flaws, things that normal people would kill themselves over, and still function, and not only function, but function with more morality, more integrity, and more charisma then all of the other traditional characters taken together.   it's a reminder that no matter how hard you get, no matter how sucessfull you get, no matter how big strong scary and impressive you get, there is allways the jester in red and black.   What does super mind matter to someone who hears voices that agree with him?  What does super killer mean to someone who can not die?  What does super beauty mean to someone who on a good day metasthasizes just a little bit?   Deadpool, just because of that, was allways the character that I could recommend to everyone. You have problems? Wanna see a guy who has real problems?   Taking deadpools scitzophrenia away is a mixed bag of nuts.  On the one hand, it is in the future, and I know I should trust the writers more.  On the other hand, it could end up like the remake of peter parker with the overly attractive indie guy cast as a hormony nerd.   stillhoping"
deadpool,3cnx5q,Meistermalkav,6,Thu Jul 9 12:31:36 2015 UTC,"The only time Deadpool heard voices was during the 4 year (2008 - 2012) Daniel Way era. Which was the shallowest story writing we ever got for Deadpool. That's when all he gave us was ""lol, so random Memepool.""  The 20 years prior Deadpool had no stupid voices. Good fucking riddance."
deadpool,3cnx5q,loki1887,2,Thu Jul 9 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"You could also argue that he heard the voice of agent Preston, whose consciousness was put into Wade's head by he necromancer friend Micheal, during the Duggan/Posehn run. Her consciousness was eventually taken out and implanted into a cyborg Preston."

deadpool,3cnx5q,TheDaveWSC,22,Thu Jul 9 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"Two points.   One, old blind al.   Two, I think the deadpool I see is a capable troll.   I am not talking about internet troll, of course. I am talking about troll in the same sense that zen masters troll. They troll for enlightenment.   Think about it. Deadpool does not break people by beating them using his specialities, he breaks them by using theirs. He sucks up all their mojo, and finds the ONE thing, the ONE THING they never ever thought could happen to them.   I would say, deadpool reads people, and reads what people project outwards, and inverts it before he reacts to it.   Wolverine? Quintessentially the immortal beast warrior, gruff, lone wolf, rides with no one, extremely abrasive personality. BOOOm, deadpools bestie.   Sexy ladies? reduced to walking breasts. The only lady he wants is death ( aka, the possibly only lady he never ever could have), and the only lady he does not want is also his mother character, blind al.   Taskmaster, whose pride is perfect mimicry? defeated by deadpools irratic fighting style.   Tony Stark is rich beyond his wildest dreams, but if Deadpool needs a jet, Deadpool borrows a jet, and leaves an IOU, just like a roommate would if he borrowed 20 bucks. Hell, Tony stark would most likely have given the jet to deadpool, but this way, he is reminded that deadpool does not see him as a superhero, or a rich man, he sees him as a friend that he can borrow from.   That is deadpools real power. All the others grew up to be superheroes. They think, breath, ponder and eat as superheroes. They could not even imagine an identity where they were not special.   Deadpool is, at his core, human. Overwritten, stretched, twisted, but nevertheless, human.   His morality is from the same style. he does not kill because it's the right thing to do, he kills because he is payed for it. He does not kill innocents, only because he is not getting payed for it, and in his core, he does know they could not possibly stand against his greatness.   But at his core, deadpool is irrevocably human. he is the litte reminder that you may be a god, you may be beloved by millions, you may be able to wield power beyond your wildest dreams, you are still a human to him. With all the drawbacks, and inappropriateness it brings."

deadpool,3cnx5q,TheIronMoose,11,Thu Jul 9 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure this is more in reference to the text boxes (voices) that were signature in Way's 2008-2012 run and in the DP video game.  If thats the case I am 1000% behind this, the text boxes were always forced and unfunny. Either way, a lot of Deadpools charm comes from his social maladjustment, not really the ""brain in constant flux"" thing from the cancer and the healing.   There is a reason some of the best instances of DP ever being written has been when he was most capable. Before Duggan and Posehn the only writer that came close was Remender, and before that the classics with Kelly and Nicieza."

The script of this film is largely made up of Kellypool canon. If there are sequals (and I have a feeling there definitely will be) theyre going to need extra material for said sequals. They cant burn it too quickly. Figure the first one is the origin story based loosely based on circle chase and the kelly death annual. --Second one is based on the  ""Landau, Luckman and Lake"" story arc. Leaving potential for 4 movies minimum if they did 1 with material based on Daniel Way and 1 more based on Brian Posehn.  ---My guess after deadpool has his second film (LL&L) arc he get hits in the head and the craziness of later deadpool (schizophrenia and all ) begins to set in.... Myself? I rather see him begin to use the wrong words then going fully schizo --- Had me laughing out loud when he was full on ...lock, stock, and two smoking doorknobs."

I highly recommend of course Joe Kelly's run and Cable and Deadpool. Duggan's and Posehn's run (the most recent) is great, too. It starts off goofy and over the top with Dead Presidents and quickly gets dark and tragic in true Deadpool form.  Also Remender's X-Force had a great Deadpool."

deadpool,3cnx5q,retconk,7,Thu Jul 9 15:45:27 2015 UTC,They are basing the movie off of Deadpool's origin series written by Joe Kelly in 1991. He didn't have voices in his head until Daniel Way put them there in the 2008-2012 series.

I hope the movie is not that. The ""lol so random"" humour in the game was awful, the game could have been good but the style of humour stopped me liking it.   Whenever people talk about deadpool, Joe Kelly run seems to be praised so I hope what the below person said is true."
deadpool,3cnx5q,BelovedApple,3,Thu Jul 9 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed- the game story was why i was nervous about the movie.  It was fun hack and slash- but I think the only non core Deadpool characters they nailed were the voices.  I liked them a lot and I never really took into account that they were distinct entities while reading, so I liked that adaptation.  Joe Kelly was fine, I remember his run being a little mellow, but less intensely cameo driven, which was a trait I also liked about DP&C.  But if he's responsible for the Death love interest he could do whatever he wanted a be the best eva."

From what I've seen with Reynold's endorsements, the look of the costume and the creative team attached (as well as snippets I've seen of the script), I think this has a chance to be a pretty solid movie.  I was reading through some comments in a Deadpool topic in r/movies and it seems like some sort of article giving Deadpool fans that want to learn more about his better written/characterized works could be in order. Always down to hear any suggestions or ideas from you guys."

Personally I'd go with Deadpool Classic -> Agent X -> Cable & Deadpool -> Deadpool v3 -> Uncanny X-Force and so on. So the best approach here is maybe to go by his character development? Like start with the ones where he doesn't yet talk to/with his bubbles and go chronologically from there?"

deadpool,3cdgxo,MwamWWilson,2,Tue Jul 7 10:58:55 2015 UTC,I don't think the success of the Deadpool movie will affect if he's in X-Men: Apocalypse specifically though. The Deadpool movie comes out in Feb. 2016 and X-M:A will come out in May. X-M:A will already be post-production at that point.   I do stand by your statement in terms of future Deadpool appearances depending on the success of the movie though.

deadpool,3cbwxl,13rennon,3,Mon Jul 6 18:39:04 2015 UTC,So this Deadpool pocket watch is cheap and rather classy (can find them on ebay)   You can also find the cheap knockoff Lego super hero sets on eBay (I got a red and a yellow Deadpool that way)   Also eBay for some trading cards. Usually will run you a few bucks for each one.   Spencers and Hot Topic have various goodies as well (a lot of clothing hats and wallets but some other things as well)   Maybe check superherostuff.com too. Kinda the same as Hot Topic and Spencers but some things neither one has as well.
deadpool,3cbwxl,Sunderpool,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"I had thought of trading cards but cant seem to find a nice way to display them. The pocket watch is a great idea, I've never actually seen one of them before! Just ordered one on eBay, was surprised it was only $4.00. I was actually just in Spencer's in Kingston on Saturday and they didn't have anything there. I did however get a Deadpool onesie on sale at HMV for $25, normally $60 so that was a pretty sweet find. I checked the Spencer's website and found a 10"" clock and mug I liked which I also ordered. Thanks a lot for the suggestions!"
deadpool,3cbwxl,Sunderpool,2,Mon Jul 6 23:57:22 2015 UTC,The pocket watch is so awesome. I was so happy to get that one. The trading cards can be tricky to display I'll agree.   I'm glad I could help you with the suggestions.

deadpool,3bvqvh,Theworstmaker,30,Thu Jul 2 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"Technically Origins, Wolverine, X1-3 Are on a separate timeline than the newest X Men trilogy.

deadpool,3bvqvh,Theworstmaker,6,Thu Jul 2 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"That wasn't Striker that dredged up Logan at the end of DoFP, that was Mystique. So the time line is already way different.

Deadpool movie reference in Deadpool comic and the return of a series in time for the Deadpool movie.   It made no sense to kill off him and Wolverine because of movie rights. The movies will just end up selling more comics and thus make Marvel more money."

Don't get me wrong the more fans the merrier. I don't blame you for the Skrull Invasion Omnibus though. Those books were hard as fuck to find. Especially a clean copy of #1."

deadpool,3apley,ag3nt_cha0s,2,Mon Jun 22 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"If you liked the game, you'll love Daniel Way's run. He wrote the game and he really breathed some life into the character by adding the Deadpool's different inner voices.  Also, Way's Deadpool is both competent and funny, which is hard combination to pull off.  My biggest problem with Cable and Deadpool was that Deadpool was mostly comic relief, while the Cable stuff is boring.  I would start off with Way's soft open in Wolverine Origins (#21-25) and then go through the whole series if you're up for it (Deadpool Vol. 2, #1-63).    Circle Chase and Sinner's Past are both solid 4-issue runs.  Sinner's Past has Deadpool's origin story.  The upcoming movie will probably be based on bits of both.    Joe Kelly's run is also fantastic (Deadpool Vol. 1,  #-1 through 33).  Kelly's Deadpool is more of positive character trying battling being a good guy with being a merc (a common theme in all runs of the comic).  Additionally, Kelly introduces lots of key supporting characters.  His run is pretty essential.  Oh, and Deadpool #11 is flat out amazing. I would avoid most of the comics after Kelly in that Volume though.  You can tell writers had a tough time trying to pick up the pieces after such a great run.  Plus, Deadpool practically turns into the Punisher at some point during this time...  Anyway, I hope this helps!"
deadpool,3apley,formerlyknownas-,3,Mon Jun 22 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"Agree that the Way run is glorious. It is fantastic when Wade's inner dialogue is talking to himself. I laughed my ass off the entire time reading it. I have the TPB Vol #1-4 and each are signed by Way. This is what got me started on Deadpool.  On a side note, Daniel Way is a total douchebag. He is a fantastic writer but a complete tool."
deadpool,3apley,supercouple,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:16:28 2015 UTC,Really? I kinda buy it. Do you have a Way story you want to share?
deadpool,3apley,formerlyknownas-,2,Tue Jun 23 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"I went to NC Comic with the four Way TPB's to get signed. I approached his table extremely excited because I love sarcastic humor and that type of writing. He immediately asked, ""What do you want?"" I pulled out the four TPB's and told him they were fantastic. He just shrugged.   I then asked if there was any other type of sarcastic humor in comic books. He looked at me and said, ""No, not really. Writing humor is very hard."" I kinda laughed it off, let him sign my TPB's and walked away.  Even the female I was with was like, ""He is a complete douche bag."""
deadpool,3apley,supercouple,2,Tue Jun 23 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, sounds like a jerk, but hey, I've never sat and a table all day where you have to be ""on"" all day.

Put the comics in the frames and used the black paper as the background (rather than the white that comes with the frame).    It's probably worth pointing out that long term exposure to light isn't good for comics, so I probably wouldn't put any seriously collectible issues on display."
