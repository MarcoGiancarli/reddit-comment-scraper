Destiny,3e3wo9,Crux309,70,Tue Jul 21 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"I often have a dream where I'm a helpless woman in an ally walking home late at night and a man steps in front of me brandishing a switchblade. I start to scream helplessly as he begins to take advantage of me. Suddenly, a blue blur encapsulates my periphery and multiple shots ring off. My attacker is laying on the ground in a pool of his own blood. I look towards my hero and it is none other then Steven Bonnell, his weapon still glistening in the moonlight. He puts a hand on my cheek and says softly to me,  ""I went with the Glock 17 over the 19. It's a big gun, for you""."

It's entirely possible it's more common than that though, my experience is mostly in the northeast in an admittedly more suburban area than say NYC, but on the border of an urban area. I've known people to own guns and keep them in their home, but never to carry them out.  EDIT: this was meant to be a reply to /u/Ceylan_CLC my b rip"

Destiny,3dy0a5,haosultist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:38 2015 UTC,I hope when Destiny gets better at the game he keeps a large portion of the energy he's putting into the chat right now. A lot of the excitement is coming from his insecurity about optimal plays which should go away as he gets better.   I'm really glad he likes the game but if he's still playing this months down the line he could easily slip into talking to the chat like he does in League. The only reason he's putting up with the backseat gaming right now is because he genuinely wants help with some stuff.  That said pls never go back to League Steven it was literally killing you.
Destiny,3dy0a5,The_Neckbear,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I can't stand the backseat gaming, and Steven asking questions from chat about every move. I understand why he does it, I just personally don't like it. It's fine when he's getting coached by Hafu, or if he was talking to Trump or Chanman or something. Chat just goes full fucking retard and unless he's being coached by someone who actually knows wtf they're talking about I just don't personally enjoy the stream.  That said I'm glad he's getting more views and doing a good job to get to the top of the HS streamer page. If that keeps him streaming then fuck what I think, I'll deal with it till a better game comes along."

Destiny,3dxbsa,-char-aznable-,15,Mon Jul 20 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"the thing is, this is how destiny thinks, or i should say OVER thinks.   state: guy has nothing on the battlefield, you have 2 cards in hand, a fireball and a 4/4. enemy is at 8 life  the destiny mentality:  ALRIGHT SO I CAN JUST PLAY THE 4/4 AND PASS RIGHT? BUT WHAT IF I FIREBALL FACE? WHAT IF HE DROPS A FUCKING 6/6 AFTER THEN I'M FUCKED, WHAT IF HE HAS FLAMESTRIKE SHOULD I NOT EVEN PLAY THE 4/4? OKAY SO WHAT IF I PLAY MY 4/4 AND FIREBALL IT THEN HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT? THEN HE HAS NO COUNTERPLAY RIGHT? BNUT WHAT WHAIT IF MY ENEMY HAS 3 DUDES THEN I JUST AUTO LOSE? IM FUCKED! WHAT THE FUCK!   ROPE STARTS BURNING   OH SHIT I DON'T KNOW MAN, IDK WHAT TO DO! IM SORRY CHAT!   FIREBALLS HIMSELF PASSES TURN.  256 hr bans 4 people  this is what it's like watching destiny play."
Destiny,3dxbsa,High_Octane_Memes,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"And it's pretty entertaining. Anyway, better to overthink than shit on yourself by playing fast."

Destiny,3dxbsa,High_Octane_Memes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"70 seconds, and it's not always about wining, he learns more from those wasted seconds thinking about the play than just doing what chat says. Which in time will make for a more entertaining strim."
Destiny,3dxbsa,qrtrp,0,Tue Jul 21 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"not really, because the more time he spends the more he over thinks things and actually doesn't learn anything. he's done with so many times already and continues to overthink. decision making in this game is not hard at all"
Destiny,3dxbsa,High_Octane_Memes,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"You know who else I've often seen take an entire turn thinking about every possible play, then misplay hastily in the last few seconds as the rope burns out?  Lifecoach. Undisputedly one of the best players in the world.   And you better god damned believe more than 4 people get perma'd from LC's chat when he makes a misplay."
Destiny,3dxbsa,mAge_SlayeR,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"this is what it's like watching destiny play.     Good thing you don't have to, huh? Leaves more time for your work as a therapist."
Destiny,3dxbsa,RDandersen,0,Mon Jul 20 18:05:41 2015 UTC,it doesnt help that his chat is toxic
Destiny,3dxbsa,BODYBUTCHER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"He 100% welcomes it.  He's brand new and barely has a leg to stand on at this point, and pauses for 20 seconds in between each move to see what chat says.  He's getting there, but at this point it makes a little more sense to have the right decisions spoonfed to him.

I mean.. it's all over twitch, he has studied it, and he is confident that he can become a hearthstone streamer, so he knows more than we think. he's just acting autistic because that's what sells with you fucktards.  Not to shit on steven, but he's not funny on his own most of the times, the best streams were with other streamers, debating shit, fighting, trolling, etc.  kacey, TB, sky, combatex, etc. that's what we need, and what we deserve.

Destiny,3dxff1,volqfer_,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"Alchemist ghoul and archmage, ping sunwalker archmage into sunwalker, bgh archmage, magma into silverback, bodyguard into silverback ghoul 9/2 to face"
Destiny,3dxff1,Vice75,4,Mon Jul 20 09:58:22 2015 UTC,"Wrong. Close, though."
Destiny,3dxff1,racemythoughts,2,Mon Jul 20 10:35:22 2015 UTC,"Want to explain how? with my play I turn the ghoul into a 3/2, 6 minions die 3 + 6 = 9, unless I am missing something.."
Destiny,3dxff1,Vice75,6,Mon Jul 20 10:41:07 2015 UTC,"Bodyguard into silverback doesn't kill the bodyguard. The ghoul would only be an 8/2. I mean, you could brew back one of the alchemists and swap the stats on the silverback, but you didn't specify it. Actually, there's not enough mana to do that. It's this:  Alchemist the ghoul and the Archmage, ping sunwalker, TRADE SUNWALKER WITH BODYGUARD, trade archmage into silverback, bgh archmage, magma into silverback -> all six minions dead -> ghoul face."
Destiny,3dxff1,racemythoughts,3,Mon Jul 20 10:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah you are right, I still don't see lethal in that case as if you want to use brewmaster aswell you don't have the mana, oh well."
Destiny,3dxff1,Vice75,4,Mon Jul 20 10:49:18 2015 UTC,The brew is bait. It's a trap!

Destiny,3dxff1,paleonetic,3,Mon Jul 20 11:01:06 2015 UTC,You must bgh the archmage to kill it.
Destiny,3dxff1,racemythoughts,0,Mon Jul 20 11:10:55 2015 UTC,Why? Where is that said anywhere? All you have to do is find lethal?
Destiny,3dxff1,paleonetic,4,Mon Jul 20 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"You need to bgh the archmage after using alchemist on it in order to get +6 on Flesheating Ghoul. Archmage won't die on its own in combat unless you use one of the alchemists on it and the other on the sunwalker then attack sunwalker with archmage, which means bodyguard won't die and ghoul is 7/3."

Destiny,3dvs4e,Betterthnu,33,Mon Jul 20 00:06:47 2015 UTC,List of things that can get you banned:   Offering advice about how he plays Criticizing his play at all Saying he played well (can be interpreted as being sarcastic) Asking why people are being banned Saying that he is on tilt when he is obviously on tilt Saying that you are too scared to talk in chat because so many people are getting banned   ...  To be honest it's best just to not talk at all about the game when he is losing or just lost.  If you talk about something that has absolutely nothing to do with what's happening on stream you should be safe.  I'm pretty sure the only reason bans are so frequent is because he figured out he can make money off the retards who resub after getting banned.  Edit: also dont be fooled into thinking he wants your advice just because he's asking a bunch of questions while playing.  That's a fast way to get banned.
Destiny,3dvs4e,__BasedGod__,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"90% of the time, people get banned for doing one of the things you said in a retarded way and fail to realize how annoying they are.

Destiny,3dyosv,OrangexSauce,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:30 2015 UTC,that's like telling someone for sc2 to skip the campaign and AI and go straight to ladder.
Destiny,3dyosv,JimmyTadeski,3,Tue Jul 21 07:17:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 1000%. There is a series by a 14x Legend player of a bunch of different decks you can build for super cheap.  I think it would be much more beneficial to Destiny to see what cards are actually useful in meta/different combinations and synergys in classes.  Here is a link to the hunter 'legend grinder' and on that page he has links to his whole series, all are less than 2000 dust, I used this guys decks at first til I could build his 'budget not a problem' deck lists at the bottom/read other pro guides.  I really think climbing ladder is also more of the kind of reward system Destiny has said he likes about other games.  It's also nice that it resets in a week can be a learning period that would allow him to go hard in the coming month.  I recommend this guys builds, I read a couple others and made my own sort of take on the hunter meta and went from literally just downloaded hearthstone 13 days ago to rank 2 only playing 3-4 hours a day AT MOST: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/270052-budget-hybrid-hunter-legend-grinders-guide"
Destiny,3dyosv,kierke,3,Mon Jul 20 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah all Hunter decks are really cheap, so if he wanted to play hunter it wouldn't be to tough. He will have to buy the Adventures though, there's no way around that."
Destiny,3dyosv,The_Lantern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it really shouldn't be a problem considering two things:  1) I have personally seen around $100 donated over the last week (even some from before he started playing memestone) with donations saying ""this is for when you start opening packs in HS"";  2) When he finally does a HS pack opening deck building stream not only will it draw viewers, but he will start getting donation money in saying ""more"" and only really needs to use a fraction of it before people are satisfied (look at cowsep the league streamer who doubled his viewership and got thousands of dollars over the course of two days to do huge ass pack opening and deck building stream)"
Destiny,3dyosv,kierke,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:53 2015 UTC,Oh for sure whoring yourself out to open packs is a great way to get views and donations. Destiny doing the Adventures with his shit cards would be hilarious to watch.

Destiny,3dyosv,Chrono68,-8,Mon Jul 20 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"The fast way to learn this game is to watch streams of better players (which Destiny will never do), or have a better player spectate your games and talk you threw it. NOT to tell what to do. Unless he has a dick rider fan to do this I doubt that will happen, so destiny is going to have to learn the hard way.   Chat can be pretty toxic and unhelpful   What kills me is when destiny sees what IMO is the right play, and chat convinces him to do a sub par play, although it is rare lol.  If destiny wants to do constructed he should just do it the old fashion way pick a class he likes and build a deck. He will be rank 25, the players he will be facing in ranked will be just as bad skill wise and card wise as him.   Net-decking can be extremely difficult for new players. Copying a deck you have no clue how to play is an awful idea. Doing something like easy face hunter does not teach you how to play proper decks."

Destiny,3dr1yf,myndzha,5,Sat Jul 18 22:42:53 2015 UTC,It helps that learning Hearthstone is actually really fun for new players. The shitty part is that you eventually learn just how much bullshit and rng is involved. It should be entertaining to watch him reach that point though.

I guess I have no choice but to agree.  In all seriousness, I completely agree. It's so enjoyable to see Destiny in an environment where he can think out his actions in a turn based strategy like Hearthstone or X-COM. I love when he thinks out loud and walks us though his thinking process. It's like an entire stream of just MSPaint."
Destiny,3dqhwh,poko610,6,Sat Jul 18 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"You get to hear Destiny talk, which is always the best part of his streams. I enjoyed it a lot!

Destiny,3dqhwh,getintheVandell,5,Sat Jul 18 20:36:03 2015 UTC,That or he becomes like kripp and just arena and play fun matches vs subscribers/friends with arbitrary rules but stay competent enough to be valid to bitch about the meta.
Destiny,3dqhwh,Snackys,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:14 2015 UTC,To reach the Reynad anything you'd first have to get yourself lifetime banned from the actual competitive TCG game (MTG) for cheating.
Destiny,3dqhwh,PolarBearFur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:57 2015 UTC,It's only more interesting because destiny doesn't know the game yet once he starts to understand the game a bit more then he will start raging when he is unlucky. Eventually it will be at the point where he is at with league.
Destiny,3dqhwh,Joshrofl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"I remember the beginnings of league were pretty hype too, we'll see if it continues to be this good after the initial hype period"
Destiny,3dqhwh,finlist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree, personally. I think streams where he's playing with a duo, in good spirits win or lose, and obviously enjoying the game are at the peak entertainment.  Plus then he's not playing this piece of shit card game that isn't even in the same league as such clearly amazing games as Gwent.  But hey, you're allowed to think what you want. When he starts raging while playing Hearthstone I'm sure we'll see plenty of ""why are you playing this game if you hate it so much"" posts."

I was big into the game during the closed beta, but after awhile of getting RNG fucked over and over I kinda quit.

Pretty much this. When Destiny understands how the game works the concepts behind it, it becomes less entertaining to watch imo because now he doesn't make as many huge mistakes. And when Destiny isn't making huge mistakes in a game he's learning, he isn't as animated and rowdy. Which means he's less funny, and more likely to just sit and grind out games.   The solution is we have to get Destiny to play a new game every month"

Destiny,3difmj,NeoDestiny,82,Fri Jul 17 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"There's a huge bias showing here, m8, sorry.  The SC2 stream last night wasn't even that good. I was tired as fuck, I wasn't talking very much, I had to be very quiet for a lot of it because Nathan was sleeping on my bed like the freeloading fucker he is, and nothing was exceptionally entertaining about the games.  I know what a good quality stream is. My ""best"" LoL streams (duos with phantoml0rd, early triple kills with Draven, sarcasm queues, etc...) are 100x better than my mediocre/boring SC2 streams.  My ""best"" SC2 streams (crazy comebacks, shittalking other people, ridiculous games, 4brofestor hit squad, etc...) are 100x better than my mediocre/boring LoL streams.  The thing is, in my hundreds (err thousands?) of hours of broadcasting SC2, you're only remembering the ""best"" SC2 streams, and you're comparing that to EVERY League stream. As I said earlier, my best SC2 streams were EASILY better than my average League stream.  There were plenty of times I grinded away SC2 miserable as fuck, not saying much, getting sniped/trolled, etc...etc...  I'm not saying one is better than the other, even if I do prefer SC2 as a game to League. I'm just saying that  posts like these are exactly why it's impossible to have an honest, frank discussion about SC2 streams vs League streams because insane fanboys of a certain game will be insanely bias towards whatever game they want me to stream."

Destiny,3difmj,elevenoutoften,3,Fri Jul 17 19:23:58 2015 UTC,Why don't you just make a poll on stream and put it in chat to see which game the viewers prefer to watch. Do this several times and take the data to decide which game you will mostly stream

It's you that's entertaining not just the game and i think this argument of LoL or SC2 is getting pretty fucking old."
Destiny,3difmj,talos707,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"As someone who started watching when you played cs:go around december, and as someone who has watched most of your stream since, I much prefer your sc2 streams.  I don't even play starcraft but it's still a great game to watch.  I feel like half the time when you play league, chat has to try and talk you down from raging, and the other half is just hoping you'll have a good game so maybe there will be some redeeming quality from the stream that day.    I know a lot of it has to do with the fact that you are already at a professional level in starcraft, but even if you get to that point in league I don't know if it can ever match your starcraft streams.  It's hard for someone to play a team game professionally and be able to display insane ability, focus, and skill on a personal level when you have to rely on the 4 other players around you.  I think with certain roles you can fill some of that void, which is something trick2g does (bear with me).  He relies on his comically inflated ego to get viewers, and the ability to roam and make plays as a jungler complements that well.  It sounds weird but I think chat empathizes with you, so when you're feeling bad (which is most of the time in league) chat probably does too.  The best league stream since you started was when you first skyped with afrigginNOOB, and you demolished.  That's obviously fun to watch.  You were always occupied while you talked to him, and it felt like there was very little downtime.  It seems like you held your attitude to a higher standard during those games.  When you were playing alone, or when you and afriggin aren't talking, it seems like a lot of that time is wasted and there's a good deal of time when nothing important is happening, and you start to focus on what's going wrong.  The stream quickly turns to shit as your mood changes to something out of a cancer documentary.  It's not fun to watch someone get shat on for 15 minutes longer than they needed to as they explain they're being shat on, and then have no recourse but to try and timidly recover or blame their teammates (which often times is justified).  I think it might be best if you started a rotation, because at this point league is becoming disheartening for many people in chat.  Starcraft 2 probably doesn't have much of a future the way blizzard is ""supporting"" it, but that doesn't mean you can't ladder, that you can't display high skill, or that you shouldn't play it.  Even when you played grey goo your abilities translated well, and that game has never been dedder.  You should definitely continue playing league, but the constant grind is getting stale.  It's not that you can't become more skilled, but it's hard to watch someone put themselves through this 9th level of elo hell constantly.  It's even harder to watch after you say things like ""I would never play this game if I weren't getting paid"" or ""I actually hate this game"".  It seems like you aren't kidding."

The way i see it is that often times when you're on tilt, in a bad mood from getting feeders, trolls, or snipers or any other shit it is very obvious you are not enjoying playing. It happens often when you play LoL, SC2, or any fucking multiplayer game that allows autist to snipe or troll.

The game feels so repetetive and most of the time nothing happens except for the one big fight. That usually decides everything. In LOL there is many small fights, constant action on lane/gangs incoming and so on.   I am not a fanboy of either of the games, but I feel in Starcraft, most of the time there simply does not happen anything and when it finally does it is over really fast whereas league has constant stuff going on that is fun to watch. Even though ur raging sometimes makes it hard as well as the many trolls and ghosters  CS:GO was the most fun anyway imo :D"
Destiny,3difmj,Crux309,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"Sc2 fanboy but everything you said is true as fuck    But I do feel maybe the sc2 Streams (atleast the last few ones) have been a little better than the average league stream because you talk more often to chat and you dont seem as frustrated with the game as you are while playing league, but a little more relaxed.  But that could be because you're just back from a nice break, you're a better judge of that."

Destiny,3difmj,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:21:57 2015 UTC,Why can't you just play whichever you'd like to? Why do you have to fixate yourself purely to one game? You could try to be a jack of all trades type of streamer rather than trying to get extremely good at one game. It'll both increase your viewer base and make you less frustrated.
Destiny,3difmj,Celdurant,3,Thu Jul 16 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's just his nature. Destiny has said multiple times over the years he gains satisfaction from mastering something, even if it means doing the same thing over ad nauseam. He'll grind out a retarded boss fight over and over again until he beats it, he'll bash his head against the wall laddering until he gets Diamond/Challenger/GM/MegaPlatinum Nova/Biggest Circle on the Agar plate/whatever other ranking is available. He finds that fun, minus bullshit balance issues/broken game problems. That plus trying to make a living off of streaming forces his hand a little."
Destiny,3difmj,Sevion,5,Thu Jul 16 20:06:27 2015 UTC,Wait. What about Counter-Strimz. He hasn't hit Global Leet yet.
Destiny,3difmj,TheFatalWound,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Any interest in trying games like rocket league? It's incredibly fun, simple but with a high skillcap, and there isn't much bullshit to get caught up on.  It's not really as fleshed out as a competitive game like SC2 or League so there isn't as much to sink into, but the great part about the game is that it reminds me a lot of SC2. When you lose, you know it was your fault, and you know what you could have done better. There's no frill external bullshit outside of your control."
Destiny,3difmj,Sulinia,-4,Fri Jul 17 10:13:05 2015 UTC,"I know I'm bias, I can acknowledge that.  And yes it's not fair to compare best to average, but it just seems like there are a lot more pros to streaming SC2 than cons (I won't bother listing them here). Ultimately it's your choice what you play and you should do whatever you enjoy more.  And I don't mean to fanboy for SC too hard.  I love both games, I've played thousands of SC2 matches in my life and close to as much league.  They're both a lot of fun, and they're both great games, I just find that when I'm watching you, Starcraft is more fun to see."
Destiny,3difmj,i_pk_pjers_i,5,Thu Jul 16 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"""I know I'm bias"" it should've stopped there, instead of agreeing with Destiny and doing the same thing again."
Destiny,3difmj,indigostarchild,0,Thu Jul 16 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"posts like these are exactly why it's impossible to have an honest, frank discussion about SC2 streams vs League streams because insane fanboys of a certain game will be insanely bias towards whatever game they want me to stream.   1000% true. There will always be people who prefer you to play one game or the other or vice versa, however I will watch you play whatever regardless. I love you, senpai."
Destiny,3difmj,NeoDestiny,-3,Thu Jul 16 23:20:22 2015 UTC,IDK what the OP is talking about. I don't care about LoL at all. So the discussion for me boils down to a simple equation:  SC2 > LoL  It's not always about 'entertaining'. How about learning strategies? Sometimes I learn from Catz or other good zergs. So it's always good to see zerg gransmasters at play to improve my own game.

But seriously you just described your stream perfectly, and you can apply the same logic to the other games you play as well. I would argue that streaming other games periodically, ie Witcher, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy, etc can sometimes have a higher than avg entertainment rate per stream, but even then it's minimal. Basically, you have a larger portion of fanbase that like's watching you for the game you play, instead of watching you for you, and that shows with all these posts, and your response above is perfect. tl;dr idgaf what game you play as long as I'm having fun and you are too..the game is a background to the entertainment occurring in the foreground."

Destiny,3di3r5,hydrogenc4r,-4,Thu Jul 16 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"Kind of yes kind of no. Her point was more that people are unhealthy due to food choices in American societies. Things high in calories, it's hard to monitor and be able to eat at a more reasonable caloritic intake. Destiny's point was more he understands this dilemma, however you still have to control how much you eat and simply eat less.   Destiny places the blame more on the person whereas the person taking issue places it more on the society. I agree with Destiny that we can't keep coddling children and telling them everything will be normal and okay when things clearly need to change. However, he still says, ""then lose weight you fat fuck!"" which makes me kind of question his motives. :p  Personally I'm not overweight, I'm fairly fit and I'm not saying this to brag. This is more to address the fact I don't defend fat people because I am fat. When I used to work the graveyards at McDonalds an overweight guy ordered his food. Someone who didn't even order anything, I think trying to impress his girlfriend, came up next to him as he was getting his food from me and yelled, ""hey, sorry for your weight!"" then drove off.  The overweight guy was just fighting back tears the entire time I was giving him his food. Maybe the guy had a disorder or he grew up in a bad household where his mom and dad argued every night and all he had to eat was unhealthy shit. The point is to mock those overweight in our society by targeting them and mocking them isn't the way to go.   Also, I'm glad someone called pop for what it really is, ""pop"" and not ""soda"" like you jagoffs like to call it. It's called POP. Also, if you all haven't accepted Hitler into your hearts like I have I don't know what you're still doing here."

If you sit him down and force him to talk about this calmly he'll obviously arrive at the conclusion that you gotta politely teach your kids to fucking stop eating when they are full/eat some low calories stuff ocasionally. Or if they have had a fucked up childhood to get therapy etc. all the rational conclusions he'll arrive at like any other person.  You mention people that have disorders or some sort of hormone issue but they dont have to be mentioned it goes without saying that those are exceptions and that he's talking about the vast majority of people that simply need to eat less. And he's saying that in response to nutjobs that think being morbidly obese is beautiful or healthy, so he uses slightly inflammatory language. He isnt mocking fat people he's making stupid morons.    The point is to mock those overweight in our society by targeting them and mocking them isn't the way to go.   Yeah but to sugarcoat (pun intended) isnt a solution either."

Osteoarthritis? Yep, just being overweight can rapidly degenerate your joints due to the extra wear and tear. Hypertension and cardiomyopathy? Better believe your heart has to work harder to perfuse all that extra tissue. Type 2 diabetes? Absolutely, acquired insulin resistance is almost inevitable. Obstructive sleep apnea? One of the biggest risk factors is neck circumference, which obviously correlates highly with weight. Cancer? Sadly, several types of cancer are associated with being obese.  These are facts. If you're overweight, these things are much more likely to happen to you. Do these things happen in skinny people too? Absolutely, but it would be a fallacy to suggest weight doesn't play a role.  If you want to lose weight, exercise and eat fewer calories. Can't do both? Then cut calories. Exercise alone is the least effective method for weight loss out of the three but still better than nothing.  /rant"

There are hundreds of things in life that are just as dangerous, or more dangerous than being fat. Where's the outrage against people doing all those other dangerous activities? Why aren't people shitting on parents who have swimming pools in their yard or snowboarders or downhill mountain bikers or motorcycle riders? Everyone's unfairly singling one group of people who are doing something unhealthy (eating too much) because fuck them, being fat shouldn't be acceptable. Who fucking cares if they're unhealthy? Most fat people are very aware that they're fat and it isn't good for them, but hey fucking apparently they love eating, just like dudebro loves to go do some amateur boxing and break his neck.  It's just that it feels like you're giving them some 'healthy life advice' in bad faith. Suicide is a huge portion of deaths, yet you're fine with telling kids in league to kill themselves. You don't really care about people's health, you're just hating on them because they're fat.  By the way, I'm all for arguing with obese people who are unhappy with their weight but they're too fucking dumb or uneducated or lack the willpower to make a fucking change. That's really fucking enraging, just fucking cut calories instead of whining, have some fucking willpower, just like you said. It's not fucking magic. And fuck parents who overfeed kids.

It's becoming quite interesting/fun to log calories and choose smarter options. Might seem like common sense but knowing that you can make a entire 9x11 casserole that contains less calories than a single fast food burger is pretty dank. Just sayin he is right, its not that hard. I plan to lose like 30 lbs this way."

Destiny,3di3r5,stonkbelwas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't like about the obesity statistics is that a lot of people fall into the lower spectrum of overweight/obesity. It's really easy to hit the lower part of being obese without looking like a stereotypical obese person. There are people who you think are just overweight when in fact they're in the obesity category. If 68% of adults are obese, then a good portion of them are doing a good job staying out of sight. Yes there are a lot of really obese people out there, but 68%?   Now it's INCREDIBLY easy to be in the overweight category. I'm 5'5 170, and according to BMI i'm almost obese. I'm in the overweight category, but no way in hell did I think am this close to contributing to the obese statistic. The only thing that my weight noticeably affected was my stamina. I can pretty much do anything I could have previously done.   One thing I want to know that I can't find (no, i didn't try very hard to find) is the specific breakdowns in the obesity statistic. How many people hover ~ 32 BMI, because most people in that category don't seem obese."

Destiny,3di3r5,calomando1004,-2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"It's really weird that destiny seems to think parenting styles for a 4 year old boy and a 13 year old girl are the same, especially concerning a topic like body image which is a huge problem for kids, and girls in particular. Destiny saying ""if you're that fucking weak thenwtf is wrong with you"" about a pubescent girl that's probably developing body image issues shows he's pretty out of touch on how to deal with teenagers (which seems obvious since he's never raised one and doesn't deal with them outside of his chat)  Maybe I'm misremembering the post, but the kid was barely overweight (like a 26 on the bmi scale) and the mother seemed to stress out way too much about her kid's weight, to the point it seemed pretty obvious the child would be put off from exercise/dieting (as a 13 year old especially). And again, I didn't read the entire thread because it's not my job, but it seemed most responses were just telling her that she was worrying her kid too much. Eating disorders are a very real threat that destiny just seems to gloss over, and they're much more harmful than being very slightly overweight.  In the context of the country in general some of the things he says like just eat less or whatever might be true, but I'm not sure it applies well to that thread. Also, I'm not a health expert, but I'm not sure someone slightly overweight but who exercises (enough that they can carry their weight comfortably and has moderately good cardiovascular health) is any less healthy than someone 20 pounds lighter with the same amount of muscle and who gets the same macro/micro spread. It just seems like being fat exacerbates health issues more than is the cause of them."

Destiny,3di3r5,askshonestquestions,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"While you do run into causation problems with health issues and being overweight, there are cases where you can pretty definitively say that being fat is very likely the cause, and not just a contributing factor.   I do agree that the woman in the post was probably a little too overzealous with her daughter, but I didn't read the whole thing either. She had legitimate concerns, but did come off a bit overbearing."

Destiny,3dgrso,mAge_SlayeR,2,Thu Jul 16 06:00:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a simple formula:   Playing to achieve high rank = suffering.  Whereas playing for fun is, well, fun. But Destiny has said a few times that he is unable to play these competitive online games ""just for fun"".  He is cursed with the drive to improve which makes him hate the game(s)."
Destiny,3dgrso,Mavren_,4,Fri Jul 17 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Although he doesn't enjoy the game itself, I think the reason he continues to play it is because he enjoys seeing himself improve. If he manages to improve to the point where he finally reaches master/challenger then his stream will probably gain a lot of popularity, and he will find it more enjoyable because there will be far less stream snipers...but I honestly don't see him getting to that point. I really hope he proves me wrong, though.   But what else can he do? There is no way his audience will grow if he plays SC2. He doesn't want to become a variety streamer because he's competitive and wants a game that he can constantly improve in. You'd think Hearthstone is the perfect game, right? A 1v1 competitive multiplayer game with millions of players and lots of potential for stream growth. So why do you think he hasn't played it yet? He doesn't think he would enjoy it, and he's right. Once you've reached legend (which is achievable after a few weeks of playing for any idiot with the right cards) you lose all sense of improvement. The game turns in to a game of whoever draws the better cards, wins. At that point not only would he be playing a game he doesn't enjoy, but also a game in which he can't improve in anymore.  TL;DR: His motivation for continuing to play League is seeing himself improve. He wouldn't get that in Hearthstone, and other games just aren't popular enough for him to consider them being worth his time."
Destiny,3dgrso,FLABREZU,7,Thu Jul 16 06:52:49 2015 UTC,"He doesn't really work to improve though. He gave it a bit of an effort for a few days with getting Warlock to coach him a bit, looking at his replays and looking at some of Fabby's replays. I think it lasted less than a week before he basically just went back to grinding, and now only really seems to look at replays to see how his teammates fucked up."
Destiny,3dgrso,indigostarchild,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:09:03 2015 UTC,"I think he left SC2 for like over a year, before coming back. He then practiced for a bit, but lost in the qualifiers for 2015 Season 1 WCS to worser opponents who were practicing more. I do remember a really insane muta/muta game on Merrygoround where he beat jonsnow or bioice. I forget who. He could have at least gotten past the qualifiers for the next season with better practice perhaps with a team.  After WCS Season 1, he got discouraged about his life. And turned to casual games such as LoL for solace."
Destiny,3dgrso,Shadostruct,0,Thu Jul 16 19:29:25 2015 UTC,And look at that. He plays LotV Beta and gets to 3K viewers.
Destiny,3dgrso,Shadostruct,0,Thu Jul 16 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"I've probably posted in these topics like 3-4 times. Destiny has probably said this himself like 5x more than I have.  It's not because of the current viewers, it's the chance for expansion of viewers. Yes, he'll get 3k playing SC2, but his absolute top is going to be no more than 5k, and even that's rare nowadays.  He believes that if he increases his rank to masters he'll get a viewer spike. Whether you agree with it or not that's his logic.  He has also said repeatedly that while he hates all team games, he doesn't particularly hate League any more than the rest. Due to his experience with the game already he decided to stick with it. His main problem is with people in chat rustling him more than anything, although shitty teammates do rustle him when it becomes crunch time (Plat 1 - Diamond 5).  Considering he's trying out Hearthstone now he seems to be willing to try out other games with a market to tap into. He already has the market on SC2 cornered, and while it's enough to sustain himself monetarily he was having problems enjoying the game which impacted not only his stream quality, but SC2 as a whole was declining in numbers. And still is, tbh. He could survive quite a long time off SC2 most likely, but it's only going to dwindle further and further till it fizzles it.  Now can we stop spamming this over and over and over and over? We get it. You don't like League, or you don't like Destiny playing league. Believe it or not there are people that don't like SC2 or DoTA2 or Hearthstone or w/e game he decides to play that day. Amazing right? People can actually not like a game he's playing and not bitch and whine about it like children.  This post was one of the less offensive of them, but it's getting annoying seeing this sub just filled to the brim with people assuming Destiny hasn't thought this through or don't listen to what he says on the topic."

Destiny,3di191,ItalianoVero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if you're innocent or guilty, armed or unarmed. Regardless of who you are, if a cop pulls a gun on you, DO EXACTLY AS HE SAYS. He might even arrest you. But they will realize the mistake soon enough, probably within a matter of minutes.   Also, NEVER fuck around with your hands or pockets when a cop has a gun drawn on you. The cop clearly perceives you as a threat, so why do the one thing that would exacerbate that perception?   two cops cold-bloodly killed a unarmed latin   Do you even know what ""cold blooded"" means? The video clearly depicts a high pressure situation. They thought that man was an armed robber that may have been reaching for a weapon."

(but if you're truly looking for the sf foodie experience, then honestly it's just kinda mediocre and you'll want to go to the tenderloin(not at night)/mission/haight for the real foodie stuff. or at least thats what all my foodie friends tell me. also honestly theres plenty of decent food near moscone on market st already.)  but if you guys wanna go, it's abt a 20-25 minute walk from moscone, and 15 if you take the bus or the streetcar. sadly i will not be around in september to join you guys -- i know meeting the quiet lurkers is a real aphrodesiac so i apologize -- but i do hope you all have a good time at twitchcon.  tour the city, soma (where moscone is) is honestly one of the most boring parts of sf, so enjoy twitchcon but also take some time to get out and explore. check out the golden gate bridge, maybe bike there (very popular and easy), try not to fall off Kappa"

I fucking hate this series so much. So generic and poorly written, le plot twists you can find out in the first 5 minutes of gameplay so deep xD   Video makes good points, but the narrative in the actual game is like a endless spew of vomit of themes and plot points that while they certainly can rationalize and make sense of it outside the actual game it just ends up being a mess when contextualized inside of it. I honestly don't think the writers intended half the stuff this video talks about. Otherwise they probably could have made a fun game if there was any actual intellectual drive behind it.

The difference is you can pay to get the decks you want and it's a 1v1 game so I think the extra control would be nice.

And tbh they are already strictly established will be hard to gain a large amount of viewers unless hafu or trump helps you out but their communities dont like your edgyness.

I hope you are only planning on playing it to please your fans rather than with the intention of possibly switching over to it full time.

Destiny,3cvwcz,Reinhart3,11,Sun Jul 12 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think I speak for at least a fair proportion of people when I say that Destiny has brought me to a bunch of other games like Dankest Dungeon, wouldn't play that if it wasn't for bonnelli.  My biggest reason for not playing hearthstone is not having any sort of basis to start from, or having people I like to watch playing it. I've tried Kripp and even Artosis, but honest to god not a fan. If Destiny switched over, not even permanently, but just to give it a shot I think I would be much more willing to play hearthstone.   Like I said I might be the only one saying it, but there's a solid number of people who are like me."
Destiny,3cvwcz,darkhindu,23,Sat Jul 11 07:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is definitely the platform that allows the highest level of chat interaction. Watching Hafu and Destiny would be adorable, and she might be able to sway Destiny toward the Arena side of Hearthstone. There's room for ingenuity in terms of drafting decks and displaying skill as you climb deeper and deeper into arena runs.   I worry that Destiny would get burnt out if he played constructed (Face hunter), but in arena, imbalances are more comical than rage-inducing.   $$$: Hearthstone is also the easiest of the four main esports to monetize via YouTube. If Steven wanted to cash in on that static revenue, he could just upload insane RNG moments or special Arena runs. (Trump)  TL;DR: Hearthstone would be profitable and Destiny could even compete with Forsen in the meme department."
Destiny,3cvwcz,racemythoughts,2,Sat Jul 11 07:58:25 2015 UTC,Destiny doesnt have the personanlity to get that back. Many people are turned off by him not being fake nice to everyone. He would fit a lot better in the csgo scene imo. Also easy to monetise via youtube.
Destiny,3cvwcz,SerbLing,4,Mon Jul 13 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is also a cash cow for Blizzard. They are releasing new modes and updates and new cards because it makes them money. This changes the meta and keeps it from getting stale. Facehunter and Grim patron warrior today, but tomorrow there'll be something else.   I know an argument against it is RNG, but with volume skill does win out. There are Hearthstone pros like there are poker pros after all."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Murgel,3,Sat Jul 11 08:17:25 2015 UTC,Just annoying that you really have to sink in a fuckton of money to be competitive.
Destiny,3cvwcz,SerbLing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:12:26 2015 UTC,I feel you. You can play face hunter for relatively cheap and still have a top tier deck but it's just not very interesting.

Destiny,3cvwcz,canarduck,5,Sat Jul 11 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"You can be competitive while being f2p but it would require playing the same aggro deck over and over again for a long while. Honestly playing more than one deck was already difficult as HS was released and it only got harder and harder as more cards were added. Pity for those that did not originally get aboard the card train as it ain't stopping. So I would not recommend playing HS if you don't want to spend any money on it, no."
Destiny,3cvwcz,AmssoBador_Spacelot,2,Sat Jul 11 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"You could still be competitive, it would just take you about a year of consistent playing to get enough packs and gold through quests/arena to get the good cards."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Faemn,3,Sat Jul 11 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"A YEAR to be able to start to compete? If destiny started playing as a noob i was considering making the journey at the same time as him, but fuck that, talk about pay to win"
Destiny,3cvwcz,canarduck,3,Sat Jul 11 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Hes exaggerating a bit. It all depends on how much you play and how good you are. It also very much depends on if you want an entire collection, or only a handful of cards. You can easily compete even if you don't spend any real money, but since it is a Collectible Card Game, and lacking any form of card trading. The amount of ""top tier"" decks you can create will be minimal."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Sebbern,3,Sat Jul 11 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"There are other modes such as arena which is independent of the pay to win model and just as highly monetized(or more, as a few people mentioned arena YouTube's) which would be a perfect fit for destiny and break the mundane static 1 deck grinding."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Snackys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:16:57 2015 UTC,Depends on whether you want to grind the ladder or just play a fun video game. I've never spent anything on it (Apart from the adventures which are 2 PvE campaign style expansions. Could never see myself buying card packs though.) and I enjoy logging in every so often to play a few games. Its a well made and presented free to play game which is very easy to get into . Just download it and play for an hour or so and see if you like it.
Destiny,3cvwcz,nethqz,17,Sat Jul 11 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'd just like to see him become popular in a game where he isn't always so angry.     as soon as he realizes how huge rng and topdecking is he will probably get angry, and rightfully so. i'm not saying there is no strategy involved at the highest level of play but the fact that someone like kolento or lifecoach can get knocked out in qualifiers by some random face hunter because of bad draws says alot about the ""skill cap"" of the game. just watch any tournament going on and notice how often it boils down ""he needs to draw card x or its over"". also, most top hearthstone players have never been good at any competitive esports before (strifecro sc2 tier at best).   it rustles my jimmies that this ca$ual entertainment shitshow is even called esports."
Destiny,3cvwcz,nethqz,5,Sat Jul 11 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"There are downsides but are there any other alternatives? I think he could get quite good reasonably quick and if he manages to generate a large audience, I don't think he'd be as rustled by losing due to RNG. The reason he gets so ragey in league is because he feels he needs to get high diamond or beyond to get to the level where he can get a big audience and the losses slow that up. He can get to that level in HS faster and easier while still being an entertainer.  When he lost in SC tournaments back in the day he was never that bothered by it because he had his stream for revenue and fame. When he consistently loses diamond promos he has nothing comforting to fall back on for confidence. That's why I think if he manages to become a popular HS streamer he won't be as bothered by the RNG of topdecks and mulligans in the same way he gets bothered by the RNG of your league (Or DOTA/CSGO) teammates. He can just look at his juicy viewercount and tell his opponent to get the flu instead of cancer."
Destiny,3cvwcz,SerbLing,6,Sat Jul 11 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"there is only one problem. you assume that his viewercount will automatically rise with him playing hearthstone. i dont doubt that he'll get ""good"" reasonable quick but he is also very late to the cashgrab party and the market is pretty much cornered in my opinion. the casual shitters have kripp/hafu, the dank memers have forsen/reynad and if you want an ""educational"" stream you can watch trump, strifecro or ratsmah (maybe there are better examples, im not following the scene that much).    also, blaming his losses in ranked on ""RNG teammates"" is just dumb. there are multiple occasions each stream where his team cant come back from a ~2k gold deficit because he does stupid shit like pushing with 0 vision or 1v1ing a fed opponent when he is 0/5/x for no reason. people like that attentionwhoring piece of shit shyv are the exception, not the rule.  tl:dr hope he checks out moneystone, realizes how casual and boring it is and goes back to ""real"" competitive games (cs:go, dota, lol, ...)"
Destiny,3cvwcz,nethqz,2,Sat Jul 11 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means assuming that his viewership will automatically rise if he switches to HS. As I've already said, it is quite possible that he'll start playing HS and his crumby attitude will be his undoing and he won't get anything out of it. In fact, I would be somewhat surprised if that didn't happen. However, I also think that there is a 0% chance he will develop a successful streaming career playing LoL, DOTA or CS:GO.   blaming his losses in ranked on ""RNG teammates"" is just dumb   I'm not saying that I personally think his losses are due to the RNG of teammates. I played online poker semi professionally for two years with a lot of success so I know how to think of things in the long term and know how to visualise that there are 5 unknowns on the enemy team and only 4 on your own team. I'm saying that he thinks his losses are due to this. I'm of the same opinion as you that he's hit a wall in LoL due to problems on his own part. We're talking about an adc main who only recently discovered that ancient coin builds into an item with an active who is also quite clueless on many other aspects of this game he plays full time. He wasn't this clueless when it came to playing SC2 so I'm just hoping that it's because it's harder to isolate variables in your play in teamgames and if he switches to HS which is a 1v1 game he won't fall into the same traps.   tl:dr hope he checks out moneystone, realizes how casual and boring it is and goes back to ""real"" competitive games (cs:go, dota, lol, ...)   Even though HS is more casual, and as I said in the OP i don't particularly enjoy watching it, I hope he does make the switch because I genuinely think that with his attitude and cockiness it's his only chance of developing a large audience for his stream as he isn't going to be breaching the top skill tier of any other competitive game and in Hearthstone there is a larger following surrounding streamer personalities than there is tournaments compared to other games.  I'm a pretty reasonable guy, so if you think he has any real chance of developing a good streaming career playing LoL, DOTA or CS:GO then tell me your reasons and if they are good then I'll be the first to say that I was wrong and casualstone was a dumb idea. People might think it's bit late to be switching to HS but out of the big 4 or 5 ""esports"" titles I think it's his only shot and personally I don't think the market is as cornered as you think it is. To say that I hope he sticks to a more competitive game is the same as saying I hope he never reaches the point where he is a renowned streamer with high viewer numbers imho."
Destiny,3cvwcz,cruelynx,2,Sun Jul 12 00:38:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of ur post but destiny was the same with sc2 as with league. Showing 0 interest in improving with help from others. Just the grind. Im the same way i just spam games and feel like 'learning the game' via videos and reading guides is a waste of time. He was very clueless with sc2. Ask him upgrade times etc he has no clue. Ask hin about timings? He has no clue. But he knows that if he sees x at y time what to expect because he played 200games vs that build. Hope im a bit clear with what i mean, im very hungover."
Destiny,3cvwcz,AmssoBador_Spacelot,2,Mon Jul 13 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"He wasn't quite as bad with SC2 as he was with League though. SC2 players in bronze-gold aren't gonna know much about timings or upgrade times but league players in bronze-gold generally know all the champion's names and most of their abilities and all the important items in the game and so on which Destiny doesn't know much about.  What you said about him knowing what to do because he had played so much resonates with what I said though. Because of all the extra variables in League due to it being a team game it's much harder to learn by yourself with no help because you can't isolate the important things.  All in all though, I don't much care for Destiny to become absolute top tier competitive wise at any game and I don't think he should either because it's too hard to develop an audience at the same time. He was at a great skill level in SC2 but the viewership for SC2 just isn't there any more. I could see him becoming somewhat skilled at HS (But still with holes in his game) and still develop a large following."
Destiny,3cvwcz,KubikiriAsa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"first of all, you could be totally right and i could be totally wrong. i think your reasoning is rock solid, i just personally hope you are wrong. if he pulls 10k viewers after a week of hearthstone, because the 12yo kids that currently spam kappa neverlucky babyrage all day in kripps chat dig his cocky personality, he'd be an idiot to go back to league/witcher/sc2/whatever.   I'm a pretty reasonable guy, so if you think he has any real chance of developing a good streaming career playing LoL, DOTA or CS:GO then tell me your reasons and if they are good then I'll be the first to say that I was wrong and casualstone was a dumb idea     yes, i belive in steben. i think he has what it takes to become a top streamer in one of the competitive games we listed if he puts his mind to it and maybe gets proper coaching to fill the niche of an entertainment-streamer who is still really good at the game (the best comparison i can pull out of my hat would be oddone, altought they are ofc very different personalities)"
Destiny,3cvwcz,Magmaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:40:16 2015 UTC,the dank memers have forsen/reynad    They don't know the power of a true OG memer yet.  The custom chat emotes are also top tier and hilarious. Not that it matter all the much lol
Destiny,3cvwcz,AmssoBador_Spacelot,4,Sun Jul 12 04:51:40 2015 UTC,Imagine if Destiny started playing HS back when it was in closed beta. I think he would have easily made it to the top popularity wise.
Destiny,3cvwcz,cruelynx,3,Sat Jul 11 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"I think he should consider not getting any coaching from Hafu, maybe she could give him some pointers about arena but I think that should be it. Watching Destiny trying to learn new games has always been a really enjoyable viewing experience, not sure how he would deal with all the retarded backseat gaming that Hearthstone usually attracts, though."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Magmaniac,3,Sat Jul 11 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"I agree at first, I think Destiny's first HS stream should be just him going in and trying to figure it out and learn through experience, but I'd be fine with him being coached a bit after a day or so of streaming it."
Destiny,3cvwcz,canarduck,2,Mon Jul 13 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"Hafu coaching would be great content for both of them as well as help him establish some presence in the scene. If he goes in and refuses any help he'll appear as just another random streamer and it would take a while to build some kind of new audience. Collaborating with Hafu would raise his profile more. It would be more interesting for his current audience to see him try to learn by himself, I agree for sure, but I'd rather see him generate a large audience quicker than us getting some slightly more interesting short term content."
Destiny,3cvwcz,SerbLing,4,Sat Jul 11 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Lets be real the actual reason for getting coached by Hafu would be adding another girl to senpai's harem.
Destiny,3cvwcz,-char-aznable-,2,Sat Jul 11 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I've already wanted him to do this and you've just sold me on the idea like 10x harder. Damn I'm excited come on dusty :^(
Destiny,3cvwcz,SerbLing,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of playing hearthstone, but I literally watch Kripp stream it every night. It's at least entertaining and interesting to watch and simple to understand, unlike LoL which I cannot ever watch without wanting to blow my brains out regardless of who the streamer is. If I try to watch Destiny play LoL, it just builds my stress level exponentially until I close the stream. I hate LoL. I would watch Destiny play pretty much anything, including Hearthstone, but I can't watch anybody at all play LoL."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Joshrofl,6,Mon Jul 13 00:56:24 2015 UTC,I'll just come out and say i think hearthstone streams are the most boring thing anyone has ever bothered to broadcast in any medium
Destiny,3cvwcz,Dimitrije,5,Sat Jul 11 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yea him switching to HS would be kinda logical but I don't think I'll ever tune in if he plays that game. Its insanely boring to watch and he will have to sink atleast 200$ in that game too really start of. But if you like watching the game it's pretty chill, streamers can talk to you constantly etc. But the worst part is that he cant talk to opponents, which was 50% of the fun in the golden days of SC2. And 50% of the fun when he was playing csgo."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Magmaniac,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:10:22 2015 UTC,"even if he has to sink money into it, he'll make so much money from the pack opening part of the streams that it'll be worth it.  He can probably get donations to cover packs instantly if he does a little donation goal."
Destiny,3cvwcz,Joshrofl,2,Sat Jul 11 13:54:41 2015 UTC,I know. Just something steven shouldnt do imo. Beg for donations so he can buy online cards.
Destiny,3cvwcz,Magmaniac,0,Sat Jul 11 16:05:43 2015 UTC,I don't see how people can enjoy watching HS to be honest. There's 0 action and 90% of the game is luck and 10% strategy.
Destiny,3cvwcz,draemscat,3,Sat Jul 11 16:56:31 2015 UTC,I understand people that watch HS and I understand your point of view. I personally watched a little HS while I was playing it but I would definitely consider watching if Destiny were to play it :) RNG can make him mad and I like Destiny when he's mad.

Idk, it seems he just has something to prove to himself/ committed so much time not to get Dia V. I think it's been long enough to rest our case that the massive influx of viewers won't come for a very very long time (not until masters, if we want to argue a higher rank is what will get him more viewers) Still, this wouldn't be the first time he's left something behind am I right bois LeRuse Also fuck someone tell me how to meme in reddit posts"

Destiny,3cvk2u,pacjax,22,Sun Jul 12 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good way of putting it. At this point the chances of him ever becoming a major League streamer with a significantly higher number of viewers are incredibly slim. At this point I think he should just switch to playing games he actually enjoys, whether that's SC, single player games or whatever else."
Destiny,3cvk2u,Konet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"Steben has always been a very competitive gamer and I think that's what he is fixated on right now, he wants to get a high rank in the biggest esport currently. I think its pretty obvious league isn't the best game for stream growth despite what he says. That market is oversaturated, and he doesn't standout in terms of gameplay and his hyperbolica and flamey personality contradicts riot's mantra. Look at the recent post on the league of legends sub for instance (although op was biased)."
Destiny,3cvk2u,tehspy-,19,Sun Jul 12 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"He still believes that League has the best money-to-mental trauma ratio of any long term game. We all know he is wrong (and he does too, inside) but he has gone too far now and it's easier for him to commit and lie to us/himself than to start all over again.   I've said it once before, and that latest r/leagueoflegends post just sends it home even more: the LoL community just plain doesn't like the kind of person Destiny is.   Just enjoy the rages because he's like 3 days from silent strims forever until he quits and looks for a regular job."
Destiny,3cvk2u,Chrono68,18,Sat Jul 11 06:50:22 2015 UTC,"Because he's going to be like this with every game, to be perfectly honest... I hate to break it to you guys, but the game isn't the problem...  I say that with all the love in the world to Destiny."

Destiny,3cvk2u,pelvisbone,11,Sat Jul 11 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a double edged sword, since do you really think he had as much fun winning matches on SC2 as he does on LoL? He seems to have a LOT more fun winning on LoL, and people don't seem to realize that. Do you guys not remember how many times Destiny said ""holy fucking shit, what a shitty game"" after winning a SC2 game?  Nostalgia is a powerful thing, I know, but I do think my point of view does have some validity to it..."
Destiny,3cvk2u,i_pk_pjers_i,2,Sat Jul 11 06:13:57 2015 UTC,"Because SC2 is a pretty shitty game. Like it's possible to turtle for 40 minutes as Terran and get mech/ravens and just stall stall stall until the other person ragequits.  You think if he wins after 1 hour 20 minutes he's going to say ""what a great game, that person is really skilled for sitting in his base for 40 minutes""?  The Dankest Dungeon strims were so based, though. It was just Destiny playing a game and having fun. He would get shrekt and all, but it's usually because of really bad luck or trying a dungeon that's too hard. But in the end it was a lot of fun, chat interaction (because turn based) and no autism (because it's just a grindan single player game)"

When this happened last night, I figured it would probably end up on Reddit in some capactiy. I told a friend of mine that if it ever hit the LoL subreddit, a majority of comments would be ""rekt,"" ""lol toxic loser deserves it,"" etc. It's fucking hilarious that even when you have someone trolling in your games and ruining 4 other people's time, the redditards still gravitate towards the fact that ""you said mean things,"" and not ""a teammates is literally not trying to win and trying to make others sabotage your and others' experience.""

It's also hilarious to me that people keep bringing up that he's ""toxic"" even though Steven rarely even types anything ragey in chat, I feel like this way very much a ""special"" case. Apparently, the Riot circlejerk is hoping Professor Lyte installs some kind of microphone monitoring software that can catch if you swear under your breath when playing a game. Gotta make the world safe for dem kids.  It's honestly the reason I stopped playing LoL a long time ago. The guy who says ""GG ez"" is more of a villain than the guy who bribes people to throw games.

I hope he does but he needs a change of mindset and he probably realizes this too, that's why he seeked coaching from warlock. Also, will 3k people really watch Destiny play agar.io for longer than 1 hour?

You're competing with large number of other Leage streamers. A lot of new League people who come tend to be turned off by your abrasive personality, or they are the type of people to backseat game you and then get banned. I don't know how much viewers you get on noontime weekdays since I work, but the afternoon times I see only around 1500-2000 viewers which seems to just stay there.  I feel like just playing new upcoming games, be it single player or online, is better to grow your numbers. Like getting Phantom Pain or Fallout 4 on the first day and streaming as early as possible.  I'm not trying to bitch when I say watching League every single day can be really tiring and boring. It would really help viewers if you could play other games on rotation."

Destiny,3cptmr,my_time_machine,-4,Fri Jul 10 11:00:47 2015 UTC,"His core viewers are loyal indeed but getting good at league means a lot of new potential viewers. Sooner or later, his old fans will stop watching once they graduate highschool, uni, or whenever. Obviously I can't speak for Destiny but I assume this is why he continues to play LoL. He was also obviously tilted after those series of games, he probably genuinely enjoys the game at times but is just frustrated with his progress (he hit plat 3 for the first time like 3 months ago i think and he was still plat 3 last week and only up to plat 1 now because of duo queue). But I agree, Destiny's life is basically the Truman Show, we tune in everyday for the news, the events, the dramas, and to see him do what he does every day--even cooking. Many of his fans will watch Destiny regardless of what game he is playing."

Destiny,3cptmr,canarduck,-1,Thu Jul 9 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"Lirik got big playing fucking Arma 2   Lirik got big playing DayZ and being a ultra-memer.  To be fair, that's not exactly a wholy organic fan base, but he's seemed to keep it for whatever reason."
Destiny,3cptmr,Invictus1123,-5,Fri Jul 10 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"Obviously everyone who comes to this sub is going to have that opinion, because the only people who come to this sub are his most loyal viewers. He'll 100% get more viewers playing league than he will playing spelunky or something  I like league and i like when destiny plays league. That said, I also think he should play something he enjoys"
Destiny,3cptmr,canarduck,2,Fri Jul 10 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"Are you really so sure that he will get more viewers playing league? His viewer count has fluctuated around 1800 and 2300 ever since he quit sc2 (which, by the way, when he was playing it on and off right before the end he easily got 4k or more). He hasn't really gained that many new viewers except occasionally when he plays with others in the league community, and when he switches to agar or intellectual stuff or meme etc his viewer count doesn't really drop either. From my experience people don't come to the stream to watch league as much as overrustle.com strims or all the other entertaining stuff Destiny does. Besides, be is competing for viewers with a ton I found people who are well above his league; do you think he is magically going to get a bunch of viewers every time he ranks up? We'll see I guess, if we can get diamond without no hymen Hhhehhehhe  Also luck feague"
Destiny,3cptmr,fourZero,-3,Fri Jul 10 06:48:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is just getting into the top 5-10 league streamers on twitch at any given time, then you get a lot of random people stopping in who were just browsing through streams. I see him get up around 2.8-3k pretty consistently at certain times of the day on league, and I think that the more fresh eyes he gets on the stream, the more people he will get as 'loyal' viewers"
Destiny,3cptmr,Tatordots,-2,Fri Jul 10 09:20:43 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with most of what you say, I think Destiny's wallet will care a lot.  If he takes the risk and stops playing league and is still in the red after 6 months, he will not only have those 6 months wasted, but it will probably also take time for people to come back to his league stream. If they come back at all. That's a huge deal."

Destiny,3chlwb,v1ct0r1us,12,Wed Jul 8 06:09:05 2015 UTC,seeing a challenger level player making good decisions and having the awareness to make those decisions while playing are two completely different types of knowledge

Destiny,3chlwb,v1ct0r1us,4,Wed Jul 8 16:41:14 2015 UTC,But it does at least give him a target to aim for. He does not need to reinvent the wheel to get to challenger. Once he has gotten better he can then focus on experimenting and inventing his own style of play.

Regardless of how the relationship ended at one point Destiny liked her enough to invite her to live with him for an extended period of time. While it's none of our business one way or another I can understand why he's annoyed. If nothing else he's the only reason she's even known."
Destiny,3cgiyd,NeoDestiny,46,Tue Jul 7 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm always slightly invested in my exes for whatever stupid reason and it bothers me if I see them make horrible decisions, for whatever irrational reason. The last time Teresa went to Sweden to visit Nanners they got into some pretty big fights, so bad that she was apparently crying etc...She ended up missing her flight back to America and went back to Naniwa's to figure out a plan for the next flight and Naniwa told her to ""stay the fuck out"", apparently she was close to messaging me to ask for some money home.  For all of her faults, she at least seemed like a pretty ""strong""/confident individual. I'll never ever go down that road in dating her again for a whole slew of reasons, but it's really, really weird for me to see her getting abused by Nanner's and then run back to him afterwards. And then to get sucked into the autism cabal of friends to where even her and Desrow are ""buddies"" because he's friends with Nanners when Desrow is the biggest piece of shit in the entire scene, ehh...  BUT WHATEVER FLOATS THE BOAT, I GUESS. :^)"
Destiny,3cgiyd,jooguh,6,Wed Jul 8 06:15:17 2015 UTC,Honest question. Why do you think Desrow is a piece of shit? Is it because of the dick pics to tigerlilly incident?
Destiny,3cgiyd,NeoDestiny,54,Wed Jul 8 07:43:13 2015 UTC,"He's a huuuuuuuuge snake in the grass type person. He will say anything bad about anyone to get on anyone's good side and he gossips LIKE CRAZY.  His website was created and hosted for no charge by a nice lady. Desrow said that she looked like a fat disgusting bitch to another friend on Skype. She found out, and that's why his website was taken down until he got it rehosted/rebuilt by someone else.  He CONSTANTLY does this to EVERYONE in the SC2 community. He'll talk behind people's backs, gossip about everyone/everything like crazy, and generally just do whatever he can to ""get one over"" on people. He has no respect for anyone else and has the maturity of a 14 year old. Tweet and ask Bling/Demuslim/Tod/Rotti/Nathanias and they will all say the exact same thing."

I have no idea, really, he has a complete and total lack of regard for anyone else's feelings and he seems really immature in every relationship (non-romantic) he's ever engaged in. That's why him and HuK almost had Remax canceled that one time, when Desrow decided to take a photo/video of Huk sleeping, and when Huk asked him to delete it, he instead posted it on the internet..."

Also, on the final day he was there, Desrow got jealous of the money MB had made during the training session which lasted a little over a week. Although they had agreed on MB paying Desrow like 500 bucks for the training, MB decided to pay him more after Desrow complained publicly. Fucked up."

I thought Tigerlilly was exaggerating on the dick pix. Before that, when minnymausgg incident happened, my first thought was, he was having mood issues from diet (which happens to me), took to heart friendly banter, trashed a person without really meaning it, and that his comments weren't that bad.   I honestly thought he and minny could mend things, at least if he sincerely begged forgiveness, abd begged long and hard enough. So I tweeted to both of them. But his response to her was something like ""I won't apologize, because you won't accept it, and you were pushing my buttons before this thing"". Not just I felt it was over, but I then started to look into the other shit he did.  So I discovered the Korok incident:   desRow pockets the team's prize money without saying a word. 7 months after he received the prize money, it stands that he gave it all away already and I have not received any of it.   At that moment, I really felt I was the biggest idiot on r/starcraft when I took his side after Thorin trashed him."

Destiny,3cmwsb,Sweetchip,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I managed to assimilate the kingdoms of Brittany, Aquitaine, and Burgundy to form a greater Kingdom of France. Through some nice political marriages and some assassinations, my grandson ended up becoming the King of Middle Francia. When I died, my grandson was able to form the Empire of Francia from those two kingdoms.   Then I got bored and decided to play a competitive multiplayer online battle arena game called ""League of Legends"". My rank was starting to decay so I played one ranked game to stay in Grandmaster III. I played the marksman role and chose Sivir as my champion.   Our opponents were some of the worst, tilted scrubs hoping to lose their lp in the latest patch of League of Chromas. I was pretty confident that I would show these cucks the definition of ""fucked"".  Unfortunately, the laning phase didn't go very well, my support Blitzcrank landed approximately 2 hooks before 10 minutes and he was really getting depressed, saying stuff like ""gottem"" every time he dragged a minion over to me so I could cs. Luckily, I didn't rage at him and told him everything was cool. I was getting zoned a lot and losing out on cs, but I managed to pick up what I could and stay alive.  After first back, Blitz and I decided to ""make a play"". We postured extremely aggressively since the enemy bot lane hadn't backed yet. Because the enemy bot lane was literally retarded, they tried to fight back instead of accepting their new submissive role in the bot lane. Blitz and I managed to get a double kill for me and our trynd was snowballing on the enemy Riven, so the game was pretty much donezo by then. We got 2 inhib turrets and an inhib by 18 minutes and ended the game 5 minutes later.  I had stopped my lp decay so I decided to stop playing league for a while, my previous ranked game had a master yi and a tryndamere in the same game, so it was a miracle that we managed to do so well (the tryndamere was threatening to afk the moment the game started). I believed I had exhausted my luck for a few cycles.  I decided to play some more modded Murder Simulator II, but some of the mods were conflicting. I thought I managed to fix everything, and the game was working quite well for a couple dozen years. Then it crashed and now I'm here reading an autistic, narcisstic post and typing up an even more autistic answer. Fuck off. ITSRAWWW"

Destiny,3c8vnh,PleaseStopThat,3,Mon Jul 6 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"See this wiki article.    Memetics is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with Darwinian evolution, originating from the popularization of Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene.[1] Proponents describe memetics as an approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer.  The meme, analogous to a gene, was conceived as a ""unit of culture"" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.) which is ""hosted"" in the minds of one or more individuals, and which can reproduce itself, thereby jumping from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seen as an idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics, particularly under a Dawkinsian interpretation, a meme's success may be due to its contribution to the effectiveness of its host.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics"

Destiny,3c8pe3,Triggerlily,7,Tue Jul 7 08:25:25 2015 UTC,"Imo he took too long. Lost his growth window. Now he's sort of an established name in the League stream schema now.  Oh destiny? Yeah didnt he white knight Kaceytron and hates gay black people? Also he's not that good an adc, he always has a neg kda, etc etc. And he rages a lot.

Destiny,3c8pe3,Writhing,11,Mon Jul 6 01:54:44 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, Destiny often complained that it was impossible to get good high level games on the NA ladder, because of map hacking and other cheats being completely out of control. Playing on the Korean (or EU) server was not really feasible because of the ping being way too high. So even if you wanted to practice the game it wasn't possible, unless you got some dedicated practice partner."
Destiny,3c8pe3,Glaaki,6,Mon Jul 6 15:49:01 2015 UTC,Destiny should record streaming numbers based on what game he plays so that we can see if he really does get more viewers playing leaguers or if he just doesn't like sc2

Destiny,3c8pe3,SidusKnight,-7,Tue Jul 7 00:24:26 2015 UTC,There's a good chance his numbers will increase when he gets better/higher rank in LoL. Sc2 is stagnant. Top LoL streamers hit like 10k ish.
Destiny,3c8pe3,BlackBolt_,6,Mon Jul 6 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"of course that was the plan, but is it really happening? his numbers don't really go up, but he appears much more triggered than during his sc2 days.  He probably gets more $$$ now because of the new revenue stream (he implemented donations just after the switch), but I doubt it can be attributed to LoL popularity vs sc2."

Destiny,3c8pe3,darkhindu,3,Tue Jul 7 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"Serious answer though.   Destiny location in the US only makes the NA server playable without really bad lag. But there is no good practice on the NA ladder, and there is a large amount of hackers. This combined with the fact that Sc2 is regressing in growth and blizzard doesn't really seemed to care made destiny stop playing the game for good."

Even Winter has a great show as random. It's one thing to get depressed after losing season 1. But you can still practice more. He practice, but only lost because his opponents were practicing more.  I remember even Desrow offering to practice. And Destiny didn't want to. Even though all the viewers wanted them to verse. Some people weren't too happy about HOTS. I didn't see much wrong other than NP gone from infestor still. And screwing up the SH made things even worse. After how many people were complaining about HOTS, not sure why they made it worse. It's still worth it to compete. Homestory was still alot of fun even though the end was horrible where the host barely said a word to the winner, and kept interviewing the caster."

The reason europoors get so butthurt about american culture is because we're a melting pot and are literally the amalgamation of any people who stepped on this land prior to like 1950, and from there on every other nation that touched us through globalization.

Destiny,3c52ci,Noobity,3,Sun Jul 5 18:07:48 2015 UTC,The first person to sail to India was Vasco da Gama in 1500. India didn't have any direct trade with Europe before then but rather it could be trickled down thru the greeks/ottomans who had trade relations with them. However after Vasco da Gama Portugal made a shit ton of money off of India which was one of the main reasons for mercantilism.

Destiny,3c55pq,rdc30,4,Sat Jul 4 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"BT is more optimal if you really boil things down.  That being said when ER first came out and people were running CDR boots on Lucian I used to do 40% cdr builds with it with success as well. It really comes down to ""Are you good enough to make it work? Can you use the advantage this item gives you over BT/BoTRK?""  And in Destiny's case the answer seems to be yes, as he's having success with it in his current elo. He may hit a wall at some point where it doesn't become efficient anymore, but he hasn't as of yet.  This should give you tons of trading power in lane because you have LS, infinite mana, and unless you're way behind you should hit the 80 damage powerspike first (It's the cheapest 80 damage item by far). Since Destiny has a duo support that's aggressive and plays well he's using this to its full advantage.  It just changes the win condition of the game for you, really. You must stomp early, which is already kind of a Draven thing to do. It opens up a lot of opportunities where you'd be mana capped (Granted, some of which can be mitigated by learning to manage your mana), but you have less LS and no shield closing other opportunities.  Honestly, the item would be in a really good place if they just upped the LS on it to 15%. But yea, it's situational, but it works as shown by Destiny."
Destiny,3c55pq,Shadostruct,4,Sun Jul 5 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's for the mana, not for the CDR. I haven't seen a single high elo Draven main consistently getting it, though."
Destiny,3c55pq,FLABREZU,4,Sat Jul 4 22:17:57 2015 UTC,"probably because most high elo dravens dont spam their w and e while farming. its not a shit item, the alternatives (bt/ie) are just much better"

His E would change the enemy meta-game into backing more often to shop, buying smaller recipe items instead of banking for a larger item.

That fake talking points enumeration, in partisan/lazy media, is basically not helping people building a political culture.   You see Destiny frustrated with medias, frustrated with schools, because those aren't enabling a political culture among citizens, that can eventually lead to empowerment. Instead of having knowledgeable debates about welfare economics (destiny picked that example) from a modern economical perspective, issues are brushed aside with empty jingoistic stances, so that candidates can refocus their campaign strategies on the hot stuff: Ted Cruz making dubs for the Simpsons, and Chillary Clinton selling mugs.   8 years of ""yes we can"" attempt of making a new better reality possible, started with small riots after  Oscar Grant shooting, and ended with Ferguson huge riots. This is clearly the sign of a population that is loosing hope in finding alternatives.  And it is not an american thing. You have riots in Brazil against corruption. You have fascistic youth anti migrant with sporadic outbreak of Islamists in France. You have former previously left leaning, with strong unions leading protests municipalities, that are now drifting into Islamic State lovers in Tunisia. You had riots in Spain. You had Podemos movement in Italy. Turkey too had its share.

He's banging a drug addict, you don't interact with F.Society outside the premises, the inner monologues sound exactly like FClub, etc.  Same general idea, same anti-corporate/anti-consumerism message. It has a little more 'substance' because it's a TV format and they can make it very long winded.  These are just assumptions based on the first two episodes.

Still glad it exists 'cuz it seems like it'll be an interesting series for at least the first season.  edit: the episode titles are fucking autistic and the marketing is hilarious. YOUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN HACKED."

Destiny,3bs3t0,askshonestquestions,8,Thu Jul 2 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he is autistic or not, but from what I have seen from his streams I would classify him with moderate to severe aspbergers. I'm conducting a clinical trial for an experiment to quantify the level with which humans interact and an adjunct of that pertains to aspbergers as well as other forms of social disorders. From what I have seen so far it falls in line with the tests performed. I can't say much else, but I will say that Steven if you're intersted in the study I am not far from Nebraska and would love to include you in my work."
Destiny,3bs3t0,nihil2909,17,Thu Jul 2 04:42:47 2015 UTC,No. Every little factoid retards love to spout on why Destiny is autistic is normal. Raging at games? Banning people when he's annoyed? Getting irritated at people who backseat game him? Trying to commit to one type of build he thinks is best? Not wanting to commit to relationships like with TigerLily? THESE ARE ALL NORMAL FLAWS MOST PEOPLE HAVE. A real definitive autistic person would be someone like Naniwa who literally has problems in the communication and understanding area.    Like he talks about one message that he sends to a girl he's never met before for about 2 hours and overanalyses every word   Like every other person that desperately wants a relationship.

Destiny,3bljuz,robotlol,3,Tue Jun 30 12:31:06 2015 UTC,Except that's wrong   You can't distribute your .torrent because it contains references to your specific account and to the private tracker.  You can create a new .torrent with the same files.  But clearly you're not cut out for torrenting if you not only think it's magic but speak wrongly about it.

Destiny,3bgarj,TanteTroll,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:26:15 2015 UTC,"Didn't catch the discussion, so I don't know how relevant this is. I just want to point something out regarding the usefulness of a kingsguard in ""modern"" times.  During the german invasion of Denmark in 1940 the danish government faced with certain defeat ordered our armed forced not to resist the advancing german soldiers. The kingsguard however, reporting directly to the king actually fought the german soldiers advancing on the royal palace, and following a short skirmish prevented the german soldiers from advancing. They did so outnumbered and outgunned until a truce could be negotiated which involved the germans not advancing any further. It wasn't until 3 years later in 1943 that they were finally forced to lay down their arms when Hitler became outraged with the danish king because he basically replied with ""thanks"" to a long formal letter Hitler wrote congratulating the king on his 72nd birthday.   The fact that some Danish soldiers actually fought, and the fact that the king would defiantly prance about the streets of Copenhagen on his horse in the years following the occupation became a powerful and uniting symbol for the danish people to take at least some small pride in after the humiliation of becoming occupied by the Nazis. You can't underestimate the importance of something like that."

Destiny,3ba0k8,RDandersen,0,Sun Jun 28 22:55:25 2015 UTC,It's called one extra wave of creeps worth of gold and by selling it you lose almost 4 waves worth of gold value.
Destiny,3ba0k8,LifeOrb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:09:37 2015 UTC,From the point that he went below 70 health to the point where he died he did absolutely nothing. It demostrates Destiny's point that in practice 70 HP at the stage in the game is worth practically nothing. Why are you framing the video like he is contradicting himself?
Destiny,3ba0k8,LifeOrb,0,Mon Jun 29 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"The main point of the video was the  and not really to make a point BUT he really still should just stick around for an extra wave which pays for the Doran's Blade instead of selling it. Even when he was playing earlier he had a point 40 minutes into the game where he survived with his Doran's Blade still in his inventory on 40 health before healing right back up and getting a double kill. So yes, the 70hp is still a useful stat later on into the game and 3% lifesteal as a percentage modifier is also still useful. You don't want to sell items until as late as possible because you lose gold value every time."

Are there other instances where a single person represents an entire form of government, thought, or religion?"" ""But X person said they were evil!"" ""So you haven't examined this for yourself and come to your own decision on the matter?""  Basically just keep asking ""Why do you think this?"" and it'll force them to explain their logic, which is most likely just appeals to authority and poisoning the well. As well as asking questions like ""What is Marxism?"" and you'll soon make them realize they probably don't know much about the topic at hand and are just regurgitating what their favorite hyper-conservative nutcase was saying.  If that doesn't work then they're probably a lost cause. The mental gymnastics some people are capable of to warp the world to make themselves always right can be astounding and frightening."

Destiny,3b29o0,nethqz,4,Thu Jun 25 11:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think that the fact that we like destiny isnt compensating enough for the lack of minimap vision in game, and because of that i think that a good chunk of the potential viewers of the stream are actually driven away. Let's be honest, in a lot of games destiny is really focused and barely talks and without the informations minimap provides viewers are left in a condition where they just can't understand a thing about the game that is in progress. If the only reason destiny hides his minimap is ghosting then it's not a cost-effective decision, since the amount of viewers that lose interest and leaves the stream outweights by far the ghosting thing (that by the way not a single streamer is worried about)"
Destiny,3b29o0,dawigas,6,Thu Jun 25 12:48:24 2015 UTC,"a lot of streamers are worried about ghosting and complain about it constantly (oddone and dyrus for example). you are completely correct though, even if hiding the minimap may be benefitial to your elo it will cost you $ in the long run because of the people leaving your stream"

Destiny,3b29o0,RDandersen,3,Fri Jun 26 08:31:14 2015 UTC,"Dude it's common sense. Your audience is composed by 1: People who watch your stream no matter what. 2: People who enjoy league (because they want to learn something) and your person.  The minimap is directly correlated to understanding a game, you need to be autistic to watch destiny last hit 30 min and be ok with that."
Destiny,3b29o0,KibaTeo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:52:37 2015 UTC,"i dont have stats to prove this, should have worded my assumption better. if someone was really bored he could check this months viewer distribution for when he showed the minimap vs. when he hides it. the reason i strongly believe this is true is that popular streamers like the ones i mentioned before get really rustled by ghosters but very rarely hide their minimap or put delay on their stream. the only reason i could think of is a significant loss in viewers/ad revenue if they do because viewers get bored/cant interact with them anymore"
Destiny,3b29o0,nethqz,0,Fri Jun 26 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"I see the point, but wouldnt a 15s delay be enough for that?     Twitch already runs at 10-40 seconds delay. And no.    Also, minimap is in the right corner because League goes from bottom left base to top right base and vice versa so most of the action takes place in those directions. Less chance of accidentally clicking the minimap by mistake while e.g. stutter-stepping."

Destiny,3b29o0,darkhindu,-1,Thu Jun 25 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"i dont think 15s delay would be enough, possible ghosters could still predict where the jungler is, if mid/top are roaming etc. a delay of 1 minute or more would severely impact his ability to communicate with chat so thats not really an option    regarding the position of the minimap: i remember he had it on the left side some time ago but changed it because of ""where the important information in the ui was displayed"""

No shit they're bad, that's why they're at that rank.  The dude had a shitty coaching style, shitty methods, shitty techniques, and relayed poor advice.  He fucking told Destiny to switch to arpen runes and then they immediately hopped into soloq without having him try CSing in a custom with them at all (its rough as fuck until you practice/learn).  He told Destiny to watch Fabbby without telling him anything to look for or focus on."
Destiny,3azdui,TheFatalWound,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"The dude had a shitty coaching style, shitty methods, shitty techniques, and relayed poor advice.   i wouldnt necessarily think that he is a bad coach. if you are used to coaching pro players (or nacs players) there are certain assumptions you make based on the game knowledge that all 10 players on the map have. for example he assumed jinx would be fine bot for awhile so destiny was free roam and ward the map for other lanes to get ahead.    that shouldnt excuse his constant bitching about plat/diamond players but it explains why his calls seem bad    just to give you a scrub example: i main support, at the end of last season i pushed my gf's account into gold so she would get the morg skin. i failed so many thresh hooks and nami bubbles in those silver/gold games because i assumed they would dodge just like in my games. but most of the time they didnt fucking move at all so i looked like a retard."

Destiny,3ayd64,suicidal_carrot,-3,Thu Jun 25 00:32:45 2015 UTC,You're completely wrong. It's not the site that sells the games. The keys are sold by users on their site.

Destiny,3ayd64,Noobity,3,Wed Jun 24 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"There is a humongous difference with insurance being purchased on a 3rd party service (shipping, since amazon doesn't have their own vans/planes/delivery people) and purchasing insurance to ensure you're not fucked if the item itself doesn't work. I can't think of any company I've purchased items for where if they came DoA I couldn't immediately send them back or return them to a store for a replacement.   I'm not going to call you names (though inbred mongrel made me laugh pretty hard) but your argument doesn't really have a leg to stand on."
Destiny,3ayd64,Gatesleeper,-5,Thu Jun 25 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my understanding, the extra insurance is not about keys being ""DoA"". I don't think G2A or Kinguin sell keys that just flat out don't work. The insurance is for when the keys get banned sometime down the line by the game publishers when/if they find out a certain batch of keys were gotten illegitimately.   Also there are plenty of stores that have a no return policy, like dollar stores or some clothing retailers. Because technically, once you walk out the store with an item and you come back later with the item out of its packaging, there's no way for you to prove whether it came out of the box broken or you broke it."
Destiny,3ayd64,Noobity,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware you can buy keys from the retailers that will just not work. I've never had a clothing store I purchased something in refuse to take something back, and unless it's clearly torn/stretched/has shit on it/doesn't have the tags that were on the things when you bought it then you shouldn't have any problem returning anything to a clothing store. Exceptions might be made to order clothing or other designer shit. I've returned stuff to dollar stores too. If something flat out doesn't work and you return it within a day or so of purchase there are very few places that wont accept it. Tons of stuff has warrantees on it (including inexpensive small stuff in a lot of cases) so that if the thing doesn't work a month down the line you can get it replaced.   There's simply no reason for game sellers like g2a/kinguin to be able to work the way they do. It's frankly disgusting."
Destiny,3ayd64,Gatesleeper,-2,Thu Jun 25 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"Really what about what I'm saying is so infuriating?  Shipping insurance is not to ""make sure your shit doesn't get broken in transit"". It's not like you're paying them to be extra careful with your shit.  What you're paying for is that in the case your shit does get broken, stolen, or lost in transit, they will send you another one free of charge.  So it is in effect quite similar to ""a digital download key being stolen and you paying to get a new one instead of it just being free"". If you pay G2A for the extra insurance, they will give you another key for free in the case the one you got gets banned. If you don't pay for the insurance, you don't get another key for free.  Much the same with other products, you don't get another one for free if it gets lost/broken if you didn't pay for the insurance.  So it doesn't say much to me about G2A if they offer optional insurance for their keys. If a retailer offers extended warranty on a laptop or a refridgerator, it doesn't mean that what they're selling is likely to malfunction soon or that the retailer is shady. It's just an extra way to make money for the retailer off of those customers willing to pay for peace of mind."

Destiny,3ayd64,Gatesleeper,-10,Thu Jun 25 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"A crate full of widgets falls off the back of a moving delivery truck and the driver doesn't notice. A small crowd of people gather around it, they each take a widget for themselves. You also partake and take a widget without paying anyone any money. That's like online pirating.  Another day, you're walking through a market and a man is operating a stall that sells widgets for much cheaper than they can be gotten at the official widget store. They are authentic widgets, but you don't know whether these widgets were gotten legally or illegally. You buy a cheap widget. That's like using Kinguin or G2A.  Taking something of value for free without paying money is worse than paying someone for it."
Destiny,3ayd64,NeoDestiny,15,Thu Jun 25 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Taking something of value for free without paying money is worse than paying someone for it.   You're using an insanely naive point of view on this. This is something I would expect a 6 year old to say. ""Well, you pay money for the second one, and the first one is free, so the first one MUST be worse!""  People like G2A encourage the theft of keys. When you pirate something, you are simply obtaining the software illegally, but no one is profiting off of it. When you're purchasing stolen keys you've entered a whole new realm. Now you've created a demand for stolen keys and people are going to do whatever they can to acquire said stolen keys.  Pirating doesn't cause people to use massive amounts of stolen credit cards to fraudulently purchase CD keys to flip to a reseller.  Pirating doesn't encourage people to lie and cheat and steal their way to free CD keys by impersonating personalities via e-mail.  Pirating doesn't ""compete"" with authentic retailers by offering the same software at a lower price."

Destiny,3ayd64,Gatesleeper,-2,Thu Jun 25 11:30:12 2015 UTC,"Well let's say we live in a world where your analogy makes sense and assume that prostitution necessitates human trafficking. It is like saying you're against human trafficking, while you partake in its spoils continuously. It's so blatantly hypocritical.  I'm not saying you have to support G2A/Kinguin, but it's weird to me to see people on a high horse about this subject when they probably steal shit online all the time and think nothing of it.   Like you're looking down on streamers who are sponsored by these sites, and people who use these sites. Those people are still paying money to (quasi?) legally buying games, when everyone knows they can simply hit up piratebay and get those games for free. It's a weird middle ground between totally legit (buying games from Gamestop or Steam) and totally illegal/immoral (torrents). If you're a person who only buys games using the former method, then fine, you have the right to look down on the grey market users. But if you regularly pirate (i.e. steal) games, who are you to look down on people who are still paying money to buy their games?"
Destiny,3ayd64,Flawzz,3,Thu Jun 25 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"Except it's not legal, at ALL, the problem is prosecution you can't really accuse them unless you KNOW those keys have been stolen and the only way you can know that is if you're the one giving them out, i.e. the developer, and the fact that I pirate or don't pirate games has no influence in the matter.   No matter how many people pirate their games in the world such a thing will never make reselling stolen keys right or buying those keys knowingly that they are stolen, it's not even a case of hypocracy unless i am pirating games in order to sell them ilegally, and even then pirating a game and stealing a key are two different things, if i buy a stolen key at a reduced price, NONE of the money goes to the developer on top of the fact that it was someone else's hard bought product, the key that my game has has already been used and can't be resold or be used ""legitimately"", for example, to play online modes."

Destiny,3azl4s,WhenTheAyylmaoHits,10,Wed Jun 24 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"Well, according to the wikia, Doran's Blade is 137% gold efficient, with a stat value of 603g. Infinity Edge is 102.1% gold efficient, with a stat value of 3880g. You also lose 264g when you sell Doran's Blade, so there's that to consider as well.  However, that isn't very relevant as Destiny's argument was that IE had more combat effectiveness than D Blade plus IE parts + boots (what he could have bought if he hadn't finished IE immediately). So let's break down the differences.  With IE and nothing else you get  80 ad 20% crit chance unique passive making your crits do 250% instead of 200%.  With D Blade + IE parts + boots you get  82 ad 70 health 3% life steal 15% crit chance +25 movement speed  For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you have 100 base ad with no armor pen, and that all of the enemies have 50 armor. You also manage to get off 10 autos total in the team fight.  With only IE your crits will end up dealing 30% more damage when compared to no crit. So 1800 * 1.3 is 2340. Reduce this by 1/3 after factoring in armor and you get 1560 damage.  With D Blade + parts + boots your autos average out to dealing 15% more damage. 1820 * 1.15 is 2093. Factoring in armor, and you get 1395.333 damage.  So the only IE build will end up dealing 11.8% more damage on average.  However, during this time, you will also heal up for 41.86 hp from the lifesteal of D Blade. This, plus the 70 flat hp from D Blade, means you end up with a hp bonus of 111.86.  It's hard to put a value on movement speed as it depends a lot on the team comps and your ability to dodge skillshots. However, movement speed on an adc is generally more valuable than on other roles since kiting is so integral to the role. This value is only magnified considering Destiny was playing Draven, a champion with no dashes/blinks which (generally) don't scale with movement speed, while having a %movement speed buff.  Having just an IE would only be more worth in terms of combat stats as an adc if you're mostly team fighting, have good positioning, and have a team comp with lots of cc or an enemy team comp with few escapes. Having IE parts + D Blade + boots is more worth if team fights are more extended and more common, your positioning isn't extremely good, you're splitting often, or if your team doesn't have much cc.  I'm not autistic, I was curious about this myself so I was planning on doing it anyways."

Destiny,3awygd,syunfox,-4,Wed Jun 24 05:59:01 2015 UTC,DAE AT LEAST RTBA CAN DO ONE THING RIGHT XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Destiny,3awygd,Waterboyyyy,8,Wed Jun 24 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"Hi. Several years ago I decided to make an extremely, extremely incendiary post in a non-reddit forum about the issue of pedophilia. Of course for the sake of laughs and giggles I exaggerated my opinion from ""theoretically and under very particular and unrealistic circumstances a certain and very limited degree of non-intrusive contact between fully consenting individuals regardless of age is possibly alright"" into ""pedophilia is great and a few bad apples aren't representative! wake up people!"". Needless to say I had a lot of fun playing a combination between devil's advocate and making people insane simply by defending an extremely unpopular position! The problem was that someone called the FBI and that I had to use a proxy after that, yet it was the largest thread in the forum with over a thousand comments over the span of several months (the admin refused to put it in the list of most popular threads though). So this time I'm going to be fair and try to defend a reasonable position, so I wanted to ask you beforehand if you would consider appropriate to discuss this possibly extremely incendiary topic. My actual position states that a society where light forms of pedophilia existed is both conceivable and within the realm of the ethically acceptable under very strict and unrealistic circumstances, and that the age of consent should be eliminated and consent re-defined as ""a situation where both participants are willing to commit the act and and at least one of them takes responsibility for any harm done as a result of the act"". That position might seem insane but it's actually just a little step towards sexual liberation, I don't defend under any circumstance pedophilia in real life and consider than in essentially every case a person under 13 years can't possibly consent to sexuality with a much older person even when there's no harm done. Real life is not like theory, but still I'd like to discuss my highly theoretical and extremely incendiary (and misunderstandable) position here someday, and I'd like your approval beforehand. Thanks for your attention :D 1) Well mine became the most insanely controversial topic in that forum ever, so it might be common but I certainly had to have a nice touch to make it burn so much! 2) Some people actually agreed to the watered-down position I exposed after the first few hundred comments so I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea really :D The exaggerated one certainly not! But what I called ""my actual position"" then yes, but only because I repeatedly emphasized how it only works in theory and under very specific and unreal circumstances. Let me show you how this works. Hitler was right in theory and under very specific and unreal circumstances. And these very specific and unreal circumstances could be, for example, if aliens had visited him and told him that they were going to invade the Earth and kill everyone if he didn't start world war 2. Insane? Yeah, but my point is that anything, no matter how stupid it sounds (such as Hitler being right), under very specific and unreal circumstances it could be right (note: i think Hitler was wrong, that was just an example to show my point) In the case of my argument about pedophilia, these very specific and unreal circumstances would be, for example, that all adults were incredibly responsible, that there was a clear way to check whether a child is actually consenting or not, that children shown perfectly what they're feeling about anything at all times, that society doesn't frown sexuality in any way, that there are strict medical and psychological check-ups, that there's no physical harm done through any of the acts, that child's psychology is completely unaffected by sexuality... the list goes on and on, that's why it stands in the realm of the ""theoretical"" since in real life it's impossible for every single condition to be met, but my point stands that if they were, then yes, pedophilia would be ethical. Just consider this a very, very incendiary thought experiment :D"

Destiny,3awygd,Zimmerzom,6,Sat Jun 27 07:22:56 2015 UTC,"Hi. Several years ago I decided to make an extremely, extremely incendiary post in a non-reddit forum about the issue of pedophilia. Of course for the sake of laughs and giggles I exaggerated my opinion from ""theoretically and under very particular and unrealistic circumstances a certain and very limited degree of non-intrusive contact between fully consenting individuals regardless of age is possibly alright"" into ""pedophilia is great and a few bad apples aren't representative! wake up people!"". Needless to say I had a lot of fun playing a combination between devil's advocate and making people insane simply by defending an extremely unpopular position! The problem was that someone called the FBI and that I had to use a proxy after that, yet it was the largest thread in the forum with over a thousand comments over the span of several months (the admin refused to put it in the list of most popular threads though). So this time I'm going to be fair and try to defend a reasonable position, so I wanted to ask you beforehand if you would consider appropriate to discuss this possibly extremely incendiary topic. My actual position states that a society where light forms of pedophilia existed is both conceivable and within the realm of the ethically acceptable under very strict and unrealistic circumstances, and that the age of consent should be eliminated and consent re-defined as ""a situation where both participants are willing to commit the act and and at least one of them takes responsibility for any harm done as a result of the act"". That position might seem insane but it's actually just a little step towards sexual liberation, I don't defend under any circumstance pedophilia in real life and consider than in essentially every case a person under 13 years can't possibly consent to sexuality with a much older person even when there's no harm done. Real life is not like theory, but still I'd like to discuss my highly theoretical and extremely incendiary (and misunderstandable) position here someday, and I'd like your approval beforehand. Thanks for your attention :D 1) Well mine became the most insanely controversial topic in that forum ever, so it might be common but I certainly had to have a nice touch to make it burn so much! 2) Some people actually agreed to the watered-down position I exposed after the first few hundred comments so I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea really :D The exaggerated one certainly not! But what I called ""my actual position"" then yes, but only because I repeatedly emphasized how it only works in theory and under very specific and unreal circumstances. Let me show you how this works. Hitler was right in theory and under very specific and unreal circumstances. And these very specific and unreal circumstances could be, for example, if aliens had visited him and told him that they were going to invade the Earth and kill everyone if he didn't start world war 2. Insane? Yeah, but my point is that anything, no matter how stupid it sounds (such as Hitler being right), under very specific and unreal circumstances it could be right (note: i think Hitler was wrong, that was just an example to show my point) In the case of my argument about pedophilia, these very specific and unreal circumstances would be, for example, that all adults were incredibly responsible, that there was a clear way to check whether a child is actually consenting or not, that children shown perfectly what they're feeling about anything at all times, that society doesn't frown sexuality in any way, that there are strict medical and psychological check-ups, that there's no physical harm done through any of the acts, that child's psychology is completely unaffected by sexuality... the list goes on and on, that's why it stands in the realm of the ""theoretical"" since in real life it's impossible for every single condition to be met, but my point stands that if they were, then yes, pedophilia would be ethical.

Through growth of an agricultural industry off the back of subjugated individuals against their will. Wow, what a valuable cultural identity. Not to mention the fact, that this flag came to represent a continued defiance and segregation of this entire people long after the abolition of slavery. The flag represents resentment, and racism- plain and simple. There is no world where slavery is ethically or morally okay. There is no instance where it was justified, and the continuance of such an abhorrent practice can only be championed by individuals who are absolutely shitty, immoral, and un-american, ignorant people.   The entire war ended up killing more Americans than the entirety of world war II. All over an embedded economic factor rooted in absolutely racist ideals. The flag is a murderous symbol of defiance against reality, a contempt of an entire race of people for the good of the few who owned them because they sought economic gain before ethical and moral righteousness.   Honestly, there isn't a conversation to be had here. You're just wrong, there's no reason to fly that flag anymore."

You could say they are economically dependent on that trade. Then France comes along who has slavery abolished and said you should abolish slavery. And in what world do you imagine UK agreeing to that demand? Would that make UK evil? Because they never ever would agree.  Secondly not all Confederate citizens and soldiers had slaves. It was almost like they thought that they are fighting for their own country or some shit.  And i have no clue how can you think that Confederate flag is not okay, but UK (which had slaves and put american natives, aboriginals, africans, indians, arabs, other asians, irish under their boots) is okay. And i can say the same about France, Netherlands any other colonial country. By looking from moral standpoint Confederate flag would be maybe 8th on the worst flag list. And don't act like southerners are the only people who ever had slaves. Fun fact UK sometimes used slavery as a justification to invade african countries because they wanted to liberate slaves (of course the country had to go into British control :D)  Edit  Oh yea i forgot how USA after American-Spanish war treated cubans and Filipinos   a contempt of an entire race of people for the good of the few who owned them because they sought economic gain before ethical and moral righteousness   nice description of human history there buddy  Lets not forget that romans had slaves.

Destiny,3avunr,-stin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"UK only abolished slavery because they no longer needed slaves. The products made by slaves in caribbean lost their value and UK moved to industrial production.  I also like how you completly ignore how long UK ran slavery and how their imperialism in africa, asia caused more harm then south could ever cause   created a state for the sole purpose of keeping slaves    Actually minority of Confederate citizens had slaves  By December 1864, Davis considered sacrificing slavery in order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent Duncan F. Kenner to Europe with a message that the war was fought solely for ""the vindication of our rights to self-government and independence"" and that ""no sacrifice is too great, save that of honor."" The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms. Davis's message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential. Europe, however, could see that the Confederacy was on the verge of total defeat.  Top kek  And also if you really believe that if Confederacy would have won that it would never abolish slavery you need to shoot yourself for being a fucking retard"

I've got to be honest, its 2015 and i don't even know why i'm having this argument because no matter what bullshit false equivilancy you pull out of your ass you're absolutely batshit retarded if you don't think the confederate flag is racist and has no place in the modern day.  Like you have to be openly ignorant of history to even make that fucking claim. The UK doesn't matter. No one gives a shit about them, YOURE THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT THEM (???????) you know why? because its absolutely irrelevant. We could sit here for fucking years and hold up the confederate states to every fucking civilization that's ever existed and weigh their pros and cons against each other, and argue who's worse. What doesn't change is the fact the the confederacy is founded with the intention of harboring slaves, the entire reason for their existence; for slavery. It also doesn't change the fact that you should be fucking sterilized for being this fucking retarded."

I don't think you grasp basic logic and reason. You can't just walk in make an argument like ""WELL WE CAN NEVER REALLY KNOW CAN WE? CHECKMATE!"" Why? Because it's fucking retarded and irrelevant to the discussion being had. The Confederacy lived and died with racist ideals, and those ideals even superseded its existence, and the entirety of its existence came to represent those same racist ideals it stood upon. It never abolished slavery. Could it have done that? Maybe. But the fact is; it didn't. Even asking that question is absolutely pointless.   I question your fundamental life beliefs if you honestly think its a-okay to have these kinds of ideas in your head and be a functioning human being. It's not frustrating, or angering to hear, its just really fucking sad that you can reach so far, to try and obscure something that's black and white by engaging in what ever fallacious logic you can to strive for righteousness."
Destiny,3avunr,oGsNiggerAnnihilator,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:14:50 2015 UTC,The Confederacy lived and died with racist ideals Now thats irrelevent   Like I mentioned time and time again many countries had these ideals even after the abolishment of slavery in south. I could probobly count on my fingers the countries that did not have slavery at some point. I don't care with what fucking ideals some country had when it died. You can't just say to some southerner fuck off with our flag and forget that Confederacy ever existed. Many african countries had slavery when they were conquered by europeans I guess it would be bad in their case to reminiscent about their lost country because at the time they had slavery. I could hardly expect a yank to understand. Hardly ever you had to struggle for your country   Honestly am I arguing with a RL racist right now?   Typical plebittor
Destiny,3avunr,CenturionWhoa,-5,Fri Jun 26 14:11:16 2015 UTC,Britain's flag represents a country that isn't inherently evil. The confederate flag represents and ideology that is inherently evil. You can't compare the two for obvious reasons.

Destiny,3aq5b7,nucLeaRStarcraft,2,Tue Jun 23 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.  Back when Destiny started playing League again, he dropped all other games to focus on it. Recently we've had Witcher breaks to cooldown from the steaming pile of shit that is solo q, but that's it. The reason for this is because he wanted to get diamond in League, and he said a few times ""once I get diamond we can have other streams like CSGO, until then nothing else"". While he got it a few times, he has to get dia back and reach a stable point before he considers doing it again. Now with the recent coaching from Warlock and saying how Masters is within reach in a few months of hard work, I think it's safe to say that League streams will stay the sole focus for the foreseeable future.  I want the best for the stream, but damn everyone including Destiny loved CSGO times because he didn't tryhard but still tried to improve; it was mostly having fun. Hopefully we can return to a more balanced roster of games in the future."

Destiny,3avd27,fishydeeds,4,Wed Jun 24 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"I played it a tonne for about 2 months when it came out. At its core its not a bad game, underneath all the MMO bullshit is a solid shooter with good gunplay and fun mechanics. That being said, its a sliced up game thats spoon fed to players every 6 months in the form of over priced DLC. May as well just wait for Destiny 2 which is apparently contractually obliged to come out on PC anyway. By then hopefully they've learnt from the mistakes of their first game, which seems to have been a guinea pig test ground anyway.  Don't forget of course the MMO formula, it was waaay too repetitive, even worse than WoW due to the fact of how little content there actually is."
Destiny,3avd27,CreamStrudel,2,Tue Jun 23 20:53:40 2015 UTC,Everything I've heard about this game makes it sound cancerous. Like they had a full game and cut it up to bleed people of their money. Really shitty practice.
Destiny,3avd27,Jupiter_101,2,Tue Jun 23 23:54:21 2015 UTC,Well said.  The main game at its core is decent and the coop is fun if that is what you enjoy.  The multiplayer should have been left out though and the DLC/MMO aspect of the game is absolutely horrible.    The other issue is that the campaign is way too short and easy plus after a while the game just gets boring.  Had I waited for reviews for this game I would have waited until it was $20.  It is simply not worth it to pay full price for a 5 hour campaign.

Destiny,3aomge,MissesDoubtfire,3,Mon Jun 22 09:43:43 2015 UTC,"The ironic thing is that he was saying that a result-oriented person would just say, ""I lost the fight, therefore it was a bad decision,"" whereas he wanted to determine what could have happened with ideal play. This is just another form of being result-oriented. The fact that he could have traded 1 for 1 if Janna had gotten in one more auto isn't very important. It slightly helps with learning the limits of your champion, but not to a great degree. Learning the limits of your champion is more about feel.  As you say, the actual thing to review here should be the decision making behind taking the fight in the first place. He'll never have that exact same scenario again, so determining the result under optimal play teaches very little. Some of the most important things to examine:   What cooldowns has everyone used recently? How many charges does Annie have on her stun? Have any summoners been used? How much health does everyone have? How many creeps will aggro on both sides? Is anyone close to being oom? How many axes do I have? If this trade doesn't result in a kill for either side, who will benefit through sustain/kill pressure after? What runes/masteries do both supports have? What support item do both supports have?   These are the things you have to evaluate to make informed decisions. The actual fight was practically a coin flip in terms of who should actually win, but that doesn't help with making decisions in the future unless you're a robot and can memorise exact scenarios down to every variable involved."

The big takeaways would be not to commit to extended trades without having axes prepped, and not committing when a pretty important spell like Janna shield isn't available.   they were at such a huge disadvantage after janna had to flash out that taking the fight was just stupid. the only reason this was even close was because after the flash both annie and ashe kept chasing after janna while destiny was pumping shielded axes into ashe.    another thing to note is that janna started coin which is pretty shitty for early trading/all ins"

Destiny,3aomge,Shadostruct,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:51:11 2015 UTC,Yeah all these close trades that he analyzes usually start when his supports abilities are one cd and the enemies aren't. League is really all about baiting the enemies skills and fighting when they are down. He needs to take a giant step back before analyzing these close fights and ask himself if he should of fought anyways. If it was a close fight then you probably shouldn't of taken it. You can get more gold by taking good trades every time instead of winning one close fight once.
Destiny,3aomge,Magmaniac,0,Tue Jun 23 19:42:01 2015 UTC,I think that destiny doesn't understand how important champions are so the first mistake is in champ select. Playing ashe/janna after trying to play lesser played champions is literally amazing and its how most pro players gain elo. They spam games as op champions. Destiny was tearing it up as jinx when he tried her.

If a cis woman had been given artificial testosterone injections since birth until she was 18 and then stopped it would change her body forever. She would never be physiologically the same, and should not be allowed to compete in sports against other, chemically unaltered women.

What's giving sociology a bad rap are the schools which far too easily hand out useless social studies degrees, and the people who wield those to further their political agenda.

Destiny,3akt6f,NeoDestiny,4,Mon Jun 22 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"It's true, but you also have to actually learn shit. If you don't know exactly what an item does, look it up between games. If you're not sure about a match up, look at some high elo guides. If you haven't already, look up runes, masteries and builds for a champion on Probuilds, whether it's for a new champion or one you're already familiar with.  A friend of mine was in plat last season, and said he wants to get into diamond this season. He's now played over 1k games this season, and he's still in plat. All he does is grind and rely on his own knowledge to climb, so he rarely learns anything new. It's just an incredibly inefficient way to improve."
Destiny,3akt6f,FLABREZU,8,Mon Jun 22 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's true, but you also have to actually learn shit. If you don't know exactly what an item does, look it up between games. If you're not sure about a match up, look at some high elo guides.   This is 100%  correct and it's something I've horribly neglected to do. I've done it a  lot more playing top lane (because you kind of have to) than I ever did  playing ADC, and doing so made some champions  appear so much less  scarier than when they seem to just be  a walking box of CCing insta-death, ie: playing vs Ryze became much more  bearable after  understanding how non-threatening he is with only 1  stack up."
Destiny,3akt6f,NeoDestiny,2,Mon Jun 22 02:29:15 2015 UTC,I've always said you need to play while in Skype with someone who knows what their are talking about.  That way you can ask the questions you need to without relying on chat and without a delay.
Destiny,3akt6f,NaughtyGaymer,5,Tue Jun 23 14:06:02 2015 UTC,There is a difference between focusing on a few champions to learn the game and playing literally a four digit number of draven matches...
Destiny,3akt6f,SkttLes,2,Mon Jun 22 01:29:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. It gave you a lot of knowledge...about Draven. Not the entire game.
Destiny,3akt6f,i_love_Cheekzz,2,Mon Jun 22 02:11:55 2015 UTC,"One thing I notice when I watch master/challenger LoL streamers is that they all know how every champion works, down to the mechanics of each individual ability. They're good at judging how powerful a champion is based on what items they have and how far into the game it is. This is definitely a skill you don't have, even after the thousands of games you have played.   I think you would benefit from watching some YouTube videos/champion spotlights to learn how popular champions work. Or you could try playing one game with each champion (which would make for a really entertaining stream), though I doubt this is something you would be willing to do."
Destiny,3akt6f,Huffy778,2,Mon Jun 22 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"He either miscommunicated his thoughts or his thoughts on the topic were erroneously oversimplified by his misinformed mind. When you are starting to play a Moba you should play every hero in the game at least once to at least a few times (or more depending on how slow or fast of a learner you are). If there are time constraints or you are too lazy to play every champ multiple times, you should be reading about certain spells (their ranges, CDs, specific numbers, etc) in game and/or out of game while you are queuing. After you know what every hero does is when it is fortuitous to focus on a small number of champs to develop consistently precise mechanics and a deeper understanding of the pros, cons, and limits of certain champs in certain situations. Bruce Lee said ""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times,"" without revealing that this blanketing platitude does not acknowledge that Bruce Lee most likely knew all the pros, cons, and limitations of almost all of the 10,000 varied kicks.

Destiny,3akt6f,i_love_Cheekzz,6,Sun Jun 21 13:15:56 2015 UTC,A to Z champ streams were pretty popular two or so years ago. Seems like everyone was doing it to attract viewers at the time.

Could be  fun to watch him getting dumpstered for 90% of the games though, because despite what some people in chat seem to believe you dont know shit about a champion (combos, trading, matchups, positioning in fights, itembuilds depending on the game state....) unless you play at least ~100 games on it."

Destiny,3ajt5o,FancyBear1,5,Sat Jun 20 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"explain how the teamgame aspect of moba is somehow lesser in dota2?  literally the only way for that would be possible is if one good player can carry an entire team, and that will never happen consistently.  destiny could carry games by himself in silver, gold etc but once he hits a wall (diamond 5) where his skill level is equal to the opponents he is facing, the outcome of the game heavily relies on his team.  destiny isn't going to have any less problems with playing with a team in dota2 than he would in league, guaranteed"
Destiny,3ajt5o,robotlol,4,Sat Jun 20 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"When you get above 4k, the rythm of the game dictates that there isn't going to be a lot of miscommunication. People know their roles. It's just a matter of how you execute them. And I feel like your MMR closely relates to your skill level, so the people you're playing with pretty much have the same game knowledge as you. Also the voice communication option is nice. It's really easy to communicate when you don't have that tiny passive aggressive chat window in the bottom left corner.  And until 4.5k, 5k, it's just a matter of having basic concepts down (heroes, items) and mechanics. Which comes naturally with playing the game, just like starcraft 2.. And after you're done with the 'basics', it's smooth sailing. The game opens up like a flower.   Seems like what destiny is struggling in League is just minor variables. And that's what losing him the games in pubbies. Let's be real, he'll never become a pro. So to watch him play over and over again just to clean up minor flaws in his play is quite unsatisfying and frustrating to watch.   Also, irrelevant to this but just thought I could add. Destiny had a bit of a rant about 4k the other day. I'd equate it to low masters in SC2. It's ALL about mechanics. And when you get them down, it's like driving a bike. It feels REALLY good the way the game plays."
Destiny,3ajt5o,FancyBear1,2,Sat Jun 20 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"When you get above 4k, the rythm of the game dictates that there isn't going to be a lot of miscommunication. People know their roles. It's just a matter of how you execute them.   if this is true, then the team with the advantage would always win, no? then once destiny reaches mmr where he doesn't have an advantage over his opponents, he would again have to rely on his team to create advantages.   And I feel like your MMR closely relates to your skill level, so the people you're playing with pretty much have the same game knowledge as you.   same can be said for league, i can tell you 100% destiny doesn't have game knowledge that is above his skill level, he knows the general macro knowledge, but i see him missing kill opportunities often (lack of knowledge in limits of champion he is playing etc)   Also the voice communication option is nice.   this is true, but the opponent would also have voice communication so doens't make game any easier    And until 4.5k, 5k, it's just a matter of having basic concepts down (heroes, items) and mechanics.

The game opens up like a flower.   i don't know how much you are oversimplifying with this, but i really doubt this is the case. you said 4k = low masters in SC2, and you can get up to 5k by just having mechanics? then i presume it's really difficult to get those mechanics? you can get to challenger in league with just mechanics.    Seems like what destiny is struggling in League is just minor variables.   nope, destiny currently isn't good enough to win consistently at his rank."
Destiny,3ajt5o,robotlol,2,Sun Jun 21 00:00:53 2015 UTC,"I REALLY wish I had played LoL so I could compare the two properly. Even to know what is approximate MMR equivelant of diamond 3 or whatever destiny is at. Maybe someone who has could chime in and elaborate what about what I'm saying?  The reason why I said 4k is equivelant to low masters in SC2 is, because that's when you start to get your basic mechanics down. You can execute build orders properly and have a macro game that doesn't fall apart. Same goes for dota. Until you hit about 4k, your mechanics aren't even at an acceptable level. For example if I had gotten a rune in dota, I would get frustrated because I couldn't even use it properly. Not because I lacked game knowledge, but because I hadn't had the proper mechanics to back up the most basic of game features. Runes in this case. AT THIS level can you start to play the game as it's meant to be played.   Also I think Destiny didn't know what enemy heroes did twice in the past few days. Once volibear for sure. In dota all items and heroes are easily recognizable and learned. It's insanely basic, pre 4k shit.  Onto your advantage point. It's really not the same. Post 4k (threshold) Players will coordinate better in dota to take objectives and such. Because it makes sense to. THE GAME RYTHM and hero roles dictate this. From what I've seen, Destiny gets frustrated because his teammates don't posses certain game knowledge to position themselves, when to push, when to take other objectives like dragon or baron, when to rotate from lane to lane. This type of thing just isn't present in dota. I don't know how else to explain it, but it's just that simple I feel like.  The only way you could get realistically pissed if your teammate really did something stupid or get outplayed in a certain engagement. But NEVER something that couldn't happen to you. Dota's ranked MM is really accurate at judging your skill level."
Destiny,3ajt5o,FancyBear1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"Dota isn't as much of a forced team game as LoL  In dota you can win lanes 1v2 or even 1v3. In LoL that is pretty much impossible since if you catch someone out they will just flash.. And the EXP difference and spell potency is way different, you'll be like 1 level ahead in LoL but in dota you can be level 7 when they are level 3 unless they pull and deny exp very very well. We're talking like  6k/professional level players needed to completely deny exp, even then there as so many ways you can just leave and be useful as a solo player.   Sure it's still a team game but you can have WAY more impact as a solo player.  LoL is literally a forced meta forced team game, you can't win without your team cooperating unless you are absurdly far ahead.   Go spectate a top mmr dota game in the client, I bet one of them has slark/meepo/earth spirit who solo wins the game even if their team are absurdly worse than them. They can win their lanes even in bad situations, and jungle/gank if it goes bad. No heroes are like that in LoL"

Destiny,3ac4n4,grossknuckles,5,Thu Jun 18 22:12:22 2015 UTC,There's no need to peel a yukon gold potato. Wash it and you're good. In fact I'd argue that they're so small and difficult to hold on average that you're safer not even bothering to peel them.
Destiny,3ac4n4,Noobity,-1,Thu Jun 18 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"I never said you needed to.  The best way, just grate it, then wrap in in a paper towel, and juice the water out.  Then fry it. Destiny sat there, with a HUGE knife, and cut cut cut... then chopped chopped chop.   It was like watching a kid figuring out how to piss right.  Telling you, thousands of dollars in PC parts, thousands of dollars in people wanting him to build their PC... and he struggles to make hashbrowns... christ.  but whatever."

Destiny,3ac4n4,Dunebug6,2,Fri Jun 19 11:46:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the problem was that he wasn't using a peeler, I use a peeler when I do potatoes, the main thing was that he lost half of the potato just peeling it   Never really had a potato that beats a peeler either, not yet at least since I started at 13 :P"
Destiny,3ac4n4,volqfer_,4,Sat Jun 20 05:57:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the problem - as someone who grew up in a place where peelers weren't common, all my life I've pealed potatoes with tiny straight-blade kitchen knifes and I don't know, peelers seem to be less versatile than those, though I haven't used one. Did Destiny peal badly, or peal with giant/specialised knife?  And, uhm, fuck, did I miss a cooking stream?  Edit: Chat filled me it, it is terminal stage of brain cancer to peel and dice potatoes with a butcher's knife."
Destiny,3ac4n4,iblametv,6,Fri Jun 19 08:27:18 2015 UTC,"Steben was literally chopping the fucking skin off the potato. Literally chopping it off inch by inch. Like when you're cutting a carrot or whatever bit by bit. That's what he was doing to the skin. Holy fucking shit. You can peel potatoes like a human without tourettes even with a butcher's knife.

If you use it before R, you have a window of time before it's back up that can equal the end of the ult's duration. For example, if you have 40% CDR, that 12 seconds turns into 8 seconds, you use it 1 or 2 seconds before you ult, six second duration, and 1 second to immediately after it ends.  edit: Before you ask how you get 40% CDR on Trynd: Zephyr, Youmuu's, Blue buff.

Destiny,3a9rsq,FoxyMayhem,0,Mon Jun 22 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"Are you high? You didn't say ""after R"". You said ""before R"". In what way would your Q be wasted if you use it before you press the ult button?   You get all your rage back when you press R, so you don't waste any of your rage and instead convert it to health. You don't lose any healing, because your Ult actually gives you healing and you're making use of that heal before you ult so the effective health you have during the 0.5 second delay is available. Your Q is back up when your ult finishes because you can time it a moment before you ult and the moment after.   So your cooldown, healing, and rage, (all things involved in the ability) are always made use of and never wasted in any way.  Even if you've smoked yourself retarded, you should understand this, yes?"
Destiny,3a9rsq,FoxyMayhem,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need healing when you use ult, as you're unable to be reduced below 1.

Destiny,3a9rsq,FoxyMayhem,0,Mon Jun 22 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"It seems stupid to you because you can't think of more than two things at a time.  Ult, 0.5 second delay, die to an auto. Q is up.  or  Q, Ult, 0.5 second delay, don't die, get heal from Ult immediately after the 6 seconds expires. Heal on cooldown (1 to zero seconds after) for 400 health, and a net survivability of over 400 HP more than normal."

Destiny,3a7bgk,v1ct0r1us,8,Wed Jun 17 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand for a person as elitist as him why he doesn't play the objectively better game, dota. He stubbornly thinks he will have more viewers playing LoL."
Destiny,3a7bgk,Fatal510,2,Thu Jun 18 07:26:45 2015 UTC,yep it's ridiculous how he'll stick to flac music and buy the best equipment but plays league
Destiny,3a7bgk,Renouille,-4,Fri Jun 19 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah same. He's always been the guy who looks at the facts and makes his own logical decision, but it seems like ever since he started playing league, he's so consumed with understanding and improving at League that he doesn't take a step back and read up on dota just in the slightest. I used to play League back when Destiny played in the ranked 5s team. I moved shortly after and yes, it was hell, and yes I still played league often, and maybe every day, but If anyone asked me which was the better game, I always said dota. After about 300 hours, I finally got used to dota and was able to enjoyably play compared to the loop League put me and the way League forced me to think. Now i'm a free bird available to the wind and the sea."
Destiny,3a7bgk,k0ngzy,4,Thu Jun 18 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, this seems to be the thread with the biggest congregation of dotards, so I'll make a post here because the sheer amount of shit logic is rustling my jim jams.  First off, there is nothing wrong with enjoying DoTA2, there is nothing wrong with disliking LoL. On the flipside, anyone who throws a full-on temper tantrum because someone doesn't like DoTA2 or likes LoL is a child and a hypocrite. The ""You need to like what I like"" bullshit should end once puberty is rolling to a stop and hormones aren't dropping your IQ by 80 points anymore.  For all the people who hide behind the ""Well this is the objectively better game"" this has no relevance to enjoyment of a game. I can enjoy the shit out of My Little Pony Barbie Adventures and still recognize it as a objectively shit game. I can also recognize SC2 as an objectively great game and not enjoy the gameplay at all. Do you guys just sit there and play a well-reviewed game even though you don't like the genre at all and just tell yourself ""Well, this is an objectively good game, therefore I need to play this even if I don't enjoy it"".  For the people who think that DoTA2 won't have the exact same issues Destiny is having with LoL haven't been listening to a single word he has said on stream. He said he has a problem with team games. He said mobas can make him rage. He has said that his chat contributes a lot to rustling him in League (And do you really think DoTA2 is gonna be better in this respect? Look at how many people are throwing themselves to the floor crying and threatening Destiny with not coming to his stream because League over DoTA2).  The ""It's harder / more complicated / takes more skill"" argument makes no sense for anyone who is not in the top .01%. If you can't make it to the top .01% of league, then obviously you haven't hit the skill ceiling in that game. So why the fuck would you look for a more difficult game? ""Welp, I hit silver 5 in League, I think I've learned all this game has to offer, time to move on to DoTA2 so I can get 1000 mmr if I'm lucky"" This also assumes that difficulty = quality, which is ridiculous. Is Sonic '06 a masterpiece because the control scheme is retarded difficult? At what point does adding in random complexity for the sake of complexity become bad game design and not just ""Making things tougher""? This is not saying that DoTA2's complexities over league are bad design. I don't play the game, I can't make that judgment. I'm merely attacking the complete shit logic being used.  Then we'll move on to my favorite argument: ""DoTA 2 will totally be a better business decision Destiny"". With such gems as ""People have been waiting for an entertaining DoTA2 streamer, that's the only reason it has less views than League, and Destiny can attract a bunch of new viewers"". This is his livelihood guys, not just a side-job. He even has a family to support. To move to a new game he has never streamed before, start over from complete scratch, and expect a viewership to last more than a month. No, him streaming it for a month and ""seeing what happens"" is not a good basis to make a business decision. If his viewers fall off a ledge due to the hype wearing off that directly impacts revenue. ""Well, then why doesn't he just go back to league after that if it doesn't work?"" you might say. Well, probably because he just spent a month playing a game that doesn't interest a lot of League people, so he'll need to do a lot of rebuilding of the numbers he has collected from League. On top of that he'll have noticeable declined in how well he will play the game, because as much as people like to say ""DoTA2 is the harder game"" these skills don't translate to League because they play very differently. It's almost like they're incomparable in terms of skills necessary to succeed in.  Did I cover it all? Feel free to disagree with me, I enjoy debating when it actually involves people that know how to structure an argument."

People will still snipe and ghost him, and all of his gripes with League will just carry over to Dota.

Destiny,3a7bgk,Glasslake,0,Thu Jun 18 13:58:26 2015 UTC,"This is coming from a guy who has never played Dota, I can tell.   It will not be fun in the beginning.

All of these things exist in Dota."
Destiny,3a7bgk,Kregoth,-7,Thu Jun 18 21:14:00 2015 UTC,Name a streamer of Dota that has A SNIGLE FUCKING ISSUE that Destiny has.
Destiny,3a7bgk,k0ngzy,3,Thu Jun 18 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, are you actually implying that there are no retards or flamers or ragers playing Dota? Or are you implying that dota is somehow not a team based game and so Destiny will enjoy it more than League? Or that his viewers (many of which play dota and have the ability to snipe/ghost him  and will do it because it gets him so ragey) WONT do it simply because he is playing Dota?  This is such blatant fanboying I'm actually fucking shocked.  Also, Draskyl frequently complains about the players in his games, when I watched Barnyyy he got ghosted quite a bit and also frequently got upset at the players in his games, as do Blitz and Purge. (Purge less so) Obviously none of the streamers of Dota are going to have the issue of it being a Team based game because they enjoy that aspect of it, so it would not be an issue for them while it would remain an issue for Destiny.  Please go back to /r/dota2 or actually play the game instead of trying to evangelize and convert a streamer who has no fucking interest in the game."
Destiny,3a7bgk,Kregoth,-9,Thu Jun 18 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"No literally all I said dipshit was for you to go watch a Dota streamer for 1 hour and record how many times they have the same 'issues as destiny in a team game'  You responded with rage, so I assume that means I win. Have a great day.  EDIT: LMFAO Draskyl AND Barnyyy are about as irrelevant in Dota as Destiny is in League."
Destiny,3a7bgk,k0ngzy,3,Thu Jun 18 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"Right in my comment   Also, Draskyl frequently complains about the players in his games, when I watched Barnyyy he got ghosted quite a bit and also frequently got upset at the players in his games, as do Blitz and Purge.

AS SOMEONE WHO PLAYS DOTA AND WATCHES DOTA ACTIVELY -- I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME AN EXPERT. sing_sing never has issues with sniping and feeding and griefing BECAUSE HE'S GOOD AT THE GAME AND HIS MMR IS AT A PLACE THAT THE TROLLS CAN'T GET  Along with the fact that us Dota players actually care about the game and just because we're with a streamer we're not going to ease up, but instead try harder. Please stop fucking replying to me man. You've so fucking out of scope."
Destiny,3a7bgk,k0ngzy,4,Thu Jun 18 21:31:21 2015 UTC,"BECAUSE HE'S GOOD AT THE GAME AND HIS MMR IS AT A PLACE THAT THE TROLLS CAN'T GET   Yeah sure I agree with that. But Destiny won't be, not even close for many years if he ever switched. Challenger league streamers also don't usually get trolled or sniped/ghosted.  Barny and Draskyl are wayyy more relevant to Destiny than singx2 because he will be in their position. 1-2k viewers with low-medium MMR."
Destiny,3a7bgk,Kregoth,-4,Thu Jun 18 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"Point is, and we both agree with this, I hope.   League's infrastructure, game play, mechanics, client, and design is outdated and Destiny does not benefit in the long run by staying with a game that has scaling magic dmg, runes, masteries, and a guy who sits in the fog and comes out once every 3 minutes to walk through the river to ""gank""  EDIT: I forgot to mention the buffs in League and how everything gives one.  EDIT: sorry, i began rambling, point is that the negatives of League outshine the one 'positive' which is the player base."
Destiny,3a7bgk,k0ngzy,3,Thu Jun 18 21:44:48 2015 UTC,"Keep moving the goal posts bro. First it was name one streamer that has a single issue, I name several 1-2k+ viewer streamers that have several of the issues Destiny has (and are about in the position Destiny would be  in if he would ever play Dota so they are far more of an apt comparison than singx2 or Dendi) and apparently those don't meet your standards."

I have watched Destiny on stream since banelings were awful, (Always in case you're wondering)but I pray for the day I see him playing something else. Little does Destiny really understand that a great majority of his viewership comes because they like Destiny, not league, and when Destiny started to play league a lot, the viewership slowly got tired of having to watch a simulated Adobe Air client coded by money greedy shitters League players like to call devs. Everything is wrong with league and the fallacy that he has to stay with it because it's what he's played for the majority is outrageous and frankly against everything I view destiny as. I pray for the day that I can see Destiny actually enjoy a game again and I think Dota would be the perfect game for him.  Every complaint I have ever heard from the stream in regards to the game has been, ""Well fuck I get bodied by [insert hero], that's game."" or, ""Holy shit he's sitting bot lane""  These terms are so astronomically inferior in terms of strategy and complexity compared to what Dota 2 offers in the long run. At this point, Destiny is just grinding a game that surely deserves to be brought out back and shot for the amount of people it has infected.

Heres a huge list of what they should do instead of adding more than 3 skins every single patch. - New launcher / Client / proper tooltips ( and fix that firewall popup ffs) - A REPLAY SYSTEM.. GOD (replay.gg is fine but it feels like all these websites are doing riot's work instead of rioters themselves ) -Fixing Hitboxes and bugged casting range ( all these thresh grabs that were nowhere near my damn hitbox ) -See your Ping before playing ( its annoying af to do a custom game every time i login ) - Every single champion unlocked in ARAM - Rune price reduction - REWORKS. GODDAMN REWORKS THAT SHOULDVE HAPPENED LONG AGO - Make Players able to code / make custom gamemodes - a circle that moves during the Loading Screen so that i know the game crashed. - due to all these trolls in champ select and all.. make teambuilder default for ranked you search for a Role after role after role and when its 5 you queue. then its 3 bans each and you know the rest. - A mini-game that is easy to load and is simply for Last hit practice. or to test a skin / new champ kit or rework. - a HUD update ( not the one on the PBE tho.. it sucks. ) - Death recap fix ( so many bugs and false icons in it aswell as unreliable damage record ) - stop implementing pointless things ( champion mastery is cosmetic indeed but it does encourage that 'you should fear your opponent since he's a master at [champion]') - Chroma packs only for original skin. - Icons for RP only? if i would purchase RP its either for Runepages/Skins , the rest i just buy with IP. and iam pretty sure alot of people feel that Summoner Icons for RP is a dumb thing. - Profile Banners based on your icon IF you buy the icon with RP ( which makes people actually want to buy it for RP while who can't get RP will just buy the icon alone ) - Ward skins changing in Champ select - make it so we can see if its a normal game or ranked game in champ select because some trolls dodge after they say oops i meant to play a normal draft - When releasing a champion for god's sake.. please make sure all bugs are fixed and balanced it. that dosen't mean nerf him to shit. it means Make his scalings reasonable and it doesn't matter if you change an ability or two that can cause alot of problems. ( Ekko's Ult is totally not Dota's weaver's ult but more OP ) - Recommended items and items in general. ( Brutalizer on champs that no longer even need it since the Black cleaver rework) and why not make new items? and by new items i don't mean Jungle Items that get reworked every single season.. and not ZZ'rot that is fucking stupid. i mean any items , consumables too. - Listen to the community. it's been years now and most of the community..we can all agree on something , then riot does the exact opposite.. iam talking about nerfs/buffs/tweaks. - How is the community supposed to give feedback and ideas when all the mods (Reddit) do is remove anything criticizing Riot? What a joke. - Just because someone is trying to say his opinion and that rioters and redditors get offended simply because they said the right thing doesn't mean they are trolls or that they should get banned. reasonable reddit thread should be listened to than simply removed. - We get it. it's a free game for everyone and all that which means that they owe us nothing. but come to think of it.. yeah they don't owe us anything. and we certaintly should be appreciative. but that doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize anything that is wrong with the game. i hope rioters and redditors read this and accept that they are doing a 'few' things wrong."

He keeps bringing up this argument that it's a problem with team games and it saddens me. To improve at dota is such a rewarding and progressive experience. I'm 100% sure destiny could easily get 4.5k in a month if he tried. It sucks to see him play CSGO for weeks and not make much progress. But Dota is like SC2. Much of it is in mechanics.   I don't even know why I keep turning on his stream. LoL is such a shit game holy fuck.  Also I'm sure he would do great streaming dota. I watch dota streams all the time and it definitely could use more english speaking streams. Even if he's not the best.

Tired af and looking worn out. I end up no watching stream. It's boring.

At least top it's 1v1. I genuinely think he'll have a much less frustrating time once he's got some more games under his belt up there.  He switches to dota and it'll be those tryndamere games every single game until he gets used to Dota and I would put money on that taking far longer than him getting used to a single champ/playstyle in lol.

You have to pay gold to be able to teleport (""back"")""   An inconsequential amount of gold which ports you to your lane in a few seconds. VS what in League? Unless you have the Teleport summoner skill you HAVE to walk back to the lane, and even in the Meta it's viable on a few top laners. What about buyback? We can't discuss the depth of strategy that brings to the table I guess, so let's not even talk about it.    In DOTA2, mana is so restricted there are some champions that can use one spell every five minutes or so in the early game. Have fun with that.   Yes, you literally cannot cast spells for 5 minutes. Thanks for the insight Riot.    ""DOTA2 is pedantic about last hitting. If you're not animation cancelling, you're going to have TERRIBLE CS. Last hitting on every single champion is radically different due to radically different missile speeds, swing animation speeds, etc.""    This is the most popular complaint. You forget a movement kit it takes you a few minutes in game to get used to it again. It's really not that big of a deal unless you're JUST learning the game. This is the one of the main reasons why Melee ADC's are not that amazing...you can kite them infinitely. The pros never get discussed for this, kind of disappointing really."

Destiny,39yt5j,Ubley,20,Tue Jun 16 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly, DOTA fucking loves the Dank Memers eg Bulldong and the like. He'd fit right in and honestly Dota is just a much higher skillcap game which I'd enjoy watching him more, but I'mhappier he's playing Doner etc since.  The least he could do is give it a trial period like a couple of weeks/ a month to see how financially viable it is as opposed to just saying it isn't viable at all. IIRC his Dota 2 games were pretty high viewership"
Destiny,39yt5j,Crux309,6,Tue Jun 16 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"You're completely right, not just bulldog , singsing and rtz  and many more, he is maybe many times more entertaining than what they try to be and with a little boost from the community can really take off. the community already likes him."
Destiny,39yt5j,Ubley,5,Wed Jun 17 02:17:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, toxicity likes Destiny's (Toxicity term being used for his antics) is fully appreciated in Dota as opposed to LoL where the community is trying to be the least toxic as possible and telling someone they're bad is apparently an ordeal. On top of that I think he'd enjoy the game more once he got into it."
Destiny,39yt5j,LifeOrb,-21,Wed Jun 17 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"Dota has a higher skill floor, not a higher skillcap. Every other ability in dota is a passive, meanwhile League is filled with skill shots."
Destiny,39yt5j,TheBullshitPatrol,12,Tue Jun 16 08:00:33 2015 UTC,>higher skill floor  good luck csing buddy :^]
Destiny,39yt5j,ShittingDickNipple,10,Tue Jun 16 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Dota has far more active items than LoL. Your claim that "" Every other ability in dota is a passive"" is just ridiculous. Most heroes have one passive at most (of course there are exceptions, but mostly farming hard carries like spectre or faceless void).  Positioning is far more important since you can't just flash out mid combat (your Blink Dagger goes on cooldown whenever you take damage). There are SO MANY champions with inbuilt espace skills because for some reason Riot seems to think that if you are caught off-guard you should always have a chance to get away.  Skills shots aren't really skill shots when you can spam them every 5 seconds and it doesn't matter if you miss one or two. Compare that to, for example, Mirana in dota: She has a 17 second skillshot stun that moves slowly and is generally easy to avoid. If you position yourself correctly though so that the enemy can't see you or your skillshot the payoff is usually huge.  You have denying which adds a whole other layer of control to the laning phase.  The biggest thing however is that you don't have to stick to the Riot dictated meta and can be ACTUALLY inventive and try new things."
Destiny,39yt5j,Kubelecer,8,Tue Jun 16 08:43:26 2015 UTC,skill shots     more like spamshots
Destiny,39yt5j,Reptarisgreen,6,Tue Jun 16 10:53:57 2015 UTC,Have you even played dota? Is this the go to for dire hard league fans?
Destiny,39yt5j,123Legogals,-27,Tue Jun 16 09:01:40 2015 UTC,"Can you honestly explain how a game with outrageous disables, no flash, laggy gameplay and turnrates has more skillcap than league?  There is litelarlly no counterplay to spells like BlackHole or The Doom."
Destiny,39yt5j,Ubley,19,Tue Jun 16 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"Denying, Far more complex and interesting skills, an absolutely astonishing amount of activatable items, much faster gameplay, the game relies on your skill as a player as opposed to snowball (Comebacks much more likely than league)  Counterplay to Blackhole? Don't clump up/BKB GG Enigma just blew his gamechanging ult on a single person.  DOOM, disengage and have your team play around the doom then re-engage when the CD is gone.    There is litelarlly no counterplay to spells like BlackHole or The Doom.   If there were true then they would be 100% pick/ban in pro games but as it is they aren't  Turnrates are good for the game, it balances Melee/ Ranged heroes so that there isn't a huge disparity in comp play like there is in LoL. A hero like Garen or Mordekaiser or even Poppy(A hero I always wanted to play but y'know, laning is impossible so what's the point) might actually be viable due to not getting kited 24/7 also Items like Stout Shield further reduce the disparity between Ranged and Melee.  Last hitting is harder in Dota since your attacks do like 1/20th of the damage to a creep whereas in League creeps have less health so it's easier to LH. Denying isn't a huge part of the game, but it's a part of it which increases skillcap considering denied creeps give 50% xp, so it's pretty useful to get the 1 up on a lane opponent.  No Flash? That isn't a problem since many heroes have a form of mobility and even so, Flash slows down the game.  Outrageous disables are generally the ones that are easy to fuck up/counter. But that's Dota's way of balancing, OP vs OP cancelling out and honestly, I find it far more fun that the 3/4 years I spent on league. Gameplay isn't laggy, it's just that the backswing/casttime on spells is once again, there to balance.  In Dota every single hero is viable pretty much. Only 5 heroes weren't picked in the TI5 qualifiers out of 110. That's far more diversity than you'll ever find in League."

Ketosis is a direct side effect of your body burning fat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis  Essentially When your body burns fat for energy it produces ketone bodies as waste.

Both methods work, Low Carb is just easier for some people.  Sorry for the trolls meng, but don't just dismiss the low carb diet because of them.  *edit: formatting"

I do think that this was incredible for Bethesda's first conference though, and tomorrow its gonna be hard to beat, but thats only because I dont really care about the other companies.

Destiny,39u2hr,maxxramman,0,Mon Jun 15 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"It’s very idealistic to say Capitalism is “alienating” and that we could do better by “perfecting” society so nobody has to be alienated. Let’s take a closer look at these so-called alienations.  Karl Marx believed that the first form of alienation is alienation from property. For Karl Marx, people are alienated “legally” from property. The average person doesn’t legally own the property they are working on, so they are legally alienated from the property. For example, a fast food restaurant worker doesn’t own the hamburgers that he or she is creating. In addition, the average person doesn’t look at their product as something to identify with, so they are also psychologically alienated from property. What Karl Marx didn’t take into account was that Capitalism values property rights. Somebody owns those hamburgers and somebody has a psychological investment in their own creation, that’s why they would hire people to help them with their investment. Also, everybody owns their own property anyway. People may not always own what they are working on in their job, but they do have their own property. People value their cars, their white fences and their houses. To say that everybody is alienated from property legally and psychologically is preposterous. If all people were living in a commune, like Marx wants, you would be even more alienated legally and psychologically from property because you wouldn’t legally own any property. All property would be completely alienated legally and psychologically in a commune, not under Capitalism.  The second form of alienation is the alienation from labor. Marx believed that under typical capitalist means of production, labor is treated as chopped up meaningless units that can be sold. As a result, Marx believed, people don’t have any psychological attachment with the labor that they are doing. While it is true that most people are working for the weekend, this is necessary process for a working and functioning society. There are always going to be jobs that people wouldn’t want to do if they were given a simple choice. However, it is a universal law of labor that there are people who want to work hard to get an easy job where they can sit around and “think” about things all day and there are other people who want to keep the status quo and float by so they can work for the weekend monotonously. As a result, anybody who wants to work hard can eventually land an easy job where they can sit around and “think” because there will always be enough spots due to the fact that there will always inevitably be those who are content and don’t want to work hard. Capitalism is free in that regard, because you always have a choice in where you end up and it just so happens that the choice many individuals chose is the choice not to work hard and have a future where they will be “alienated” from their labor. Just as long as there will always be people who have the freedom to make their own decisions; there are those who will be “alienated” from their labor and there will also be those who worked hard and have a deep emotional investment in their labor.  Marx’s third form of alienation was that Capitalism alienates your “species-being.” He presented the premise that people ought to be social and theoretically self-aware. The different between humans and other species is that humans have the capability to be “theoretically self-aware.” Marx suggested that since laborers are not actively thinking about their part in the Capitalist system, you are alienating your species-being. However, this just happens to be a general tendency because under Capitalism you are completely free to actualize your species-being if you want. To Marx, in “Communism” somehow you will be “free” to do whatever you want so you can concentrate on your species-being. Marx failed to demonstrate a working Communist society in which this is possible. Regardless of the type of society you live in, Communist or Capitalist, somebody has to work in order for products to get made. If people dedicate their lives to their “species-being,” then nobody will be working; conversely, if people work, then people won’t be able to spend as much time on their “species-being.” Somebody has to work, even in Communism, and if working means no species-being, then even Communism wouldn’t fix this “alienation.”  Marx’s fourth form of alienation is the alienation between owners of capital and everyone else. Marx fails to consider the intricacies of Capitalism once again. Capital owners need to interact with people in order to sell products. There is always going to be a consumer/business relationship because businesses are competing to win over consumers. Consumers have the power not to buy, so capital owners have a monetary incentive to interact with them.  Karl Marx proposed four alienation that weren’t aren’t real problems, but even if we do accept them as real problems, Karl Marx hasn’t provided any way to solve these “alienations” and how Communism is actually supposed to technically work. We can imagine how the ideal Capitalist society could work but that is not the same for Communism. It is great to think we can idealize and perfect the world by letting everybody get by without having to do any work, but a working system like that is unimaginable. Under Communism, there are questions that are not being answered, such as: how would businesses start up if we removed the monetary incentive? It’s without a doubt that society would degenerate to the olden days of communes with little to no advancements. Communism is riddled with flaws and we should try to distance ourselves from it as much as possible."

Yes, but that somebody is NOT the person making them. It's the guy who owns McDonalds.   to say that everybody is alienated from property is ridiculous   that might be ridiculous if anybody were actually saying it. marx's first type of alienation is the alienation of the worker from his work. he is not alienated from ""property,"" in a vague sense, as you said, but rather from the product of his own labor. (either you haven't read in a while or you're being disingenuous)  this is hugely important and makes your entire first paragraph completely meaningless.   While it is true that most people are working for the weekend, this is necessary process for a working and functioning society.   you fail to illustrate why that premise is true.    Capitalism is free in that regard, because you always have a choice in where you end up and it just so happens that the choice many individuals chose is the choice not to work hard and have a future where they will be “alienated” from their labor.    i don't understand what you're saying. alienation from labor is NOT the same thing as ""thinky jobs.""   to be honest, i'm not the person you should be arguing against, i read the manifesto once for a college course, but it's pretty clear to me you don't understand it very well. i'm not one of those people who would vouch for socialism as defined by marx every time above all else, but i certainly can't vouch for capitalism either.  more importantly, this isn't the argument i thought we'd be having. i don't disagree that marx's theory of alienation could be wrong (it certainly could be,) i disagree that it is ambiguous. you said ""these things are ambiguous"" and then went on very clearly to outline each aspect. you did so incorrectly, but, how could they be ambiguous if you articulated them?"

One alternative we have is to degenerate to a less-efficient form of social production such as communes, slavery or feudalism. Marx offered no working and fully planned alternative that is more efficient than Capitalism. He said that there could be a possibility that one exists. Then he just simply said, ""here is how people are alienated under Capitalist production and alienations are bad... for some reason... so we should try to figure out a spooky ambiguous system that is more efficient than Capitalism that produces more products without the alienations that are bad for some ambigious reason.""  It would be irrational to accept communes, slavery and feudalism as working functioning societies because they are inferior to what we have. The only alternative is Capitalism. You would be irrational to accept anything other than Capitalism because there is no other working and fully planned out form of social production that is more efficient. Working for the weekend is a by-product of Capitalism. So, working for the weekend is a necessary process for a working and functioning society."

But then you make the definition of Communism and Socialism absolute; where it is only socialism or communism when you have complete ownership by all people/workers. You therefore allow yourself to hold your beliefs about communism to be eternally true because in your view 'it works perfectly in your mind' and simultaneously you can brush off any criticisms about your beliefs because 'it just wasn't right'.   Was there ever a true Communist country ever?   Has there ever been a true capitalist society ever?   Some consider hunter-gatherer tribes to be practicing ""Primitive Communism""   Calling hunter-gatherers 'communist' is a misrepresentation of what communism is aiming to achieve; in the same way that calling a neighbourhood watch a 'communist society' is a misrepresentation of how a neighbourhood watch functions and what it is aiming to achieve. In both cases you do not have a situation where everyone is working to give the most benefit to their common man; but instead a situation where helping your common man will have a much more positive outcome for you than if you didn't."

It isn't the United Neo-Keynesian Welfare States of America. It's labelled that because of the institutions that it has (Obamacare, regulatory bodies, Federal reserve etc..) and the mainstream policies it advocates regardless of the motivations. What laws it has also comes into consideration.  There is absolutely nothing, empirically, about the DPRK that screams 'democratic'."

The stream is a lot more entertaining for that simple reason. Don't get me wrong, on his ""good days"" while playing league, he can be entertaining sometimes with his commentary and dank memes, on his ""bad days"" he activates autismo drive and does silent rustle streams for hours on end, with the occasional out burst of !  Lets be real now, he gets Diamond 1, or whatver the rank above that is, Master V, is the stream suddenly gonna sky rocket in views? Doubt it, a marginal gain perhaps, but not some magical 5k a day stream number. More and more twitch users are looking for entertaining broadcasters rather than skilled players, unless they are actual professional contracted players. It just so happens that his CSGO streams were entertaining as fuck, I missed out on his Dota 2 streams but again, the voice chat with random pubs is always huge entertainment potential with Destiny.  This last part is pure speculation but I have a sneaking suspicion the majority of league viewers are strictly only league viewers. I don't buy Destiny's reasoning when he says league is a better longer term stream game, as far as the followers acquired are concerned, other popular games are as equally viable. Honestly though, I miss those dank Nathanias + Destiny CSGO streams."

Destiny,39pl5n,crazyeight1337,6,Mon Jun 15 17:47:27 2015 UTC,I think destiny would play dota 2 differently. Because he would be learning heroes and mechanics not grinding games for diamond 1. He would be bad but I think its more enjoyable watching someone learn than climb ladder.

I find destiny the most entertaining when he's just talking about topics or arguing with somebody because it's fun to listen to and I almost always learn something.  When he plays league it's funny because of his DANKMEMES commentary, not because of the gameplay.  I do think a higher tier of legoland would attract some new viewers though if that is why destiny continues to play and keeps playing this shit game, because it probably will bring in a marginal increase in viewers, not sure if they would stay after checking it out, but I would assume he'll get more traffic."
Destiny,39pl5n,kmbcpu,24,Sat Jun 13 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"It's not like Dota 2 is going to die so I never understood why he wanted to move to the LoL community.

Dota players have a much thicker skin and a sense of humor very akin to Destiny, unlike the ""MUH TOXIC COMMUNITY HE'S SUCH A MEANIE BOYCOTT HIM ENJOY THE TRIBUNAL BAN :^)"" attitude league players have. I hate to meme it like it is but when he was failing in LoL back in the day, it wasn't because he was bad at it or because some pro players stole his thunder or the 'Own3d viewership crash' excuse; it was because the LoL community doesn't like Destiny."
Destiny,39pl5n,Chrono68,7,Sat Jun 13 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure about 1200 of his current 1500 viewers would watch him stream literally fucking anything and still be there for the person not the game.  He was never really going to get many more viewers by  swapping to LoL because his site is fucking him for growth. It's obvious why he's done it, but when some random guy opens his twitch channel it's basically empty. Nobody is chatting..even though it has gone from NOBODY chatting to a select few... the person then has to figure out where the people are or what's going on.  Keep in mind the average person doesn't give a shit and will just close it before even realizing there's a chat on his website, which isn't advertised on his twitch right now. There's nothing on his twitch describing where the chat is or what his website is for. I think the bot says something like join our chat at destiny.gg but by the time that bot comes around to saying that the average user will be long gone.   He reminds me a lot of Purge the dota streamer, he'd always get mad when the chat moved too quickly or had spam or people being typical twitch users. If someone says something like ""omg fuckin noob use X"" Purge would ban them, Destiny does the same. Differences are that Destiny's community is mostly trolls who would type this kind of stuff on purpose and Purge's  community is mostly noobs at the game looking to get better from someone who makes guides for noobs.  I dunno, maybe he wants to have a sekrit club  and he's happy with his steady and loyal viewership, no matter what game he plays the sekrit club will probably remain and alienate anyone new looking to communicate or join in with a stream.  Can't complain if it's working I guess"

I then went on the forums ready to shitpost when I saw another post about someone being unable to open the in-game shop, guess what the fix was. disabling the offline-mode on windows internet explorer (FUCKING WHAT).

Destiny,39pl5n,4114Fishy,2,Sun Jun 14 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"Even though I can only speak for myself, I would love this. Destiny would have a much more versatile time on Dota for a plethora of reasons, and many of them have been mentioned here:     the voice chat with random pubs is always huge entertainment potential with Destiny.          I don't buy Destiny's reasoning when he says league is a better longer term stream game, as far as the followers acquired are concerned, other popular games are as equally viable.

These points are great, and I can't help but feel that Destiny would find it easier to get viewers while playing Dota. The community is much more lighthearted than the LoL community, and he can really use his unique personality to great excess with the voice chat communications.    If he does switch, I feel it should be after the new beta Reborn comes out for Dota. Aside from the obvious engine and UI updates, the new tools and modes implemented that will assist him in learning the game will make the whole experience much easier to take in. Destiny should feel comfortable learning a new game, and with the new learning and sandbox modes added I feel that it is more possible than ever.    The next point I'd like to highlight is gamemodes. This is almost  speculation, which I'm jaunting through in this comment because of the impressive posts made on the /r/DotA2 subreddit, but I think it's fairly important to bring up. Unlike LoL, Dota 2's new custom game implementation will add a new way for people to relax after a stressful match. This is important because it proves to be a conduit by which Destiny can relax through, if for nothing else than to host sub games (which I recall being a thing back in the sub Sc2 days).     I'd pay anything to see Destiny compete to get into Root's Dota squad, which doesn't seem so unlikely given their... spotty performance, to put it nicely.    Lastly, I think duo queuing with Kyle seals the deal."

Destiny,39pl5n,brollebol,2,Sun Jun 14 18:52:37 2015 UTC,Would it be possible for sc2 to be made/run in this engine/framework? (Ignoring practical/business  issues).  I assume it would run better than the current engine right?
Destiny,39pl5n,damcho,3,Sat Jun 13 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"It would, and it would run better, but not always. In generic case the difference would not be noticeable, however in low-end configurations Source extremely good so I'd expect it better and in high-end configurations Source engine certainly performs better, since it is multi-threaded. Another perk, not affecting majority, is that it'd also work for Linux.  And this is me talking about the old engine, the one Dota 2 is being updated from to a significantly improved one.  Technically it is possible, and it would bring various technical and quality of life improvements for the players, but I am not sure how the things would change for modders, map makers and developers.  From business standpoint, as you realise yourself, not in a million years is this happening."

Destiny,39ai4l,wolfentity,47,Wed Jun 10 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"Steven makes reference to poor purchases that build up and cost the typical consumer more than if they had simply waited to buy these items with cash, however Steven fails to substantiate poor purchases in this claim when he lists things like a new washer and dryer or clothes.   If you need to finance to purchase clothes, you can wait to buy the clothes. Why reduce your overall spending ability by purchasing clothes now and paying interest on it in the future? For washer/dryer, that's a different issue which we'll get into..   These are people who are earning a solid salary, albeit not-too-impressive. Their resumes are not a mile long, and they are just moving out into the world. As it turns out, this is the majority of workers and credit card holders around the world.   Sources for anything..? Okay, let me research...   Households in which a member lacked health insurance in the three years before March 2012 were 20 percent more likely to carry credit card debt than households where no one had been uninsured. Those in which someone had been unemployed for two months or more in the three years before March 2012 were 14 percent more likely to carry credit card debt than households where no one was unemployed. Those without credit card debt reported having savings nearly three times greater than average households with credit card debt. Homeowners with negative equity were 24 percent more likely to carry credit card debt than those without negative equity in their homes.   Do these people sound like responsible credit card users who are making their way out into the world?  Oh, and my favorite one of all?   Respondents with a college degree were 22 percent less likely to carry credit card debt than high school graduates.   This seems to stand in contradiction to what you said, though the source is admittedly shakey, I'd be surprised to see where you get your numbers.   So if you can't afford a washer and dryer now, why buy one with money you don't have? Let's see, you can either have dirty clothes and lose your job, or spend an hour of your life walking back and forth, every week, at the cost of five bucks from your wallet in quarters to use public machines just to rinse your work clothes -- or you could invest in your future and buy a new washing machine that your standard, broke-ass couldn't afford because you didn't hit it randomly rich on the internet as a teenager.   There is so much that you don't understand about this example that it's actually frightening that you would post this. Here are two predictions:  1) You have never, ever been truly poor in your life, ever.  2) You have never lived paycheck to paycheck.  3) You don't understand basic budgeting principles.  We're going to use your example, okay?    John makes $2,500 a month in income. After basic living expenses (rent/utilities, cell phone, food, gas for commuting, essential clothes) he is left with about $50/month in ""fun"" money. As you described, in your own example, he is living ""paycheck to paycheck"".  Let's say John wants to purchase a new washer/dryer. Using this website to figure average prices, we'll say John skimps out and gets a very, very cheap washer/dryer combo at $700 for both. I verified on Nebraska Furniture Mart's website that such a set could be purchased, although these will be the cheapest possible washer/dryer combo you can get. But we'll ignore the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness, although any poor person that's had to buy shitty products KNOWS this phenomenon is VERY real.  Since, according to your example, John needs the washer/dryer now, he will be forced to finance it on, as you suggest, a credit card.  The average credit card interest rate is 15.07%, and we'll assume John has ""average"" credit. We'll plug in $650 financed at 15.07% into a loan calculator and now we see that John's payments, should he pay off the debt in 1 year, are $58.69/month.  This already puts John over his extra monthly allowance.  Let's say he finances it for 18 months. That brings his monthly payments down to $40.57/month, with a total of $80.29, or 10.99% of his original loan amount, being ""lost"" to interest.  So what does this mean? Well, a few things.   John's finances are going to be even tighter than they were before, assuming he can even afford this financing in the first place. If ANY kind of extra ""issue"" comes up (broken cell phone, traffic ticket, car problems, medical problems, house necessities that aren't budgeted for, or any other kind of emergencies), John either has to A) take out MORE money at a 15.07% revolving credit account, or B) lapse on his payments for his washer/dryer, acquiring late fees and accumulating more interest, pushing the cost of that financing up even higher. If John has ANY kind of scaling back on his income (job cuts hours, he gets sick and misses work without FMLA benefits, or at worst gets laid off) he is going to be in huge trouble of missing his CC payments. If ANY of John's other bills increase (if his phone bill goes up at contract end, if he renews his lease to a 3-5% increase in rent, if he gets in a car accident and his insurance rates rise, or if his credit takes a hit for any other reason and it affects the interest on his credit cards), he is going to have to ""choose"" which bills to pay.   Are you starting to see the problem now with financing purchases like this when you live life paycheck to paycheck? Precariously perching your entire life in such a way that if ONE thing fails you will fall into financial ruin is not wise. Credit only contributes to this.    The reason why I can tell from your post that you've never been poor before is because you don't understand how absolutely devastating ""one time"" expenses can be. I do. Poor people do. Because for poor people, a one time expense can be a life-shattering thing that destroys your finances for the next 12 months.  For me, now, if I go out and get a speeding ticket for $150, it's an inconvenience. I'll joke about going to court and fighting it on stream and I'll brush it off as a minor annoyance. Eventually, I'll pay it, and it'll simply be another ledger in my bank account that I forget about immediately.  For a poor person? Well, that $150 traffic ticket represents multiple weeks, sometimes months, of your ""leftover"" income after paying bills at the end of the month, assuming you even have left-over income. Now you have to make a decision on whether or not you need to finance it, whether or not you go to court and beg for continuances until you can afford the fine, or whether you try to borrow money from family or friends and pay them back ""slowly"" and feel like a piece of shit the entire time.  The thing is, for well off people, ""little emergencies"" aren't emergencies at all. But for poor people, these things are catastrophes.   Accidentally watched Netflex on your phone off of Wifi? $30 charge that's ""no big deal"" is a big deal to someone who's broke. $30 is pounds of meat beef from the store. Getting monthly maintenance done on your car is important. That's a no-brainer, right? Well, many people don't really ""budget in"" things like oil changes or timing belts and break pads and fuel filters when they create their budget. A $800 timing belt/water pump replacement is not something one can easily afford living paycheck to paycheck. What would John do if he needed that repair done? Finance that, too? He's already barely affording what he has. And waiting to maintain your car often leads to catastrophic financial impact. Kicked or stepped in something nasty that fucked up your shoes? If you have a nice pair, it's annoying, and if you really want, you can just get a new pair of shoes. If you're poor, saving up for new shoes can be a huge expense. It's easier to buy a cheap pair of shoes, but they degrade and go to shit faster. Medical expense? For poor people, medical expenses are disastrous. Medical expenses account for over 60% of bankruptcies in the United States.   One thing you realize  when you're poor is that these ""little emergencies"" always seem to pop up, and while you feel unlucky, the reality is that these little inconveniences happen in life all the time, but they only adversely affect people who live paycheck to paycheck. People who are better off simply eat the cost and go on with their lives."
Destiny,39ai4l,NeoDestiny,31,Thu Jun 11 03:56:32 2015 UTC,"If you earn a salary, you have a pay day. It doesn't just flood in from donations for sitting around in an office. It comes on the 25th, a month after you do your damn work.   I know this is a personal dig at me for no reason, but most people get paid bi-weekly. I get paid on a net45 basis, meaning I get paid for my work sometimes up to 2 months after the last day of the month I already worked it. But moving on, because a personal shot at me isn't really helping your point at all.   Wouldn't it be fucking wonderful if there were some kind of magical money card that would give you the availability of cash-on-hand to handle minor inconveniences that you are most-certainly good for?   So your second example is going to be someone who takes out a CC expense for two days to pay for a water bill with a raise immediately around the corner? Do you think that the average household (in debt) in excess of $15,000 in credit card debt is using all of that money to pay for a water bill so they can immediately pay it off in two days?   By the way, the credit card companies don't just sit on the money. They invest it back into the economy in the form of bigger loans that fund projects and companies. That's how they actually get the majority of their money.   Any source for that, or just some more conjecture from someone with a poor understanding of basic finance and how people should budget their money?   tl/dr; The title. Want to learn about something? Learn how to read.   It's amazing how condescending your tone is in your entire post when it is painfully obvious that you have never, ever experienced significant financial trouble in your life.

Destiny,39ai4l,Guillaume_Langis,2,Thu Jun 11 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"I do see a few flaws. I personally like to keep my savings/cash for emergency services (mechanic, plumber ect.) When my wife and I need to buy clothes, we usually use an outlets credit card (jcp, macy, ect), its usually lower interest. We sometimes need the credit card at the end of the month for 50-100$ just because something popped up in the month we didn't expect. In that situation we pay the credit card down along with rent. If we have to eat canned food for 2 weeks so be it, we will always end up ahead because of a decent budget. In the meantime, using the credit card really has brought our credit score up. We both had none for a long time, and we were able to get a good rate on our first mortage (3.5%) because of using it for semi frivolous things. There were a few times where the card's balance got a bit out of hand, sometimes unavoidably. In that case you have to set aside any extra income just for it (bonuses, tax return, birthday money from grandma).   tl;dr credit isn't black and white"
Destiny,39ai4l,Raishiwi,-4,Thu Jun 11 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"It's not a personal dig at you without reason. You got your money in a way that is unattainable for most people at that age. You say that most people get paid bi-weekly, but you're not taking into account that payments tend to lag behind for all work. Donations, on the other hand, are direct to paypal, as far as I'm aware.  You're wrong or strawmanning the second point. There's no raise, it's payday. The money comes in once a month, as I mentioned in the sentence before. The average household is approaching 7,000 in debt, if you consider the wealthiest portion of the population, who float debt constantly as a means of currency, because they understand the value and potential of it -- not because they can't afford to pay it off.  You're also looking at the wrong numbers in your own links. It says ""Average credit card debt per indebted household:   $15,257"".  The next line above that says: ""average credit card debt per household: $7,117""  Do you think the every low-wage worker is suddenly in thousand dollars of debt and putting everything they own on a credit card without paying it? Do you think that just because some people don't know how to manage credit, that no-one can ever do it?  I'm not even going to respond to your baseless aggression. I already answered how wrong you are in your assumption, and I don't need to go into detail posting a bunch of source articles when your own sources counter your information."
Destiny,39ai4l,fenicx,-3,Thu Jun 11 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck that's a massive post to take on. Unfortunately for both of us (because I don't want to tackle every single thing), you are wrong on several points.  So let's just get into the core of it: you have to keep your topic and core assertion straight. I don't know if there was a stream I missed, while I was at work where you ranted and came up with a new way to look at this, but anyone can look at the VoD from a day ago and see you repeating the same core message: ""Credit cards have NO value. The companies suck money out of the economy without contributing a single thing.""  Not only did you say this word for word once, but over and over from the start of the conversation to the end of it. This is the point that I'm arguing, and not for a battle of semantics like ""oh, if it's even just a little bit useful"". We're talking a typical use case. When I say typical, mind you, I don't mean average mean. I mean average median and mode. It's a huge difference that you should really take into account, because the wealthiest 2% of households are disproportionately tilting the balance of your figures, which can be read about in your own sources.  So speaking to that, using the example you replied to: John buys a washer for $300. (Why am I using $300 instead of your weird washer/dryer combo thing? Because I personally bought a washer for $300 not two years ago. Your tirade on how I must never have been poor made you overlook the possibility that this example is something I lived through.) You give him average credit (which is frustrating because you're forgetting the complexities of averages in statistics -- something you, yourself, have ranted about). You also assume average interest rate (which, if you look at your own source and actually read it instead of glancing for a figure, is skewed by a massive 28% for instant approvals). And then for some reason you assume he's going to pay it off in tiny increments of $50 over a year instead of just paying it off right away when his paycheck comes in over a span of one or two months, IE: when he has the money on hand (like I did).  Now, how can he afford this? The gap between 300 and 750 is massive, when you're talking about payment installments in the first place. But the money that was previously going to the laundromat is now going toward an investment which will end up costing him less the sooner he buys it. Rather than that $30 as the 10% interest he would have to pay toward an extended loan (which is unnecessary without assuming extra weird circumstances, but we'll consider that case as the standard anyway for the point of your reply), he would normally be paying almost $10 a week on washing clothes anyway. What's he going to do with only a washing machine, you might be thinking? Air dry. It's really common around the world in less well-off places than America. Like France, Japan, Korea, etc. You probably know about that having lived in Korea, actually.  The point of the credit card is to use it responsibly. If you can't afford an $800 maintenance on your car, you can't afford it. Period. You have to devise within your means a way of dealing with it, whether that means you pay an extra $80 over a year in interest, or you walk two hours to work until you save up for it like I had to do when I got in a fender bender right out of college. The key is, again, knowing what is in the realm of feasibility for you, and knowing that credit isn't the answer to everything. That doesn't mean that it's useless or sucking money without giving anything back.  Now to address your personalized point, just because it's so off base. Let me give you some background on who you're talking to. I'll be happy to go on Skype some time and actually talk through this with you because I'm not just some kid with a chip on his shoulder; I think you're legitimately mistaken when you say that credit cards are useless, because used responsibly, they've been a lifesaver.  I was born on a beach, and lived there for the first two years of my life. I don't mean a Malibu home, or a ritzy place alongside Long Beach. I mean I was literally born and raised on a god damn stretch of sand with no home or food. My mother was so poor for the first half of my life that by the time I was eight, she still couldn't afford to buy a 37 cent taco from Taco Bell to share with me. I remember her breaking down and telling me this story when I got older, because at the time I saw the picture in the glass and was having a crying fit in the street for not having eaten a solid meal that week. My real father was an addict, and I don't just mean an alcoholic, I mean a real fucked-up dope-head who only showed up every once in a while to beat the shit out of his girl and baby for not looking at him with the kind of dignity he demanded.  Only by the grace of a distant relative's luck phone call did we even get off that island, and only to go and live with them in a one-room shack in the middle of butt-fuck-nowhere -- me, my pregnant mom, and my second aunt. This town had a god damn Stage Stop. If you don't know what that is, it's a cart pulled by a horse instead of a convenience store, because they couldn't get real products moving on the regular in such a dirt-poor region. Rather than vegetables and drinks, they sold bubblegum and live chickens. I didn't see my first apartment until I was ten years old, and I didn't have my own room or toys until I got a job myself the day I turned sixteen.  I lived on food stamps and had zero hand-me-ups in terms of getting a job, into schools, or anything like that. I worked hard for everything I have today, including my degree, my home, my fiancee, my car, and my job. I flew around the world to accomplish this, and I didn't do it without tons of ""little emergencies"". My credit card definitely helped, and because I used it sparingly, and responsibly, I made a steady profit off of it by having resources that I otherwise couldn't possibly hope to coalesce.   tldr; The one-time-expenses are the reason you want a credit card. A credit card smooths the payments. It's not the answer to everything, but it is helpful with a number of them, given you use it properly.  I'll format this later. I have work in the morning."
Destiny,39ai4l,Fulrune,5,Thu Jun 11 15:53:43 2015 UTC,You sure are good at making up bullshit stories about how poor you are    This is a post from your other account: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/370ppy/serious_what_have_you_done_in_real_life_that/crjda67   can't buy 37 cent tacos> kid lost in fantasies and video games    You even use the same age in both stories lol. Also I'm done arguing with you since you obviously tuned out after hearing 5 minutes of stream  Edit: 2 minutes of googling shit from your post history also shows you lived in very rich school district for high school.
Destiny,39ai4l,askshonestquestions,0,Thu Jun 11 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"Nothing in that experience conflicts with what I posted. You can have live in make believe adventures while you're shit-poor. It's standard. You can have friends who own video game consoles when you're too poor to live on anything but food stamps while your single mom works a crap job for two children. It happens all the time thanks to low-income housing. You can also have a shit car your neighbour in butt-fuck-nowhere sold to your mom and it can also be sideswiped. I have scars to prove this shit and I don't need some aspie trying to suck up to Destiny and avenge his own shitty post to tell me what happened in my own life.  Also, the town we moved to was not a rich district at all. The only thing it had when we got there was dirt and a reservation casino. Ten years later it boomed into an economic center, but that's only relative to the shit area that is Riverside in the first place.

Destiny,39ai4l,feyg0t,3,Fri Jun 12 11:22:43 2015 UTC,"So here we are with two massive posts by two people who agree with each other, but an argument has ensued due to a misunderstanding.   The way I see it, Destiny did not say ""credit cards have no value."" He said something along the lines of ""credit card companies bring no economic value.""   His reasoning was that these companies only make their real profits off people constantly paying interest on large credit debt (irresponsible credit card owners.)  Therefore these interest payments take away buying power from consumers and thus takes money out of the economy.  So you can argue that credit card companies grow the economy with their profits, you can argue that credit card companies would be profitable even if all their customers were responsible. But you can't argue that credit cards are useful to responsible spenders because Destiny already agrees with that point."
Destiny,39ai4l,CAPCOMMegaMan,6,Thu Jun 11 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"In your example we have someone using a credit card responsibly.  In Destiny's example we have someone using a credit card irresponsibly.  Unfortunately, I agree with destiny that majority of people (especially poor people) use credit cards irresponsibly, which can be seen as predatory behavior from banks. I don't have data to back any of this up and I'm just a speculating autist, but I got my credit card at 18 and its balance is currently 0. PLUS I got some dank ass rewards piled up ($40!!!) and you KNOW I'm gonna buy some snacks with that!"

However, the core point of his argument the other day was that Credit Cards are evil and just suck money out of the economy without contributing anything, which is false.  The point of the post is to illuminate the value they have. Which, as you said, is clear when and only when someone uses the credit card responsibly."

Most utilities don't even report to credit bureaus. AND they don't report to credit bureaus unless you're 30 days or more late. At that point maybe you want to rethink your shit tier spending habits if you can't pay 15 dollar water bills.   Were you even listening to the stream? The average person IS NOT paying their full balance after a month or two. The average cc debt is 15k. If you're consistently accumulating debt, you are living beyond your means no matter how you look at it. If you have 15k cc debt and you're living on a 2500 dollar paycheck, you should know how difficult it is to break free from that debt.   CC debt is fucking crippling and the APR is more than the advertised 20% or w/e. The interest is compounded on each payment cycle, increasing your total paid to the cc company. The temporary increase in your own purchasing power is almost never worth it. The rare instances are like purchasing clothes for a job that will substantially increase your income. All you retards keep talking about having money now now now now, but in 15 years you're gonna be broke as fuck with a credit score of 0 while the guy not floating 15k debt is living comfortably (with dank ass nikes and a washer and dryer).   Edit: If you're living paycheck to paycheck doing everything to save money and need to pay for unexpected circumstances, well shit that sucks. If you're buying any retarded shit which forces you at a later date to use your credit card to pay for unexpected circumstances, you're a dumbass.

Do you think that makes it any better? GLHF.  Do you really think the argument is that one purchase of a washer is going to put you into 15k of debt? If you do, you're likely delusional or retarded.

Destiny,39ai4l,MissesDoubtfire,-3,Wed Jun 10 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"7k is significantly less than 15k. As in it's less than even half of that.  The argument is whether or not credit cards have value. They do.

Don't base your argument like this is the only alternative to your example lifestyle.

The whole point of managing money is to prepare for times when your finances AREN'T as perfect as you assumed they'd be. ""Averaging out"" your money is just as much of a convenience as anything else that this ""broke-ass"" can't afford, it's just a sneakier way of taking your money."

Destiny,39ai4l,rzlo,-4,Thu Jun 11 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"In sciences like Economics, you work often with terms like ""orders of magnitude"". What this means is that the scale in which the problem you're having is relevant, and the response or possibly a related but different problem are completely outside of the realm of interaction.  For example, if you saved up every penny you ever stumbled across on the street in your life, would you ever be a billionaire from that sole act alone? No, because you would need 100 billion pennies, which would take more time in your life to find than you would ever be able to accomplish. The magnitudes of application of a single cent and 100 billion cents are different.  Similarly, it could be said that on a smaller scale, 15k debt and $300 on a credit card paid off at the end of the month in a responsible manner are orders of magnitude apart from eachother.  Destiny gives an example above where over 18 months, the net loss is about $70, which while a very real issue when stacked with tons of small purchases in an irresponsible manner, isn't plausible with good spending habits like paying off your debts on a regular (monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly) basis.  If you don't read anything else, just know that it's not a single math problem, because the numbers scale and the spending habits are different/unpredictable by person."
Destiny,39ai4l,Fulrune,2,Thu Jun 11 11:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think there are some misunderstandings here. I was mainly curious about your washing machine example. You literally refer to the purchase of an appliance as an ""investment"" several times in your example. By  using such terminology, I would expect you to have done some calculations on the expected ROI.  In business, purchasing on credit can obviously be the best choice sometimes (at least as far as my understanding goes), and maybe there are indeed situations where you, as a private person, could actually gain by buying on credit. Keep in mind though that it is YOU who are making the positive claim that it is in fact so, and you are not meeting your burden of proof by making sweeping (and somewhat condescending) explications about ""orders of magnitude"". Your washing machine example seems contrived, and you haven't presented the necessary math to prove any point you are trying to make."
Destiny,39ai4l,rzlo,0,Thu Jun 11 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the misunderstanding is that you're confused about how weekly sums of ten dollars add up to three hundred dollars?  Okay, so, to break down the simplest concept, which you, for some reason, decided to use as an excuse: $300 divided by $10 per week leaves you with 30 weeks before this investment of $300 breaks even. Every week there-after, you make $10 from your paycheck that would have gone to laundry at a laundromat. This is additive because more and more money would normally be gone from your paychecks that concur every month.  To be plain: y = $10/w - $300; y = the money you make from this purchase and w = the number of weeks that pass.  This is literally seventh grade math and if you can't do it in your head, and need someone to explain it to you, then you probably shouldn't be in a thread about adult problems in the first place."
Destiny,39ai4l,Fulrune,2,Sat Jun 13 08:52:27 2015 UTC,"This has literally nothing to do with your example.  This problem requires, at least, the following information: time needed to save up for laundry machine; number of laundry loads per unit of time; cost per load at laundromat (which, for any sane person, is not even close to 10$/week); interest cost of credit purchase; direct cost per load of doing laundry at home (water and electricity cost). There might be even more factors that I'm not considering.  The pay back-method of doing calculations which you are suggesting is proven to be flawed. And I literally mentioned that I was inquiring about your laundry machine example in my first post - how the hell do you consider me asking about that to be an excuse? Quit trolling, dude."

It seems like a lot of people think it'll be a doomsday event to raise min wage to something like $15, yet Australia seems to be doing just fine.  So even if you don't think it would be a healthy change for the USA, I truly don't understand why people lose their shit and make it sound like our economy will collapse under the weight of living wages."

Destiny,3947d3,Darkstrategy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"Seems like this has a lot to do with cost of living. Poorer countries than the US according to that chart have much higher buying power, while countries we would consider first world seem to have less buying power.  I'd be interested to see this applied across states in the USA. The buying power in NY would be vastly less than say, Nebraska. Yet our minimum wage is actually lower than most states.  That being said, Australia's min is $16.87 (AUS dollars of course), but from what I've heard from friends living there is that min wage is generally only for young people. I knew someone who worked retail over there at 19-20 and was making $21/hr. They mentioned something about being 20+ gives you a higher min wage, and looking at this site it seems to be true. I went through and made a profile for a basic retail cashier that works full time and is 21+ and got $18.52 AUS / hr with increases in pay when working past 6pm on weekdays, or when working weekends/holidays.  I just want to see our society evolve to a point where if you're working a 40 hour job you can afford food, water, and a legal roof over your head. I think being a productive member of society affords you that much, and our current system isn't providing that much for many."

You can't simply run around saying, ""M-MUH LIVING WAGE"" and expect everything to work out fucking perfectly. Each state has their own economy. It's best to let each individual state take a pragmatic approach and carefully decide where and by how much their minimum wages should be raised. It's fucking retarded to pick a random arbitrary amount to raise the federal minimum wage by and say, ""hurn I can raise the minimum wage and there be no consequences and effects on the economy but benefits.""

Destiny,3947d3,Darkstrategy,8,Tue Jun 9 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"Mmk, I agree that $15 shouldn't be the gold standard everywhere. It was merely an example as I was thinking of Australia and more recently Seattle in the USA.  That being said cost of living should match min wage. That might not be $15/hr in many states with lower cost of living, but in states like mine (NY), the min wage here isn't enough to get the lowest of the low of legal apartments. You either need government housing, or an illegal apartment.  As a civilized society we shouldn't accept that people work and try to make a living and struggle with putting food on the table and a roof over their heads. These should be basic necessities of life afforded to everyone who lives in this country.  Wages haven't kept up with inflation. How does that fit? That's no longer about ""Well, for this specific economy"" when it's literally not keeping up with the buying power of the dollar. Prices of goods and services are inflating, why would wages not?"

He basically said ""I did the math! If wages are raised by X then employers only have to raise prices by Y to make up the difference! See, not a big deal, what's wrong with my math?!""   I've never, ever, ever, ever said this, ever, in my entire streaming life, ever, not a single time. What I have said, multiple times, (please link the VoD and prove me wrong) is ""I don't think there would be a 1:1 increase in price along with an increase in wages. In all of my personal work experience supervising, labor only made up less than a quarter percentage of our revenue for any given day, so it seems unlikely that raising minimum wage would cause a parallel increase in price.""  I don't know how many different other ways I could say  that. I don't know if you ever took any classes, or  listened to anyone speak, or have any kind of critical thinking whatsoever, I truly do feel bad for your complete and utter  inability to  understand what someone is saying.   He basically said ""I did the math! If wages are raised by X then employers only have to raise prices by Y to make up the difference! See, not a big deal, what's wrong with my math?!""   If this is what you honestly think I  said, you really have no business commenting on  my subreddit or any part of the internet at  all since you've clearly  demonstrated a complete and total inability to listen to anything being said and instead you only want to hear what you can argue against.  It's funny that you even claim to be some kind of ""economic expert"", and then go on to say stuff like...   If a producer has to increase the price of his goods by 20%, then the quantity demanded for his good will be lower- people will therefore buy less.   You realize that there is a certain elasticity of some goods, right? You think a direct 20% increase in price will lead to a direct 20% decrease in consumption?  Not to mention that you're ignoring the fact that an increase in cost  of goods could  come along with an increase  in wages, which also impacts demand as people with more money can afford more...   Destiny, your analysis assumed that people will buy the same amount from the employer if he increases his prices. That is absolutely not true.   It is if their wages rise in  accordance (or greater than) the increase in the cost  of goods. And it is if the goods  themselves are relatively  inelastic (like food...).   Of course, the impacts of minimum wage are difficult to measure. Increasing minimum wage will not always lead to a visible increase in unemployment, because 1. employment is determined by many, many factors, and 2. The impact of minimum wage depends on the size and increase of minimum wage.   This is the only smart thing you've said in your entire  post. All of these things (increase in wage, increase in cost of goods, affects on employment/price, effects on demand) are very, very difficult to measure, so blanket statements like   If a producer has to increase the price of his goods by 20%, then the quantity demanded for his good will be lower- people will therefore buy less.   honestly don't even belong in a high school text book, because even high school text books teach you that economics is far more nuanced than that..."

Destiny,3933w4,-stin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:06:45 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be a 1:1 increase, and I never said it would.   Err, okay, then what exactly do we disagree on?   It isn't a 1:1 increase, but it's a marginal increase. And a marginal increase in prices will marginally reduce quantity demanded. This will in turn marginally reduce quantity supplied, which makes it likely an employer will choose to higher fewer workers than without the price control since he is producing marginally fewer goods.   So in an insane, perfect ""economics vacuum"" where adjusting only ONE thing (wage) affects only ONE thing (margins), this may be true, but you must surely understand that it's not that simple in  the real world, right?  If what you're saying is true, shouldn't there be a bunch of convincing figures showing a concrete connection between every time the minimum wage is raised and unemployment? Why does this not happen?? Even ""the United States Department of Labor reviewed 64 studies on the effects of minimum wage increases and unemployment, finding no correlation between the two. The studies suggest that an increase in the minimum wage decreases employee turnover along with the expenses associated with hiring and training new workers."" In fact, more than 600 economists, seven of them Nobel Prize winners in economics, have signed onto a letter in support of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by 2016.  So it seems that your insanely oversimplified view of how the minimum wage plays into businesses needs some adjustment, surely, no?   Which increases prices and also fucks the unemployed even harder because there's a higher barrier of labor value to be profitable to hire... Are you starting to see the problem?   No,  because you're inventing a problem that only exists in LITERALLY GRADE SCHOOL  economics textbooks. Like, your viewpoint  on this is so absurdly simplified it's almost difficult to take you seriously. I'd expect to hear more nuance in a Rush Limbaugh program than the bullshit you're pushing here, and it's extra cringy to me because I'm pretty sure I was saying  the same shit not even 3 years ago.  Shouldn't you be able to draw a VERY CLEAR line showing the increase in minimum wage leading to increased cost of living? According to the most recent data collected by the BLS, current as of August 2014, what would have cost $20 in 1994 would now cost over $32...these figures indicate that while the average person is still making the same amount of money when accounting for inflation, prices for many of the daily necessities have gone up considerably, which means that each dollar earned does, in fact, buy less than it did 20 years ago.  Cost of living continues to rise, even while minimum wage (in real dollars) falls. In fact, the highest minimum wage was in 1969, yet cost of living has only increased since then..??? It's very clear that factors beyond minimum wage have a significant impact on the cost of living, and even when minimum wage declines (in real dollars), cost of living continues to increase.   causing people to be unemployed that would otherwise be employed without the minimum wage   This is bullshit. This is grade school economics theory-crafting, gonna need some actual links or sources on this, and not some bullshit that goes state by state  and says ""well this state has a higher minimum wage and more unemployment, see!   The entire point of my post was that your calculations of minimum wage were neglecting the cost of distorting the market with a price control. There are real, large economic costs associated with price controls in markets.   Err, I never ignored that. I specifically said, a multitude  of  times, that it's possible there could be far reaching effects of changing the minimum wage, such as impacting wages above the minimum wage and  impacting the cost of products purchased for companies and what not. However, price controls are not necessarily evil, please get that anarcho-libertarian-capitalism-objectivism bullshit out of here.   Think about it. People are paid minimum wage because their labor is simply not valuable enough to earn a higher wage.   People are paid a minimum wage because they are able to be paid a  minimum wage, period. If you believe anything else, you are simply delusional. If what you were saying  was true, you should be able to draw a clear  line showing negative impacts on the economy every time the minimum wage was raised, and you can't.   Why would a price control magically make them better off if it doesn't make their labor any more valuable?    I dunno, why do carbon credits make  companies ""better off"" if it  doesn't make their technology  or production processes any more valuable?  Again, even in a fucking high school econ class you learn about things like negative externalities. For a quick summary,   When a negative externality exists in an unregulated market, producers don't take responsibility for external costs that exist--these are passed on to society. Thus producers have lower marginal costs than they would otherwise have and the supply curve is effectively shifted down (to the right) of the supply curve that society faces. Because the supply curve is increased, more of the product is bought than the efficient amount--that is, too much of the product is produced and sold. Since marginal benefit is not equal to marginal cost, a deadweight welfare loss results.      Why would a lower-skilled person magically be made better off simply because you are making it harder for companies to hire him?   Lower  turnover, lower cost of training, higher consumer purchasing power, increased productivity and higher employee satisfaction? Again, refer to this.   Here's a supply and demand graph showing the effects of minimum wage and that graph would be the same no matter what econ textbook you opened.   No. This is a supply and demand graph that you would find in the first page in the first chapter of  an econ  book, and the following chapters would describe a million different other things that influence these curves. NOTHING in econ is as simple as a few lines on a fucking graph, if  it was then economic and fiscal policy around the world would be solved and there would be no problems. We would know the perfect tax rates as the laffer curve would be solved, all wages would be perfectly calculated, all fiscal policy from the fed would be perfectly handled, inflation  would be kept  in perfect amounts, etc...etc...but OBVIOUSLY this doesn't happen because these graphs need a lot of real world adjustments.   And look at that, a higher minimum wage is associated with higher prices, lower quantity demanded, and greater unemployment in the market, just like I said.   Yes. Just like you said. Your insanely simplified, grade school econ graph points to a whole bunch of outcomes that aren't justified with real world statistics. It's almost like  there's a reason people get  PhD's in economics instead of just opening a fucking econ  book and copy/pasting a few graphs for everyone to read."

Destiny,3933w4,-stin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"But when regulating a market, you aim to create a dead weight loss that makes up the lost area with marginal utility to the market, or markets as a whole. You don't create a deadweight loss with intention to ruin a market. Its perfectly okay to use, and a practice of every functioning capitalist economy in the world? It's not inherently bad.   The idea behind raising the minimum wage is to offset the deadweight loss by creating positive externalities with intentions to raise quality of life, and increase consumer spending. Sure, there will be short term loss, but the market will adjust accordingly, and eventually it'll be perfectly normalized long term. Which, with my few years of studying economics (not that this is important) seems to be a tried and true practice.  I'm not sure if they'res ever been any real economics professor, study, or anything independent i've come by that says supply side economics works."
Destiny,3933w4,-stin,-4,Tue Jun 9 02:14:21 2015 UTC,"Your assessment that the impacts of minimum wage are cushioned by employers accepting a blow to their profit margins.    Sigh. I've never said in my life that employers will ""accept blows to their profit margins"", I've said repeatedly that the end product to the customer probably won't see a 1:1 increase in cost as wages go up.  I've  said this multiple times. If  you can't read or  understand any of  my argument, there's no reason to have a conversation.   You were the one literally assuming that the producer would just sell the exact same amount he did before he increased his prices.   Nope, never said that.   Even still, a plurality of economists do not support raising a minimum wage. So you are appealing to a minority of economists.   No sources again? I'm just supposed to take your word for this?   but the important point is that it is a marginal contributor to those things, even if it's not the most significant.   Which you can't support with any legitimate evidence, right?   Externalities have literally nothing to do with minimum wage.   Because people working minimum wage jobs but still withdraw benefits from social programs like welfare aren't paid out of public funds?   Your problem destiny is that no matter how much I throw the word marginal in your face you don't seem to get it.    No, the problem is you're making claims with zero references backing you up.

Destiny,3933w4,qawsed123456,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:17:00 2015 UTC,"Let's say raising minimum wage is bad, because otherwise profitable jobs will disappear. Then you would assume that lowering minimum wage, or even canceling it, would create jobs and help maintain them  This is true, BUT, you create jobs that have very little wage. Furthermore, jobs that would get minimum wage or slightly more, will now earn less. Why? The reason lies in the fact that having minimum wage set by the government is an indication that the bargaining between employers and employees is skewed to the point where citizen took matters to the last place where a vote still matters. In other words, as the bottom half of the population is earning less, you get a recession.  The reason countries in the OECD without minimum wages are successful, is that unions are strong. There might be low wages jobs in the service sector for example, where there is no unions... But in these situation the government compensates by making harsher work inspections, and making sure that the employer isn't also cutting on safety, isn't excessively using temps ... In the end it balance out. So for example, the gdp per capita in Germany (4% unemployment rate) is similar to that in France (12% unemployment rate). Yes the same qualified engineer would be payed 10% more in Germany than in France, but you have 1.5 million germans that work for less than 5€/hour (minimum wage in France is 9€/hour).  Also, these jobs that seems profitable without minimum wage restriction can hide hidden costs to the community. Making sure your salary gives some health coverage, some money for retirement, some money to spare, is a way to make sure: I will not end with someone sick to the point he can't work, which impacts his household income (thus their future and their jobs)....  In brief, the way you look at minimum wage is utterly stupid. And the unwillingness to understand the balance required is nothing but class warfare. The minimum wages isn't kept in place out of charity. But rather having it in place (with minimal adjustment to inflation) will marginalize the need of unions. In fact it is the anti-union fascist Vichy regime that set minimum wage during WW2. And every time someone will open his mouth, we will shove down his throat the dumb 101 macroeconomics you mindlessly vomits.  TL, DR: none"
Destiny,3933w4,zenxbear,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"I know very little about economics, so I'm pretty sure my ideas are probably flawed in many ways that I don't understand. Please feel free to correct me as you are able.  Basically, I think raising the minimum wage will have a positive effect on the economy because of these things.  Everybody has a certain ""cost of living"" made up of things you need to survive (food, water, shelter) and things that would be really really nice to have (heating, air conditioning, electricity, food that isn't canned beans). Generally, this doesn't change much from person to person. For a low income person, this ""cost of living"" makes up a high percentage of their total income, let's pick an arbitrary number and call it 50%. Basically, they're spending half of their income on ""necessities"", a small amount on ""investments"" (if any at all) and most of the rest on ""luxuries"".  Now let's say you have a 10% increase in income. Your ""cost of living"" will remain mostly unchanged, you aren't going to increase your consumption of food, and your rent isn't going to magically change unless you decide to move to a different place. However, now that your income is 110% of what it was before, you now have 60% of your (former) income to spend on luxury goods. Basically, a 10% increase in income resulted in a 20% increase in ability to purchase luxury goods.   This differs from the income distribution of a wealthier person, as their ""cost of living"" takes up a significantly smaller proportion of their total income, let's say 10%. Additionally, if this wealthy person is acting rationally, their luxury good expenditure will cap at some point, and most of their remaining income will be occupied in various investments (mutual funds?).  A 10% increase in income would result in a 10% increase in investments but a 0% increase in luxury good expenditure.   As an employer, your costs of doing business is going to include things like employee wages, cost of infrastructure, and cost of material. In other words, your costs of doing business will always be greater (usually significantly greater) than employee wages. So a 10% increase in wages will result in a less than 10% increase in your total business costs. However, a 10% increase in wages will also result in a 20% increase in luxury good money for hypothetical low income workers. Obviously, your customer base is probably not going to consist solely of low income workers, but the point is that your customer base is increasing by some amount. This fact, combined with the fact that your cost of doing business increased by less than the percent increase in minimum wage, should mean that you can increase the cost of your product by less than the increase to wages (if at all).   This all seems like a good way to both increase the economic involvement of lower income workers and to make their lives more enjoyable with more of their income available for luxury goods. Basically transforming some of the economic lower class into a pseudo middle class in terms of purchasing power.   I'm probably dead wrong in some of my logic assumption though."

Mis-calculations concerning elasticity (or he just decided to simplify it which results in misleading results). (He uses two different kind of elasticity estimates interchangeably, (I think he has even admitted that flaw but I'm not sure)) fails to take depreciation into account, etc.   And lets not forget that Picketty is also ideologically motivated as well, and has a few cherry picked estimates and biases in his work too (Using outdated taxation structures and data). Ultimately, economists, and the people discussing their work, are bias. Economists do reach consensus on some things though. Picketty's  book and the ideas expressed within are not one of them. While, also relevant to the greater discussion, the fact that raising the minimum wage results in an increase in unemployment for the poor and unskilled worker is.  Obviously, all anyone can do is try to find economists they believe are reliable and try to vet those beliefs. The problem is when that bias is taken as fact/indisputable. I think a better way to look at wealth and economic trends is through the lens of living standards, unemployment, etc... rather than focusing on wealth retention of a certain few anyway.

Destiny,391bxm,TheBullshitPatrol,2,Mon Jun 8 22:10:43 2015 UTC,[serious] Is it possible to record the number of bans across multiple streamers on overrustlelogs.net? For scientific reasons.   It will be interesting to find patterns/correlation among the streamer themselves and chat behavior.
Destiny,391bxm,JackVS1,2,Mon Jun 8 16:26:39 2015 UTC,most other streams are politically correct normie bullshit.  if you think destiny.gg is bad you have no clue.  at least it's a very anything-goes atmosphere.  I think it's fair enough that making a genuine personal attack on steven gets you banned whereas most other streamers and their autistic internetforummoderators(TM) would ban you for 1/10th of the baiting and 4chan memes that give destiny.gg its charm.
Destiny,391bxm,klomonster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it is for science.  I want to see how different streamer behavior attract different part/type of community. I call it the ban density. (# of bans/total number of viewers)   For example, girl streamers may have higher ban density, because tfw no gf. Or edgy streamers may attract more troll bait. Or shock streamers that brings out the worst in people.   Also how does # of ban scales with # of viewers? It is a constant or does it plateau at a certain point? Or does # of ban scales with rate of chat activity.   Which type of games attract the worst people?  (pvp? role playing?) (mmo, moba, rts, fps, cards?) Social games like minecraft may attract less trolls than competitive pvp games?"

You only consider the number one place to the right of the value you want, e.g. because he wants the closest 1K, he only looks at the 1.4K and rounds down from there.  I mean, if you don't disregard the numbers you come away with an obviously wrong statement:   1450 is closer to 2000 than it is to 1000   The disregard rule is there to prevent exactly this problem."

Destiny can't build a consistent viewerbase because there's no consistent schedule. I only know he's on because I watch hells kitchen with nate.

Just enough calories to maintain my body weight, which was around 1500 I think? But eating was the hardest part for me because I just wasn't used to eating 3000-3500 calories a day. So I started drinking a lot of protein shakes, smoothies, all that shit in addition to my typical one meal a day. And over time, my body got used to taking on more calories.

Returning home to Shady Hill from a business trip, which is all he wants at this point. The engine of the plane begins to have trouble. strange events begin to occur before frances. A man sitting next to him, your everyday working guy, pulls out a flask. Of course,frances smiles at him because at a time like this, who could refuse a little drink? Except, the man refuses to give Frances a swig. The man is obviously a person who is thinking abouthimself.The author foreshadows an absence of devotion to the home life. Passengers on theplane are singing, meanwhile the plane continues to descend.The lyrics refer to World War 2 songs.Frances is caught up because he was in World War 2. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the man with the flask refers to an old pilot's slang from war time ""Buy the farm."" Usually reffering to the death of a Pilot(soldier) who's benefits from the Government would be used to pay for a family's farm. At a time like this,when the plane you're in is crashing, that is a phrase you dont wanna hear. Finally, the plan lands in a field and, just like that, it was all over and everything was fine. With his new found life ahead of him, Frances returns to his home, only to find a fight with Julia. Frances feels that julia ,his wife, should cook dinner for the kids earlier and then another later for him. The real problem is that he feels like he almost died and would like to come home to a little intimacy, instead of kids ruining the mood. Throughout the family dinner we hear the language of battle between Frances and Julia. Later on that night, Frances goes out back to enjoy a cigarette. He watches the neighborhood dog, Jupiter. Jupiter is a dog who pretty much sleeps wherever he pleases and does what he wants. I think Frances begins to realize that he wou...  FIND OUT IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF Frances In Shady Hill"

Destiny,38m4tq,Frembo,2,Fri Jun 5 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I do have one issue with practicality though. If I am using one of those retarded home-made ice AC buckets, I am not using it inside the biggest room (aka kitchen+living room) where my fridge is; it's going in one of my bedrooms with a closed door. If this thing works, it will cool off my room. So ya, I agree it is inefficient, but we have to at least give it the right context to succeed.  I missed the initial part of the conversation and am not sure if the argument was something ""enviro friendly"" or  ""cost saving"". So I conclude: Enviro friendly, no. Cost saving, yes, if it cools sufficiently it will save you the initial cost on an AC unit."
Destiny,38m4tq,Moonlapsed,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:35:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed, you are correct.  The what Destiny originally stated was ""isn't this just inefficient?"" which may or may not be true depending on several factors.  Under the general discussion/assumptions, looking at the cost effectiveness, it is inefficient.  However, if you are just looking to cool your room and can't be bothered to close the vents from an HV/AC system to the unneeded parts of the living space, then this may be worthwhile and effective.  Alternatively, in places where no AC exist or in garages, it could be useful so long as spending money on the extra electricity is respected."

Destiny,38fk1w,CrazySyd,0,Thu Jun 4 00:37:24 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry I thought you were trolling. Sorry for calling you stupid <3.  I'll try and illustrate it this way.  You're randomly pick one of 4 colours: red, blue, green, yellow. You have a 25% chance of each choice, and if you add up all of these choices you get 100%. The fact that they all add up to 100% is important and I'll come back to this. This is all fine and nobody has a problem with this. If you're asked ""you picked a colour, what are the chances you picked red"", anybody would tell you the answer is 25%, and they would be right. The chances you picked red is 25%, yellow 25%, green 25%, blue 25%.  Now lets say somebody says ""you picked a colour, and you did not pick yellow, what are the chances you picked red (or green or blue)?""  Now if you are a 25%er, you would have to say that the answer is 25% (this is the equivalent of the heads/tails, crit etc problems). But if the chances that you picked red is 25%, that you picked blue is 25%, that you picked green is 25%, that you picked yellow is 0%, then when you add them up you get 75%, which is impossible. You should be able to add up all of these probabilities and get 100%.  When you eliminate the 25% chance of yellow, you need to somehow distribute that 25% to the other 3 options (red blue and green), so that the total adds up to 100%. So unless you have a particular reason to give any extra to red green or blue, you split it all evenly so that's 8.33% to each of red green and blue, so that's 33% each.  (as for why it could be 33% or 50%, that's a completely different story).  Hope that explains it."
Destiny,38fk1w,EmpyralT,2,Thu Jun 4 00:51:37 2015 UTC,"I like this example, and it is correct, but I don't think that it is completely relevant to the problem. I'll use heads/tails because it's less confusing, at least for me, to understand/explain... it is the crit/hit rephrased.   You flip two coins.  There is a 50% chance of the coins landing on heads. At least one of the coins is a heads. What is the probability that the coins land on heads/heads?  Let's look only at the second statement : There is a 50% chance of the coins landing on heads. Flip a coin 100 times... just one... and you will get 50 heads, and 50 tails, according to this condition. NO MATTER WHAT... you WILL get 50 heads, and 50 tails. It doesn't matter if the second coin lands and is an autistic meme breathing dankster... the first coin will be 50 heads, 50 tails. I hope that's clear and agreed upon.   Now let's look at the third statement: At least one of the coins is a heads. Now this is interesting, and this is where people get confused. Mentioned earlier, the second coin has no impact on the first coin, at all. However, the first coin has EVERYTHING to do with the second coin. Those 50 tails that were flipped MUST be followed by a heads... it is part of the condition. So you have 50 tails/heads, yes? Okay, good. However, you also have 50 heads. You already have a heads, so the condition of ""at least one heads"" is fulfilled. The only other condition is the 50% chance of heads on coin flip... so if you have 50 heads... and flip the second coin 50 times... you will have 25 tails and 25 heads... you will get 50 tails/heads, 25 heads/tails, and 25 heads/heads. I hope this is clear?  Now, your example does have some relevance to the problem. I don't think that you are wrong, but I think how we individually view the problem is what is causing the disagreement.    In the coin problem, if you apply the conditions BEFORE the coin flips (NON-real world) then it is 25%, I hope I made a logical argument for that.   However, if you attempt to make the problem more of a real world problem, then your personal interpretation changes the answer to the problem. If you assumed that the coins are flipped and then the conditions are applied, it can be either 25% or 33%... here's how:  Without the conditions, and in a real world where a coin is still 50% heads, you will end up with 25 T/T, 25 T/H, 25 H/T, 25 H/H. SO. If you did not see what the coins landed on, but your friend did, it can be either 25% or 33%. If he tells you that at least one of the coins is a heads... pay CLOSE attention... and asks what the probability of heads/heads, it is 25%. Why? Because even though you apply the conditions after the event, the heads/heads event still has a 25% probability of occurring. Yeah? I hope that's clear. Now, if he instead asks what the probability, FROM THE REMAINING OUTCOMES (which are T/H, H/T, H/H), of heads/heads is, then it is 33%.  Weow.  The problem seems very similar to the boy-girl paradox, but not so much. The boy-girl paradox is always applied after the event. The children are born, and we ask families what gender their kids are, then what is the chance of ... so on. However, the coin problem is allowed to have the conditions applied beforehand.   Because the question does not make clear when the conditions are applied, or whether the probability is of the remaining outcomes, or of the literal outcomes, it is hard to say for certain, which is why it is a paradox. I assume that the conditions are applied before the coin flip, and if that is not the case, then I don't see where the question asks specifically for the probability from the remaining outcomes. In both cases, 25% would be my answer... how you, or anyone else, interpret the question, may change the answer to 33%.   I still have no reasonable idea why 50% would be an option."
Destiny,38fk1w,CrazySyd,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"""However, the first coin has EVERYTHING to do with the second coin."" This statement is completely wrong. Conditional probability doesn't work that way. There is no ""first"" and ""second"" coin. If you are looking at it that way you are already missing the point.  The way that you are applying the conditions you are saying that if the ""first"" flip is tails, suddenly the 2nd coin is not actually a fair coin, it becomes a coin that can only be heads. That shows that this entire way of looking at the problem as ""first"" coin and ""second"" coin is wrong.  I googled ""simple explanation conditional probability"" and this was the first thing that came up. I haven't watched it yet but I assume it will explain everything. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwADSMeiIoE"
Destiny,38fk1w,CrazySyd,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:45:24 2015 UTC,"Now I understand how conditional probability works... but I still think the problem is very slightly different. The original problem states that you hit twice. I assume that means hit and then hit... as in, you can't jab twice with the same hand in the same instance. I would then assume the first hit is categorical probability, and then the second hit is conditional probability."
Destiny,38fk1w,Sherman72,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Just to apply the formal conditional probability formula,  Probability(A given B) = Probability (A and B)/Probability (B),  probability (both are heads GIVEN at least 1 is heads) equals  probability (both are heads AND at least 1 is heads)  divided by  probability (at least 1 is heads).  probability both are heads AND at least 1 is heads is 1/4   probability that at least 1 is heads is 3/4,  So you have (1/4)/(3/4) which is 1/3"

Also your hard drive might still run on ribbons instead of sata... so you might need to replace that. Your choice if you want an optical or not.

I got the i7,4790k+ITX moBo for about a total of $375.98.)

The only problem is that games with heavy use on multi core processing will suffer. Games like starcraft 2, battlefield 4.

Destiny,386rax,hoardedsoviet,-1,Wed Jun 3 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"Medical debate: Informed medical consent (not about rape).  ""Informed consent"" is the practice of making sure that a patient fully understands and agrees to a medical treatment before it is performed, and that if the patient does not understand what the treatment does, it must be explained to them (so that they are ""informed"").  Does a persons right to allow medical procedure fall out when their life is in immediate danger, or should they be allowed to speak for themselves even if their state of mind may very well be compromised?  Who should speak for a patient; the patients family, or a doctor?  As an example, let's say a patient has developed a condition where the brain starts to lose function over the course of a week.  There is no hope of recovery, only preservation for ""x days"".  In cases similar to this, an advocate for the patient is chosen, most often a close relative, and that advocate is there to speak on the patient's behalf when it comes to informed consent.  This person would have a lot of power over the patient's future, and could very well make a decision that would benefit their own lives over the patient's.  In many cases, the advocate would rather the patient live on in agony rather than to let the patient pass, even when the advocate had been advised that it would not be in the patient's best interests to continue with an inhuman quality of life.  A doctor would have much more information, however still in most all modern hospitals the patient's future is left to a relative.  Is it ethically sound to allow a family member make an important medical position for someone else, superceding a doctor?  Is it ethically sound to allow a doctor to end a patients life without consenting with the family?  Who should be able to make the ultimate decision?  Informed consent has been a long standing topic of debate, and is similar to the ""death panels"" debate that was touted on cable news as obamacare was gaining support.  This topic also has many variables that should be interesting to think about."

Destiny,386rax,rasmorak,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:48:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what happens.  The debate is whether it should happen that way.
Destiny,386rax,talos707,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"As a paramedic, yes it should be that way. If a person's life is in ""immediate danger"" they aren't not in a position to refuse treatment. Even if they could refuse treatment, it's likely if someone's life is in immediate danger, the police are there, in which case, 9/10 times the police will issue an RMA-AMA (Refusal of Medical Assistance-Against Medical Advisement, or protective custody), so we'd take them and treat them anyway. That's the way that it is and should be really. I didn't become a paramedic to get rich, I became a paramedic because I wanted to help people as best I can in ways they might not be able to help themselves. It's hard enough when you do everything you possibly can to keep a pt alive, only to have them die seconds before reaching the ER; I don't want to feel even more guilty because a guy who crashed his car and is bleeding to death says ""I refuse treatment, I'll be okay."" just before he dies.   As for who should speak on behalf of the pt, I see what your saying. I hate seeing families keep alive a father or mother or whomever in a vegetative state. But I do think the family should still have that say. They need to be more financially responsible for it though. In a situation like that, it's the Doc's job to convince the family that Timmy doesn't even know who they are and his entire existence is basically staring at a wall until he slips into a coma or dies. Sometimes they can, and other times, families believe a miracle will happen.   EDIT: Obviously, I have bias since I'm in EMS."

Destiny,37v9vb,-stin,-3,Sat May 30 23:05:13 2015 UTC,I actually really enjoyed ME3. Easily the best of the series and a multiplayer that has no business begin as good as it is.  The ending was disappointing but there were so many other amazing highs during the game I definitely didn't hate it.
Destiny,37v9vb,-stin,3,Sat May 30 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"Whoah there, i was rooting for you until you said the shit about ME3 being the best in the series. Sure, the combat was better, but it was one of the most disappointing games ever released in recent memory. My favorite part of the game was how my decisions didn't mean jack shit by the end. I could have picked any options throughout all three games and still get the same retarded ending.   Bioware deserves to be called Bioshit after what they did to Mass Effect."
Destiny,37v9vb,Magmaniac,-1,Sat May 30 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I'm assuming you think ME2 is better?  What did ME2 do? It's final boss was just as dumb as the three choices in ME3. The suicide mission was cool as fuck but it's the only moment I actually remember from that game.  Spoilers below btw.  ME3 had the Mordin sacrifice scene, the Citadel coup scene with Udina was pretty awesome, the Geth stuff and Rannock is really great too and the Thessia mission with all the Banshee stuff was really great too.  ME2 had what? Assembling a team was kind of cool and most of the loyalty missions where some great pieces of fiction but it feels like that was it. The entire game felt like a bunch of recruitment/loyalty missions then the sequence after the Reaper IFF mission arc.  I'm not saying ME2 is a bad game but my personal ratings for the games would probably be ME2 < ME1 < ME3.  As for choices not having an effect in ME3 do you mean choices from previous games or choices from ME3? I can't even remember a whole lot of choices in ME3 that matter outside of the moment. It felt like ME3 choices were smaller, more character driven ones.  Besides depending on some choices you make some characters won't even be alive or will actively hate you by the end."
Destiny,37v9vb,TanteTroll,0,Sat May 30 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that from the beginning of Mass Effect, Shepard was meant by superior some force to be the one who will decide of the fate of the galaxy. Sure it's not explained at the beginning but like every SF piece, some question are answered and some are not. One of them was why was Shepard so important from the beginning. I like to think that it was all planned by the reapers.  The child representation at the end is just a medium to give the player the answers he wanted/needed. Also don't talk to -stin since all he wants to do is memeing and bashing a game he didn't like because reasons.  Like every Mass Effect fan said : ""It's not about the ending, it's about the journey""  God the butthurt..."
Destiny,37v9vb,Axxhelairon,-2,Sun May 31 09:52:09 2015 UTC,"mfw you delete your comment before I could reply to it.  I can get that. I get that ME2 was a setup for ME3 and that the stories that were told in ME2 mission to mission were much smaller in scope because it was setting up the larger set pieces in ME3.  I just think that the plot of those missions weren't nearly as good as the missions in ME3. In ME2 I was wondering ""what will I learn about X character next"" or ""who will I meet next?"" but in ME3 my thoughts were much closer to ""what's going to happen next?"" in addition to the character stories.  Basically, I feel like ME3 did really well with both the larger world story and individual character development, where as ME2 just had some great character moments and 'meh' plot/missions.  I'm actually not entirely sure what info is available about the Reapers and the cycle in the core game, but the Leviathan DLC has so much great info it's a real shame that it's DLC and not included in the core game.  The ending was pretty crappy though, I agree 100%. There wasn't a whole lot of consequences to the choices you made in regards to the ending.  You also need to be realistic though. It would be impossible to actually have different endings that change based on every little choice you make. It just isn't possible without infinite money and time.  In terms of personal closure of characters I care about I would disagree. I made my peace with Thane, let Liara know I still love her, gave Tali her home back as well as Legion his life. Those are the characters I really care about and I felt like I made my peace with them, and anything that happens afterwards is redundant. It wouldn't matter if the entire galaxy was swallowed by a blackhole, whatever adventure they got into they did together.  But ya, that multiplayer should not have been good at all lol."

This wouldn't be very hard to pull of, they just needed closure."
Destiny,37v9vb,sacredcowkiller,1 point,Sun May 31 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"The singleplayer was pretty good coming off the leap backward of ME2. No where near as fun/interesting than ME1.  They story was okay, but it still suffered from oncoming tumblrcancer- characters who weren't gay suddenly became gay at the behest of a minority of players. Not that the other gay characters mattered- but it lacks consistency and is thus poor writing.   Oh, not to mention the fucking weird and unnecessary Seth Green / SPACESHIP romance. If you haven't played it, i'm not joking. Joker (Seth's character) LITERALLY WANTS TO FUCK AND MARY HIS SHIP BOUND AI. No. This wasn't a ME3 version of 'Her' (released years later) This was what RLM calls a case of the 'not-gays' where every fucking character in the game has to validate themselves as sexual beings.  The multiplayer is standard fair of 'hold off hordes of enemies' with maybe (iirc) some additional objectives with gimped player classes."
Destiny,37v9vb,sacredcowkiller,0,Mon Jun 1 01:26:08 2015 UTC,I would go as far as to say that most multiplayer classes are better than the single player ones.  Which characters suddenly became gay between games?  I also liked the Joker/EDI story. Rip me I guess.

Destiny,37torg,Waterboyyyy,48,Sat May 30 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"1 - first analogy is accurate, stupid to hold an entire population accountable for something a small number of people do.  Sky can't hold ALL female streamers in negative regards because one or two extort people, same way I can't be racist against ALL black people just because one or two may have stolen something from me in college. This is a pretty easy comparison, not sure how you can miss this...  2) Second comparison is explaining odd fetishes. Just because you understand something, doesn't necessarily mean you agree with it/condone it. ie: some people have weird fetishes, like body modification (extreme) stuff, I can understand how someone can have that fetish, but I don't. Not sure what else to say there...  3) This one is really vulgar, but the analogy fits perfectly, not sure what else to say about that. You can't rape someone without holding them down; you can't land banelings without some kind of pressure keeping the marines in place.  4) ""Having a preference doesn't make you immune to criticism"", illustrated using a ridiculous ""preference"" that is clearly open to criticism...  5) Seen a TON of people who ""need an SUV because they have kids"". Parents never had an SUV, I don't have an SUV, known plenty of people who don't have SUVs. Willing to bet 90% of people would agree that just because you have two kids, doesn't mean you absolutely NEED an SUV just to get around...  6) Not sure what I was even explaining here, this video/these videos are literally like 4-5 years old, you're reaching pretty hard here..  The reason I blew up at you in chat was because you said all of my analogies/comparisons are bad, or that ""i'm known for not making accurate comparisons"". I think the majority of my comparisons, even if they're extreme, usually illustrate a point..."
Destiny,37torg,NeoDestiny,4,Sat May 30 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"6) makes sense too I've recently watched some of these old videos. You were talking about balancing terran when SC2 was a relatively new game. You were saying at the time, if I'm not mistaken, that terran had so much wrong with them that terran didn't even have to use most of it. Basically saying that just because they had 1 over powered strat that everyone used, it didn't make the other less used strat any less over powered. Hence, just because the pink shirt makes you look gay, doesn't make the purple sweater any less gay. Pretty sure it was reference to auto turrets, and that just because no one had to use them at the time, doesn't mean they weren't ""gay"" or broken."
Destiny,37torg,adanceparty,19,Sat May 30 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"I think your most ridiculous analogy was comparing Athenes trolling in League games and then going ""well I give money from subs & donations to dem keedz"", to a rapist giving money to a charity after raping."
Destiny,37torg,KroMagTheFucktard,4,Sat May 30 12:15:38 2015 UTC,But still 100% valid.
Destiny,37torg,Doobers,2,Sat May 30 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Hardly. I understand the point he was trying to make, but I think it's kind of valid to say ""Athene isn't a terrible human being trolling people in League of Legends because he does a shitload of charity"" whereas ""It's fine that I raped women because I gave some money to charity""  The comparison of ""a terrible person is still a terrible person even if they donate to charity"" is valid, but trolling in League doesn't make you a terrible person, unless Destiny's best friend Kaceytron is a horrible person as well."
Destiny,37torg,Reinhart3,2,Sun May 31 12:33:59 2015 UTC,I think the point that destiny was actually trying to make was he thinks people's actions should be judged separately.   Athene's trolling(a bad action) is not absolved by his donating to charity(a good one). He still did the bad act. Destiny just used his favourite debating tactic of taking a situation that he thinks is illogical and taking it to the very extreme. Obviously trolling in LOL doesn't make you a terrible person but he was annoyed at people who were saying that it meant nothing because of his other acts.
Destiny,37torg,Cynical_Lurker,-2,Mon Jun 1 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"but I think it's kind of valid to say ""Athene isn't a terrible human being trolling people in League of Legends because he does a shitload of charity""   Except...it's not...at all, ever. Life isn't a zero sum game. No one would ever let you slide on fucked up shit because you do ""good shit"", in fact, those people are usually viewed upon as WORSE than people who just do bad shit because people are quick to attribute the good you do as just ""covering up"" ..."

Destiny,37torg,KroMagTheFucktard,7,Sat May 30 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"You're getting too hung up on specifics at that point. All he was trying to do in that one is compare 1 bad act to another bad act. Nowhere did he say they were equal in severity in his analogy when he said that. He said it was just fucked up either way. It's an analogy used to clear up an idea for someone who might not understand, then you get hung up hard on the details of a fake scenario."
Destiny,37torg,adanceparty,-10,Sat May 30 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"His point was literally ""Athene can't justify being an asshole in League because he donates the money earned to charity, the same way someone raping a woman cant be justified by later donating to charity in the victim's name"".  The analogy relies on those specifics, and it falls apart because while justification is the same - charity - the severity of the act is in no way comparable (rape and trolling)."
Destiny,37torg,KroMagTheFucktard,6,Sat May 30 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"He wasn't trying to compare the severity. He was saying that you can't use good actions, to make you immune to criticism when you do something shitty. The severity of each action he used is entirely irrelevant. And that's what I mean about getting hung up on details. Sure they aren't even remotely similar in severity, but no one was trying to make that argument. The argument is that doing good things, doesn't mean you are immune to any criticism or ""hate"" when you do something shitty."
Destiny,37torg,adanceparty,-5,Sat May 30 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"You are not saying anything wrong, but the point of an analogy like that is to give a precedent and apply the same kind of treatment as in the precedent. Which he failed to do."
Destiny,37torg,KroMagTheFucktard,3,Sat May 30 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"You are applying the same treatment, in both scenarios, a person is trying to be excused for shitty actions, based on good actions they did in the past. In both scenarios it's like now you can't do that, you aren't getting off the hook that easily, and they are being criticized for the actions. The severity of the actions don't have to come into play at all, it's completely irrelevant."
Destiny,37torg,adanceparty,-3,Sat May 30 17:28:04 2015 UTC,Yea but what is more shitty? Making nerds mad or raping someone?
Destiny,37torg,fphthrowaway311,-7,Sat May 30 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"How is severity of the actions completely irrelevant? You can't treat all offenders the same way, that's not how the judicial system works. The details matter, based on them we can estabilish precedent and apply the same treatment. And what I'm saying is that Destiny failed to give proper precedent, which he thought to be fitting."

What we are talking about is actual rape, which /u/Doobers thinks is comparable to being a asshole in a fucking video game, clearly not understanding the implications of real rape (which is what Destiny was originally referring to).  EDIT: nice edit you retard    I'm pretty sure you might be retarded if you look at that analogy and think he's saying Athene is worse than a rapist.   Where exactly did I say that Destiny was implying that Athene is worse than a rapist? rofl   Nobody considers it comparable   Except for Destiny, who made the comparison in the first place? I'm sure he would rectify that statement now, but at the moment he was high with emotions.   but it works and gets the point he's trying to make across in a black and white way.   No, it doesn't. That's the fucking point. And how is making any point in a black and white way good?"
Destiny,37torg,KroMagTheFucktard,1 point,Sat May 30 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"You're honestly taking this the wrong way if you really think destiny or any of us think that rape is comparable to trolling. What people are trying to tell you is that if you're being a dick, any good thing you do doesn't change the fact that you're a dick.   If a high school bully beats kids up and takes his lunch money, but then goes home everyday to take care of his sick grandma, then he's a dick who's nice to his grandma.

Dharma_bot, which is effectively undocumented, bans for what I presumed was any link that is found to be tagged on reddit as NSFW (including those which are subject to subreddit-wide NSFW) and isn't tagged as NSFW in chat. In an act of desperation and self-preservation, I've made an effort to tag every link I post in chat as NSFW, without concern for the fact that people who are at work will miss out on my content.  Amidst enjoying and sharing a lovely work of avant-garde composition by one of my favorite artists, I was jarringly interrupted with the reception of an entirely unjust 10 minute mute by the familiar tyrant ""RightToBearArmsLOL"". This same figurehead has a documented history of haughty, fanatical behavior, from watermarking self-created animated GIF files with his brand, to keeping behavioral records of and harassing regulars in chat like Randall from the children's animated series ""Recess"".  Did that 10 minutes of absence really detract much real value from my $12 3-month tier 1 subscription, or unpaid general participance and long term support of the community? Perhaps not, but instead it speaks to a greater issue. I can no longer trust my usual fraternization in chat to go unchastened. It's a curious case, no doubt, that the same character who was hesitant to ban chatfolk for obvious abuse of the chatroom is now so vociferous in action. I strongly urge steven, if he is reading this and at all cares about my and many others' $50 annual contribution to his wellbeing and unwavering support of him and his domain, to consider the clandestine behavior of his one and only de-facto ""moderator"", and perhaps establish a less vague set of rules and penumbra governing the chatroom that would be easier for them to regulate.  - a concerned chatter"

Destiny,37vjaj,fenicx,2,Sat May 30 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem) is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"". A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.  The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα pronounced [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, ""imitated thing"", from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, ""to imitate"", from μῖμος mimos, ""mime"") coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.  Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.  A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.  Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he obviously welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that ""memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically"" and wanted to regard memes as ""physically residing in the brain"". Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler. At the New Directors' Showcase 2013 in Cannes, Dawkins' opinion on memetics was deliberately ambiguous."

Destiny,37ks1s,FinalPawn,9,Thu May 28 12:44:45 2015 UTC,The death penalty is actually the dumbest thing ever for two reasons:  1) Our judicial system is far from perfect and people who are convicted of a crime could still later be proven innocent through evolving evidentiary analysis procedures. See cases where DNA testing has proven people innocent of crimes that occurred decades before the testing technology had even been invented.  2) It costs more tax dollars to litigate a death penalty case than to just lock them up forever -- http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/
Destiny,37ks1s,Chriscras66,2,Thu May 28 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"People are still getting wrongly executed. You can look up the stats, the official number is 4% or something like that, that are nowadays still getting executed and then afterwards proven innocently. I don't even want to know the real number of innocent people getting executed.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_execution#United_States)"
Destiny,37ks1s,fphthrowaway311,2,Thu May 28 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"You can either execute criminals but that costs money  Or you can send them to a private prison where they work like slaves, make license plates and military equipment and are generally useful(profitable even) to society."
Destiny,37ks1s,CoverNL,0,Sun May 31 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"It costs more cause the guy can appeal 50 times until he dies or something like that, can't we change something so it has a cap ? like 5 times max, she says its unlikely to happen, if it was to change that argument would be the other way around"
Destiny,37ks1s,Sherman72,25,Thu May 28 16:20:13 2015 UTC,I agree with this 100%. Why do we even let people appeal!? Just execute the guilty ones!
Destiny,37ks1s,NeoDestiny,6,Thu May 28 17:13:19 2015 UTC,And the lawyers cause they're as bad as the murderers.

Destiny,37ks1s,Sherman72,3,Thu May 28 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"Until we can get some magically better system, death penalty should just be saved for the people we can 100% confirm guilt on. like someone caught on a very clear camera murdering a lot of people."
Destiny,37ks1s,Fatal510,2,Thu May 28 22:35:42 2015 UTC,You mean like the Boston Bomber which caused Destiny to immediately call the Massachusetts government murderers?
Destiny,37ks1s,askshonestquestions,1 point,Fri May 29 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really doesn't seem to make any sense.  I'm guessing that this mess is caused by a failure of democracy. I mean, proponents of the death penalty would probably prefer to see the murders carried out quickly and without any convoluted legal process. But, there's huge opposition to the whole idea so lawmakers ended up with a retarded compromise that serves nobody.  I say, either man up and work the gallows or don't have a fucking death penalty in the first place."
Destiny,37ks1s,Tanukki,0,Thu May 28 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"1) Our judicial system is far from perfect and people who are convicted of a crime could still later be proven innocent through evolving evidentiary analysis procedures. See cases where DNA testing has proven people innocent of crimes that occurred decades before the testing technology had even been invented.   So you have an issue with the logistics of it all. How its handle and all that. That is why you are against it.  What if you have on camera a person going into a mall and gunning down 50 people. There is no doubt, it is 100% the person being accused the camera is clear as life. Does he deserve to die?   2) It costs more tax dollars to litigate a death penalty case than to just lock them up forever -- http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/   We have that because we don't want to make the mistakes you list in your first point. We want to exhaust every possibility that the accused is innocent. In fact they are probably better off being on death row because they get government paid access to death row lawyers that fight for them. Whereas a person who instead just gets sentenced to life without parole will be forgotten in the system, even if innocent, no one will fight for them. Because they don't have that same access that a death row inmate does."
Destiny,37ks1s,Fatal510,2,Thu May 28 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, man he believes in reform. Even if you murder 50 people in cold blood. I mean look how Charles Manson's commuted death sentence has turned out.   California has spent over $2 million just housing him not to mention all the costs of his appeal hearings, while trying to prevent him from running his murder cult on the inside. I'm sure any day now Charles Manson is going to be integrated right back into society and that it definitely would have cost more than $2 million to execute him back in the '70s."

Destiny,37ks1s,ianyapxw,4,Thu May 28 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"he was speaking about possibility of reform rather than possible innocence. the essence of his argument was ""why are courts/juries allowed to decide whether someone is beyond reform?""."

Destiny,3796gh,Fraye,18,Tue May 26 19:47:08 2015 UTC,As fun as Gwent but he gets to rage against real humans? I can't wait!
Destiny,3796gh,Gracksploitation,27,Mon May 25 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think there's still a chance that if Destiny switched to cardstone he'd puil 20k+ viewers  - if he were good, or good enough.   Huge number of hearthstone viewers are people who dropped SC2 when it became ded gaem, and still remember watching Dustony fondly.  Moreover, there's no one currently streaming cardstone that fills his niche exactly.  Reynad rants like he does, but generally he rants on the topic of cardstone, and almost never ventures into other topics.  Forsen has his edginess, but doesn't rant about shit."
Destiny,3796gh,jurble,14,Tue May 26 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can actually see his stream growing a lot more in HS than LoL, really.  I can't see him ever becoming a hit in the LoL scene, but HS might be perfect for him.    Would give him a lot of time to interact with chat and rant about things.  And also what you said, SC2 people made it pretty big there.  Trump was pretty much no one in Starcraft by the time HS came out, now he is a 20-30k viewer streamer."
Destiny,3796gh,cutemiqotewaifu,10,Tue May 26 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"Also, the LoL streams are slightly starting to drop numbers.  It wasn't unusual to see Trick2g pull in 20k-30k people.  He's now between 6k-10k.  It's still a large stream.  Same thing goes for nightblue, but to a lesser extent.  The LCS (If TSM plays) is at about 230k-280k, where it used to almost be at 400.  It is a LONG way from being a ""dead game"", but viewers are starting to go elsewhere."
Destiny,3796gh,Magnious,1 point,Tue May 26 17:51:46 2015 UTC,This is just their current stats....what are the comparitive stats from last year??  This shows neither a decrease or an increase..just current from the past few months.  I don't know what you are trying to say.
Destiny,3796gh,Magnious,1 point,Thu May 28 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to say is that you can't post 5 months worth of numbers.  You have to compare year to year.  The LCS was over in December and January, so of course those months are going to be lower, then they had the spring split.  Also, Trick could have taken time off during the holidays, and generally less people tend to watch.  You can't compare 5 months worth of data and then say 'Look!  You are wrong!!'.  You have to compare like variables, which would be December 2014-April 2015 compare to December 2013-April 2014.  Also, what are you saying about Trick?  His numbers are obviously down.  And no, it was not unusual to see Trick with 20k."
Destiny,3796gh,Magnious,5,Thu May 28 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"I would watch Destiny play hearthstone 25/7, and I never watch him play League so yeah I hope he does."

Destiny,3796gh,rasmorak,0,Wed May 27 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"I think most Hearthstone streams are pretty boring, but I think Steben can probably pull off an entertaining Hearthstone stream. The thing is once he masters the game I think he'll become hella frustrated from the sheer amount of RNG in the game. I played in vanilla and it was rage inducing then, and I've heard it's even worse now.  I wish another online card game wouldn't be so scared to try and take market share from Hearthstone without being shovelware to make a quick buck. MMDoC used to be fantastic around the time Hearthstone was in beta, but I hear the economy is complete shit in it now and the ranked ladder is dying out.  Hex seems decent, but it suffers the same issue as MTGO - way too much fucking money to actually be competitive.  Hearthstone definitely has a huge amount of viewers to tap into, though. I'll be happy watching him play anything besides DayZ, EvE, and SC2 tbh."

Destiny,3796gh,MissesDoubtfire,11,Tue May 26 11:34:32 2015 UTC,It'd at least be more entertaining than fucking LoL.

Destiny,3796gh,meuwth,-1,Tue May 26 08:50:09 2015 UTC,I still think that Hearthstone is way to boring for Steven and in general for the viewers.

Destiny,37d1bp,dawigas,4,Tue May 26 19:04:02 2015 UTC,twitch.tv/destiny/profile/past_broadcasts  good luck have fun buddy
Destiny,37agmi,obsoleteXeo,2,Tue May 26 04:28:16 2015 UTC,"From what i saw with the gwent streams so far, card drawing isnt much of an issue at all (albeit reliant on RNG), in fact i think it works perfectly as is. You have factions with perks that allow you to draw cards from your deck/discard pile, spy/medic cards that draw cards from your deck/discard pile, and decoy cards to allow you to use those cards again. Then you have the elf and monster factions that can put mobs onto the field and be able to add onto the field all those mobs in the hand/deck that share the same name.   Of course fundamental issues arise from this, such as massing up a medic/spy only deck and resurrecting your units constantly, so maybe adopting the card restrictions in Hearthstone or having a cap on total power for your deck would be something to consider. Hero caps could be a thing too, so that scorch and weather cards can still be worth enough to keep in decks.  Overall: bretty gud card game, hopefully CDPR adds online for this in the future as dlc (provided they try to balance the game so that 20 poor fucking infantry card decks cant exist)"
Destiny,37agmi,syunfox,1 point,Tue May 26 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"My concern if they made it online: if it existed as is, RNG would be very prominent since card availability is so scarce....to this end, the meta would be figured out really quick since the card pool is so small. I think if it happened, they would have to expand the cardbase a lot, otherwise the fun would be diluted fast...right now it fills its niche as a minigame.   I think it would be cool to open it up online, but there would have to be a big balancing act and a ton of additions/tweaks to make it work. It could happen and be really fun, but I think as it stands, they have a limited design space since there are only so many characters (how many heroes could you add? -- unless they tied into expansions)....  ya tldr it's a fun game now, and I voted yes (just curious if everyone felt similarly)...but expanding it online would require a lot more support to work and be sustained."
Destiny,37agmi,syunfox,1 point,Tue May 26 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"I dont consider RNG affecting the outcome of the game to be much of an issue (maybe just an issue with card games in general, or that i only see gwent as being a comfy casual game to play without any sort of comp scene). It also happens quite often in hearthstone where players lose because they were unable to draw cards to use for the early game and get outpaced by their opponent. Other than that, i'd agree on a card expansion to further diversify each of the faction decks to have one or two ways it can specialize in."
Destiny,37agmi,getintheVandell,1 point,Tue May 26 06:01:27 2015 UTC,"Ya I agree. I wasn't necessarily saying that as a negative thing. For instance, having played both, MTG has much more RNG than Hearthstone because there are Lands involved that add mana. Instead of Hearthstone adding a mana each turn, in Magic you draw lands in your opening hand and subsequent turns, which can lead to games where you or your opponent don't even get to play, or where one has a significant disadvantage based on mana screw or mana flood.      However, MTG was designed with this is mind because the randomness adds a fun factor and allows lesser players to beat better ones (otherwise a game without RNG would basically be the equivalent to chess).   The reason I mentioned it is simply a reminder it would be very apparent and some people may not like that. However, minimizing RNG could happen via expansion of card pool -- right now could really only be casual since there isn't much diversity. Basically agree with you, just clarifying that I didn't mean it in a bad way, except that adding more cards would mostly be a positive thing."
Destiny,37agmi,iopq,1 point,Tue May 26 06:12:23 2015 UTC,"My only issue with Gwent from a design standpoint is that it's all about collection moreso than composition. There are no resource mechanics besides card draw, so your only goal is to collect twenty two 10-strength units, supplement it with spies/medics, and bam, you win.  Now. This works for the Witcher 3, where it feels like character progression, but not if you want to make Gwent into a legit card game in the real world. There either needs to be more rules for structuring or a resource mechanic so that the only deck building strategy isn't just ""load it with powerful cards."""
Destiny,37agmi,iopq,1 point,Tue May 26 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"Collect twenty-two 10 strength units? Say hello to scorch.  15 point hero cards are broken as all hell, though. Your normal cards should do as much damage as your hero cards because they are affected by weather and scorch and so forth. Having cards that do 15 right off the bat is kind of broken. Maybe 7 strength hero cards are about right since they're not as powerful as stacking regular cards (two boys for 5 = 20, 40 with horn), but having two 15 damage heroes is almost always better (weather, no scorchings, not having to waste a horn or ability, etc.)"
Destiny,37agmi,Sherman72,1 point,Wed May 27 07:48:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine, Gwent is about conserving cards. If there was some reason to have cards like poor fucking infantry in your deck, it would be balanced better, though.  Maybe the competitive mode could cap the total nominal damage in your deck."

Not to mention completely fucking crazy, but no one sees that because 'like omg, so hot, look at my red hair and my jovial nature.' Amnesia and faking drunkenness to steal a kiss? You'll be a slave to her mind games all your life.  Yennifer on the other hand is a stone-cold fox. She may be a mean bitch at times, but that's because she always says whats on her mind, and never minces words. She'll run you into the ground if you're a spineless bitch boy. You say some stupid shit and she'll not hesitate to call you a cockless retard. But if you're man enough for her, if you can stand up to her sharp wit and piercing gaze, then she'll worship you as a god, while at the same murder anyone who ever crosses you. Literally the perfect waifu."

Triss has leftover emotions towards him since they dated in the Witcher 2 and broke up at the end of the game (its unclear but they both assume they broke up) Yennefer is a mother figure to Ciri while Triss is more of a big sister, more stuff gets revealed later on and relationships evolve as well.

Destiny,3720rb,dank_memez,7,Mon May 25 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"Why is Hitler so naive?  It's like he's incapable of understanding that no system is perfect, that innocents will always slip through the cracks, and that in any situation where a system can be abused, it will.    When he suggests that criminals currently sentenced to life in prison or execution should instead be sentenced to life in work camp, does he not understand what he's incentivizing?  It's not like we already have a problem with for profit private prisons and corrupt judges sending people to jail on trumped up charges. So now we should also allow the government to directly profit and, more importantly, dictate the efforts and labors of its imprisoned citizens? Yeah, no way would righteous and upstanding government officials ever be tempted to abuse that kind of power.  Does Hitler believe the world is separated between the Aryan Master Race and dirty jews? Where is the room for chinks and niggers? For half breed crackers and toilet cleaning taco bells?  I got really rustled, sorry."

Destiny,36vns9,nihil2909,-1,Sat May 23 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"The idea that raising the minimum wage will reduce employment in low skill workers is not necessarily true. In a perfect market, with buyers of labor (employers) and sellers of labors (individual workers) equal in terms of influence in the market, theory will predict a decrease in employment.   However, a few studies have been made to show that this is not necessarily true.   http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/minwage-unemp.pdf  Here are a couple of papers, granted they are rather old, that show how raising the minimum wage will not necessarily cause employment to decrease.  Now you might say that goes against economic theory. Actually there is a model for the labor market that is more consistent with the results of these two studies, a monopsony model. This means that employers have market power in the labor market (similar to a monopoly).   In the monopsony model, raising the minimum wage by a small amount (small is up to interpretation), will not decrease employment but actually raise employment in low skill workers.  So this article has some theoretical truth to it, but I wanted to add another perspective."

Destiny,36g4yg,Quivex,1 point,Tue May 19 03:41:11 2015 UTC,If you actually didn't do anything wrong(like you're sure of this) check if you're using any extensions that might change your IP? Things like unblocking extensions(hola unblocker etc.) I frequently visit chat only to see I'm IP banned from whatever IP browsec is giving to me at the time. Disabling the extension will give my native (unbanned) IP back to me.   Edit: in fact I see in your chat logs you say you use a VPN. It's probably that. Disable and try again. You're not actually banned.  Edit 2: In fact after further reading your chat logs you already confirmed it's browsec lol. Guess this comment was pointless!

Destiny,3677f7,densaki,2,Sun May 17 11:19:09 2015 UTC,"One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. ''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks."" Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: ""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."""

The only way to deal with her is to position in a way where she will have to blow her combo on someone else (literally full pussy mode, sitting yards behind another vulnerable carry) And then when she goes in, to not be afraid to get as much damage on her as possible. One crit from a 3 item AD should bring her to half health. Any cc will kill her. If everyone gets essentially one auto / ability on her she's gone.  Watching the game where Destiny was playing against her he wasn't playing that badly. There was a point where he gave her a free kill because he wasn't watching his character. The LB abused vision pretty well. However there were a few times where LB went in on someone else and instead of going for damage on her, he pussied out and ran backward.  First instinct should be to not be afraid of her, try to get something on her when she blows her combo (even if she's going in on you, before shes 17-0. After that you're relying on team composition and mechanical ability to blow her up)."

Watching the game where Destiny was playing against her he wasn't playing that badly.   He was consistently positioning like there wasn't an LB in the game."

Destiny,35r1dm,indigostarchild,0,Thu May 14 12:58:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on the child. If a child really wants to live their life of the opposite gender, and they really know that's what they want, there is no reason to wait until they're older. If a child is somewhat ambiguous about it, then maybe wait it out before deciding. But yes, there are definitely some people who know at quite an early age what they want to be, and are really unhappy pre-op. So go ahead with operation if they are really unhappy as they are. It doesn't matter if you're a child or adult, the decision isn't some rash decision. It's something they have been living with since they were born, and have enough certainty about that they want to do it as soon as possible. No reason to make them wait."

I was picking my nose and playing FF7."
Destiny,35r1dm,Malletr,1 point,Tue May 12 21:31:54 2015 UTC,From what I got here is that his point is being trans is a choice. If it's not a choice then it must be genetic and if it is genetic then the earlier treatment starts the better it would be for the child. I'm pretty sure that's what the email says. So for me the fact that everyone is criticizing him for suggesting this as a choice for trans proves the argument that trans is in fact a choice altogether. That's the argument that I am agreeing with. So basically yes children at the age of 12 should not be given this choice bc they are stupid. But then you are admitting being trans is not genetic.
Destiny,35r1dm,lol-da-mar-s-cool,11,Wed May 13 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"Its genetic yes, but some kids still might pretend just for attention. 12 year olds are usually little shits."
Destiny,35r1dm,Malletr,2,Wed May 13 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"I mean I am not disagreeing with that. But it doesn't seem like anyone has put a good response to this e-mail and just calling it dumb. It doesn't seem that dumb to me, so I was more looking for a response to the argument as a whole not to a single point about 12 yr olds.   Given that it is genetic, it still doesn't answer the question what if in the future we are able to identify that gene and determine the orientation/sex/gender of that person. Would you allow your 12 yr old to make the switch given that test or would you still wait for the 12 yr old to realize his lifestyle?"
Destiny,35r1dm,lol-da-mar-s-cool,2,Wed May 13 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"Its more the fact that someone was so personally offended that they felt the need to type up an essay and send it to.  If I could know for certain that it was genetic 100% without a doubt, then yes of course I would have the treatment done. I think most sane people would as well. But we are not at that point yet."

He however does none of that and just spits out a bunch of shit and acts like it is fact."
Destiny,35r1dm,Malletr,0,Wed May 13 05:30:41 2015 UTC,I made a reply to the comment below you. It's the same reply to both of you though.
Destiny,35r1dm,Noobity,9,Wed May 13 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't think his points were awful, but they rely on you being able to accept that a young child can experience and determine their own sex.   As a personal anecdote, when I was 12 I was not fat, but was gaining weight and had some pretty impressive manboobs. Additionally I had a decently high pitched voice. I was (at the time) determined that I was meant to be a girl, and it bugged me that I was a dude. I'd thought the doctors or something had messed up without having any real idea how that shit worked.  What this dude is saying is that my 1-2 years worth of confusion should have started me on the path to becoming a woman. This would have been a humongous mistake and would have completely fucked me now, in my happily male body.  You simply do not know what the fuck you're talking about when talking about anything when you're 12. I'm not saying repress them, but don't fucking change their body chemistry because they're exploring or confused or anything like that."
Destiny,35r1dm,Malletr,0,Tue May 12 21:16:43 2015 UTC,From what I got here is that his point is being trans is a choice.  If it's not a choice then it must be genetic and if it is genetic then the earlier treatment starts the better it would be for the child.  I'm pretty sure that's what the email says. So for me the fact that everyone is criticizing him for suggesting this as a choice for trans proves the argument that trans is in fact a choice altogether.  That's the argument that I am agreeing with. So basically yes children at the age of 12 should not be given this choice bc they are stupid. But then you are admitting being trans is not genetic.  Edit: I guess just to add on. The reason I feel bad is because these arguments were able to convince me that homosexuality is a choice which although I think is wrong I don't really have good arguments why.
Destiny,35r1dm,Noobity,2,Wed May 13 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it's saying this is a choice. I'm saying it's more a realization than a choice. I don't believe children can make that realization accurately. If we had a 99% accurate way to genetically prove that this is an issue I'd say go for it, start those treatments as early as the body can handle them. But since we don't we have to rely on human... cognizance(?) (whether it be to understand or become, depending on your definition, and I personally believe it's understand). That's not something I will allow my 12 year old to make a decision based on, and will gladly accept their hatred if it means erring on the side of caution so as not to irreversibly change their body. My fiance' doesn't necessarily agree with me, it's something we're discussing now and is extremely frustrating.  But generally, I don't think that you should feel bad. I think that you're thinking through the situation in a decent manner. No reason to accept that homosexuality is not a choice when it's largely something that can't be proven. I accept it because the homosexuals in my life tell me it's not. Doesn't mean I'm not going to question it with understanding and an attempt at logical discussion."
Destiny,35r1dm,shadier,1 point,Wed May 13 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Being trans isn't a choice, transitioning is. Just as there are people who may have been confused with their sexuality at a young age there are people who may have thought they may be trans at a young age. Unfortunately transitioning is a lot more permanent than experimenting. Beyond that when we're young we don't have the mental capacity to really understand how life altering the choice to transition could be and it's not safe to allow a 12 year old to make such a huge decision.  Just because you're born gay or born trans doesn't mean you're born 100% understanding that."
Destiny,35r1dm,CT_Legacy,-13,Wed May 13 07:45:28 2015 UTC,TL;DR but basically he's saying fat people are born fat? lol Yeah that's why Africa is so full of fat people because it's random genetics right>?
Destiny,35r1dm,Ally0fJustice,7,Tue May 12 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"He's saying the exact opposite. In his warped mind, he proves that homosexuality is a choice by proving that being fat is a choice."

From what I've seen while browsing streams he is usually at the 1-2.5k viewer amount which is sometimes less, but mostly the same as before.   Steven always struck me as the type to gain a big crowd that followed him to each game to see how he felt about different things and hear his opinions while interacting with him. His Dark Souls, DayZ, Bloodbourne, and Xcom playthroughs are where I felt he really shined and it's because he's having fun while doing it while, on the flip side, the community gets what it wants really well through those games. It's a shame he never picked up the Xcom expansion along with the Long War mod.  I think when it comes down to it, Steven is still chasing that esports professional status from back in his ""once upon a time"" days. It seems he just turns his back on what his viewers and fans want out of his stream in exchange for what he hopes the demographic who doesn't watch his stream will grab on to. Not to say that what I want is ""correct"" or that I speak for anyone but myself, just that he is catering to an untapped market rather than growing an already substantial one.  Maybe one day he'll be known as Destiny ""the LoL player"" instead of Destiny ""the Streamer"". If he makes it then good for him. Though as an old fan of his it'll always just be a disappointing thought of what once was and what could have been."

Any retard with an RTS background who got into SC2 as early as he did and had the freedom to play it all day every day and not worry about school or work would have got GM in NA. See: Deezer and the innumerable other barely-literate teenagers who made it to GM because they had nothing else going on in their lives.   He's got a bad case of NA syndrome. Big ego, tilter, takes all criticism as an insult, and despite all the lip-service he pays to self-improvement and discipline, in the back of his head he is the chosen one. Anyone from EU who has played any competitive game on NA servers knows how ubiquitous this attitude is. It's why NA teams suck vs EU teams in every game and why 60% of the top NA players are Canadian despite that country having like half the population of England."

Yes, the people who voted Tory are morons and I count the night I spent in an airport terminal battling a speed comedown while watching those results coming in as the worst night of my life, because the party of investment bankers and aristocrats that sadistically tormented unemployed and disabled people while presiding over a double and almost triple dip recession had won an almost 100 seat lead over Labour, who I also despise but less-so. I didn't hear a single argument for the conservatives that wasn't fallacious or simply an easily verifiable lie (eg we have a deficit because Labour ""overspent"").    And my comments about Hotbids fucking atrocious writing and Germany's imperialism were both clearly correct. Yanis Varoufakis made the same observation a few weeks later."

ALSO, league provides plenty of feedback whenever we make a mistake while playing, the game is fucking designed for it, he doesn't need 100 autismo's yelling in chat every time he dies, the game will provide and punish his mistakes enough, and he is conscious enough to improve on his play without your special snowflake feedback..

Destiny,35ge6v,PainusMania2018,-8,Mon May 11 06:35:32 2015 UTC,"The interesting bit is that The Red Pill scene and in fact most of the movies barrow heavily from Marxian and Revolutionary thinking. And the resistance is more in line with the supposed SJW and Marxist thinking. Don't believe me?   Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.  Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.   Go through Marxist writings on Capitalism and Feminist writings on Patriarchy, then compare and contrast.  On another note, it turned out the machines were in control the whole time, both of the Matrix itself and of Zion. If we follow this framework and either Destiny or Nathon are the chosen one, the only outcomes are:  1: They make the ""personal choice,"" resulting in the total destruction of ""Humanity's Freedom."" SJW victory.  2: They make the ""selfless choice"" resulting in a continuation of the system that is ultimately controlled and utilized by the SJW. SJW victory.  3: They make the personal choice, but an error results in a threat to both ""humanity's freedom"" and the SJWs. A peace agreement is made, and they destroy the error but at the cost of their own lives. The peace is, however fragile, and hostilities are likely inevitable. If they resume, the SJWs possess all the strength necessary to eliminate any resistance and restart the system. SJW victory.  Anita Sarkeesian: You are here because the Patriarchy is about to be destroyed, its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.  Destiny/Nathan: Bullshit.  Anita Sarkeesian: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it."

The way you ran your program, if tails came out first, it was then the next coin was forced to be heads, which is why it seems that P(TH) = 50%. But it's not, because in the case that you got tails for your first flip, the second flip will never be truly random, because it must then be heads.  When running the simulation you have to allow Tails Tails, to happen. Each out come would happen around 25,000 times, and we would then remove all the TT outcomes.  This means we would have 25,000 HH, 25,000 TH and 25,000 HT.  Possible outcomes/successful outcomes means 25,000/75,000 = 1/3"

Destiny,35e1z8,TheNumberYellow,2,Sat May 9 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Second question of article  Boy or Girl paradox:        Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   This question is identical to question one, except that instead of specifying that the older child is a boy, it is specified that at least one of them is a boy. In response to reader criticism of the question posed in 1959, Gardner agreed that a precise formulation of the question is critical to getting different answers for question 1 and 2. Specifically, Gardner argued that a ""failure to specify the randomizing procedure"" could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct ways:   From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1/3. From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1/2.     Grinstead and Snell argue that the question is ambiguous in much the same way Gardner did.   For example, if you see the children in the garden, you may see a boy. The other child may be hidden behind a tree. In this case, the statement is equivalent to the second (the child that you can see is a boy). The first statement does not match as one case is one boy, one girl. Then the girl may be visible. (The first statement says that it can be either.)  While it is certainly true that every possible Mr. Smith has at least one boy (i.e., the condition is necessary) it is not clear that every Mr. Smith with at least one boy is intended. That is, the problem statement does not say that having a boy is a sufficient condition for Mr. Smith to be identified as having a boy this way.  Commenting on Gardner's version of the problem, Bar-Hillel and Falk  note that ""Mr. Smith, unlike the reader, is presumably aware of the sex of both of his children when making this statement"", i.e. that 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' If it is further assumed that Mr Smith would report this fact if it were true then the correct answer is 1/3 as Gardner intended.     Interesting: Raymond S.

Destiny,3594gt,whitealien,8,Fri May 8 03:25:55 2015 UTC,"There are still three outcomes... all you know is that one of the outcomes has a crit. What you don't know is which set of outcomes it was:   Crit - Hit Hit - Crit Crit - Crit   The way you're thinking of it is that you're starting with a guaranteed hit, then letting the second hit determine the outcome. I realize you tried to avoid wording it that way when you said ""one of the [1st or 2nd] hit is a crit,"" but you explicitly state that the only determinant of the outcome is the unknown coin. You can't take that crit as your first hit and then flip for the second, because it is possible that that crit was made on the second attempt. Rather, when you take that first guaranteed crit, there were still three ways that that crit could have been generated (listed above), and you have to consider all three. The only scenarios you're considering are crit - hit, and crit - crit, because you've left off the hit - crit.  You can plug this into excel if you want and run it with 1000 trials, eliminating any trial where there are two hits instead of a crit (you'll get 33%). Alternatively, you can just replace any hit-hit with a hit-crit, if you're of that persuasion (you'll get 25%).  The one scenario that simply does not work is the 50%.  Full explanation of the 33% and the 25% here."
Destiny,3594gt,MadDogWest,1 point,Fri May 8 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"Here is how 50% makes sense. Don't look at the problem like you are trying to determine the possibility of whether the first or second is going to be a crit or both. That doesn't matter in the context of the question. Knowing that at least one of them is a crit already, the possible solutions to the question would be ""both are crits"" or ""only one is a crit"" (aka one coin with 2 heads). No crit/hit, hit/crit, crit/crit bs. The order does not matter in the context of the question so crit/hit would be the same as hit/crit.  Edit: That is how 50% makes sense. I personally don't believe we have been given enough information in the question to determine which method is the correct to use.

When you say ""at least one is a crit,"" that means if the first hit is a miss, then you will be guaranteed that the second is a hit. In gambling is would be to say tails+tails will be reflipped till it's tails+heads.  So when you remove that, you realize that the first Option you wrote is the SAME as the second option. Because you don't care which order it happens. Since they are the same, outcome, there are only 2 TOTAL options. Hence 50%.  tl;dr when you say ""at least one is a crit,"" from the possible outcomes, Crit/Hit and Hit/Crit are the same event. Since you don't care in which order they happen.

This leaves you with a situation where you have boy/girl, girl/boy, and boy/boy as equally likely outcomes with a 33% chance of each outcome.   HOWEVER, if the problem did actually specify that the first child was a boy then its easy to see that the chance for the second to be a boy is 50%. This is a valid question in its own right, but I contend that it is not the one that we are presented with.   Wiki Article  We are presented with a problem matching the form of the ""Second Question"" which has multiple mathematical proofs which arrive at an answer of 1/3."
Destiny,3594gt,Zenithor,1 point,Fri May 8 08:48:58 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Analysis of the ambiguity of article  Boy or Girl paradox:       If it is assumed that this information was obtained by looking at both children to see if there is at least one boy, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Three of the four equally probable events for a two-child family in the sample space above meet the condition, as in this table:  Thus, if it is assumed that both children were considered while looking for a boy, the answer to question 2 is 1/3. However, if the family was first selected and then a random, true statement was made about the gender of one child in that family, whether or not both were considered, the correct way to calculate the conditional probability is not to count all of the cases that include a child with that gender. Instead, one must consider only the probabilities where the statement will be made in each case.  So, if ALOB represents the event where the statement is ""at least one boy,"" and ALOG represents the event where the statement is ""at least one girl,"" then this table describes the sample space:  So, if you are told that at least one is a boy when the fact is chosen randomly, the probability that both are boys is P(ALOB and BB)/P(ALOB) = (1/4)/(0+1/8+1/8+1/4)=1/2.

With the way the problem is worded, it seems that the second hit must be a crit if the first was not.  It's not even a matter of the probability, it's the interpretation of the question.   I don't think anyone is stupid enough to argue that it's 1/3 if you simulate it this way.  If you were to add up the number of crits in this simulation (in the counted results) and divide it by the number of attempts, you would find that the crit percentage is not 50%."

You only increment total when there's at least one crit. Then you're ignoring the 25% chance of noncrit/noncrit at the end when you calculate percentage.  Even if the rule is that there must be at least one crit, you can't just ignore the outcomes. If the first hit results in a noncrit, the second hit must result in a crit, you shouldn't even try for the possibility of a second non-crit and then go on to ignore it so the logic of your code is incorrect."
Destiny,357xuc,Stanlot,8,Thu May 7 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"The problem statement (starts at 3h57min in this VOD: http://www.twitch.tv/destiny/v/4769160?t=3h57m) is:  You hit an enemy twice. At least one of the hits is a crit. Assuming a 50% crit chance, what is the probability both hits are crits?  Sentence 2 states:  At least one of the hits is a crit.  We are only looking at situations where at least one hit is a crit. This is why all noncrit/noncrit scenarios are discarded. In other words, we are trying to find the probability of getting 2 crits given that 1 crit has occurred. This is a conditional probability problem which can be defined as:   P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)          (Eq. 1)   Where A = 2 crits and                    (S1)   Where B = at least 1 crit          (S2)     To find the solution to Eq. 1 we must first find the value of P(A u B) and P(B).     Finding P(B) Let C = crit   Let N = no crit     Table 1: Total possible outcomes for 2 hits   NN   CC   NC   CN     P(B), as defined in S2, is the probability of at least 1 crit.

A and B only intersect (satisfy both events) in 1 situation: when there are 2 crits. Referencing Table 1, the following instance represents 2 crits: CC. This combination is out of a total of 4 possible combinations.      Therefore P(A ∩ B) = 1/4     We can now solve Eq. 1.      P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) = (1/4)/(3/4) = .33"

If you assume that, then you're left with what I got, which is 25% to double crit. Otherwise, you'd be right."

Your ""one hit will crit"" actually sounds more like the 25% way of reading it.

Your pick!  That's the beauty of paradoxes. You get to really churn that hatred of the people that read it differently. You get to delve into the most extreme hatred of a person that you've never seen that you can have. It's all linguistics how you read the fucking question. All answers are perfectly valid. You can argue which way of reading it is the most probable one, but that has been tested in the case of the boy or girl paradox and the result is that people willl have different answer depending on which words you emphasize.  ""One hit will crit"" is the 25% way because to satisfy that clause the game only needs to change all hits after non-crits to be crits, which doesn't affect the probability of a double crit. You can read ""at least one hit is a crit"" as ""one hit will crit"" because you can read ""hit"" in the first sentence in the present tense in the sense that you're going to hit the enemy twice. To achieve this you would code to make the hit after a non-crit hit a 100% crit chance.  EDIT: To achieve this I could also code the game to always crit on the first hit or always have a guaranteed hit in every two hits. However, if the first hit was always a hit the player would know and abuse this and it would double the amount of two crits in a row. If I randomly selected a guaranteed crit in every two hits it would less prone to abuse but would still double to amount of double crits, but that could be what I wanted to achieve. I.e. the 50% way.  To achieve the 33% way in a game I could code every set of two hits to reroll all double non-crits. This would however require every two hits to be a set that happens at the same time, unless somebody comes up with a more elaborate solution."

Destiny,355k9u,Dysssfunctional,3,Thu May 7 08:24:58 2015 UTC,Just because the chances of getting HH after getting T is 0% doesn't mean that getting a T on the first toss is an impossibility. So you have to account for getting T on the first toss as well when calculating the probability.
Destiny,355k9u,tcpaul,0,Thu May 7 08:33:11 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm saying. Where did you read that T on the first roll was an impossiblity? It IS a 50% chance of T on the first toss in my example, not an impossiblity.  To rephrase it: If you rolled T on the first 50% roll, now you know you will roll H to satisfy the condition but HH (the goal) is impossible at this point. If you rolled H on the first 50% roll, now you have a 50% chance of rolling either H or F which makes the chance of HH: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25."
Destiny,355k9u,tcpaul,-1,Thu May 7 08:48:55 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm not saying that 33% is wrong because it's all up to interpretation of the question.  I replied to you because your tree is very similar to the first one I drew and was interested in how you got a different answer. http://i.imgur.com/egIAkkM.png From my tree I count 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.  EDIT: The main point is that in a tree like this the first roll can take you to a path that doesn't contain any goal states. Thus cutting out branches from the path of failure doesn't affect the probability of any outcome in the other path. The probabilities in your tree would be 25% for HH, 25% for HT and 50% for TH. However, 25%, 33% and 50% are all correct depending on your interpretation of the question. I just think your tree actually shows the 25% way while trying to show the 33% way."

Destiny,355w4m,Brolympia,6,Thu May 7 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"25% is not a legitimate answer, and I would encourage people who believe that 25% is the answer to learn more about probability.   I would encourage you to learn more about logic. The 25% way isn't about math but about the logic in interpreting the question. As a coder it was the first thing that came to my mind because that's how it would actually work in a game. The crit question has an extra interpretation compared to the boy or girl paradox.  The 25% interpretation (at least mine) is: if the first hit is a non-crit then the game forces the next hit to be a crit. This stems from the line ""at least one of the hits is a crit"". In the boy or girl case, ""at least one of them is a boy"", it's clear that this (the world forcing the next one to be a boy) can't be the case because that's not how the world works. In games however that sort of critical hit forcing or pseudo random crit distribution is often used. LoL has some sort of a system like that and so does Dota http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Pseudo-random_distribution. The question's pseudo randomness would obviously be extreme.  If the system in this question was used in a game, where you would observe the chance of crit hit by hit, it would leave you at a 25% chance to crit twice in a row, which is what it would be without the system. The code is there to help you to not have rows of non-crits. The code comes in to effect only when you don't crit on your first hit, to help you crit after the non-crit. It doesn't come in to effect if the first hit was already a crit thus NOT helping the probability of a double crit.  http://i.imgur.com/egIAkkM.png Chance of two crits in a row: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The code makes ONLY the miss-crit outcome more probable, which is now 50%. This is the coder's 25% interpretation.  I understood the other interpretations after reading the ""at least one of the hits is a crit"" some more times, heh. It would've been a lot clearer if it had said ""at least one of them was a crit"" and ""what is the probability that both hits were crits?"". The ""you hit an enemy"" where hit can mean both the present and the imperfect tense also makes me think hit by hit compared to the clearer ""has two children"". The boy or girl paradox is a lot clearer in this sense and leaves no room for this kind of interpretation."

In the terms of the coin toss game at the casino:  If you're playing in a world where all coin tosses after tails will be heads, then your chance of tossing HH is 25% because the condition doesn't help.  If you're playing in a world where the dealer tosses a pair of coins and discards it if it's TT, then your chance of HH is 33%. For example the dealer tosses 4 pairs of coins at the same time. On average there's one TT which is discarded leaving 3 options where on average one is going to be HH for a 33% chance.

No information about the other child is available and thus the chance is 50%. It effectively reduces the sample size, since now one child is set. It is now a 'draw one ball out of the urn' problem. B: He knows both children (the complete sample). The information is now spread over the whole sample, unlike in the above example where information is available only for a subsample. It is now a 'draw two balls out of the urn' problem which leads to the 33% chance.   So how can we reconcile both solutions with each other? If we look at 2 children families in general the probabilties of BB BG GB GG are equally likely. If we now exclude GG we have the 3 possibilties with 33% chance each. But in case A and the BB constellation our certain someone could know either of the two boys and therefore the chance has to be doubled. With a rough calcualtion we get 2*33% for BB and 33%+33% for either BG or GB, which leads to 66%:66% which is exactly the 50%:50% of case A.  In the end it is comes down to the question (or language in general) being amgibuous. Case B is the approach which is more prevalent in mathematics, essentially meaning that formulation like 'at least something' always refers to the whole sample."

Destiny,355w4m,Ally0fJustice,4,Thu May 7 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't listen to your discussion of the paradox, but that wikipedia page is inaccurate.  And I think this is leading you to conclude that Destiny's question could be interpreted as the 1/2 interpretation.  But in fact - this is wrong.  That page claims that the ambiguity of the phrase:  ""at least one of them"" is confirmed in the Bar-Hillel, Falk paper.  In fact, Bar-Hillel and Falk argue that there is no ambiguity.  They state explicitly that the  phrase ""at least one of"" applies specifically to the 1/3 scenario.  And they use a variant of the second son case to show why.  You can find the paper itself here:  https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp280/10spring/class/19/Teasers.pdf  The Bar-Hillel, Falk  second son problem goes like this:  You are walking down the street and you randomly encounter Mr Smith walking with his son.  You've heard via the grapevine that Mr Smith has two children.  But that is all you knew about him prior to this encounter.  What is the probability that he has two sons?  In this case the answer is unambiguously 1/2 under the assumption that Mr Smith chose which child to accompany him randomly.  It's only 1/3 under the assumption that when people generally go for walks they always choose a boy if they can (i.e. they don't have two girls).  But this is clearly a perverse assumption to make given the context outlined by the question and what we know about the world.  Why would someone asking this question make THIS assumption about the real world?  You can stick to your guns and claim either interpretation is valid - but most people would  think you odd if you asked the question that implies the 1/3 answer.  If you lived in a culture where people always chose the sons to walk with - then the 1/3 intepretation would be reasonable.  We don't - so it's not.  And this is exactly what Bar-Hillel and Falk argue.  When they discuss Gardner's variant they write:   Another version of the Second-Son problem is presented by Gardner:  'Mr Smith says:  ""I have two children and at least one of them is a boy"".  What is the probability that the other child is a boy?'  Gardner derives and answer of 1/3 based on the equiprobability of BB, BG, and GB.  He is not, however, in disagreement with our analysis.  He is merely addressing a different problem!""   For some reason Gardner went on to take the moral of Bar-Hillel/Falk's paper as being that his original formulation was ambiguous.  This was just wrong.  And reading his presentation - he gives no argument in rebuttal of Bar-Hillel defending his new interpretation.  You can read that presentation on page 226 of:  https://bobson.ludost.net/copycrime/mgardner/gardner02.pdf  While in both cases it is true that you now know that ""at least one of"" Mr Smith's children is a boy, in the Bar-Hillel/Falk  second son problem you also have additional relevenat information about how parents and children organise to walk together - information that you can reasonably infer from the fact that people don't always choose to walk with their son's.  This information changes the event space.  And it's not reasonable to add that information in the Gardner case.  In that case, you know less.  Getting back to Destiny's question - it's clear that his is structurally isomorphic to the Gardner example and NOT the Bar-Hillel/Falk example.  So it's just not right to say there is any ambiguity at all.  The probability is 1/3."
Destiny,355w4m,grovulent,1 point,Thu May 7 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"It's true that there is no ambiguity... people are having trouble because there are many wrong scenarios to the problem. I believed it was 33%, but not so much now... There is, and always, a 50% chance of a crit on attack. That means if you run the scenario 100 times, the first attack of each event is a 50/50 hit or crit. So now you have 50 crit and 50 hits as your first attack. Since you cannot have a hit/hit, the 50 hit events MUST be followed by a crit. There are 50 hit/crit events. You also have 50 crits on the first hit... and since there is a 50% chance of a hit or crit, and the condition for at least one crit is already satisfied, the chance of a hit following a crit is 25%, and the chance of a crit following a crit is 25%...  I stumbled upon something while typing this though.... my argument (to me) seems valid until you hit first. If there is a 50/50 chance, then how can the crit be 100% probable, given that it follows a hit. This leads me to believe that the actual question is impossible... logically, at least. The premises given in the problem contradict each other."

Destiny,355w4m,Bojakn,0,Thu May 7 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"I was really on the side of 33% at first but then I thought about it this way: Say Destiny makes his first attack over 1000 different instances. 500 of them should crit, 500 should not. Since we have to accept that there must be at least one crit in two successive attacks, all the hits that don't crit must follow up with a crit. So in 500 scenarios, the outcome is no crit/crit. In the remaining 500 scenarios, wouldn't the second hit be 50% crit or no crit? Meaning 250 scenarios with the outcome crit/crit and 250 scenarios crit/no crit?  So you'd get   500 no crit/crit  250 crit/crit   250 crit/no crit   or 25% to crit twice?  Am I going about this wrong?"
Destiny,355w4m,Stanlot,2,Thu May 7 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"That's not how probability works. If you flip a coin once and its heads, that does not entitle the next flip to automatically become tails simply because the probability is 1/2. This is the problem with people believing the answer is 25%. I see why people believe it can be 25%, but that isn't how it works."
Destiny,355w4m,i_love_Cheekzz,1 point,Fri May 8 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"I know that in reality each individual flip result is independent of any other but for this problem, it says that at least one of the two flips has to be heads. I assumed that meant that if you get tails first, the second is forced to be heads because of the confines of the rule."
Destiny,355w4m,Stanlot,1 point,Fri May 8 01:27:02 2015 UTC,"That is correct, if you get tails first, then the 2nd one has to be heads according to the problem. But that isn't the only outcome. You can have tails be the 2nd flip. Or you could not get tails at all, and have both flips be heads (which is what we are looking for). 3 possible outcomes, and one of them is Heads/Heads, therefore it is 1/3 or 33%"
Destiny,355w4m,i_love_Cheekzz,1 point,Fri May 8 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of ""At least one of the hits is a crit."" meant that if you get tails first, you don't bother flipping again and assume that the second flip is heads. In this case, there is no possible case of tails/tails. I guess it depends on what the exact meaning of that rule is?"
Destiny,355w4m,Stanlot,1 point,Fri May 8 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah see that's the problem. You can't automatically assume a variable in the probability, at least not in this question. If the question said ""one flip is exactly tails"" or ""the 2nd flip is heads"" then you could do that.  There is no possible case of tails/tails, which is why it isn't included in the final probability. The final possible out comes are  Tails, Heads  Heads, Tails  Heads, Heads  This is based on the idea that ""at least one flip is heads"". Therefore one of these outcomes must happen. Now you want to calculate the possibility of getting two heads in a row or two crits in a row. You know there is only one outcome that contains the Heads,Heads out of the 3 outcomes given. So it's 1/3"
Destiny,355w4m,i_love_Cheekzz,1 point,Fri May 8 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"I thought of it like this:  You make the attack 100 times.  You'll likely get this (T = true/crit, F = false/no crit):  25 TT 25 TF 25 FT 25 FF  In other words, each of these scenarios has a 25% probability of happening.  This is using our assumption that each hit has a 50% crit chance.  Our result condition (that at least one was a crit) does not change these probabilities.   Now, we randomly pick one of these 100 trials to be ""our trial"" that matches the problem.  Except here's where that condition comes in.  We have to pick a trial that has at least 1 crit, so we remove the 25 FF's from the pool of possible choices.  Now we only have 75.  So the odds that ""our trial"" is one of the 25 TT trials is 25/75 = 1/3."
Destiny,355w4m,20XD6,1 point,Fri May 8 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. If you eliminate all cases of FF, then you're left with 25TT/75 FT|TF|TT. But my issue is, why remove them? Because the problem says that there must be at least one crit in two attacks and that doesn't sound like it wants to exclude the FF cases, but rather that they don't exist in the context of the problem.   In other words, if you get F first, then you must get FT so, assuming that the first hit is really 50% either way, getting F first will always result in FT(50%), making it weigh more against the possibility of TF(25%) or TT(25%).  But the thing about that is that I'm making an assumption about what the problem's rule means."
Destiny,355w4m,Stanlot,1 point,Fri May 8 01:43:28 2015 UTC,"that doesn't sound like it wants to exclude the FF cases, but rather that they don't exist in the context of the problem   I think that's a problem with the wording of the question.  If there's always a 50% crit chance, there's no way that chance could change based on what happened on a previous hit.  The problem kind of makes it sound like you haven't attacked yet, which I think is a confusing way to look at it, because then people want to evaluate it one hit at a time."

Though where this question spawned from is from games where a system like this is used. Doesn't LoL have or used to have some variation of this? The system is in place in games to help not have rows of non-crits. The code only comes in to effect only when you don't crit on your first hit or x non-crit hits, to help you crit after the non-crit.

EDIT: To rephrase it: If you rolled F on the first 50% roll, now you know you will roll T to satisfy the condition but TT (the goal) is impossible at this point.

Destiny,355lua,i_love_Cheekzz,3,Thu May 7 09:27:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on what level of understanding you're interested in.    As I said - one thing a formal proof makes clear is the assumption of independence.  I can point explicitly to the step where that assumption is required.  This is not something your style of demonstration makes explicit at all.    It makes use of an analogy between destiny's question and coin tosses (which are always assumed to be independent).  But such an analogy is only appropriate if independence holds.  By using the analogy in the way that you have, you have just assumed independence without clarifying to your readers that you've made that assumption.  Sure - anyone who understands probability well will just make that assumption along with you - but for people learning about these concepts you risk conveying the impression that there are no restrictions on making these sorts of comparisons.  This is why I'd encourage everyone to invest in developing a formal understanding."

My intent in providing a formal analysis was to engage with any who might want to develop a deeper understanding.  And while I do agree with you that this level of depth is not required in order to get the main idea - still I do believe a formal analysis has a LOT of value - and I'm quite happy spending as much time with you as you like to help you understand why I think this.  And I'll do this because I think it will genuinely enrich your life.  There is probably a large degree of egotism in my desire to do this as you claim.  But maybe I can somehow demonstrate that it's not entirely egotism.  Having said this - I will counter that your comments are probably somewhat ego driven as well since you focus much more on demonstrating my egotism than addressing the core of my arguments.  Maybe we deserve each other.  :) - <non-sarcastic smiley - I assure you>
Destiny,355lua,Temil,1 point,Fri May 8 08:22:04 2015 UTC,"Actually - I'll say a little bit more than this.    It's because people like Russell and Whitehead went to such lengths to show that some arithmetic truths like 1+1 =2 can be proved with logic that led some to believe (including Russell and Whitehead) that ALL such arithmetic truths could be so proved.  It turned out that they were wrong.  Godel proved that they were wrong in his famous incompleteness proofs.  But if people like Russell and Whitehead had never tried to develop their formal system, it's likely that people like Godel would never have discovered why such an undertaking was flawed - and one of the most important and profound truths about mathematics would never have been understood."

Destiny,356mj2,weowsuchcointoss,2,Thu May 7 15:22:08 2015 UTC,are you actually this retarded?
Destiny,356mj2,Vypur,1 point,Thu May 7 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"First one is wrong.  Lets say you know one coin is going to be heads. There are actually either two out comes for your second flip(if you rolled heads first),or one outcome for second flip (if you rolled tails first), so discarding the first flip is incorrect.  33% is correct, the middle one is a good explanation. Probability always comes down to Successful/Possible outcomes.   Last one is incorrect because the probability that the first toss is tails is not 50%. It is actually 33%. it may seem counter intuitive, BUT this is Because we are doing two flips, with possibilities (HH), (HT) and (TH). As you see, (TT) is eliminated because it is GIVEN that there is no (TT), so if you look at the only three possibilities there are, Tails only happens 33% of the time."
Destiny,356mj2,calomando1004,2,Thu May 7 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"But that is how it works. If you were to toss 100 pairs of coins, since it is GIVEN that you got at least one heads, you must throw out the tails- tails. It's not at all possible for the coin flips to be tails tails which is why you discard those and 33% is the correct answer."
Destiny,356mj2,calomando1004,0,Thu May 7 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"That isn't what he's saying. I was a stern 33% but this morning I stumbled upon a strong 25% argument. Let me try to explain:  The first attack is a 50/50 probability of a hit or a crit. No matter what, there will always be a 50/50. If you ran the scenario 100 times, there will be 50 hits and 50 crits as the first attack. I'm hoping we agree there. NOW, since you MUST have a crit, if you hit on your first attack, you must crit the next attack. Since there are 50 hits, and you CANNOT have a hit/hit event, there is a 50% chance of the hit/crit event. When you crit first, the probability of the second hit does not change... you satisfy the condition of there being at least one crit. The only other restraint is the 50% crit chance... which means the second coin has a 50/50 chance as well...  Here's a great paint to show."
Destiny,356mj2,EmpyralT,1 point,Thu May 7 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is, once you get Tails you're saying there's a 100% chance of getting a crit once you get a non-crit. This isn't neccissarily true as depending on how you view the problem you either assume that No-Crit No-Crit is possible and just disregard those answers as they don't conform to the problem of having one hit be a Crit and re-roll the result OR you assume that one is guaranteed to be a Crit, in which case the chance of the other hit being a Crit is a 50/50. When you take a chance out of the problem you have to distribute the chances equally across them. So it can't be 25% ever.   This problem is the same as the problems in the boy or girl paradox, the first question is an example of an um-ambigous question, the second which is extremely similar to the one Destiny was commenting on has two results, 33% and 50% depending on how you see it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox#Second_question  Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?  Destiny has two hits. At least one of them is a crit. What is the probability that both hits are crits?"
Destiny,356mj2,Dunebug6,-2,Thu May 7 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"See, I don't think that's the case either. This isn't a real world scenario, this is strictly hypothetical. The question is assuming that, in a world where there MUST be a crit, when you hit first, there MUST be a crit following, and there cannot be a hit following a hit. It doesn't say that you can ""re-roll"" or disregard the hit/hit because it simply cannot happen, given the conditions."
Destiny,356mj2,EmpyralT,2,Thu May 7 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"It's a bad question either way, it's all perception."

Destiny,356mj2,EmpyralT,-2,Thu May 7 20:13:26 2015 UTC,yeah this is right because you have to treat the two sides independently (the sides of flipping heads first or tails first). after that flip the remaining possible outcomes on each side need to each remain 50% no matter WHAT because nothing that happens after the first flip can possibly change the probability of the first flip being 50% heads or 50% tails

The problem that Destiny is trying to solve is: ""You hit an enemy twice AT THE SAME TIME..."". This is not the original problem (in my interpretation), he has changed it. The problem changes wether the hits are at the same time or in succession. Wether ""you hit enemy twice"" implicates ""at the same time"" is up to the reader.  The system is in place in games to help not have rows of non-crits. In the games it does not help you crit twice. The code only comes in to effect when you don't crit to help you crit after the non-crit. It doesn't come in to effect if the first hit was already a crit thus NOT helping the probability of a double crit."
Destiny,355h3c,Dysssfunctional,-1,Thu May 7 07:22:25 2015 UTC,"I think its 50%...but only because of interpretation, I also agree with you that it can be 33% if you interpret the question in a certain way.

There are 3 ways the miss-miss can change: crit-crit, crit-miss, and miss-crit.  This makes the crit-crit have a 33% chance.  Kinda the same as how I illustrated"
Destiny,355h3c,pplwnnaflyaround,0,Thu May 7 07:25:34 2015 UTC,"Thing is, there is no miss-crit without miss-miss. To put it in poker terms, you're playing the opponent who will reshove 50% of his range vs your raise and call 50%. If he reshoves, we have to fold. If he calls, we have an option of cbetting the flop. Let's assume he hits the flop 50% of the time and doesn't fold and folds the 50% of the time. Our question is: what % of hands are we gonna win with cbet. Obviously out of 100 hands, 50 will get reshoved preflop, 25 will get action on the flop, and 25 will successfully get the pot on the flop. We can't cbet the flop if we get reshoved on preflop, your argument claims that we can. We can also ask ourselves: how often are we gonna get the pot on the flop if we decide to cbet. It's 50%, 25 out of 50 on 100 hand sample. There is no valid question that takes into account abstract possibility of cbetting the flop when we got reshoved on preflop."

Destiny,355e5c,_moofish,3,Thu May 7 06:42:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If we knew why or how it's guaranteed to have one crit, then we'd know if it's 33% or 50%.  For example, in League of Legends, non-crits add a certain crit% to the next hit, so if we said a champ has a 50% chance and hits twice, it's a 33% chance because the second hit is a guaranteed crit only if the first isn't.  However, if we're doing coins with a guaranteed heads, it changes. Do we know one is going to be heads because we're flipping a trick coin? Should be obvious that with a trick coin it's 50% overall chance. Do we know because of some psychic vision or it's already happened? Then there's no probability involved at all, as it's a pre-determined event. Do we know because we're literally throwing away all the tails-tails outcomes and saying they don't count? Then it goes back to 33% but we're being stupid about it.  We've got the X-X, X-O, O-O, and O-X outcomes, and we're saying it can't be X-X. We need to know why it can't be X-X to know whether the other three outcomes have equal probabilities, so long as we're working in practical materials."

Bayesian analysis of article  Boy or Girl paradox:       Following classical probability arguments, we consider a large basket containing two children. We assume equal probability that either is a boy or a girl. The three discernible cases are thus: 1. both are girls (GG) — with probability P(GG) = 0.25, 2. both are boys (BB) — with probability of P(BB) = 0.25, and 3. one of each (G.B) — with probability of P(G.B) = 0.50. These are the prior probabilities.  Now we add the additional assumption that ""at least one is a boy"" = B. Using Bayes' Theorem, we find  P(BB|B) = P(B|BB) · P(BB) / P(B) = 1 · 1/4 / 3/4 = 1/3.

We know as a fact that one of these hits was a crit, because we have been told by people who saw this event. Remember we are reviewing this from well after it happened.

Destiny,355e5c,TheNumberYellow,1 point,Thu May 7 08:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think where people are going wrong is they are not looking at this in terms of what needs to happen to arrive at an outcome of both hits being crits.  Assuming that you are firing the shots one at a time the following needs to happen to get two crits.    You hit the enemy the first time. There is a 50% chance that this first hit will be a crit.  If the first shot does not crit, the exercise is over.  At that point we'd be guaranteed one crit. If the shot does crit, then we fire the second shot and there is a 50% chance that this second shot will crit.    So, for two crits to happen, you must pass two 50% checks in a row. I'm not a math expert so I don't know how to calculate the chance that you will pass two 50% checks in a row. The answer to that question is the answer to this problem.  EDIT - To me it seems that the answer is 25%.  I watched the whole discussion on this, so I suppose this means I'm part of what Destiny considered the retard contingent in this discussion.    I still say it's 25% if you are firing the shots one at a time.  If you are firing the first shot separately, that is a separate event with a 50% chance of critting.  If you pass the first check, you must fire a second shot that now has it's own independent 50% chance of critting.  Eliminating the possibility of there being two misses doesn't change the fact that you must still pass two 50% checks to arrive at the outcome of two crits.  There is a 25% chance of passing these two checks.  The qualifier that one MUST be a crit is only relevant if the first 50% check fails.    If I'm going wrong, by all means someone point out my mistakes, but that's what it looks like to me."

The shots have already been fired and you know that at least one has crit.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox  Just to take some stuff from that, say a couple has no children. What are the chances that after having 2 children they will both be boys? 25%. This is the question you are answering but it is not the question being asked.  The question being asked is that if a couple already has 2 children and at least 1 is a boy, what is the chance that both are boys? The answer is either 33% or 50% depending on how you interpret it."
Destiny,355e5c,Chriscras66,1 point,Thu May 7 10:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's ambiguous. Using coins as an example, if you ensure that one of the coins is heads by flipping them both and then switching one of them to heads at random, then it's 50%. If however you flip both coins many times and only record the ones where there is at least one heads, then it's 33%.

Destiny,355e5c,paksam,1 point,Thu May 7 07:16:15 2015 UTC,"Boy or Girl paradox:       The Boy or Girl paradox surrounds a set of questions in probability theory which are also known as The Two Child Problem,  Mr. Smith's Children  and the Mrs. Smith Problem. The initial formulation of the question dates back to at least 1959, when Martin Gardner published one of the earliest variants of the paradox in Scientific American. Titled The Two Children Problem, he phrased the paradox as follows:   Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls? Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   Gardner initially gave the answers 1/2 and 1/3, respectively; but later acknowledged that the second question was ambiguous.  Its answer could be 1/2, depending on how you found out that one child was a boy. The ambiguity, depending on the exact wording and possible assumptions, was confirmed by Bar-Hillel and Falk,  and Nickerson.   Other variants of this question, with varying degrees of ambiguity, have been recently popularized by Ask Marilyn in Parade Magazine,  John Tierney of The New York Times,  and Leonard Mlodinow in Drunkard's Walk.  One scientific study showed that when identical information was conveyed, but with different partially ambiguous wordings that emphasized different points, that the percentage of MBA students who answered 1/2 changed from 85% to 39%.   The paradox has frequently stimulated a great deal of controversy.  Many people argued strongly for both sides with a great deal of confidence, sometimes showing disdain for those who took the opposing view. The paradox stems from whether the problem setup is similar for the two questions.   The intuitive answer is 1/2.  This answer is intuitive if the question leads the reader to believe that there are two equally likely possibilities for the sex of the second child (i.e., boy and girl),   and that the probability of these outcomes is absolute, not conditional.

Destiny,355e5c,Wonder_cube,1 point,Thu May 7 07:28:44 2015 UTC,"its ambiguous but the question says ""you hit an enemy twice"" and not asking IF you hit an enemy twice."
Destiny,355e5c,NaughtyGaymer,1 point,Thu May 7 07:30:45 2015 UTC,Imagine that you flip a coin 24 times and divide it into two pairs and you get these results 1(tail tail) 1 1 2(tail head) 2 2 3(head tail) 3 3 4(head head) 4 4  You see that each one has 3/12 or 25 %. If you remove the (tail tail) then each one is 3/9 or 33%
Destiny,355e5c,Zimmerzom,1 point,Thu May 7 07:44:11 2015 UTC,"So the argument being made for 50% is that the progression for Crit/not crit doesn't matter because they end up as the same result. However, this is wrong as permutations do matter, as they weight the percentages.   The easiest way to test this would be to go to this link https://www.random.org/coins/ and run through a few hundred iterations. Afterwords, you would need to eliminate every result that came up Tails Tails (as the problem states that this is not a valid outcome) and then adding up all the Heads / Tails permutations and using the results to generate percentages."
Destiny,355e5c,fenicx,1 point,Thu May 7 08:13:24 2015 UTC,So we all agree it's how you interpret the question right?  The exact wording of the original image is 50%.
Destiny,355e5c,RyanSmithEditor,1 point,Thu May 7 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"The order matters in this case, if the first hit doesn't crit and the second crits it's not the same as if the first hit crits and the second doesn't.  The way to look at it is to calculate the hit/crit chance of both attacks individually. Destiny says that since we know one of them is a crit then the first roll is 66/33, the issue here is that knowing in advance that there's one crit doesn't change the odds of the first roll, the first roll is determined by the 50% crit chance rather than the known outcomes. So the chances are 25%.  If we were to attack 200 times, write down pairs of attacks, then discard the pairs where it's hit/hit, then the odds of the first roll would be 66/33, since we've already removed some of the rolls where the first hit isn't a crit. Since we haven't done that in our problem, the first roll is 50/50.  Edit: I realize now that I was wrong. In the case where the first hit is normal, there's no 100% chance of crit. Instead, there's 50% chance of crit, and 50% chance of hit, and in the case of hit/hit we can discard this case and start over. Meaning the possibilities we take into account are three possibilities with 25%, which means the chance is 25/50, so 33%"

Destiny,355e5c,warpigs330,0,Thu May 7 11:23:06 2015 UTC,holy shit this is dumb the problem with your logic is that there are two agents each of the shots is an agent so the order doesn't matter but there are still three outcomes: agent 1 is a crit and agent 2 is not a crit; agent 1 is not a crit and agent 2 is a crit; and agent 1 and agent 2 are both crits only one of these three equally likely outcomes meets the criteria to be correct so the probability is 33% fuck me how did it come to this
Destiny,355e5c,Dakren,2,Thu May 7 06:44:28 2015 UTC,"Just read the question dude. If one of them is guaranteed to be a crit, there is two outcomes, not three. Either they both are crits, or one crits one doesn't. 2 possible outcomes, 50%."
Destiny,355e5c,lolcakesters,-1,Thu May 7 06:49:19 2015 UTC,neither are guaranteed you fucking idiot that is the point they are 2 agents with equal probability of changing the outcome neither is guaranteed to be a crit one of them is a crit the first could be a crit while the second is not (a non winning outcome) the second could be a crit while the first is not (a non winning outcome) or they could both be crits (the winning outcome) now if you have been counting along you will find we have three possibilities with one winning outcome giving us a one third chance of getting the winning outcome neither is guaranteed don't be stupid don't be laukys
Destiny,355e5c,lolcakesters,1 point,Thu May 7 07:03:07 2015 UTC,"there is only two possibilities dude. Either both are crits or one crits and one doesn't. Stop thinking about it in a math point of view and start looking at the wording of the problem. If AT LEAST one crits, then there's only two possibilities: they either both crit, or they don't. It doesn't matter if it's the first or the second coin, it's an overall 50%."
Destiny,355e5c,Gammaran,1 point,Thu May 7 07:11:12 2015 UTC,yes there are two possibilities the problem with your reasoning is that if there are two agents there are two ways to come to one of your two possibilities and only one way to come to the third so to put it in terms of logical gates we have two variables both have a 50% chance of being a 1 and a 50% chance of being a zero if both are zeros they are reassigned and the program runs again you need variable x and variable y to be a 1 if you want a working outcome so you have a 25% chance of that happening but you also have a 25% chance of re-fire so if you run this 100 times it will re-fire 25 times it will initially get two 1's 25 times and it will have results that have one 0 50 times the 25 re-fires will produce about six sets of 1's twelve that have one 0 and 6 re-fires the 6 re-fires will have 1.5 winners 3 losers and 1.5 re-fires at this point with less that 2 tries remaining your total number of set's of 1's is 32.5 im sure you can get it by now the language doesn't guarantee that either agent in particular is a crit only that one of them is therefore you should only make sure that one of them is a crit in you logical model if one particular agent is guaranteed then the answer is 50% but if a random agent is guaranteed then the answer is 33%

Not sure about starcraft. The difference in smoothness is unreal and you won't be able to go back to 60hz. It's honestly so different I would consider it a competitive advantage over other players. The one I got wasn't even that expensive.   Or is there any reason you haven't made the move yet? Have you tried it?

Especially on games where you'll be well over 144, like league/diablo/starcraft/csgo that aren't super demanding. For other games that you might be at 80-120 it'll still look mad good. It is not wasted.I'm saving up for a titanx set up and I'll have dual 144hz monitors probably."
Destiny,34s652,Sweetie240Belle,1 point,Mon May 4 03:38:39 2015 UTC,"It is wasted to Destiny.  He's really big on providing the highest quality stream, and if he can't stream at 1440p, 144hz he's not interested in having it.    On top of that Destiny is super picky about reliability, and the Asus ROG 1440p you suggested is PLAGUED with quality issues.  If he has to return the monitor every few months due to defects he won't be even half as happy as you're trying to argue he'll be.  I'm sure eventually there'll be a point where someone out there will attempt streaming at 1440p 144hz, and as soon as that happens Destiny will probably be right on top of it trying to find a better way to do it, and at that point he'll see the glory of 144hz for himself and he'll share it with all of his lovable Larvae on stream.

We're not mocking you for not being a STEM and I'm glad you found the time studying music to be worthwhile. However for many of us college and higher education is meant to have a payback when all is said and done.   Most people I know who majored in history music or theater now work in something completely different. For many of us that wouldn't be considered worth it, especially in this fragile economic climate."

I know the prevailing opinion nowadays is that college is just a diploma factory for a higher paying job, but I think that if you know that you would be happy with a major where you might not get as much money, I would do that. I'm in a major right now where I'm just grinding through school to get a boring job to live a normal life, I'd much rather be in a major I was passionate about, even if I wouldn't make as much.

As it stands in our current society, if your passion is for something in the entertainment industry, like music or drawing, you better have some good networking skills or some Picasso-tier quality work if you want to live as well off as your average cubicle worker."
Destiny,34bdzv,ChaoMing,2,Thu Apr 30 03:46:26 2015 UTC,">struggle to make ends meat  I was making an insane amount of money (for my age), like $20+/hour working 60 hours/week at the casino with a decent shot at upward mobility (lots of opportunities for advancement in the caisno), I don't think doing college for music was a terrible decision, and even looking back on everything now I wouldn't trade what I learned about music for anything in the world."
Destiny,34bdzv,NeoDestiny,3,Thu Apr 30 08:08:38 2015 UTC,"Senpai pls no bully  I was more or less talking about only working as an artist - not having a side job that you can fall back on when things don't work out or, at best, something paying minimum wage-ish since not everybody is lucky in this economy - and the ones who probably get it the worst are comic artists or artists not working in a studio (and maybe musicians/bands as well) where they earn wages and/or have contracts rather than having to work off of commission. The artists who do the Sleepycabin podcast did an episode on the struggles for the average artist (picks up around 34:20~), how even they are financially struggling to a certain degree, and these are rather ""famous"" web animators who you'd expect to make a killing off of JewTube money but people don't know the reality of the matter.  Overall, it's not a bad idea to go for your passion, not at all and by all means do so, but these people should at least realize that they should not expect immediate stability unless they have the connections to get their name out there, work in a studio where they have wages, that sort of thing."
Destiny,34bdzv,ChaoMing,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:21:38 2015 UTC,Most people are not lucky enough to get a job like that though. Most of the time people wind up working at fast-food places and coffee shops getting paid minimum wage.

The real term in an open relationship comes in honesty. You know you have to really be blunt with each other if you don't want to see each other anymore or if you've found someone else. Not that you're looking for someone else but, again if it's long distance, there are complications. An open relationship is defined in terms of exclusivity (how lenient will you be) I think sex is too far for these kinds of relationships, though."
Destiny,34ct99,Firedeathz,1 point,Sat May 2 09:54:08 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with them if you are making them work properly. Open relationships can be good for some things.
Destiny,34ct99,Noobity,1 point,Sat May 2 09:53:23 2015 UTC,"What i find weird is how destiny will say, oh well that isnt an ""open relationship"", but a relationship that is justed fucked for some reason. Another thing is if one partner is having emotional as well as sexual interaction with another individual, while at the same time slightly neglecting their partner because of it is it no longer an ""open relationship""? Or is that acceptable in a generic ""open relationship""."
Destiny,34ct99,MMACheerpuppy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:00:59 2015 UTC,That's not an open relationship anymore. That's a failed relationship. The idea behind an open relationship is that the emotional interaction will be with the person you're having the relationship with. Once it evolves to you having an emotional relationship with someone else then you're moving from a one to one open relationship and into a polyamorous kinda thing. Their argument is about an open relationship where 2 people decide they want to be able to fuck other people. Once there's emotional attachment to more than that then it's a different type of thing entirely.

Destiny,348cuo,KibaTeo,2,Wed Apr 29 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"top comment  ""There is no paradox here you just added the fractions incorrectly. For example if you wish to add 10/50 and 90/150 you don't do (10 + 90) / (50 + 150) = 100/200 = 50% you first have to make the denominator equal 10/50 + 90/150 = 30/150 + 90/150 = (30 + 90)/(150 + 150) = 120/300 = 40%. Simple fractions can slip you up but the fault in your maths is odvious as the average of 20% and 60% is not 50% and like wise for 30% and 70% not being 40%."""

Destiny,348cuo,Shinatose,-2,Fri May 1 08:22:30 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck would you distribute the drug so unevenly between genders if genders could matter OhKrappa  The fallacy is obvious, in order to conclude something by succeeding in a test you can take set A, that for some random reason is already extremely likely to succeed, and set B, the exact opposite. Now you apply the thing you are testing to set A, do nothing with set B, and show that set A is (still) more likely to succeed than set B. What happens in the video is this, except a bit less obvious (the two sets were less distinct). lul"
Destiny,348cuo,Shinatose,7,Wed Apr 29 10:07:18 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck would you distribute the drug so unevenly between genders if genders could matter OhKrappa   Because the video is there to make a point for a variable that you could forget to account for (like parents' income when looking at black vs. white crime statistics.) The gender variable was only an example to make a point.  Statisticians won't always remember to account for all of the variables, so this video shows why statistics can be misleading. It just uses gender as an example to explain why."
Destiny,348cuo,iopq,-2,Wed Apr 29 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"i mean, sure, but i mean, every and each person on this planet can make mistakes on any situation right? Every scientific field is hard exactly because things are ""subtle"" and making mistakes is quite easy if things aren't done properly.  I feel like the video is trying to show some hidden secret truth behind statistics or something when in reality what they made is a basic mistake, but hey maybe it's just me.  to add to the example, even if you miss the ""gender variable"", a simple pre test without any drug usage would've shown that females are already extremely likely to survive or whatever it was, while male are not. This isn't some secret trick statistics use, if media/tv wants to lie to you they just outright do it, it's really basic stuff lol."
Destiny,348cuo,Shaliber,5,Wed Apr 29 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"They already made this mistake in the case of UC Berkeley, there was a lawsuit against them for gender discrimination. So this paradox DOES come up in the real world, they addressed your point before you even made it."
Destiny,348cuo,poko610,0,Thu Apr 30 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"Because for almost any meaningful statistic you need purely random sampling, they probably should have created 2 trials: 1 male, 1 female to ideally eliminate a bias that could occur but you don't always want to do that initially. As long as they keep track of the characteristics of the participants it shouldn't be a huge factor, that being said of you have too many factors you can end up skewing results, so it's really a balancing game."

Destiny,345h64,Razkol,-16,Tue Apr 28 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Which is why OverRustle BasedGod NoTears is an emote combo, they're making fun of their culture and not spouting  the fucking several hundred year old racist idea that black people are monkeys. It must be fucking nice being black and knowing that white boys like you go around saying ""Well, it's only the bad ones."" Like gee, when you're calling only black people (a coincidence, I'm sure) racist slurs I'm sure you want black people to go ""Well, he's not talking about me! My white overlords approve of me! As long as I try to be as white as I can society won't look down on me! God, I hate being black!""   Like really, I don't hate all white people, just the ones that subscribe to mainstream white culture that's a bunch of racist shitheads jerking themselves off while only hiring other white shitheads, and then wondering why consistently underprivileged people (who white boys like you wouldn't hire regardless) don't better their situation.

Destiny,345h64,pacjax,6,Tue Apr 28 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"Why is it wrong to say that cultures that promote and glorify criminality and frown upon education and self-improvement are bad? Saying that ""I'm sure you want black people to go 'Well, he's not talking about me! My white overlords approve of me! As long as I try to be as white as I can society won't look down on me! God, I hate being black!'"" is completely a straw man. Nobody (well, nobody reasonable anyway) is disparaging anyone for being of a different culture, we're just pointing out that some aspects of urban black culture clash with common-sense values. You don't get to use the excuse ""But my culture!"" if parts of that culture are bad.   Obviously there are systemic, unfair, oppressive structures in place in this country that disproportionately harm black people. There is a quantifiable racial bias in arrests and police brutality independent of the fact that most street-level crimes are committed by black people (because street-level crimes are committed by the poor, and the poor are disproportionately black). Gentrification, again, disproportionately impacts black communities, and forces people out of their homes and onto the streets. More relevant to what's going on online, many people on the internet and in chat probably are legitimately racist, however, none of that excuses the kind of rioting and looting behavior we're seeing in Baltimore right now. You don't overcome systematic oppression by looting 7-11s and sneaker stores. The solution needs to come from both sides. Those in power need to acknowledge and work to solve institutionalized racism and systematic oppression, and those being effected need to realize that parts of their culture are serving to give the racists somewhat legitimate ammunition for their hatred."

Maybe all the mayo on your face is stopping you from seeing clearly, cause this is the only way anything gets fucking noticed. Oh boo hoo, some store franchise lost a little bit of stock. Maybe the reason white people care so much about these stolen goods is because money's one of the few things that matter in white culture?  Also, I've experienced ""white culture"" (if you can even call it a culture) and it's objectively disgusting. They value stepping on others' backs to get to where you need to go, forgetting they ever helped you unless you might need something again, and generally doing the bare minimum to achieve success (which is pretty easy to come by when you're white). What else do they value? Homogeneity? Being anti-social fucks? Abuse of power? Doing cocaine? Not washing their assholes?

She did, and after the act she called me because she was very excited, and I asked her to tell me all about it, all the sexually explicit details. Well that made me really turned on and the guy hadn't gotten her all the way there before he finished and left  So we had a bit of phone sex while she told me all the details and I told her what I had in store for her when she got back.   Wow, so they have rules that means they'll always tell each other if they do anything, they're both sleeping around, they've been together for a long time and both agreed on doing it. They then both took part in the call with her ringing and him asking for the details. He hadn't finished her off so he, the loving boyfriend that he is helped her out.

You have to remember your shirt is merch, it's not a quality item. The most you can charge WITH shipping is like $15 or people will just buy real clothes. Think about band merch when you go to a gig (maybe a bad example because you never leave your house), that stuff is usually decent and they don't charge $25 most of the time, that's without shipping, too.  If it was a little cheaper, I'd have bought one. I really think you screwed yourself with the 'limited run expensive' route.

Destiny,341yhp,Slardar,3,Tue Apr 28 09:08:36 2015 UTC,"I CAN SIGN IT IF YOU SEE ME AT AN EVENT, THO.

But I can't think of a way to do it, short of people sending me the money and then me ordering all of them and shipping them individually, which sounds like a disaster. Also I dunno if I could sign it in something that wouldn't fade/fuckup over time.   Also, any tee that teesprings can offer isn't gonna be 'high quality' they're trying to make a buck off you too so they won't be using the best quality shit.   They're pretty open with their margins. They can ""make a buck"" off of you and still use high quality stuff. If you go to their normal site (not the Twitch one) you can choose differently quality material. If you choose the most expensive one (with the smallest margins for your self) and then compare it to Twitch's Tee's shirt, you'll see it's the same, meaning I'm assuming they use the highest quality stuff for the Twitch campaign.   You say you won't sell the design a second time, but what if I wanted to buy the LeRuse design? There's no option for me, which sucks.

Destiny,341yhp,Tanukki,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add as well that your shirt isn't band merch, like, when I'm going down the street and I see other people that have that shirt it's cool to chat, but your fans are thinly spread and they're all socially awkward (no offense to the fans) so you'd never get any interaction out of it.  Those that don't get the 'in-joke' will just think that we're memeshitter faggots with the mind of a 12 year old because we think it's okay to wear the Lenny Face in public like shitlers.  For all these reasons you can't really peddle this like someone else would and you're not popular enough to jew this shit as hard as you are right now.  But these are all my humble opinions and you can ignore them if you want.  As for the quality, it's not gonna be a cashmere shirt like this for the same price + shipping... Assuming that the Twitch campaign is using the highest quality shit is a little bit naive.  As for seeing you at an event, I live in England man, flying to America for a signing is a bit OTT lol.  EDIT: Was the original shipping like $3.85 or something and you raised it to $12.50?"
Destiny,341yhp,blahtherr2,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:31:13 2015 UTC,"The cost of shipping within the US was like $4.  Canadian shipping was around double that and international shipping was the redonkulous double digits you're getting, sadly.  As for the shirt quality.  It's 100% combed cotton, which is roughly the same quality shirt as the one you linked worth £25.  That shirt you linked is not cashmere.  I'm also a little skeptical of the T-shirt quality, but I'm noticing that the average price for a shirt whose only available style is ""Twitch Tee"" seems to hover around $20.  Any lower priced shirt I found that appeared to be a Twitch streamer's shirt was printed on shirts from companies like Hanes.  So the cheaper shirts are being printed on cheaper quality shirts as a base.  I'm curious to know where the ""Twitch Tee"" shirt's material is sourced from, but since the shirt uses combed cotton then it should be of appropriate quality for the price being asked, compared to the Hanes pre-shrunk ""ComfortSoft®"" cotton."
Destiny,341yhp,Doobers,0,Tue Apr 28 11:52:26 2015 UTC,"I can't fathom how you think the literal fabric of the tee is what he meant, nor how the design doesn't factor into it heavily. Yes it is Destiny branding, but you can rarely sell something so well to begin with. That's reserved for the top tier established shit. In comparison to this is your 1st tee, your first branded whatever and you chose the lowest quality res doodle. Either way the rationale for the price $25 is outrageous I'd say.   95 Sold at $25 = $2375. Let's say your share is 50% so $1187.5 for you the rest for Twitch/Teesprings whatever. Now based on a following of your size AND devotion of the fans this is low.  Imagine we had it at $15 starting and sold 200 seems reasonable. $1500 for you. Moreover just enticing the fans to spend in a product like this ""Destiny Tee"" only encourages future purchases and sets up an alternate income source. Plus it just looks good for Twitch or in general to see a large number sold. In the end, we want to distribute as many dank memes as possible right? =D"
Destiny,341yhp,Slardar,2,Wed Apr 29 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"95 shirts sold @ $25/shirt = $1,425 estimated profit.  250 shirts sold @ $15/shirt = $1,332 estimated profit.  The money's actually semi kind of important to me at the moment since I'm making these brutal student loan payments.  I'll do the next one at a lower price point with a different design, if you don't like this one, PLEASE don't buy it, and wait for the next one, and then I'll be able to see the difference in numbers and what not and I'll make future decisions based on  the data.  It's ALWAYS easier to start at a higher price point and move lower rather than start at a lower price point and move higher.  If I did my first run at $15 each and then started the next run at $20 or $25 each, I would be LITERALLY Hitler and people would flip shit.  If I start this run at $25 each and do the next one at $22 or $20 or $15 each, people will see me as being reasonable and ""bringing down the price"", even though both accomplish the same thing - collecting data for different price points."

I'm objectively quantifying the worth of said shirt, and calculating maximum profit/marketing is an interesting subject.  There are two ways to go about it, but yes I agree if you start low then going higher you'll need a valid reason for people to not flip their shit. I'm of the start low, go higher school of thought. Contrast it with a your sub system. People are more likely to T2 T3 or T4 after purchasing a T1 subscription, same with getting your proverbial foot in the door in terms of getting people to buy Destiny Tee's. The effort it takes to make this shit is nothing, you streamed the process. Akin to subscriptions, get people hooked on this shit more likely to buy it, get excited about it, you can churn out shirts 2~3 months with cooler designs.

But honestly, I see Batman shirts (just a bat symbol) sell for $25.00.  Yes, some Hot Topic tees are cheaper...but that's because it's cheap material. I believe these ones actually use decent grade material, and it's also about supporting a streamer.  Again, we will see the data, but I believe if Destiny sold these for $15.00 each, he would probably only see a %10-%15 increase.  If someone isn't willing to spend $25.00, they are probably not willing to spend $15.00."

Aren't you doing that by routing it through Amazon? What if you route it through a paid, trusted proxy that has authentication? Wouldn't that be just like routing it through Amazon if both are secure and trusted?  I use a SOCKS5 proxy for my Skype, I have for a few years now. I have never been DDoSed, nor will I be. It's reliable, fast, and secure. Your method is better (obviously), since Amazon obviously has enough bandwidth and protection to deal with every DDoS attack that comes in, but I like just setting up a SOCKS5 proxy and just forgetting about it.  When I used to be super paranoid, I would run a VM with a VPN and use SSH tunnelling to tunnel specific programs to use the VM/VPN and that way, I would be completely secure as well as not have my game performance impacted but now I just don't really care anymore, a secure SOCKS5 proxy is good enough for me.  As for finding a VPN that accepts a large amount of traffic, any decent paid VPN should be more than capable at handling this.  Still, good job as usual providing knowledge to the masses."

Talk about DDOS protection Talk about multiple levels/ways of monetization. Talk about building your brand. Give your advice on surviving extremely negative controversy.   I think surviving controversy is going to be your best bet, because it's relevant to every single twitch streamer. It's also relevant for twitch itself, because they don't want their streamers to fail. They're invested in your success too.   E: I think you might have missed the submit deadline?  The website says.   The TwitchCon committee will review all submissions beginning 04/10/2015. Selected presenters will be notified of the status of their submission by no later than 05/30/2015."
Destiny,33u9bo,The_Neckbear,13,Sat Apr 25 18:15:35 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see a talk on branding as Destiny has some pretty unique stuff in that area compared to other streamers.

Destiny,33u9bo,KibaTeo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"You could tie all the points into something along the lines of surviving popularity or something.

Destiny,33u9bo,autowikibot,2,Sun Apr 26 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"Joke:       A joke is something spoken, written, or done with humorous intention.  Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole short story. The word ""joke"" has a number of synonyms, including wisecrack, gag, prank, quip, jape and jest.  To achieve their end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other devices. Jokes may have a punch line, i.e., an ending to make it humorous.  A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken joke in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Destiny,33u9bo,KindlyKickRocks,3,Sun Apr 26 03:10:46 2015 UTC,"I really like this, especially the second part. Still, the first part is a very good place to start thinking about. Destiny's easily one of the most knowledgeable people in regards to up-to-date streaming utilities and hardware, ranging from budget to high end. His recent upgrade dialogues have proved that he's also able to break down each component for the viewers to easily understand. Along with the whole DDoS mitigation thing, a (hopefully) publicly taped panel could neatly secure Destiny as Twitch's resident tech expert.  In regards to the second part, I quite like the idea of a panel centered around 'maintaining and growing the medium sized channel.' The majority of Twitch channels sits in the sweet spot of between 1k-10k viewers, where gameplay and viewer interaction is neatly balanced, compared to the ~1k dead chats and the +10k spam fest/hitler chats. Destiny could give his personal do's/don'ts for this particular set of streams, talk about methods of safely growing your channel (participation in relevent esports social media discussions, subreddits, co-oping with other streamers, etc vs. the dangerous get-rich-quick sodapoppin aids style). Perhaps Destiny could talk about his recent understandings in regards to building and maintaining Twitch relationships, going to events to personally meet fans, that sort of stuff. Destiny could also talk about stuff from the first part and have like a set of ""must-have"" qualities a stream in 2015 should have (720p @ 60fps, an uncluttered layout, method of obtaining songs played on stream, etc).  There's quite a few other points I can think about, but hopefully this enough for D to decide on. Overall, there's a lot of potential in the second part, in regards to rebuilding his image in the community (lolz you're the BM guy who's always BM) and building connections to possible up-and-coming medium streams."

One of the more popular things for streamers to do is include their viewers in stream activities, such as subscriber day or whatever. Some streamers hold miniature tournaments or events for their viewers as well, so Destiny could talk about his experiences with the tournament he set up, from the logistics and what to expect and what not. Something an individual streamer could wrap their hands around and maybe do for themselves, or to give viewers a more in depth look at what goes into tournaments.   Just a thought off the top."

Destiny,33u9bo,funkyfritter,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"""How to turn your audience into a community"" is a little broad, but it could be a good starting point. People socialize in your chat when the stream is off and tune in even when there's no gameplay, there's a reason for that.  Alternatively, you could go the ""back in my day"" route and just ramble about what streaming was like in the justin.tv days. Not as compelling, but it would be easier to throw together."

How much could be made before adblock and from advertising.    The rise of subscription and donation models. Both Why and What impact did they have on streaming.  I think you are pretty unique in the fact that you talk very explicitly about how to monetize yourself. Although it doesn't completely go in line with Twitch I think a talk about the benefits of having a website, sponsors, and their importance.  If someone is a new streamer what are they looking to accomplish from a monetary perspective. How many viewers, how many subscribers, are donation numbers stable?  There are a lot of more economic based questions that you can provide unique insight on in addition to the general I was the first streamer ever routine etc.  For me personally, I would just like to hear more about how streaming has changed economically over the years and possibly predictions. Is subscriber/donation model the best in the current market? Will Twitch make an attempt to go completely adblock free or ad free? What is the cost of streaming (computer, internet connection)?

Its just people usually eat for about 15 minutes, and then decide they are full. For example, if you go to a restaurant and eat your food, it usually takes about 15 minutes to finish your food. Unless you are just super fucking hungry and in a rush to eat. Maybe people meant meals last 15 minutes?

Destiny,33qedx,onemanmanywomen,2,Fri Apr 24 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"The thing he doesn't understand is that an (morbidly) obese's brain works fundamentally differently in this area. Likely, the signals that indicate satiation don't get to the important area in the brain (Fast enough). On the other hand, you have this rationalization of eating. They know they eat too much, but their brain orders them to eat more, otherwise the impulses aren't there anymore and the brain doesn't want that. Add to the fact that there is a lot of emotions attached to this (like happiness by eating and the remorse thereafter), and other factors which makes this a very complex issue for the brain and body to be in.  Yeah you can simplify it and mock them, but i don't think that'll help obese people realize they have to change AND HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO GO FOR THAT CHANGE. It's not as simple lowering your calorie count, there is often an underlying psychological issue to be addressed. You don't just rewire a significant function/mechanism of your brain.

Destiny,33o48m,thatnumpty,22,Fri Apr 24 02:43:23 2015 UTC,You understand that Day9 is like the one example that doesn't apply to this right? Destiny tries not to use him as an example because of the load of content that he produced before he moved onto other games.
Destiny,33o48m,FlyingFlight,51,Fri Apr 24 03:53:15 2015 UTC,In the 80 trillion discussions had beforehand about this topic:  The difference is that EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON who left sc2 defended it to the death saying that nothing was wrong and the community would be the one to bring the game back to life. They praised blizzard for the work that they were doing and kept giving blizzard leniency about their failing game. The dishonesty behind their actions     as opposed to destiny being outspoken about sc2 before leaving is the reason why people who hold your opinion are fucking retarded.
Destiny,33o48m,exdeath1987,0,Fri Apr 24 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"Hm...I don't think any of those people were particularly dishonest. InControl is still streaming StarCraft, too. Idra went to college, which is smart given that he probably had money saved up.  Destiny was extremely negative in that rant. The problem is that it's not a fair way of looking at things - for an RTS to still have hundreds of thousands of active players five years after release is really, really good. The majority of games fail almost immediately on release...people should be way more grateful for what Blizzard accomplished and continues to accomplish, and for the healthy competitive scene. League and Dota will lose population over time as well, you know."
Destiny,33o48m,seejay2,10,Tue Jun 16 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"I mean if you want to believe that then go ahead. There's plenty of ways to get Destinys point of view on this topic. He basically called sc2's fall almost exactly 2 years ago and got shit on by Idra, incontrol, and DJ Wheat. Here's the video by the way. Destiny called out the flaws of sc2 and ways to fix it, which turns out is the business model for the very popular pc games, CSGO, LoL, and Dota. There's even a blog post on his website destiny.gg about sc2, you should check it out.  Also, he only calls out the people who we in denial about sc2 dying and then just quitting. I don't think he had any problems with people just switching games. He also pointed out that Day9 was a bad example because he made so much content and stayed dedicated for so long."
Destiny,33o48m,solifenacin,22,Fri Apr 24 10:27:49 2015 UTC,"I tried playing Dota during the original WC3 days and I absolutely fucking hated it.

Destiny,33o48m,Knoscrubs,6,Fri May 1 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"His income is directly related to viewership, advertising revenue, and donations, which come from again, viewers.  If SC2 has a dying population, Destiny would be fucking stupid if he didn't branch out and try other popular games, to perpetuate his income.  Blizzard blew it with WoL and HotS, his views on SC2 are not unfounded.  Give the man some slack, he's just trying to pay his bills, like the rest of us."
Destiny,33o48m,Knoscrubs,0,Fri Apr 24 05:19:45 2015 UTC,I get that but his sc2 viewer numbers were about the same as he does with LoL.
Destiny,33o48m,GenerationBlue,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:28:34 2015 UTC,But the overall playing population of LoL dwarfs SC2...  The potential revenue base is exponentially higher.  He would literally be going down with the ship if he just stuck to SC2.

I would watch Destiny 24/7 even if he only played video games less than 10% of that time. But I can't fucking stand LoL or DotA, so I don't watch. If he just wants to play a game where he can get lots of viewers, I'd watch him play CSGO, Hearthstone, fucking Minecraft which I've never even played, any variety flavor-of-the-week game that just came out, just not fucking LoL or DotA."

All the youtube vids and talk show stuff I've seen with Destiny talking about this stuff has him calling them out for being hypocrites, not for leaving SC2.  People that gave him shit for being real about the dying SC2 community, and people that gave him shit for trying new things and moving away from solely being SC2 focused. Then after they do that they quietly move away from SC2 and become hearthstone streamers or whatever is popular.  I'm like 85% confident this is what happened based on just the Destiny vids I've seen without knowing about the sc2 community first-hand. If I'm right then I don't get how someone who is a sc2 fan couldn't figure this out."

Destiny,33qopf,Ralain,-3,Fri Apr 24 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"Why would you say two video cards is a bit too much? And I've looked into i5 vs i7. A high end i5 is enough sure, but I'm not building this pc with the intent of it being just ""enough""."
Destiny,33qopf,Ralain,3,Fri Apr 24 23:26:34 2015 UTC,The reason for my saying get an i5 and only a single video card are the same. Any extras won't allow you to do more. A single 970 with an i5 is going to be able to render any game on max settings with at least 60 fps. Getting a second one won't give you anything extra.
Destiny,33qopf,ChaoMing,5,Fri Apr 24 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"Any particular reason you're going with 16GB of RAM? Are you going to be doing any serious audio/video/animation work or something?  If not, you can get by with 8GB with pretty much any PC game in this day and age.  240 GB for an SSD may be a little bit overkill, most people just throw their OS on it and still have room to put their major games on there on a 120 GB SSD. SSDs are rather expensive and inefficient to get a lot of if you don't have that many things to put on it, then fall back on 2 TB of HDD space.  And as the other dude said, 850W is serious overkill, I don't know if your monitor is a serious powerchugger, but you can probably get by with 650W, 700-750W to be on the safe side.  This is what I came up with: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PRPkP6  I dunno, my brother is better at this than I am, so go crazy."
Destiny,33qopf,Razogh,-5,Fri Apr 24 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"I choose 16gb of RAM just to be on the safe side, I realize it's a little overkill but after being stuck on 6gb ram for 6 years I don't intend to upgrade by only 2gb. That and also, knowing I can reduce compilation time in various SDKs by having some RAM coupled with the fact that it'd be nice being able to up settings on various next gen titles (witcher etc) without having to worry about anything feels  nice. I checked the stuff you wrote, it seemed good. Although I'm going with SLI most likely, even if you might think it is overkill :)"

Destiny,33qopf,calomando1004,2,Fri Apr 24 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"You don't need 850W of power to power your computer. It's a lot more than enough. You can get away with powering your system with just 650W and there would be 0 difference in terms of performance vs. the 850W. A 650W power supply would cost less and do the same job, so why spend more?"
Destiny,33qopf,Stripe4206,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:34:45 2015 UTC,He probably checked the power consumption of all the part and found out that 650W is enough. You should verify it.
Destiny,33qopf,Ralain,2,Fri Apr 24 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"you dont need an 850w PSU, why would 1000w even be a possibility?"
Destiny,33qopf,calomando1004,2,Sat Apr 25 03:29:48 2015 UTC,Replace the power supply with a 650W power supply and get a GTX 980 instead of 2 GTX 970s.

Destiny,33lgdh,Doobers,4,Thu Apr 23 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"Gotta admit, that was some fun times learning Eve and seeing Destiny trying to learn the game as well. RIP  o7"
Destiny,33lgdh,Danzo3366,2,Fri Apr 24 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"I still remember taking my first fight in Geemu, it was my first time flying with Destiny. We were outmanned, outgunned, and outexperienced. But Destiny's next level command, strategy and tactical genius brought us to victory...  The radio crackled to life, ""Sir! We've got contacts on the gate. Roughly twenty or so, cruisers by the signatures.""  ""Hold men. Let's get some intel first. Stalker 1, what's the situation?""   Destiny's calm demeanor brought a chill stillness to the hearts of the brave men and women. The grizzled veterans had come to expect the inevitable. But the greenbacks, like me, had no idea what was in store. For us, we were going to fly to our deaths.  ""Stalker 1, I see Stabbers. 20 or so. Maybe a few less. They're holding just inside 10km, on the gate.""  Admiral Destiny leaned back in his chair and lit a cigar. ""All ships align to gate. We go on my command.""  I looked at my navigator. How could our inferior 10 ship fleet take these guys on? We had less guns, less experience, less men, and less courage. I played the battle over and over in my head and it came out the same every time: We would be annihilated. Our last legacy, our last hope, shattered against overwhelming odds. I could only hope that some day, someone would see our gravesite and recognize the ferret paintings on the hulls of our Ruptures. ""This is it,"" they would think. ""This is where Geemu made their last stand.""  I was so lost in thought I was shaken when the radio cracked to life with a single word: ""Jump!""  The ship lurched forward as we were propelled with the rest of the fleet into slipspace. I ordered my Communications Officer to isolate the signal from Admiral Destiny's ship. I wanted to hear every order clearly. We traveled lightyears in seconds. When we landed, we stopped short of 20km off the stargate; well within attack range.  ""Align to the gate and start locking targets but DO NOT FIRE."" The beeping of tracking signatures blared through the bridge. I was so nervous I ordered my Weapons Officers to take their hands off their control panels completely. My anxiety deepened when I began to hear klaxons. The enemy fleet was targeting us. I was so worried about the stalemate that I didn't even noticed we were about to ram the Stargate. Just before we would have made contact, we were pulled through the gate alongside the rest of our fleet.  On the other side, the Admiral insisted we stay put. ""We're going to wait for them to come to us. When they jump through, we're going to guillotine them. Ships 1 through 4 are going to target the same ship, 5 through 8 will target the next one, and 9 through 12 will hit the third one.  I felt like I was the United States during the Cold War. I knew there was an enemy on the other side of this gate, and he knew I was on this side of the gate. We both knew that whoever jumped through that gate to pursue would take heavy losses. A minute passed. Then two minutes. Then five minutes. The Admiral was itching for a fight.  ""All ships, realign to the gate. We're going to jump through and bait them into a fight on our terms."" All I heard was we were going to die.  ""On three, we take the gate, lock up targets and then turn around and jump through the gate again."" Was this guy fucking crazy? Was he high on some ? Didn't matter, we were slowly approaching the gate. A Light flashed and through we went. I was prepared to lay down my life and the lives of my men (Especially you, BombJin) to make our stand.  When we landed we wasted no time. My bridgemates when into overdrive locking targets, deploying countermeasures, and turning the ship back to the gate. But what I saw shocked me. I saw the enemy fleet advancing towards us. We were only seconds away from the gate.  ""When you get within gate range, make the jump!"" Destiny's voice echoed through all ships. A flash of light blinded the bridge and through the gate we went once again. When we landed I scanned the signatures of ships on our directional scanner. We all made it through.   But then another contact appeared on the Dscanner. Then another, then another. They were chasing us. Battle was upon us.  ""Ferrets 1 through 3, you are cleared to engage. Your targets are being relayed to you right now. Fire at will""  I didn't even get a chance to brace myself before our turrets began slicing through space. I saw our target directly in front of us. Six beams struck the enemy ship, starting at the nose, all the way down to the back left engine. Shortly after, the ship erupted in a fireball.  We began engaging targets at will, prioritizing targets with Ferrets 1 and 3. Ferret 3 had been unable to destroy their target fast enough as they had begun taken fire from other ships. To our left, Ferret 1 and the Admiral had destroyed two Stabbers, and critically damaged another forcing him to back up and retreat. The combined power of Ferrets 2 and 3 quickly took out three more Stabbers and a Stabber Fleet Issue. It was over. Against every odd, we had emerged victorious.  I must inform that Admiral Destiny seems to be very stressed post battle, and his behavior in action was risky and excessively dangerous to friendlies. His fire discipline and target selection are clearly lacking the usual calmness of a Geemu Naval Admiral. He was quick to take chances that not only endangered himself, but also his fellow brothers-in-arms. A chance that demonstrated the Admiral is an exemplary commander and very talented pilot. I will fly off his wing any day."

Destiny,33ifko,raspberrykraken,3,Thu Apr 23 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"Are you really this retarded or are you baiting?  The account that ""committed suicide"" was a throwaway account with one post about his parents and feeling depressed and one comment critcizing Richard Lewis.  Then the brother just happened to have the log-in info of the account so he could post about the suicide.    I'm sure that's the first thing a grieving family member would do. Log on to a throwaway account and tell everyone in that exact thread that Richard Lewis made his brother commit sudoku.  Ho  Fuck you gotta be gullible."
Destiny,33ifko,askshonestquestions,2,Thu Apr 23 15:25:30 2015 UTC,I'm not baiting in a thread that was confirmed by the mods. I just haven't bothered to dig it up yet and surprised everyone overlooks it because Richard Lewis just apologized. It was the thing that got him banned to begin with after being a dick to the mods for hours on end.

The Kid apparently had problems with suicide and after Richard Lewis joked about it in the thread the kid said he made his mind. Hours later his brother came on to confirm the kid in fact committed suicide.   Since then Richard Lewis has fake apologized/tried to sweep it under the rug what he did."

He's even asked the guys at G2A to change top earner ""lirik"" to ""aw"", even if his affiliate/referral code is still LIRIK. https://www.g2a.com/goldmine  He's said in the past that Destiny Highlighting his stream (dayz videos) really made him going and getting viewers. I wonder if Destiny would have stayed with DayZ with the launch, while dealing with stream snipers like Lirik, where he would be now. Dankest community, the same path of the big warrior  (DayZ -> standalone -> arma 2 life mods (RP) -> arma 3 BR/life mods -> H1Z1 -> variety)  Standalone increased his viewers from the regular 3-4K to 9K+ and it stayed that way. Same was for youtubers like FrankieOnPC, etc. Cool how that works. Didn't stop from launch.  Took a lot of work though, but he specifically mentioned Toweliee to getting his first viewers and Destiny kicking it off.  I wouldn't mind using Destiny's referral to buy stuff from G2A. He gets tons of %, permanent cookie(in ip/paypal) and 2nd tier referrals from all the warrior, affiliate faggots from chat.  ALL things considered, I feel it's hilarious how this faggot makes so much money yet always says ""oh shit man those are so expensive..."" like he's poor lmao. When he's talking about general things. He seriously does it to fit the viewers and it's so obvious, but I love him"

When he's talking about general things. He seriously does it to fit the viewers and it's so obvious, but I love him   This is absolutely not true. In 2011 I made my first $100k and I wasted ABSOLUTELY FUCKING EVERY PENNY without paying ANY TAXES. I'm STILL paying $750/month to make-up for that $20,000 bill.  The fact is (I'm partially guessing, I've heard this a lot, AND I know now from personal experience), rich or wealthy people don't simply waste their money on a bunch of needless/expensive shit. I still live VERY frugally, honestly. The most money I waste is easily on eating out too much. Aside from that, I have like 6-7 outfits (ask anyone I've dated), a $20 desk from goodwill, a $50 office chair, and that's it. I could dump a ton of money into guns, or more money into my car stereo or performance-related shit, or go flying around on trips and what not, but I really don't. I watch my money increase in my Paypal and when it hits a certain point, I move it over into an investment account, period.  I've literally never ""faked"" any part of my personality on  stream before, and I never would do anything like that. It's the most important part of my branding, it'd be stupid to fuck with that, and it'd be obvious if I did."

Destiny,33e5bi,sidrkrulz,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"He gets more money if you sub on his website since he only loses the paypal cut. Twitch takes $2.49 if you sub there, but I think he wants Twitch subs anyway so he can get $3 from a Twitch sub and can also get stuff like reduced delay. He needs to hold 400 Twitch subs for those benefits. At least that is what he was saying a month ago."
Destiny,33e5bi,TheDashiki,-2,Wed Apr 22 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"G2A is very shady comparing to Amazon but that's why it is so successful to streamers and gamers. Cheaper games, much cheaper. It's because they purchase polish or other 3rd world keys for games in bulk, due to lower purchasing power.   Sometimes a few keys come up that's stolen or similar but it's very rare and considering the fact that they are endorsed by such a large company like PayPal makes it crazy.  I don't think you need a partnership outside just spamming your referral link which anyone can sign up for, I guess if you want a fixed rate of money each month from them or a higher cut from referrals.  During PayPal cyber monday basically entire PayPal page was G2A https://www.g2a.co/en/say  If you do decide to register on G2A make sure you clean out all your cookies/caches and use a clean browser otherwise some faggot in the universe is going to get a % of all your sales.  Yeah, well it doesn't happen often but the overall impression one gets is that he says ""oh shit that's so expensive"" he might have changed though, getting a bit loose.  Thanks for the reply.   This build is also around $15000 compared to my $8000 build. I don't know if I'm being modest but that is fucking insane. That is like buying a Ferrari and praying no one hits your car when you drive it around. I'd be paranoid to even use it. Once again, maybe I'm just being weird.  This is way too overkill IMO. I could never even imagine having a computer that is THAT good.   has made $70K a month for a long time before this was even made.

Destiny,33c0ps,Fentanyl,4,Tue Apr 21 17:22:43 2015 UTC,I remember him saying a little while ago that he does not feel as interested in playing something without a ladder to climb. Given his competitive nature when it comes to games his lack of interest in lotv beta is probably to be expected. Im sure he will play again when the ladder is activated.
Destiny,33c0ps,Terakahn,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:26:32 2015 UTC,Well last time I watched he was doing archon mode. Hardly the most competitive thing. But I see your point.
Destiny,33c0ps,Monifix,-1,Tue Apr 21 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"While it isn't the worst, that is still a pretty bad mindset to have. Ladder rank should not really be a consideration at all. If you want to achieve mastery at anything, then your focus should be on practice and you should be motivated by improvement.  I don't think Destiny will ever be one of the best at anything because his competitiveness is short sighted.  There are good reasons not to play a lot of LotV mind you, the lack of ladder just isn't one of them. If you want to improve at SC2 then you should still practice HotS since it is way more competitive, while playing a bit of occasional LotV in order to be prepared for when the game launches."

Destiny,3308fq,ianyapxw,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"""always much lower""  This assumes you have things to deduct. This is obviously much more relevant for you, self-employed with a mortgage and a child and so forth than it is for, let's say, a single, childless, non-property owning company desk-jockey.  I have always thought your perspective on this was a little skewed. With the exception of student loan interest deductions (which are honestly, maybe a 1-2% return of my income) and the standard deduction, I am taxed relatively close to the marked rate, not ""much lower""."
Destiny,3308fq,SMMBG,2,Mon Apr 20 21:35:40 2015 UTC,"Standard deduction + various credits (making work pay credit, + various education credits, + claiming children), + investments (if you do IRA contributions via work or whatever), etc...

Destiny,3308fq,NeoDestiny,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:05:04 2015 UTC,People that are more savvy with their money usually take advantage of lower tax rates on different kinds of income and plan more as well.   There is nothing wrong with it. People like to act like they would be taxed higher on that same type income when that isn't true. It's not like Romney gets preferential treatment on his capital gains and dividends tax rates... He just chooses to utilize it.

This is such a fucking waste of a post because 95% of you won't ever fucking comprehend this idea so I don't even know why I bother posting it, but everything in life is nuanced. People are nuanced. Music is nuanced. Films are nuanced. It's possible to enjoy some aspects of something while simultaneously disliking other aspects of something. It's not cognitive dissonance. It's not contradictory thoughts. It's being a rational fucking human being. Just because someone doesn't like some aspect of something doesn't mean they absolutely fucking hate every single thing about it and every single thing related to it. Just because a person does one bad thing doesn't mean that every single thing they do is bad and every single thing related to them is bad.

Destiny,32w9pg,stRafaello,0,Fri Apr 17 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"The Steven that we once knew is long dead and gone. He's barley even a shadow of his former self. He literally begged us to buy him a new roof and all we wanted was to watch him play the Witcher 2 and he couldn't even keep his end of the deal. He says that he likes to play games competitively but he switches inbetween LoL, CSGO, and SC2 and just fucks around and then bans people when he does stupid shit and gets called out. He streams only because people give him attention and are foolish enough to believe that he has any idea what hes talking about. It took him days just play BloodBorne and now he'll probably never touch it again. It's hilarious when he complains about people like PhantomLord when he is no better, going on talk shows when he just sits there and doesn't contribute to the conversation because he can't even spend 10 minutes looking at the notes and doing a little bit of research to make himself not a total waste of life. I don't know about you guys but I won't be here anymore, Stevens constant LIES have pushed me OVER the edge and it's a shame he could have been so much more...goodbye. PS I hope all the starbucks close down so he's never able to buy his child obsession hot chocolate. How old were you when you started watching Destiny? It might be you who has grown up and realized the low level of entertainment provided by his stream. The truth is he's always been this way. He was just as stubborn with SC2 when he first picked it up - it took him months and months, playing full-time, to reach a semi-competitive level.  When he's ""on"", his personality is absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, his ""on"" moments constitute only a tiny percentage of his overall stream time. The rest is just pure frustration - I never watch live now, instead occasionally checking the VODs instead so I can fast forward past the hours of time that would be otherwise wasted waiting for something to happen. If he would 1) learn to FOCUS on what he's doing (instead of running in circles in one Bloodborne area for four hours, dying, killing the same enemies, and over leveling himself) and 2) get excited to try new games, of which there's a vast selection both new and popular for him to have FUN exploring, I might be excited as well to see his stream is live. As it is, this product is less fun than other streamers, less refined than youtube gaming shows, and less funny than any proper comedy content. It's good enough for a few 14 year olds and the die-hards will continue to support him, and I wish him the best - he's a genuinely likable dude who's disciplined enough to put in the hours and keep powering through streams. Like you said though, it's a shame the quality of the content seems to be stagnating rather than developing - I want to see Steven and his stream flourish, not wilt. 10 years from now people will see you as one of the first big streamers ever, but who got extremely lazy and took the easy, childish way out of most situations. You are lucky that there are so many edgy retards out there who will ride your dick to the end, so you don't have to change/improve and you will still make money. Congrats on exploiting lonely man-children who look up to you and are worse off for it; you are molding them to be lazy morons for the most part. I'm sure you are proud of yourself because you make money and get to play video games all day, but will at least think about how Nathan will think of you after he observes your narcissistic ways when he is old enough to observe your past. Will he respect you or will he think you are a glorified jester with wasted potential? If he were doing this in his spare time I feel that this sort of constructive criticism would and should be lost on Destiny. As it were, this is what he's doing with his life at the moment, and I feel that any endeavour which you've committed such a significant portion of your life should leave you satisfied. If the quality of work that Destiny's offering satisfies him and suits his purposes, who are we to offer him this advice? We don't know him personally, so it's fair if he dismisses the ""armchair"" wisdom of an anonymous face on the internet; it's also fair for him to perceive even the most well-intentioned of our messages on the internet as vague passive-aggressive gibberish (you, the reader, can probably say the same of what i'm writing here). Moreover, anything that we may have thought of in terms of advice has probably already occurred to him: why do we continually seem to operate under the assumption he already doesn't know what we're writing? That's why I feel that writing that paragraph is lost on Destiny: he either is satisfied with what he gives us, or he simply doesn't care what we think. And that is really, truly, genuinely in all senses of the word, fair. After all, we have to put into this into the context of the viewer/streamer relationship paradigm: I don't think we or he can truly view him/us as someone we know or he knows, even after devoting vast swathes of our time to him and him to us.  I'm just sharing a consumer's perspective on why Destiny's entertainment offering isn't compelling to me, sympathizing with the sentiments. I have no delusion that Destiny has any interest in my advice, and I definitely wouldn't waste time trying to tell him how to manage his time and business. I just think it's interesting that people talk about the ""old Destiny"" as if the content was significantly different from the most recent streams. I think it's the viewer who has changed, not Destiny. I know that, for me, I used to find more entertainment in the things I've mentioned as now being frustrating to watch. When we talk about how the stream could be ""so much more,"" I think it's because we want the stream to grow and change with us to maintain our interest. It's an unfair expectation - almost like watching Rugrats for four years and then expecting the show to change itself to match your interests instead of just watching something else. Viewers are constantly moving into and out of demographics, and for every person who stops watching there's probably someone discovering his stream for the first time, so why try to change your product for those people who are giving up on you? I get it, and if you can make a good living doing what you're doing then the negativity is just noise. Longevity in the entertainment business is rare, though, and tends to be reserved only for the best of the best (the content that continues to develop and challenge the audience) or for the stuff with perpetual massive mainstream appeal (American Idol, etc).  I have been watching destiny since he started streaming. I was on and off months at a time but I was always around. It was fun watching destiny play games and talk about his personal feelings on issues. He would have great discussions on a wide range of topics and it was always interesting to watch. As time goes on though, things change. Not just destiny, but his viewers also. Destiny began to, in my eyes have less fun streaming but still did it because it was better than anything else at the time. With this change it was still an enjoyable stream just not as much. After a while the viewers became more and more autistic too. Now people like RTBA are deciding what content is, and isn't allowed in chat and it is quite sad to see. With random bans and nukes of comments to deciding loli is ok (but only some loli, he decides at his leisure what is ok) even though it is illegal in a majority of states and things like NSFL content banned; he has no regards for anyone in chat and has become, in my eyes worse than Dharma did. Destiny's stream was once a place to go to enjoy a quality stream watching destiny play games, talk to his friends on skype, and have talks with his chat. No longer is this the case. So this is it for me. It was fun over the years and I hope destiny continues what he wants to do and wish him luck. To the general chat who most likely haven't read this far (because of the autism) and have already typed something like ""good bye then"" or ""fuck you"" as a response, it was a displeasure speaking to you. To the people who care, it was fun. Good bye."

I wonder why that is? Could it be, I don't know, because it brings in more viewers? Because they realized SC's popularity diminished too greatly to keep doing SC content?...But wait, you said viewership is irrelevant, so that can't be it. Hmm.

Destiny,3200ud,KibaTeo,15,Thu Apr 9 14:18:25 2015 UTC,I've heard he's trying to improve on this. I think it's hard for him because    It's part of his image and makes him money He's use to doing it
Destiny,3200ud,flopagis,20,Thu Apr 9 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of a ""I'm passionate about this topic and sometimes I can't control how I speak"""
Destiny,3200ud,Salamanca22,10,Thu Apr 9 17:15:20 2015 UTC,While that's true.. He yells about things that he has no passion for as well.
Destiny,3200ud,flopagis,4,Thu Apr 9 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"When he gets like that,  he gets passionate for the argument I think.  The original topic doesn't matter,  it's more his opinion that he gets passionate about.  Not a bad thing,  other than making it hard for him to stay cool and collected."
Destiny,3200ud,Quivex,3,Thu Apr 9 18:55:19 2015 UTC,I think he realized his mistake part way through the Sky debate... sometime around TB entering. I felt like I could hear in his voice that he fucked up by yelling and was trying to overcompensate by  being extremely calm. It feels like he is trying to improve. I'm sure he knows that staying calm and collected helps your argument.
Destiny,3200ud,flopagis,2,Thu Apr 9 19:04:01 2015 UTC,Yet he forms very strong opinions around topics he has little information or experience on and then calls other people retarded for thinking differently.
Destiny,3200ud,Regemony,4,Thu Apr 9 20:58:22 2015 UTC,What's an example of this?
Destiny,3200ud,NeoDestiny,7,Thu Apr 9 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"One example would be Eve Online. After only a few months of getting into the game you were hotheadedly engaging the Eve subreddit/community and while you probably were correct in your arguments, diving into a community and calling experienced players retarded wasn't very tactful. It was very possible that due to your inexperience, you may be missing some crucial information or perspective. This isn't necessarily true but I would expect that to be so vehemently passionate about something, you've spent a lot of time/energy/effort invested in that thing.   I understand that you’re an intelligent guy who has strong convictions about most aspects of online and offline life (and that’s what makes you an interesting streamer to watch) but if something doesn't make sense to you, or you don’t agree with something, doesn't automatically make it retarded and doesn't necessarily deserve the vitriol. Understanding the reasoning for something is far more important than the argument itself.    I know the ‘Destiny’ persona online is very hyperbolic so this isn't a very strong critique of your character, just an observation of the past 4 years."
Destiny,3200ud,Regemony,7,Thu Apr 9 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I ""form very strong opinions"" often enough for you to bring it up, yet the thing you bring up happened over a year ago...   It was very possible that due to your inexperience, you may be missing some crucial information or perspective.   I wasn't, I was 100% correct in what I was saying and we ended up playing a huge game of ""LET'S MOVE THE GOAL POST"" to prove one minor point possibly incorrect on a technicality based on verbiage.   This isn't necessarily true but I would expect that to be so vehemently passionate about something, you've spent a lot of time/energy/effort invested in that thing.   ...I had?  I agree that I get too passionate/heated about arguing certain things, 100%. But I completely disagree that I ""form very strong opinions about topics I have little information"" about. I generally preface those things a million times with ""I don't have all of the information"" or ""I may be wrong"" or ""this is my uneducated conjecture."""
Destiny,3200ud,NeoDestiny,0,Thu Apr 9 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"I have one problem with that statement. Saying that you may be wrong or don't have all the information does not excuse you to then proceed to call people retards because they disagree with you or are talking about a different thing.  For example, today you were talking about decibels and you used the definition of PERCEPTION, like you hear a 10 dB sound ""twice"" as loud when people in the chat were arguing that the amplitude (the actual sound pressure) is twice higher at 6 dB.  Those are two different things. The actual sound is twice as loud at 6 dB, but your perception of its loudness may or may not be twice as loud depending on frequency, whether you first heard the louder sound or the quieter sound, etc. and it's all part of the biases of your ear for which there are definitely people studying this shit and that 10dB value is just an estimate and might be wrong depending on other factors  but in the pure physical definition it's just 6dB, the amplitude of the wave is twice higher even if your ears might not think it's ""that much louder""  for example, if you move TWICE FURTHER AWAY, the sound pressure level is 6dB lower, but your ears might not register it as ""twice quieter""  That whole discussion lacked nuance."
Destiny,3200ud,iopq,2,Fri Apr 10 08:35:42 2015 UTC,"As a streamer, you'll have to discuss various issues anyway, it's part of interacting, not to mention you can sound dogmatic at times (those those who follow you know your opinions can actually change).  Not every issue is something that you're knowledgeable about.  I'm not calling you out here or anything, it's also an attempt to explain to this sub that what /u/quivex said is unavoidable."
Destiny,3200ud,ianyapxw,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"I understand it's ""part of his image"" but whether he gains or loses more money because of it is up for debate, imagine a scenario where destiny hit it great with Sky and they start duo'ing and dicking around, theres a good chance some of sky's viewers would become attached to senpai through that. ""he's used to doing it"" is terrible, just because it's a habit doesn't mean its good"

Destiny,3200ud,Skipdash,20,Sun Apr 12 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"I thought Destiny held his composure as well as was possible in the Sky debacle.

XJ9 just didn't get what Destiny was saying at all."
Destiny,3200ud,XenesthisWhite,18,Thu Apr 9 15:03:04 2015 UTC,i dont think dusty is in the clear here. They both were antagonizing eachother.

Destiny,3200ud,NitrousOxide_,4,Thu Apr 9 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"You also have to understand the context of the situations Destiny was in. With the XJ9 case, he is talking about breaking the law, losing his streaming career and not understanding the consequences of his own actions. When you go over to Sky, he is an intelligent, highly outspoken person with a controversial opinion that was wrong. Sky was antagonizing Destiny and probably only kept up the act because he didn't like Destiny and it was also creating Twitch drama to monetize the situation."
Destiny,3200ud,Chrono92,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"xj9 was completely nuts. Not 'LuL such autism' but serious mental issues. When interacting with a guy like that you have to keep remembering that he just might show up on your lawn one night, wearing a brony costume toting dual Katanas."

You know that all electronic devices capable of sound input using a standardized diode are required by law to also have the capacity for sound output. It's a restriction placed on manufactures that was established in the late 70's for the Cold War. It directly relates to government surveillance, but rarely has it been a concern of most watchdog groups as it's a fairly outmoded method for tapping citizens."

It usualy does not act like that if you don't tinker with hardware or audio set up. Also you don't hear it cuz it's not aplfied. What destiny got is cuz he had custom setup for ps4.

Any signal generated on either the 3.5mm or RCA would pass to the other one.   Since you typically wouldn't plug a line-output directly into a transducer, you wouldn't have a problem. But Destiny had his headphones in one of them, so the signal generated by the drivers went to the mixer and then to the stream."

Destiny,31o4hy,JimmahTD,15,Tue Apr 7 07:24:38 2015 UTC,"""I think everything having to do with gift giving is like a whole bunch of fucking autistic fucking stupid shit.""   Its literally the other way around. Giving gifts is all about relationship maintaining and empathy. The closer you are to someone, the more you tend to know someone, and the better you know where their interests lie. Like the two donators said in the video: you're supposed to find someone a gift that they wouldnt have thought of buying themselves. Why is Destiny unable to imagine getting a nice gift which he couldnt have thought of buying himself? Is he assuming he already owns every single thing that he likes? In which case he would be mistaken. A simple example is how someone couldve bought him a dvd collection of Game of Thrones a long time ago, a show he only recently started watching and said he enjoyed.   When people give simple things like food or drinks, or the last resort money (never go for gift cards; hes right on that), its usually cause the relationship is not that close or the person receiving the gifts has no broad ranging interests. When people give you inappropriate gifts like the mixer or ipad example, they're just misinformed or dumb. I don't see why he judges a social interaction by its lesser performances."
Destiny,31o4hy,a34fsd,2,Tue Apr 7 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  While his opinion is probably based off of bad gift giving/receiving experiences, he totally misses the point.  A good gift is something that not only has value to the person receiving it, but also demonstrates that the gift-giver really knows you and put effort into their gift choice (ie thought of something that you yourself hadnt even thought of)."
Destiny,31o4hy,Tanukki,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:21:17 2015 UTC,Also you can care about a person but give them drinks or food cause you dont know them well (ie. distant relatives).
Destiny,31o4hy,KaeWye,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:13:52 2015 UTC,"dvd set for someone that sits on their computer 24/7?  Anyway, the problem is that people expect gifts on every birthday, christmas and valentine's day and whatnot.

Destiny,31o4hy,XenesthisWhite,-3,Tue Apr 7 11:25:25 2015 UTC,"So last year I told everyone I was not doing any sort of gift giving and want none in return, the reason being I have never enjoyed the whole gift giving practice and would rather spend my money on me, and they spend their money on them.  Lets say I get £100 in gifts, I then have to give out £100 to be equal. But it's not as simple as that, I have just given out £100 and then received 10 £10 pieces of crap.  So Christmas (also my birthday -.-) comes and I have nothing, family come over and start giving me crap and I am sitting there looking like an asshole getting all these looks as I'm wearing my dank new Jacket I bought myself. Thanks for the gifts I didn't want... I can't even remember what they bought me, but I remember this lovely Jacket!  Hopefully this year they give me nothing, hell I would even rather everyone save the money they would spend and we can all go out for a awesome meal/drinks."

Destiny,31kqih,BorNProNStar,12,Mon Apr 6 00:42:56 2015 UTC,"This guy's got it.  The game's boss fights are about learning the enemy attack patterns and figuring out a small checklist of things:  What is the attack currently happening?  Can I parry/dodge it?  Does the current attack have follow up attacks?  Under what circumstances do the follow ups occur?  Does the current attack track movement?  Will I have to dodge/parry early or late because of that?  You can see this with Destiny's Vicar Amelia fight.  Amelia has around 20 different attacks grouped up in 5 or 6 patterns, many with slight timing differences.  Two jumping attacks- one using only Amelia's right hand hitting directly in front of her, and the other having a slightly higher leap using both arms to hit a wide cone in front of her.  Both attacks have very minute differences in their start ups that you have to catch to decide if you want to dodge forward immediately to slip passed the first jump attack and get hits in, or dodge a fraction of a second later sideways from the second variation of jump attack to avoid the 90% smash that Amelia usually follows up with her quick sideways swipe for the kill.  Then you have the difference between Amelia's double-handed smash attack that sends the shockwave out, the stronger double-handed smash attack that sends out a shockwave farther and wider, OR Amelia's 30% heal.  All three moves start with her clasping her hands together as if to pray.  The difference is that she looks upwards when performing the smashes, and looks downwards when healing.  Small subtle difference determines whether you rush in to punish the heal, or dodge sideways from the attacks (plus both smash attacks have slight timing differences AND track).  There's also remembering which limbs you've done damage to, so you have an idea of what body part on Amelia you should attack to stagger her.  Her knees, both arms, and her head can all be damaged individually and each limb results in a different kind of stagger animation.  Damaging the arms immediately ends whatever attack she was doing including healing, damaging the knees allows a visceral attack on her head, and damaging her head causes her to writhe for a few seconds completely open to attacks (Destiny typically performed two charged R2s whenever he damaged Amelia's head enough).  If you're autistic like me and make spreadsheets of this stuff to track boss patterns, you'll probably do just fine.  Destiny is intentionally gimping himself by playing the game in a severely challenging way, so if you play it without those limitations you shouldn't get stuck often.  Destiny himself said it, too, ""if you get stuck you could just go to another area and get levels or fight a different boss.  I'm just doing it this way because I want to.""  Man, did I just type all that?  I really don't want to do my taxes either, Destiny..."
Destiny,31kqih,Jerails,11,Mon Apr 6 00:45:38 2015 UTC,No DPS did much better and he is retarded.
Destiny,31kqih,dacamell,22,Mon Apr 6 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. The game is difficult, but Destiny is heavily handicapped right now. Most streamers and other people that have played the game, started off with the Standard origin which had way better stats. Destiny started off with 'Waste of Skin' which literally has the description ""You should never have been born"", so he is extremely weak. Not only that, he refuses to level up vitality, so he essentially will get 1-2 shotted by everything in the game. He's made the game intentionally harder for himself, likely because he said Dark Souls 1 and 2 were way too easy. But regardless of this, the game is still quite difficult."
Destiny,31kqih,i_love_Cheekzz,15,Mon Apr 6 02:24:35 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.  There are a lot of things that you can do ""smarter"" than what I'm doing, such as:   Grinding levels and items in current area Exploring new areas and coming back to bosses later Grabbing appropriate ""boss items"" (like that stunning powder stuff) Not starting off with a gimped class ""Waste of Skin"" Different stat allocation (like not leaving Vitality at 10)   I'm gimping myself in a lot of ways because I enjoy the challenge. Losing to a boss for 6 hours and beating it is actually really enjoyable for me, and I wouldn't feel the same way if I tanked a boss's ultimate attack 3 times, healed a couple times, then slow rolled into him until he died (like I did in Dark Souls 1, one of the reasons I never finished the game). Other people wouldn't want to die over and over again and think what I'm doing is autistic is fuck (and to a large extent, they're right). It's up to you how you want to approach it, just do what's fun to you, but don't not buy the game because it looks insanely hard, I'm just playing it autistically."
Destiny,31kqih,NeoDestiny,12,Mon Apr 6 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"By the way Destiny, not sure if you know this or not but playing the game for a long period of time (12+ hours) causes it to become much easier. The game has a memory leak that does not really have an affect until 12 hours in. Bosses will use much less of their moveset and only really spam one attack. So if you notice something like that happening and you have played for awhile, shut down and restart your PS4."
Destiny,31kqih,Kregoth,4,Mon Apr 6 06:46:22 2015 UTC,I'm gimping myself in a lot of ways because I enjoy the challenge.   There's a reason why many who really love Dark Souls do 'soul level 1' runs where they never level up over the course of the game.  The game is totally beatable that way and it forces you to truly master the mechanics and it's a total blast when you finally get to that point where you can beat everything the game on player skill alone.

As much as this is true, I think I can argue that for most of us it's boring and frustrating as fuck !  Then again its your stream and you can do whatever the fuck you want right !  The only thing that rustles me, Is when you start complaining about how other streamers ( Lirik, Summit1g ...) are bigger than you and that you used to be the biggest streamer on twitch ... ( someone can link the vods ).  Well guess what ? those ppl make the game more enjoyable for their audience ! Maybe just like you they would like the challenge more ! but somehow they find a way to make it work ! maybe instead of dying for 6 hours they die 1 and adapt to keep the ppl that support them somewhat entertained.  I feel like this is survival of the fittest all over again.  Anyway see ya after the blood autism stream !"

Destiny,31lacr,Vunks,8,Mon Apr 6 05:43:02 2015 UTC,Its ok Hafe. I am sure more than a few other chatters have shitposting alts as well.
Destiny,31lacr,RightToBearArmsLOL,5,Mon Apr 6 05:44:25 2015 UTC,90% of my chatlogs are shitposting and spamming emotes and the other 10% is me actually talking to people and I've never been banned by RTBA. As far as i know only severe cases of autistic shitposting get banned. Good thing i have high-funcioning autism so i'm smart enough to know when i'm crossing the line. Klappa
Destiny,31lacr,Lacira,3,Mon Apr 6 15:51:24 2015 UTC,RTBA said he wouldn't tell me to kill myself earlier today. He's a great guy as far as I'm concerned.
Destiny,31lacr,rasmorak,-1,Mon Apr 6 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"He muted me for ten minutes and told me not to spam strawpolls (which are hard to click when chat moves quickly).

Destiny,31g5fq,JohnnynapalmSC,33,Sat Apr 4 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"I came down with a mildly severe case of terminal autism last year. My mom said I should just kill myself, but the doctor recommended a heavy dose of dank memes and an environment where no one else has social skills either. A place where effective communication and even basic cognition function isn't required to participate.  Luckily, I found the perfect place and the perfect person at Destiny.gg.  My behavior is naturally repetitive and restrictive, so I find that posting the same pictures and memes day after day is therapeutic. And because of my learning disability, it's nice having a senpai like Destiny give me pseudo-intellectual advice that only a retard like me could possibly comprehend.   Overall, I found myself becoming less concerned with social etiquette and self-awareness, and more concerned with dank memes. I would recommend this to anyone!"

He knows he does this a lot, he just doesn't offer any real explanation. My guess he's a normal hetero male who doesn't mask his true intentions which I admire. At the same time he's so thirsty and his love life has become a barren desert."

Destiny,315kg8,Kantyash,-14,Thu Apr 2 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"im sorry, what is so 10/10 beta about this? This is about a girl and a guy where the guy is more into her than the other way around. So the girl pre-emptively breaks up, cause she knows the relationship wont last. This kind of stuff and the reactions that follow, are like the normal of normals.  Both feel like shit about it cause they still like each other a lot, as shown in this conversation, but the dude feels more fucked, cause he cared more. In this convo its obv JP is hurt a lot, and even more so cause he thought everything was good, which makes the break up even more sudden and painful."
Destiny,315kg8,seodoth,29,Thu Apr 2 10:21:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry buddy, it's an accurate rating. A long history of white-knighting and beta behavior was taken into account, not just a single conversation.   ...umm, interesting analysis though. Here's what I think happened: JP was thirsty as fuck. She wasn't. He started becoming overly needy and whinny. Feeling pressured, Livinpink backed off. JP became desperate:“you're coming to xmas here...ill pay for it”. Livinpink ends the relationship before it could even get started – even dropping the “nice guy” line in the process. JP is destroyed, but recovers in time to put her on Roll Play and defend her honor against Incontrol."
Destiny,315kg8,VyseTheFearless,-1,Thu Apr 2 13:17:27 2015 UTC,I don't think any of that is that unreasonable. Another guy wanting the same girl shouldn't stop anyone anyway. That's just healthy competition imo.

Destiny,30tymj,dacamell,3,Mon Mar 30 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"So I have no context on this issue at all, and you're providing me MORE things I need context for."
Destiny,30tymj,SMMBG,15,Mon Mar 30 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"To the best of my understanding*, Sky is a black(ish?) homosexual twitch streamer who took issue with streamers (women) manipulating their viewers (showing cleavage, etc.) to monetize their streaming endeavors.  Destiny takes the stance that it is marketing/good business to use the traits you have accessible to you (physical or otherwise) to generate traffic and revenue. I believe he also made the appeal that Sky does the same thing by utilizing his sexuality and race to generate viewership. Moreover, we know that Destiny's perspective on the way women dress is that it is their prerogative to choose how they dress and why (including the fact that some women enjoy dressing in ""revealing"" clothing because that garment happens to also be comfortable, or it builds their self-esteem, or whatever the case may be), so there is also that defense of the ""sexualization"" of streams.  Having said that, we all know our beloved Steven Bonnell II is prone to episodes of excitability (shouting, telling you to kill yourself, etc.). His perspective is (at least somewhat) that you should value his argument on its content rather than its presentation. I don't believe he is an idiot, so he may know that the way he presents an argument does certainly affect the way it is received (not everyone is an autist).  While in a vacuum, I agree that rational, reasonable people would be willing and able to evaluate an argument on its own merits (regardless of language or presentation), it is irrational to expect a  ""feeling"" (vs. thinking) person to disregard your vitriol (was it vitriolic?) to get to the meat and bones of what you're saying.  It seems like TotalBiscuit, who is a bit more controlled in the way he presents his opinions (also top dank british accent), shared some of Destiny's same views and shed light on them to Sky who then partially conceded some(much?) of the argument.  However, this provided a platform for Sky fans and people who generally dislike Destiny and/or the way he sometimes (often? recently) presents arguments to bitch at/hate on/generate more drama with Destiny. This seems to be the case with the two shitters above on Twitter.  That said I could be off base about the content of the discussion because I did not watch/listen to it, but it sounds about right.  TLDR Destiny got excited while arguing about exploitation/sexualization by streamers and some people think that he is 10/10 ultimate rage aspie shitter with aspie fans.   /u/NeoDestiny feel free to course-correct this if you have any interest in doing so  *I did not actually read/watch/whatever the discussion between Sky, TB, Destiny, etc."
Destiny,30tymj,NovemberTerra,8,Mon Mar 30 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"I love steven and I think this is one of his main selling points (seeing him rage is pretty fucking hilarious) but this incident fucking happened cause destiny is a world class autist who cant control himself in heated situations. If the other person doesn't understand his points, destiny ends up screeching and/or tells them kill themselves.   This ends up happening in 9/10 of his arguments.

It's the relentless retards in chat saying the dumbest, most retarded shit.  ""Destiny, you should itemize to target carries, trust me, as ADC you should be shooting other carries, I am Diamond 2.""  ""Destiny, even though you said x could do better, THAT'S TOTALLY IRRELEVANT AND MEANS NOTHING YOU COULD DO SOMETHING BETTER WHY WOULD YOU EVER EVEN COMMENT ON SOMETHING YOUR TEAMMATE DID I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU MENTION IT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT ANYONE ELSE IN THE GAME EVER.""  ""Destiny, why do you always play Draven?"" then 1 week later ""Destiny, why are you only playing Graves?"" then 1 week later ""Destiny, do you ever play anything besides Jinx?""  Then after fighting/arguing with chat I get posts on my subreddit going ""why does Destiny even play League he's so rustled all the time LOL"".  And then when I'm doing well in LoL and having fun ""LOL THIS FAKE EXCITEMENT IS SO PATHETIC"" because every exciting moment in SC2 was 100% legit and every exciting moment in LoL is 100% phantoml0rd'ed in.

Destiny,30sroo,Deltronium,2,Mon Mar 30 14:31:17 2015 UTC,What's your honest opinion on people trying to give legitimate advice when playing other roles that you don't have a whole lot of experience on? Does it get annoying or do you like the help?
Destiny,30sroo,NaughtyGaymer,3,Mon Mar 30 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"But that's the crux of the situation, though. What's legitimate advice and what's not? In a chat with 3000 people yelling ""advice"" at the top of their lungs, it's impossible to distinguish good advice from bad, thus all advice becomes useless.  Even if you had a confirmed source and the time to read and process the advice during a game, the kind of information that is delivered through the chat client is really unhelpful for trying to make any real progress.  ""Do this, not that"", ""build that instead"" or ""focus on that champ first"" addresses just one unique situation at a time and is an incredibly slow and inefficient way of teaching. Altering decision-making processes, prioritization and min-maxing for varying situations takes time, effort and understanding on the part of the teacher, and time, will and trust on the part of the learner. That's not really viable in a chat environment with 2999 other voices giving additional, or even directly contradicting, advice at a thousand words per second."

Destiny,30sroo,Terakahn,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"I doubt you'll read this reply, but as someone who gives advice in your chat, I do try and tone it down. Generally if you ask the stream for advice I'll chime in, and here and there otherwise.  None of my advice is b8, I truly believe all of it, even if you might disagree with some of it.  I think part of the reason you get so easily rustled by some chatters though is because, as you've said, League isn't a game where you can definitively go ""I know better than you"".  Your whole argument on support Morgana's pool not being used for anything except for when you land a bind, for instance, was just blatantly wrong. But you not only argued the other side of the coin, you got rustled by those who disagreed with you and even started timing out some people (Although they probably deserved it anyways for being nasty about how they argued). The conversation ended with ""Lets stop talking about it or I ban you"".  That argument started with you saying Morgana should never use her pool to poke. It's wrong, you stated it like a fact, and you're in a position of authority being a big streamer claiming to have hit higher diamond divisions in past seasons. So of course there are going to be those in chat trying to refute you.  The fact of the matter is the game has changed a lot, players have gotten better at the game as a whole, and there's still a lot you need to learn. And I'm not saying this from my high horse, I'm not that much higher than you, I'm a Diamond 5 player, and I have a lot to learn about the game, too.  So yes, you have a point, there's a bunch of bait, and morons, and ragers in your chat goading you on and generally saying stupid stuff out of either ignorance or to get your attention. But you hyperfocus on the morons and usually ignore the more reasonable players with decent game knowledge.  If you want people who know what they're doing for League: TailsDarcy, badDraven, a few others I can't think of off the top of my head, and myself (I have pretty good game knowledge about the game in general, but I do main ADC and then support)."
Destiny,30sroo,Shadostruct,2,Wed Apr 1 06:05:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply Dusty, good to know.  Follow up question if you'd care to respond: Is the chat less russling when you play other games or is it at its worst (best) during LoL?"
Destiny,30sroo,derverwuenschte,4,Mon Mar 30 12:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, chat is less russling when he plays other games, but that's because games like starcraft 2 are less accessible and it's harder to backseat game.   The fact that LoL is free to play means that literally anyone in chat can give out his ""pro tips"" to Destiny.  So yes you could say it's worse, but for other reasons, it's not the game per se, if sc2 was free to play he'd get the same kind of shit."
Destiny,30sroo,Finaltidus,5,Mon Mar 30 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure destiny is more rustled whle playing LoL because people in chat are better than him. Similar things happened when he played CS:GO. People try to give criticism but the instant it happens destiny snaps and says something is irrelevant or doesn't matter when it really does. He refuses to listen and then asks for a multi page response in 60 seconds before banning someone, it is pathetic. Chat would be a lot better if he just had RTBA time out people for back seat gaming. The other reason is that he decides to take every fucking bait that is posted in chat."
Destiny,30sroo,pacjax,-1,Mon Mar 30 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Destiny you should probably look at yourself as the cause of all the rustle in this situation. Its very childish to argue with ur chat all the fucking time. People respond to childish behavior with childish responses or trolling which in turn pisses u off because of how childish the responses are and/or how trolly. Perhaps if u didnt exibit such childish behavior on stream, childish trolls and viewers would not shit up the stream 24/7. The amount of time u spend arguing with random people in chat is downright silly."

Destiny,30sroo,Gilbanator,-10,Tue Mar 31 06:25:31 2015 UTC,"Just wondering. How often do you watch other streams or even EU/NA LCS?  I don't know if you know, but Sneaky played Draven in NA LCS vs CLG and was a pretty dominant factor in the game Here's the endgame screenshot.  The reason I'm saying this is not because you are 'behind the meta' or anything. But because at Plat and beyond, every botlane you face is going to be spamming the shit they see in LCS, and being able to respond to that (In terms of picks, and itemisation) quickly will help.  This is coming from someone who has been playing League since late s1 as a main game until round about now since I've started uni. So my advice holds a bit more weight than some of the kids in your chat who just seem to be immature on the topic.  Also, when can we see you duo with some of the other League streamers? Seeing you stream with Qtpie would be interesting, maybe try and get Double to coach you again after playoffs? Or even Sneaky, since he's considered the best ADC in NA.  Edit: Downvoted because I didn't respond trying to dick ride you with dank and edgy memes about trigger warnings or use the word nigger like a cringy skinny as fuck white kid with rich as fuck parents. As much as I enjoy Destinys stream, I really fucking hate this 'community'."

Destiny,30pbyl,rdc30,52,Sun Mar 29 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"He got banned a few days before that. He deleted his account because people kept PM'ing him because they were told that he told a suicidal kid to kill himself. Which ofc was a lie that got a ton of upvotes all over those threads.  When he defends himself against people spreading lies he gets banned, when people lie and incite a witch hunt nothing happens even with multiple mods and riot people in the thread.  And people wonder why he hates both parties"
Destiny,30pbyl,BaronVonAwesomEU,28,Sun Mar 29 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"While that's fucking horrible if it's true, does anyone else find it slightly fake that suddenly this kid commits suicide and then his ""Brother"" posts on his reddit account that it happened a few days after he made a scathing post that ""People like Richard Lewis existing makes commiting suicide so much easier""  Idk, I'm just not convinced that he isn't pretending to be a ""Brother"" who conveniently loaded up his reddit account and knew to post on a Richard Lewis thread."
Destiny,30pbyl,TBWolf,12,Sun Mar 29 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I think him providing proof would be at the very least the minimum thing he could do (even though if it's actually true it's kinda fucking rude to be asking this stuff). The reddit account had like 4 posts total before ""the brother"" came, clearly the user didn't use reddit much or has another account especially since he probably made an alt account(the one he used to diss richard because he didn't want richard to shit on him on his main account) to post the sob story about him failing  his parents and didn't want people to see, especially any family members.  His ""Brother"" came at the exact same moment that everyone on reddit started witch hunting RL for calling out the kid, and it's pretty obvious it's the same dude that just wants people to shit more on RL."
Destiny,30pbyl,BaronVonAwesomEU,12,Sun Mar 29 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't expect privacy when you post in public forums. If the kid didn't want to be called on his hypocrisy he should have kept his mouth shut, suicidal or not."
Destiny,30pbyl,BaronVonAwesomEU,10,Sun Mar 29 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending him at all, he should have been banned way earlier, I literally reported a dude twice for harassing me on the /r/leagueoflegends and he got banned (I don't know for how long though), imagine the amount of reports RL must have had. I'm just saying that people are using the fact that the kid was suicidal as a way to take more jabs at Richard are retarded.   RL read the title of the post on** /r/offmychest** not /r/suicidewatch or what ever, and called him out on the hypocrisy, people saying he stalked the kid or what ever are fucking retarded, kid had like 3 reddit comments at that point, and shouldn't expect privacy on a public forum (like some retards kept saying).  The witch hunt that happened after that was clearly based off people who blatantly lied on the /r/leagueoflegends saying he told a kid to kill himself and that he mocked him for being suicidal and got banned because of that (which he didn't), which even though no one provided proof for their claims everyone upvoted and believed it.   ""and what about the mods??""   He went on the show to point out how the mods are selective on how they enforce their rules (the which hunt is a perfect example).  People have been going on every thread about him and posting lies since forever and he has a right to defend himself from these claims, and again i'm not defending the way he did this, but the mods never did shit to these people, who after getting warning once would just make a new alt account and continue to do the same shit."
Destiny,30pbyl,BaronVonAwesomEU,-1,Sun Mar 29 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"people saying he stalked the kid    I havent seen anyone say anything like that and I read all the comments.  also read the stuff I linked please. (its in the edit)  Fyi I ""trolled"" him once (baited him into an argument) and I immediately got a massive warning and was told if I ever talk to him again I'll be permbanned, the mods arent selective at all. He's being treated BETTER than the average user, he got away with shit for years cause mods were scared of being doxed."
Destiny,30pbyl,hydrogenc4r,6,Sun Mar 29 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"the stuff I linked   Here's my opinion on that  And source 2 is getting shitted on on those comments.  Source 3 is hilarious because RL has been getting dirt on KT for months now (he hated him even before he came to /r/leagueoflegends apparently) and he seems scared shitless tbh.   and I immediately got a massive warning and was told if I ever talk to him again I'll be permbanned,   And that's the problem, the users that consistently stalked him just made new accounts at that point.   the mods arent selective at all   Explains why they didn't remove the shit and lies that was being thrown at RL in those threads.   He's being treated BETTER than the average user, he got away with shit for years cause mods were scared of being doxed.   Completely true but I highly doubt it was because they we're afraid of the Dox (considering most of the mods have twitter accounts with their names on them) but just because he is highly against their moderation and would throw shit at their eyes if they did (kinda of what's happening now and will happen soon to KT)."

Destiny,30mmyj,Chriscras66,2,Sat Mar 28 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"If he's having headphones go into the mixer, then using line 5/6 for ps4 wouldn't allow him to listen to the ps4 audio without the mic.   The 2 track input can be sent directly to the phones out. If its in 5/6 he would have to monitor the main mix, which is mic+ps4. He would have to mute line5/6 to send it to ALT3-4, monitor that, then have ALT3-4 out route back into another channel which is added to the main mix."
Destiny,30mmyj,coryo,4,Sat Mar 28 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"I beleive he doesn't use the headphones connected to the mixer and plans to use it connected to the FiiO DAC 3.5mm jack output.  If he wants to use it connected to the mixer then he can use the SOLO function. On this mixer putting a channel into SOLO mode does not affect the MAIN MIX output, only the control room/headphones output.  So putting a channel into SOLO mode, will make only that channel play on the headphones output, but the main mix will remain unaffected.  According to the manual."
Destiny,30mmyj,coryo,2,Sat Mar 28 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"The fiio dac has a line out, which isn't ideal for driving headphones. (assuming i'm looking at the right one).  If the solo feature works that way then I guess ideally ps4 would go into line 5/6, and headphones into mixer."
Destiny,30mmyj,coryo,2,Sat Mar 28 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on plugging in the headphones directly to the DAC is not good, it would be better to plug it in to the mixer directly.  The DAC he bought yesterday was a FiiO D3 (D03K) and the 3.5 mm output is a line-out which is not intended for a headphone signal."
Destiny,30mmyj,coryo,4,Sat Mar 28 21:30:08 2015 UTC,"The final solution with 2PCs and and a PS4 would have to be like   Headphones into mixer PS4 -> Line in 5/6(-10dBv) Gaming PC Line out-> Line in 7/8 (-10) Solo enabled on 5/6 and 7/8 Mixer USB to the Stream PC giving it the main mix (mic+ps4+gamingpc)   Then the last issue is getting the mic signal without the other channels into any applications that need it (skype, voice chat in games)  That could be achieved by repurposing the aux send.    Have the aux send 2 loop back to the Return 2 (left). Have return 2 go to alt 3-4 via the button. Have alt 3-4 line outs go to the gaming PC (line in). gaming PC can now have voice for csgo and skype. connect aux send 1 to gaming PC line in turn aux send 1 dials off for non mic channels.   edited"
Destiny,30mmyj,Photex,6,Sat Mar 28 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Corrected diagram based on suggestions below.  Made your solution plan into a diagram for clear graphical representation.

Destiny,30mmyj,coryo,5,Sun Mar 29 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"extra things to note:  line out from the ps4 and gaming pc will be -10dBv which can be set on the line ins on the mixer.  The aux send to gaming pc line will be going +4dBu to -10dBv so it will have to be lowered to -11.79dB so it will match.  Also if the headphone amp on the mixer is not very good, the control room line out can be sent to some other headphone amp.  also the mic is XLR, perfect diagram otherwise."
Destiny,30mmyj,RustleOverwhelming,3,Sun Mar 29 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"this is all correct and is how I would setup a two PC setup  edit: and I mean that non-sarcastically, this was a very detailed setup and doesn't add anything unnecessary into the loop."
Destiny,30mmyj,y3n0,2,Sun Mar 29 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"That is a very good setup. Exactly what he needs to do with two PCs.  But why loop back the AUX SEND 2 to the AUX RETURN and then route it to the ALT 3-4? Just use the AUX SEND 2 output and plug it into the gaming PC line-in. Then it just needs a single 1/4"" to 3.5mm jack cable."
Destiny,30mmyj,RightToBearArmsLOL,2,Sat Mar 28 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"good point. It's easy to over-think things :p  In that case use the aux send 1 instead, then you can still use the built in effects. (which probably shouldn't be used but whatever)"

Well then, his experience with marijuana wasn't negative it seems.  I am not sure if it would be good idea to stream at first... weed is... unpredictable. First time i tried it i was PARANOID AS FUCK i thought i was gonna die, but that is due to the envirionment i was in and the people. Other than the paranoia, i felt a weird WAVE of information comming trough my ears, nose, mouth, eyes: Everything that stimulated me in some way was enhanced A LOT.  The part that started making me really nervous was when every word people said to me, i started connecting with dozens of other posibilities for sentences, which made it impossible for me to focus on something specific for more than a second. After thinking my friends were luring me into a position in the street where a sniper could shot me dead, i panicked, and then took me for a walk in which we started singing and making rhymes for songs we made on the spot we didn't even knew we were able to make. When i got home i LAUGHED MY ASS OFF for being so scared and realized how silly my reaction was.   Nowadays, i realize how fucking amazing weed is for listening to music and doing things that stimulate your senses: Orgasms are amazing while high, taste, smell, are all enhanced and if you CHILL it's an amazing experience.   But yes, if anyone want to try it, remember it might not be what you expect the first time. Also, you feel your guts :P"

Because it is possible to look without doing that (which I did). I did help with the first reply, and I guess maybe it wasn't obvious to you at the time, but for the reasons I said above I wasn't going to just unban you (because that is going to x lengths for some people, but y for others)...  After I saw Destiny had tried to delete it and couldn't and I couldn't I was undoing things that happened after that point, but not before, because I  didn't know the context of it. You could have been hit with Destinys long nuke of YEE, or the tempadd by Bot (which for you would be longer, because your ascii timer is long because you get yourself muted pretty regularly)."

Destiny,3090al,whiteguycash,2,Wed Mar 25 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"No. Youtube is the service provider. They host a video-sharing website and make it a hassle-free experience for its customers to watch and/or share videos online. In exchange for hosting services, the customers agree to be subjected by their advertisements and data-mine collection. Google's Terms & Services, anyone? This is where marketing companies come in. By purchasing ad space,  marketing companies are helping to finance Google's upkeep. In return, they have a common place in which they could sell their ads online.

I'm pointing the fact that Own3d was financially fucking over their streamers and was doomed to failed because of their incompetence. I'm not saying that Destiny early successes on Twitch was entirely due to luck, but that was a really favorable situation for him switching over as early as he did, and switching this time would not be comparable because Twitch isn't failing.

One, youtube claims to have higher quality streams than twitch, and destiny masturbates nightly to the idea of his stream being higher quality as we saw last night.   Two, destiny is as independent as streamers get from twitch, making the move a lot easier.  Three, destiny clearly isn't in the inner circle at twitch. He could at least expect youtube to act more professionally in terms of warnings and bannings than the favoritism that seems to exist at twitch. (I would hope)"

Destiny,307ppz,iopq,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"Now idk what if how much has been discussed on stream but when I did research for my own purposes I came to the conclusion there seems to be a gap between 1080p consumer grade cards and the professional equipment like Blackmagic Designs' DeckLink product line.   Even the latter doesn't list 1440p in its supported resolutions and they probably don't see it as a problem - their mindset is on things in terms of TV broadcasts and there the next step up from 1080 or ""full hd"" as the marketing term goes is Ultra HD or 4K as it is called. Resolutions such as 4096x2160, something that is definitely coming to gaming and monitors in general, just not quite yet as an everyday thing.  The only 1440p capture cards I came across were some rather unknown chinese brands and while indeed chinese slave labor is efficient in producing iPhones and whatnot, their own brands' stuff has in many cases proven to not be, well, optimally designed and/or fully tested.  The other option talked about especially on the OBS forums is using the quicksync hardware in intel processors and a nginx server instead of a capture card but if I was to run nginx it'd probably be on linux and the OBS multiplatform final release is still quite far away"

The entire structure of geemu made it extremely hard for anyone new to actually make money in null without an alt.  I think that contributed to why so many new players burned out so quickly.  Tons of ex geemu are out in the wild in many different corporations. Seeing people I haven't seen on the other side of the battlefield is always kind of fun. About two weeks ago I was talking in an ex-geemu eve chat room about how I was on my way for a fun fleet vs black legion. Turns out, some dude in the room was on the opposite side of things about to brawl with our fleet. We had a good laugh and got on each others killmails.   If you want to keep in touch with an old geemu bro, message Relick Bumbacka in game. Geemu bros are best bros."

But yes, we were (and still are?) Blue to BL, so a large number of ex-Geemu ended up there. If you have the mindset, knowledge, and isk to cut it, BL isn't a bad place to be."

Destiny,2zvpxm,Wonder_cube,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"I would never say never. People didn't expect him to go back to League, but he did. I wouldn't expect him to come back any time soon though."

Destiny,2zsuk1,MMACheerpuppy,10,Sat Mar 21 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"pretty sure destiny didn't get shut down because he was streaming youtube... there are whole channels dedicated to drawing and music, and welp surprise: those aren't games."
Destiny,2zsuk1,pphp,14,Sat Mar 21 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"Twitch isn't specifically for Gaming content.  And Destiny didn't get banned because he was showing ""non-gaming content"", he got banned because he was streaming copyrighted Youtube videos.  He received complaints because of this (not that I agree with his ban, or the complaints he received from streaming the videos)."
Destiny,2zsuk1,Magnious,5,Sat Mar 21 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"A week or two ago I started watching a VOD and something like the first two hours of the stream ended up being YouTube videos. The Twitch.tv ""Rules of Conduct"" explicitly states the following:  ""... while it's nice to take a break and just chill out with your audience, please ensure that your channel's primary focus is on gaming or music creation""  Also, everything on YouTube is copyrighted. There's an implicit copyright on any original content you create."
Destiny,2zsuk1,CroozeTM,2,Sat Mar 21 19:49:07 2015 UTC,I really can't remember the last copyrighted thing we streamed. We usually sit on /r/cringe where YouTube videos generally surmount to free distribution.  Still it follows from my meme arrows if Destiny was banned of a copyright content claim then why not ban all-streamers such that they get red-flagged by Twitch for playing copyrighted music automatically for uniform punishment?   Nightblue3 LITERALLY keeps Spotify on throughout his streams.  but whatever I'm trying to stay out of this debate.
Destiny,2zsuk1,NeoDestiny,0,Sat Mar 21 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"We usually sit on /r/cringe where YouTube videos generally surmount to free distribution.   That's not true.

Destiny,2zq3dc,yankedoodle,66,Fri Mar 20 18:13:14 2015 UTC,youre wrong   nigga okay
Destiny,2zq3dc,davidez451,41,Fri Mar 20 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"Sky made a very vague claim but still stood behind it. very strong claim. It was misinterpreted as an attack on female streamers. Sky was really just stating that streamers use tactics which can use viewers 'wants' to 'hustle' them for money. ie boobie stream can get teenage boys money because boobs. or reading their comment for money .  Enter TB who Destiny tries to use to backup everything Destiny and Kacey have been saying which TB does, however that isn't enough for Sky. So TB ends up repeating everything then Sky understands.  After hours Sky finally saw that his vague claim could be interpreted by two types of people.    1 People who understand what he is trying to say. 2 Sexist  who think Sky was reinforcing their world views.   Destiny, Kacey, and a lot of other people thought sky was being an asshole when he was just being stupid.  If you were wondering. From beginning to end SIVHD said nothing of value."
Destiny,2zq3dc,BasediCloud,10,Fri Mar 20 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"Sky was making the sex-negative feminism case. That is why he got such a strong positive reaction (and also positive reaction from women). It's the same offendatron crowd which wants to reduce breast size in video game characters.  I would argue the ""People who understand what he is trying to say"" crowd from the video is zero. A lot of people who will now pretend he was arguing against female streamers who exploit male teenagers via private message will just do so cause it makes them look better. It is a hard case to make given he spews quite a lot of hate in the direction of those male kids.  I would even go so far and argue that Sky was intentionally attacking female streamers and that he is a sex-negative feminist. And that he just is backpaddling cause TB doesn't share his views. It is apparent that his view wasn't swayed by logic but instead by TB's authority.  All the discussion tactics he used. From screaming himself to dismissing Destiny for raising his voice to pandering to Kaceytron that she is special and absolutely not targeted to goal post shifting to fallacies to playing the victim to ""women have it sooo hard"". That is the complete social justice book. It is hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing."
Destiny,2zq3dc,WinterSays,6,Sat Mar 21 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think the claim was strong at all. A streamer using their body is not tricking people into watching him or her, the viewer in question is making a conscious decision to watch that stream. And misinterpreting Sky's video as an attack against all women isn't sexist, what the fuck, they just didn't understand him and his argument that changed atleast twice or more during the conversation.  I also totally agree the SivHD guy had no idea what on earth was going on, what a fucking joke."
Destiny,2zq3dc,hix3r,6,Fri Mar 20 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Ultimately I think Sky sees a problem with the direction where Twitch is heading. Of course everyone can choose freely what to watch, he beleives some forms of entertainment don't belong on Twitch because while they are entertaining they divert attention from the ""gaming"" aspect too much which Twitch supposed to be about, and causes entertaining gamers being buried.  Similarly you don't see porn on a cooking channel. I would bet a cooking show with erotic elements would have amazing viewership. Then other smaller cooking programs would have a hard time getting the same amount of viewership without using erotic elements. You could say then ""Well that's the real world, it's though."" But this channel was supposedly created exclusively with the purpose of promoting cooking related stuff and celebrating the cooking culture, where else would you go with your own cooking show?  You could say it's the shows' fault, they should only show cooking. But the producers are only trying to make a show they suspect will become popular in the current market. You could say well this kind of show shouldn't be on a cooking channel. Then you could argue that it's the channel's right to choose what to air to have the maximum viewership. Against this you could argue that then it has lost it's right to be called a true cooking channel. Then it became a difference in opinion of what you call a cooking channel and what should be there.  This whole argument was pointless from the start because at the core the difference was in taste and subjective opinion of what Twitch should be about, where to draw the line, how much could a streamer still deviate from ""pure gaming"" content and still be considered relevant to the theme of a streaming platform supposedly made for gaming. Then stupidity threw the whole thing loops around the sun. Also SivHD was there."
Destiny,2zq3dc,Snizzlenose,2,Sat Mar 21 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched everythng but from what SivHD has said, I think he's just trying to keep outside of it because he's ultimately against what Sky is saying, but want to remain friends with him."

And he is aware of two cases where that has happened, both times with a female streamer."
Destiny,2zq3dc,Wurstinator,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"Kind of, but not actually in the ""I was wrong""-sense.

Destiny,2zq3dc,SlyCaribou,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"Sky made a video, some people got rustled. Kacey wrote a response to said video that rustled Sky. Sky reached out to have a 'conversation' because he thinks of Kacey as a friend and he felt slighted; because I guess constructive criticism doesn't exist between friends... Conversation turned into shouting match.  Sky tried very hard, and failed to convey that he personally believes there are real and observable negative consequences to female streamers who use their sexuality to take advantage of horny younger men. Specifically because of the internet/Twitch sub-culture around the chatrooms of these streamers where women are mocked and demeaned and how that toxicity flows over to other women streamers who are not using their sexuality to take advantage of people. Thus, according to him, people are being harmed by this behavior.  In reality the consequence that Sky is referring to is most certainly a real thing; but Sky is placing the blame on the women who are taking advantage of that toxicity and not the mouth-breathers who are perpetrating it.  I'm not completely done with these 3 videos but apparently Sky eventually back-pedals and broadens his claim to anyone who takes advantage of people? Which makes his argument that much more dubious."

Destiny,2zr3c5,PenPaperShotgun,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:21:16 2015 UTC,"He picked up League again, but it is nowhere the same... It is so damn sad... I loved his stream, but now... He even played yesterday some mobile moba on his mobile phone and went from 4k viewers to 1,3k viewers in like 30 mins lel Was just so damn boring to watch. Don't know if he got payed to play this game tho."
Destiny,2zr3c5,i_love_Cheekzz,1 point,Sat Mar 21 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"Of course he got paid. He asked for people to add him on his friends list, because that gets them to download the game and he no doubt had reverals"

Destiny,2zr3c5,willgreenzilla,6,Mon Mar 23 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame.  I really like PhatomL0rds stream, been watching for a while. Call me stupid but I liked the loud music, the screaming whilst playing league, etc...  Then he started ""playing"" CS:GO (I say ""playing"" because I don't consider opening crates for 8 hours actually playing a game) and he got with Dingle and everything changed. I like Dingle, I think she is quite funny, I'll watch her stream sometimes.  But PL seems to have gone the way of ""shock"" streams, drinking heavily on stream, turning his headset mic on in the bathroom, this shock collar stuff... It's pretty pathetic to watch.  I miss the days where it was PL, some metal music, and LoL. Now it's all crate opening, stupid Jackass like stunts and he comes across as so insincere now."

Destiny,2zr3c5,poko610,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not Starcraft2 was a big reason why twitch started off. One of the co-founders even admitted this in a AMA here on reddit that SC2 played a role in twitch's creation.  With that said in relation to your question, ""whats the point in watching someone else play"", as far as SC2 goes there was actually some good value in watching pro players and even GM's stream where they would commentate on their decision and thoughts during the game and give insight to strategies. This was very valuable to people learning the game, in fact it was so valuable some sc2 streamers stopped streaming because other pro's were able to use it to their advantage when competing against each other.  Now, as you've seen twitch has become a mixture of the former and now where cam whores taking over who just care about making money."

Just jumping on that dick and riding it all night long, stroking the fuck out of that dick.

Destiny,2znxv3,FLABREZU,40,Fri Mar 20 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"Sky is so terrible at arguing. Half the time he just completely avoids the point and goes off on a tangent. Also, it's incredibly obvious that Kaceytron's response was serious. How could you possibly think that was trolling?"
Destiny,2znxv3,lurker093287h,7,Fri Mar 20 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think he was using an incoherent version of motte and bailey strategy, where he made sweeping claims in his video and is retreating to a more defensible position when questioned, and that was a bit of a straw that he just grasped at."
Destiny,2znxv3,RDandersen,2,Fri Mar 20 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"Nah, that strategy is planned out and deliberate. This is was just plain ol' backpaddling when confronted with unexpected critique."
Destiny,2znxv3,lurker093287h,3,Fri Mar 20 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt that it was planned. He genuinely didn't seem to understand what he was doing and sort of stumbled between arguments like somebody trapped between two escalators.   I kind of think that it's difficult to argue and clear your thoughts when you feel that you're being attacked, and that his incoherence might have been from that though."
Destiny,2znxv3,RDandersen,2,Fri Mar 20 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I think. That coupled with Sky genuinely not seeming aware of how the video was perceived by most people."

You give him some money, you get the instant gratification of your name appearing in front of thousands of people and someone famous reading out what you have to say. You pay money for attention.

Destiny,2znxv3,densaki,6,Fri Mar 20 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"it's naive to think that ""there are no losers""   Because ths is an actual competitive system, in which people are constantly competing for viewers with new gimmicks, new ideas, new anything, just to set them apart. It's not a bad thing there are losers, but thats the only reason twitch exists.   the whole donate ""feel a part of something, maybe a pretty girl will read your message and give you a bonor"" system that's going on, the whole thing is exploitative of lonely impressionable people, it's not objectively wrong but it's lame as fuck   This is in no way a uniquely Woman only exploit, In fact, Phantoml0rd was one of the first league streamers that got popular doing it. Its kind of ridiculous that it originally was a unisex trick, but since females do it guys are screaming ""MUH MUH MUH EQUALITY"""
Destiny,2znxv3,pm_your_squatch,5,Fri Mar 20 11:18:29 2015 UTC,"This is in no way a uniquely Woman only exploit   Yeah, it's not just women, the whole streaming thing is kind of debauched male or female with all the weird manipulative mind tricks to exploit people out of money, I think what Sky was saying was that it's not wrong for you to do that but it makes you a douche."
Destiny,2znxv3,densaki,3,Fri Mar 20 11:27:10 2015 UTC,"But the problem here is that sky called out female streamers for doing dumb shit, yet for the most part, all the top male and female streamers got where they are through manipulating people. So complaining about the woman problem is totally irrelevant."
Destiny,2znxv3,andinuad,-5,Fri Mar 20 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"Let's say guy A is 170.32324324324... cm tall, do we say that he is that tall? No, we do an approximation by stating that he is 170 cm tall.  In the same sense: if someone loses close to 0, we round whatever he lost to 0. So if noone lost anything of significance, then it is correct to state through approximation that there are no losers."

Destiny,2znxv3,JACdMufasa,-4,Fri Mar 20 04:55:36 2015 UTC,Destiny and Kaceytron both said that it was incredibly obvious that her response was sarcasm...
Destiny,2znxv3,FLABREZU,9,Fri Mar 20 06:21:59 2015 UTC,That was for a different tweet.  This was the one that was clearly sarcasm: https://twitter.com/kaceytron/status/578230770482999296  This is the one that sparked the whole thing tonight and he said he couldn't tell if she was trolling: https://twitter.com/kaceytron/status/578752484145004544
Destiny,2znxv3,JACdMufasa,4,Fri Mar 20 06:24:16 2015 UTC,Tweet #1 is the obvious sarcasm. Tweet #2 she was definitely serious.   Sky said on stream that he didn't even read #2. The chat was spamming to look at Kacey's twitter because of #2. He saw #1 and was confused by whether it was sarcasm or not and asked her if she wanted to skype about it.   The whole thing started because of #2 but sky was mentioning #1 whenever he was talking about a tweet.
Destiny,2znxv3,FLABREZU,3,Fri Mar 20 06:32:06 2015 UTC,"Before the discussion started, he saw tweet #2 and said that he couldn't tell if she was serious or just trolling. He then said that actually they should just discuss it on Skype."
Destiny,2znxv3,JACdMufasa,4,Fri Mar 20 06:38:36 2015 UTC,"No, whenever he was discussing a tweet it was to #1. When everyone was in the mix (kacey, destiny, siv, and tb) Sky quoted #1 word for word to bring it up as a topic to debate on. Sky said ""to be honest I didn't even open up the other one (#2)"". I don't know why he wouldn't, all he had to do was click the google doc link. But either way he was specifically talking about #1. Kacey and Destiny's counter point was that ""the tweet was obvious sarcasm"" with TB chiming in that he could tell it was sarcasm too. Even if there was some initial ambiguity on which tweet it was, them mentioning sarcasm plus sky quoting it means they were definitely talking about #1."
Destiny,2znxv3,FLABREZU,3,Fri Mar 20 06:49:33 2015 UTC,"That may be the case if he didn't actually read the second one. If so, he articulated his argument pretty poorly, given that he didn't specify before Siv came on and the entire time it sounded like he was referencing her most recent response."
Destiny,2znxv3,JACdMufasa,3,Fri Mar 20 06:55:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest the whole thing was a shit show before Total biscuit came in. Sky not being very clear, and then Destiny making the problem worse by trying to turn it into a shout match.   This whole thing could have been avoided if Kacey would have had a 1 on 1 discussion with Sky. I felt like Kacey sat back and had Destiny argue for her."
Destiny,2znxv3,FLABREZU,4,Fri Mar 20 07:00:48 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Kaceytron, I don't think that she made great arguments a lot of the time either. Destiny made better arguments, but did the classic Destiny ""I'm going to talk fast and yell and interrupt you all the time,"" which definitely didn't help."

Destiny,2znxv3,Kibethy,3,Fri Mar 20 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"I think of it like this: League of Legends is trying to be a sport, like football.  This is a thing that exists for a reason:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkKjATCu4E  If female streamers want to put a camera in their tits, they're making it about their tits and not about the game. If female athletes want to take off their clothes and bounce their titties down a football field, everyone involved already knows that no one is there to watch a football game. Anyone who argues against that is trying too hard to do...something, or prove something to themselves.  That being said, I don't think that's throwing their gender under the bus. They should, and obviously are, allowed to do whatever they want, and monetize whatever they want. If they want to monetize their gameplay or humor, no one has anything negative to say. If they want to monetize their body, suddenly every man on the planet has an opinion they need to share. And that statement really reveals the problem: women doing what they want with their own bodies in no way discredits any other woman...but plenty of men will think that it does. ""Don't stream provocatively, because then some men will treat other women poorly,"" is not a real solution to anyone's problem. How about, ""Don't treat women poorly, no matter what they do with their body""?  Sky just needs to accept that not all streams are supposed to be appealing to all people. Some guys like tits. Some gals have awesome tits. Some gals know they have awesome tits, and have a bit of business sense behind their rack."
Destiny,2znxv3,notoriousmule,16,Fri Mar 20 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"""being black and gay is not hard""  Sky seems really far removed from reality."
Destiny,2znxv3,Zixxa,11,Fri Mar 20 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"Which reality?   Depending on where you live and where you spend your time, it may or may not be hard. Sky can only speak from his own personal experience and what he has read about."
Destiny,2znxv3,SkeptioningQuestic,-1,Fri Mar 20 16:05:31 2015 UTC,Sky can only speak from his own personal experience and what he has read about.   Which is exactly why it's so stupid for him to make such a sweeping statement. Do you really think he has a good enough insight into the minds of other gay people and other black people to allow him to qualify that statement? Can't you see why it's a bad idea to cite nothing but you're own personal experience when speaking for millions upon millions of individuals?

Destiny,2znxv3,TheRickyB,4,Sat Mar 21 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"About girls and professional game playing, there is a great quote from some paper quoted in an article about best ever lady chess player Judit Polgár, who's parents brought her up to prove that anyone can be a genius which I think is applicable to professional game players.   the extreme values in a large sample are likely to be greater than those in a small one. Although the performance of the 100 best German male chess players is better than that of the 100 best German women, we show that 96 per cent of the observed difference would be expected given the much greater number of men who play chess.   i.e. it might be because of the relatively small sample size of women who play chess (and LoL etc). But why girls don't play LoL as much as guys is a different question I guess. There's also an interesting bit about girl only competitions   Polgár blames [the gap on] a worldwide reluctance to let girls compete against boys. “The problem is in chess that all the girls should be not competing between themselves—they should always compete in a higher level so they can improve faster,” she said."

Destiny,2znxv3,Zixxa,4,Fri Mar 20 04:33:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't listen to the whole thing, but it seemed like the entirety of the argument could be summed up as: ""Streams should be judged based on objective markers of quality and effort by the broadcaster.""  The one side being upset that this doesn't actually happen a lot of the time. The other side taking more of a free market approach.  Honestly, I got into an argument with Kacey over her stream's quality quite a long time ago on Reddit. Since then most of my concerns from the past have been resolved. I still don't personally like her persona, and honestly Steven himself has said that when you put on a fake persona too many people take it seriously (When talking about weeaboos and waifus). But I still respect Kacey as a streamer presently. The same thing with Trick2G. He puts a lot of work and effort into making his stream high quality, and I respect him for that, even though I don't personally like it.  The problem is when shitty low-effort streams suck up views. The viewbot incident should prove that you need to snowball views as a small Twitch streamer. The #1 thing that will bring in more viewers as a new streamer is having viewers already. Which becomes this massive problem where a bunch of good streamers fall through the cracks, get frustrated, and give up.  Like it or not, viewers are a limited resource. Most people can't have more than one stream open at a time, nor do most people want to. You could make the argument that the morons there only for tits aren't viewers you would want, though, sure.  Honestly, I think the lion's share of this issue falls on Twitch. They've done nothing but remove exploration tools and hurt small-time streamers."
Destiny,2znxv3,readitmeow,2,Fri Mar 20 09:57:49 2015 UTC,"""Streams should be judged based on objective markers of quality and effort by the broadcaster.""""  No. Both ""quality"" and ""efforts"" are highly subjective markers.   The whole debacle is summarized in the end where Sky asks TotalBiscuit to explain the error of his ways.   Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St-FyJodHvQ at 35:30 and onwards.  At the end Sky realizes, due to TotalBiscuit's explanation, that among the people who liked Sky's video, there are people who think that it is shitty that girls show cleavage and that it is shitty that girls get advantage in such ways. Two standpoints that Sky never agreed with."
Destiny,2znxv3,elevenoutoften,2,Fri Mar 20 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"There are objective points of value that can determine the quality of a stream. This will not determine whether people enjoy it or not, it's more just a baseline.   How much effort does the streamer put into their stream? (Is their info section informative and aesthetically pleasing?) Is viewer interaction important to them? Are they reading and responding to chat? Are they educational or entertaining? Does the stream look presentable? (Webcam window somewhere as not to impede gameplay, any type of text not drawing too much attention, are overlays professional looking and positioned correctly?)   These are not gender specific points of value. There are shit-tier male streamers that put no effort in, too.  The whole argument was a mess, and the end seemed more like Sky just building a really poor argument and TB just running over it. Instead of Sky properly defending his points, he let it collapse and just agreed with TB. Honestly, I don't much like Sky outside of his youtube content, but I think he had a couple of fair points here - he just articulated them really badly.  TB, Destiny, and Kacey to me seemed to take the side of ""If it works, it works"" outside of extreme abuse cases like leading people on for monetary gain.  What Sky failed to expand upon is that respecting a stream, enjoying a stream, and being civil in a stream are all completely separate from one another. I can respect a stream without enjoying it. I can not respect a stream yet still enjoy it. And I can remain civil in a stream regardless of whether I respect it or not.  I respect Trick2g's stream without enjoying it. It's obvious that he puts a lot of work into his stream. I enjoy Doublelift's stream, but he doesn't really put any effort into it (Not that I blame him, he's not a fulltime streamer). Sodapoppin is a stream I neither respect nor enjoy.  But if we compare it to another entertainment medium - say TV. Is House of Cards worthy of more respect than Survivor season whatever it's on? This doesn't mean you can't enjoy reality TV, but can you honestly say it's better than other TV shows just based on the amount of viewers it gets? The harsh truth is that quality is not dependent on how much attention it receives.  Sky's main faults were he argued his points horribly, his video only covered one side of the argument without any mentions of opposing viewpoints, and it wasn't a civil discussion. This is a delicate issue, being hamfisted about arguing one way or the other, especially with this much attention, just leads to nasty people latching onto your argument and using it to justify their shitty behavior."

Problem with this criteria: different people require different amounts of effort to achieve same result.

If you watch a stream, you are being entertained by that stream per definition unless you are literally crazy or you are new and are just trying out a stream.   A stream may be both entertaining and educational, but I have a hard time finding examples of streams that are educational but not entertaining.

Destiny,2znxv3,billyquick,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"Problem with this criteria: different people require different amounts of effort to achieve same result. It can take a person 30 minutes to create a certain page, while for another person it can take 10 hours to create the exact same page.   Time spent doing something is not my issue. Some people have a talent for certain aspects and it'll take them less time to complete due to that, some don't. Hell, for this category you can even pay people to do stuff to make your stream look professional and that's fine. But whether it's time, money, or skills you've acquired if your stream looks sloppy, lazy, or directionless then that's a fault on the broadcaster.   You consider this to be something that increases quality. For other people, they may not care at all about it. In fact, people may even think that it reduces their enjoyment of the stream because that takes time away from the streamer doing other things that they actually enjoy watching.   There does come a point where viewer interaction has to suffer when you start getting to sheer numbers of people chatting. But besides that I see no downside to viewer interaction. Almost any broadcaster worth their salt can learn to multitask playing what they're playing and interacting every so often.  If they don't interact with their viewers in any way, shape, or form, it mineswell be a youtube video. There'd be almost no difference.   A stream may be both entertaining and educational, but I have a hard time finding examples of streams that are educational but not entertaining.   I find Nightblue's stream educational, but not entertaining. I find Geranimo's stream educational, but not entertaining. You can have one without the other, as well as both at the same time.   How entertaining something is and how one values the entertainment and educational aspect is entirely a matter of opinion.   I meant this more in a broad aspect. Does their stream have substance? I know of streams that have entertainment value without me, personally, finding them entertaining. If they're just sitting there doing absolutely fucking nothing, or have the most boring personality on the plant, then they're probably a shit broadcaster.   This is the only point where I can imagine that one can objectively measure a form of relevant quality attached to the stream: namely how ergonomic something is (can measure strain on eyes and back, etc).   And honestly, this is an enormous point. Streaming is mainly visual content. What it looks like matters a whole lot, whether people admit it or not. Having a professional looking stream with a little custom flair ironed into it is to be commended. On the opposite side of the spectrum, those that have lazy and/or messy setups or setups that impede relevant game information should be condemned.  There are male streamers that fail to make a passing grade on any of this. The main difference between males and females in this regard is that more females get away with it and acquire viewers despite it.  Then comes the questions: ""Why should I care? How does this affect me? How does this affect potential broadcasters?""  It's extremely hard for new broadcasters to acquire a steady viewership. I've seen many fantastic broadcasters fall through the cracks and give up out of frustration simply because the time investment isn't worth it. It seems like luck, connections with big streamers that can share viewers, or having an advantage such as physical attributes become the only reliable paths to success.  Viewers are a resource, and Twitch is extremely top-heavy and snowbally when it comes to where they congregate. To a degree this is always going to be that way, no matter what. To another degree some of this falls on Twitch for having really shitty discovery tools for viewers to find low view-count streamers they might enjoy. This aspect of Twitch has gotten worse over the years, not better, and it wasn't perfect to begin with.  Features like randoms being able to be frontpaged, being able to click the last page of streamers on a game and work your way backwards to see all the low-viewer streams is gone, a lot of customization has been replaced with tiles and markdown, and others have been removed/replaced.  This leads to only two ways a viewer can decide to watch a low-view stream - the title and the snapshot of their stream. And so huge webcams taking up 75% of the screen with a woman are going to attract more people, and so the snowball starts.  TL;DR - So to let me sum all of this up... I never advocate being shitty to other people if they aren't actively harming you with malicious intent. That isn't the case here, and so I offer no justification for the shitty actions of people that go into streamer's chats and are nasty to them for whatever reason. That being said, there are some abuse cases with streamers that I'd consider exploitative, as mentioned in the original discussion with Sky, and I'd consider those cases unethical. Those that merely exploit the system to acquire views without any real effort put forth I don't find unethical, I merely don't respect them as broadcasters. It's on Twitch to help out small streamers (As it will eventually be where their future lies when the old-guard retires), figure out a line where a stream is deemed unethical and worthy of removal, and a way for broadcasters that really care to compete with the lazy saps who still get a ton of viewers.  Edit: Also, I've upvoted your comments. Someone put you at 0 for whatever reason. Your argument is relevant and civil."

Additionally, there was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism.   Basically (it's a small sample so could be sketchy but), conservatives who colbert is satirizing think that he agrees with them and your existing political views might influence what you see as satire  Also, I never knew destiny used the word dog as much as he does until today."

He even made the effort to rephrase it, to tone it down, to try and reach him through different routes... Only to be cast aside when TB explained it using similar words and phrases. I'd be pretty frustrated, too.   But I think at the end of the day, Destiny knew that he had to use TB's point of reference to try and convince Sky to see reason. And despite frustration, the entire point of the discussion at hand was to get him to see reason...   So even if Destiny wasn't labeled as the hero of the day, he actually was kinda like Batman. I'd say it was a success."

Destiny,2zobko,WestminsterNinja,12,Sat Mar 21 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"He pretty much fucked some of the community. Before he became about opening cases, and doing whatever the fuck he does nowadays he was a genuine streamer. I did pretty much all the modding, and highlights on my own for a couple of months. Was also the one who made his donation and subscriber sounds. Remember the walrus sounds? That was me.   One of my issues with him is that he forgot about the community that made him who he was. A lot of the veterans of the chat left, you can still find some of them. But many of them just disappeared. One of the reasons is because they got tired of waiting. For years now PL has said his new website was underway. Eventually he stopped doing a lot of sub days saying that he would do them when his new website was up and running. This was way before Donger dash, and whatever else he does now. The sub days were fun, and he would pile us all up in vent and talk to us and play games. It was genuine, and it was fun.   Like I said before though eventually he stopped doing that because he said he was gonna wait for his new website to come back up. We went months without another sub game and just constantly being told to wait. Eventually he did some random one, but it wasn't even a sub day it was just some game. It's hard to find a streamer that was as dedicated as he used to be, despite him yelling and being loud all the time, and overreacting sometimes. He was a streamer you could have fun with and learn with at the same time. That shifted into the PL that we have today.  My main beef with him though is the way he treats his mods. He has very strict rules, if he's losing a game or just having a bad game, chat should always be in submode. No if, ands, or buts. This is understandable, if you're losing, or tilted, the last thing you wanna see is some random guy in twitch chat with broken english saying ""u suk very dik"". However the issue is, sometimes it's not like that. You can see him playing not up to par, and chat will say a couple bad things, so you slap it on submode, only to hear him yell ""Who the fuck put it on submode!?"". He also had no actual stream schedule which was a bitch for all his mods, I was constantly breaking my sleep schedule staying up for more than 24 hours for something that I didn't even get paid for until the end. (Not like it matters, I only joined to help streamers since I myself can't stream, I was never looking for monetary compensation.) He was also constantly threatening the mods in mod chat. He would stream at random hours when EU was just waking up and NA was dead asleep. So he would have no mods, and he'd be saying shit like ""Mods hello? Where the fuck are you guys. Do I need to get new mods and replace you guys?"" He would constantly come into the skype chat and say shit like that. So much that he made one of the younger mods snap and just leave. He has since came back, but I remember him coming into skype and just chewing all of us out like it's our fault that he has no schedule. The poor kid was mad and I could see why he told PL ""We all bend over backwards for you nothing, we use our spare time for you and we don't even get a thanks."" With all that being said, he's just changed and I can't watch him anymore, I no longer see the genuine streamer I used to see. Also while I was doing all this work for him he didn't even know it, he found it because one day he pulled me and some other mods to the side and asked us to do highlights, I had to explain to him that I had been doing them for the last couple months and that his brother Nick has been hooking me up with some money for my work. (Nick is a really good dude btw.)   Some proof for you guys.   *Me having access to his dashboard to do highlights and semi-control the stream: http://puu.sh/gJ6cg/10a30a418b.png  *Hosting one-for-alls when you had to mod your client for him(my old league name was ArchemediusII): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=achgDJv06SA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlu_12hkTW8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXe9XXVH-mA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pld9Y8YuEW8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zODvmosN0 (90% certain I made all of these, one of them might have been edited by his brother.)

Destiny,2zobe3,Xentera,2,Fri Mar 20 13:35:04 2015 UTC,TIL: repeatedly saying fuck validates stupid points.
Destiny,2zobe3,Senior_CXC,3,Sun Mar 22 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"i feel like you fucking use fucking a fucking lot  anyways, you have a point in saying that not everyone will get the 'gist' of how destiny argues, yet he completely dismissed everything he said, basically. it was frustrating to watch."
Destiny,2zobe3,cucufag,1 point,Fri Mar 20 09:46:21 2015 UTC,"Fuck you, motherfucker. Just kidding. Yeah, Sky was ridiculous to listen to. Sky had an attitude with pretty much everyone who wasn't agreeing with him."
Destiny,2zobe3,Senior_CXC,3,Fri Mar 20 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"I don't usually support Destiny's argument because I think he is ""funny.""   That characterization is just an attempt to demean someone you don't agree with/ understand.   I usually support Destiny's arguments because his arguments are sound. Further, he knows how to defend that argument.   What I feel you are misunderstanding is why I would not support someone with those same qualifications that is more level-headed.   The answer is simple: Destiny's response to stupidity is similar to my own. When someone makes a REALLY bad argument and he gets upset, or he evokes the tone of incredulity while launching into a tirade, is a reasonable response to me when you're met with such stupidity.   Watching someone who is not gonna disagree with someone else, or if they do disagree, will act like ""Oh it's just a difference of opinion"" when in reality one is not logically sound... is annoying, and comprises 90% of what arguments are today.   In addition, his complete disregard for social convention when met with stupidity IS FUNNY. Which is what I think you unfairly focused on, but is definitely a factor."
Destiny,2zobe3,Kantyash,2,Fri Mar 20 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"Destiny isn't new to this. He knows that it isn't always what you say, but how you say it.   However, Destiny is going to continue to debate in this style despite the negatives because that's just who he is. It's like telling a cigarette smoker not to smoke because it's killing their body. They're aware of that fact but they just don't give a fuck."
Destiny,2zobe3,Cerealboss,9,Fri Mar 20 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't who he is at all. He's been through shitloads of rational, calm debates. Remember the XJ9 series? How calm and patient he was with the guy? Remember the ECH guy? Any normal person would've hung up the call or yelled at him about how autistic he was half way through, but Destiny was really fucking patient with him. How about the arguments with Irishladdie? Or any feminist for that matter? Remember in the really early days, all the skype calls with people who'd threaten to report him or disagree with one of his views? Remember the skype call with that one dudes mom? Holy shit, Destiny can be one of the most patient and rational people I've ever seen in a debate.  I think that saying that's just who he is really isn't a reasonable explanation, especially when there's so many others that could work. Maybe he's just stressed out about something in his personal life and can't take the frustration? Maybe he's just trying to be entertaining? Both would be viable considering he acts this way on stream when arguing with chat."
Destiny,2zsovw,Mardoo,7,Sat Mar 21 11:11:29 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you mean, ""fuck you Sky?""  Destiny/Kaceytron said the boobstreams were fine."
Destiny,2zsovw,SeriouslySlick,-10,Sat Mar 21 12:24:48 2015 UTC,"without destiny, this wouldn't have gotten viral brah"
Destiny,2zsovw,SittingAnteater,10,Sat Mar 21 12:37:32 2015 UTC,"You're giving Destiny an awful lot of credit there. The Dropped Frames podcast had more than 20k viewers at some point, it was the most watched channel on twitch at the time. Destiny might have brought a little more exposure, but to say he was the reason it blew up is blowing his horn a little too hard."
Destiny,2zsovw,MMACheerpuppy,0,Sat Mar 21 13:14:52 2015 UTC,but to say he was the reason it blew up is blowing his horn a little too hard.

Destiny,2zsovw,SeriouslySlick,2,Mon Mar 23 02:50:01 2015 UTC,Sky was already getting a lot of attention for his video.

Destiny,2zpc46,Knadra,7,Fri Mar 20 14:41:40 2015 UTC,You can only use the laptop that Destiny uses? Lol  Ummm it may be in his blog somewhere on Destiny.gg
Destiny,2zpc46,i_love_Cheekzz,-4,Fri Mar 20 15:40:31 2015 UTC,As opposed to one that he doesn't use? Are you joking?
