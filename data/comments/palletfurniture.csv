palletfurniture,3a4zm8,Cajuncowboy08,3,Wed Jun 17 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"its the amount of forced needed to HOLD such a small item and extract it from a tight place. think of the amount of force you exert on it with a pry bar. That area of the pry bar is say 3 square inches and you are exerting 300#'s of force. That's 100 PSI. The pry bar has maybe an 1/8th square inch exerting that 100 PSI to the nail, but since the area is smaller the force is 8 TIMES that. so you are exerting 800 PSI to that nail to remove it from its hold.   this is all theoretical numbers but it serves its purpose"

palletfurniture,3a4zm8,kvdveer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:35:18 2015 UTC,Use a reciprocating saw and a nail set.  Cut the nails and then tap em out.  If you are able to separate the pieces a bit first you can use a cats paw to pull the rest of the nail with out the head.

So much more wood is saved, and it takes less time overall."

palletfurniture,39cgyw,louspinuso,3,Sun Jun 21 21:49:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you could go this method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpcur7RTDVU which you can build yourself (and he sells plans if you want his specs for pretty cheap).  I haven't made one of these yet, though I plan to in the future, so what I do is take my 6 inch battery powered circular saw and cut the boards just next to where the nailed in at the far right and left.  I then pry them off the center piece of wood, which becomes surprisingly easy, mostly whole.   I do lose about an inch on each end of the boards, but that's so worth it compared to the amount of time I save and the number of boards I don't lose to breakage.  The hardest thing I've found about working with pallet wood is getting them to lie flat when I'm gluing them up to make a large board to make larger pieces."
palletfurniture,39cgyw,Falcon_Rogue,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:55:06 2015 UTC,getting them to lie flat   You gotta get that $10 plane from Harbor Freight and get to work planning them somewhat square. I do this and end up with a little wavy but functional larger boards. The reason is you don't want to use your expensive plane and hit rocks or a missed mail and trash your blade.

Some googling will help u there.  If they are good pallets, easiest way for me way to take them apart for me was to sawzall between the plank and the 2x4.  It'll eat those nails alive and save you a lot of time.  Most of the time u can leave the nail heads or you can choose to take them out.  You need to clean the pallets before they go anywhere near the bed.  I recommend using an outside friendly bleach.  Bleach both sides, then power wash.  After they dry you need to sand them to knock down the splinters.  Use 80-100 grit.  Then you can paint or seal them, both sides.   To answer your question.  Get a nail gun, put some wood glue on the back of the planks and nail them up.  If you don't have an air compressor, ryobi makes a battery powered one.  I own it, it works great for the this application cause I built my headboard using this same application.   I know it's a lot of work but you gotta be safe when using pallet wood.  You never know where it's been and what's been sitting on it for days, out in the hot sun or getting poured on by rain.  This project is gonna take some time to finish, so be patient.  There are a lot of steps involved.  Gotta be safe.  Good luck.   Hope this helps!!"

She mostly sells by word of mouth or on our local ""classifieds"" on Facebook. Stuff like what you have would sell there but prices people want to pay are lower than you would like. Locally the shelves in pic 1 & 2 would bring $20-$30, Pics 3,4 & 5 $15-$20, Pic 6 $25ish, Pic 7 $30+. My wife has found a niche market she is busier than she wants to be most of the time. In the window panes she would put chalk board in place of glass. Those sell really quickly.  She has found that she has flooded the market with a few things. She then moves on to a new ""Pinterest"" project and sees how that sells. The painted signs and chalkboard picture frames has been her biggest sellers.   Yard Sellers are a ""Cheap"" demographic. They want everything for pennies on the dollar. I wouldn't get discouraged over them not selling there. Try to find a local classifieds on Facebook. They can be a headache to deal with the meetings and people standing you up. But, for the most part she has good success. Or, a local shop that sells similar home decorating stuff.

I personally am also very wary, I would never buy pallet furniture unless I knew the person selling it and knew they understood which pallets were safe.

My father (a logger, mill worker, and carpenter) made similar items and sold almost nothing.  Aside from my cruel critique, the market is now saturated with upcycled/recycled/diy type pieces.  There is a home for these items, but selling furnishings is really hard to do.  Think of all those furniture stores that have ""going out of business"" and ""one week only(everyweek)"" events.  That and you are competing with Ikea prices too.  It's unfortunate that the labor and creative effort is not rewarded, but it's a really tough market to get into and succeed at."

The detail on the legs are not necessary and distracts from the overall simplicity and elegant nature of the table top. A single tapered leg would look absolutely stunning IMHO.   Great work though, i really I love the top. Are you planning on staining or finishing it in anyways.   I'm just a design snob so I tend to fixate on the little things....damn you design school."

palletfurniture,340dmx,inurshadow,2,Mon Apr 27 13:49:51 2015 UTC,I copied it from a vintage beer crate. I was struck by the original's clever design. Even if you put more crates like this next to each other you can still grab one of the crates individually due to the sunk in handles.

palletfurniture,340u06,yeaitsgroog,3,Mon Apr 27 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Just run the blade in between the plank and the 2x4 cutting the nail.  This will leave the nail head in place as Chaz has mentioned.  I feel that the saw method is faster, and taking the time to pop out the nails with a nail punch can be tedious, but worth it.  I learned that prying the boards left a lot of them vulnerable to splitting."
palletfurniture,340u06,Meganormous,2,Mon Apr 27 17:58:24 2015 UTC,I've done both depending on how long I need the planks.
palletfurniture,340u06,chaz345,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are doing with them. Rustic stuff where you can leave the nail heads in is no problem. But if you are going to be any smoothing of the planks, then you still need to pop the heads out with a punch. That and cutting the nails off means the rails are largely unuseable because the nail shafts are still in them."

palletfurniture,33e6ql,HairyCarey,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"As a rabbit owner, if you're looking to build a hutch, good on you - just don't use pallet wood. As mentioned, it's is often treated with toxic substances. It also seems to me that you'll just be making it more difficult for yourself if you use pallet wood, you may as well get some good, safe wood that is easier to use for building; not warped, knotted, or splintery wood which may be the case with pallets (not saying that all pallet wood is like that, just, y'know).  You should probably keep in mind that making it out of pallet wood would lead to the hutch being much, much heavier than is ideal; being able to move the hutch around the yard is good, either so the bun can eat grass (if it's a hutch that will sit on the ground), or just have some sun/protection from rain.   I'm fairly certain that there are free hutch plans around on the net, if not I can PM you some photos of the hutch my father built for my rabbits. Building a hutch is a great plan because as you mentioned, store hutches are not the greatest. But for your bunny, and your own sanity, I'd steer clear of pallet wood for this project."

palletfurniture,32kh00,AAonthebutton,2,Wed Apr 15 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"Simple, a little rough, I love it. Good job. How many coats did you do? I like the colour."
palletfurniture,32kh00,beefox,2,Tue Apr 14 23:41:39 2015 UTC,3 coats of stain. It was a learning process. Since the pallet boards are not 100% flat some places ended up darker than others.
palletfurniture,32kh00,beefox,2,Wed Apr 15 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell the quality from this pictures, but the finish is really nice. Really good for your first project."
palletfurniture,32fhjf,ladygashworth,2,Mon Apr 13 11:10:27 2015 UTC,Put something to hold it against the wall. Will suck if it gets knocked over.
palletfurniture,32fhjf,Nirple,3,Tue Apr 14 07:52:30 2015 UTC,I hope those nasty splinters heal fast from leaning that pallet against the wall!
palletfurniture,32fhjf,man_made_centaur,2,Mon Apr 13 18:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah the sanding, drilling and staining were fine, it was the leaning that was really treacherous."
palletfurniture,32fhjf,shadeobrady,1 point,Tue Apr 14 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"Could be misinformed on this, but I've read in a few places to watch out for using plants with pallets that may have been sprayed with specific chemicals (I'm sure you'll know if they die quickly).  I'm unsure if sanding does the trick or if you need to reseal the wood after. Maybe someone more knowledgable could comment on this..."
palletfurniture,32fhjf,shadeobrady,2,Mon Apr 13 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"The basil is already looking a bit peaky... To be honest I didn't even consider chemical leaching (and as a chemist, shame on me) but u/iwasinthepool mentioned that the pallet was luckily marked as heat treated."
palletfurniture,32fhjf,Kazooguru,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:31:30 2015 UTC,Good to know! I remembered that tidbit since I plan to do it in the future. Heat treated wood won't leach the chemicals?
palletfurniture,32fhjf,shadeobrady,2,Mon Apr 13 22:28:27 2015 UTC,"They treat the pallets with heat, instead of chemicals. I think it is for pest control? Not sure."
palletfurniture,32fhjf,iwasinthepool,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:14:21 2015 UTC,The wood is treated with heat instead of chemicals so if there's a HT stamp then you're good to go. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-determine-if-a-wood-pallet-is-safe-for-use/
palletfurniture,32i017,yonderheif,2,Mon Apr 13 23:17:58 2015 UTC,Happen to have a tutorial on this?
palletfurniture,32i017,-Bingo-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"Not an official one; however there are three important aspects to this design. 1. Make sure there are enough slats on the back to keep books from falling out the back (I didn't have to do this on this pallet but on other types you might have to). 2. Add a second 2x4 to each of the three boards on the bottom of the pallet to add depth equal to the length of the books you'll be putting on it (same length as the three bottom boards as seen in the picture). 3. I used scrap pieces of plywood to mount the holders for the shelving, so that the shelving is removable. Hope this helps."

palletfurniture,326mkc,CagedChimp,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:35:42 2015 UTC,Here you go
palletfurniture,326mkc,YoSeanAngelo,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:37:45 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Thanks!
palletfurniture,31w2rb,inurshadow,2,Wed Apr 8 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Good job. I love reusing and repurposing old wood from pallets and shipping crates. How's the stability? I would maybe add some corner bracing made out of triangular shaped pieces of wood to keep it from racking. Either that, or most of my benches are attached to the wall behind them if I don't put them on casters. I tend to be pretty hard on them, so they have to be built strong."
palletfurniture,31w2rb,bananapeel,2,Wed Apr 8 23:34:42 2015 UTC,The shelf supports on the bottom are attacked to the legs. It's really stable. I also stole the drill hanger from my pegboard and drilled some holes for it. It's nice to not reach over my table saw for my most reached for tool.
palletfurniture,31w2rb,bananapeel,2,Thu Apr 9 03:33:08 2015 UTC,Ergonomics are an often-overlooked area in the home shop. Good thinking.
