I went up a few weeks ago and after living in the south and mid-Atlantic the last 18 years, the summer seems fantastic, but maybe I was just there on a good day.  Ot rained one day and that was pretty rough humidity though, I admit.  How crowded does it get in the fall?

You can almost tell where the town borders are on the roads due to different road crews taking care of each side of line.  That said, the State plows pretty obsessively.  But...they aren't miracle workers, either.  This summer has been really rainy and therefore nice and cool in the mornings.  There's only been a few real humid days thus far.

I've seen 2001-2005 foresters for sale in TN with 120-150K miles and the only issue with them is the mileage and they are $3500-4K out the door...up here they start to rot right around 100-120K miles and they are the same price if not more.  Whatever vehicle you bring consider getting it grease undercoated before Halloween.  Also snow tires - you WILL need them.  don't try and get by with AWD or 4WD on summers.  Studs are optional, but you need dedicated winters.  Get some winter rims too for $25 each at the jumk yard and it makes the transition from summer to winter tires and back all the more easy."

Vermont does not have a bare roads policy during winter as other states do.  You are expected to know how to drive with a few inches of snow cover on the road.  The bright side is that it fills in the potholes.  So we've got that going for us..

If you are working at the mountain do not get discouraged by the access road. It is ALWAYS clearer than main street. It's a priority area, you will never not be able to make it up it. You don't need 4wd unless you live off a dirt road or steep hill, some nice snow tires will do just fine...and it's not a terrible idea to keep a small shovel in the trunk. And you will want to get an ice scraper/brush that extends BEFORE it snows...so end of October early November. Other things you will need BEFORE it snows: Snow pants, boots (Sorels are affordable and durable), waterproof gloves and a shovel.  VT is a four season state, there will always be out-of-towners on the weekends and holidays. The grocery store, Shaws, is VERY small and a little more expensive then the ones in Rutland. Avoid this place at all costs during the winter holidays.   Everything closes early.

vermont,3ddb28,phordant,11,Wed Jul 15 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"because his debt has been paid - he did his time.  I'm not defending him in any way, shape or form...but would you want to live in a country where you could be held in prison indefinitely ""just because""?    The problem here is the judge who presided over his case not making his successful completion of a treatment program mandatory as a condition of his release.  That would give cause for him to be held and not be a danger to the public.  Hell he probably got a plea bargain...happens all the time.  Our justice system at it's roots is flawed."
vermont,3ddb28,06EXTN,3,Wed Jul 15 13:47:24 2015 UTC,"You're right, I would not want a system that doles out arbitrarily open-ended prison sentences. That is a salient point.  I also agree that his treatment should have been mandatory. Other countries will parole ""high risk"" offenders and promptly commit them to psychiatric hospitals, not with the goal of punishment, but treatment.  I realize that public mental health programmes in the US died in the 80s, and it's sadly ironic that today such a huge number of prisoners landed behind bars as a result of their untreated illnesses."
vermont,3ddb28,phordant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"is sexual preference toward underage males/females considered a ""mental illness"" or simply a ""societal no no""?  I would think that if classified as a mental illness confidential and helpful treatment would be possible, even for those who have not been incarcerated for such a thing.  Perhaps we have such a rampant problem with this because people are afraid to come forward for treatment?  Media's help in lambasting these folks doesn't help either...makes innocent until proven guilty the other way around.    any way you slice it, this issue isn't going away...so shouldn't we find a way to stop it as early as possible?  prevention rather than treatment always seems less expensive and has a better payoff to me, whether you're talking about sexual predators or getting fat."
vermont,3ddb28,06EXTN,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"While I am not a psychiatrist (IANAP) I would think it crosses over into illness when someone has a desire (sexual or not) that they know is illegal, harms others, and poses a huge risk to their own safety and freedom and can not stop themselves from acting on it. There are certainly people out there who feel attracted to prepubescent children, recognize the risks, and steer themselves away from ever being in a situation where they had an opportunity to act.  I do think the stigma and reflexive revulsion most people feel when they hear about a pedophile is keeping many of them under the radar. I have heard mental health professionals state that there is no ""cure"" for them, any more than there's a ""cure"" for homosexuality. And to be sure, simply being accused of anything sexual involving children can end careers and marriages."

However, a new EPA rule will force all states outside of the RGGI to reduce electricity sector emissions.    From the article:  ""The EPA’s Clean Power Plan, expected to be released next month, will require states to reduce the amount of carbon emitted from the electricity sector. Electricity accounts for a third of all carbon emissions in the United States, largely due to the use of coal-fired power plants. Developing multi-state or even individual systems to price carbon is one way states will be able to comply with the EPA standards.""    So, everyone else in America will have to start paying more for their electricity.  As we all know, misery loves company.  Warm climates that use a lot of electricity for air-conditioning will soon find their overall utility costs in line with Vermont even with our harsh winters.

I exaggerated when I said it was double per KW hour, it is only a 65% increase.    The we are all paying a lot more for a lot less now is in reference into the article indicating that the shitty metric they used is that we have lost so many energy intensive businesses in New England that the total energy usage (and total price) is lower, not that anyone individually is paying less.   It is a cleverly written title mis-portraying the actual state of the cost of energy in the North East."

vermont,3d4njk,DanceWithGoats,3,Mon Jul 13 18:19:29 2015 UTC,App Gap of course.  I ride and drive that many times a year.  Always be aware that cyclists  do that climb often.
vermont,3d4njk,yoeddyVT,2,Mon Jul 13 14:59:29 2015 UTC,Lincoln Gap is another good one.
vermont,3d4njk,douchecookies,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:32 2015 UTC,I heard the other day the road's pretty beat up
vermont,3d4njk,bleahdeebleah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is beat up.  I have been up in my Miata and bicycle already this year.   Middlebury Gap is nearly new pavement and fun."
vermont,3d4njk,yoeddyVT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:30 2015 UTC,Ha!  I was thinking of taking my Miata when I heard it was beat up!
vermont,3d4njk,bleahdeebleah,3,Mon Jul 13 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"route 125 between 7 and 100, speaking of which, rte 100"
vermont,3d4njk,adamlcarp,2,Mon Jul 13 15:06:51 2015 UTC,Just did that today to get to boston!
vermont,3d4njk,bigowlbrewery,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:20 2015 UTC,The drive up Mt Equinox?
vermont,3d4njk,Xzillerationer,2,Mon Jul 13 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, I hadn't head of this. A quick search yielded this image, which is all I needed to see. I have a friend down around there, so I'll try to do this next time I go visit."
vermont,3d4njk,Xzillerationer,2,Mon Jul 13 14:32:22 2015 UTC,Also this from /r/motorcycles
vermont,3d4njk,chesbyiii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:43 2015 UTC,And this. Not sure if they still do it but it's awesome.
vermont,3d4njk,clzair,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"Route 7 is very pretty all the way down the state, especially past middlebury. Doing some covered bridges might be cool!!"
vermont,3d4njk,mailerdeemon,2,Mon Jul 13 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"A bit of a thread hijack, but I am driving from NYC to Jacksonville, VT later this month. Is there a preferred route that is scenic without being obscenely long and slow?"
vermont,3d4njk,sawyersutton,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"It's all relatively scenic in western Mass and Vermont and that neighboring part of NY, for that matter."
vermont,3d4njk,braidedbutthair,2,Tue Jul 14 10:41:07 2015 UTC,I love the stretch of 100 from Killington to Warren. If I didn't live outside Burlington I would drive it more often.
vermont,3d4njk,Timeflyer2011,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:48:13 2015 UTC,The ride over Mt. Abraham - especially in the fall.
vermont,3d4njk,walkalong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:46:04 2015 UTC,Lincoln Gap?
vermont,3d4njk,Timeflyer2011,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:44 2015 UTC,Stupendous views of Mt. Abraham:  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g28966-d126604-Reviews-Lincoln_Gap_Road-Vermont.html
vermont,3d4njk,MmmmapleSyrup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"For a little more ""off the beaten path"" kind of a drive, I would start up the CCC road from 100A in Plymouth and then cruise through Shrewsbury. Lots of nice dirt roads lined with stone walls and old growth maple/oak trees."

vermont,3d4njk,euthanizethepoors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:43:53 2015 UTC,How do you know it's not a Chevy Volt?
vermont,3d4njk,jamaica_70,2,Tue Jul 14 13:42:23 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered that potential.
vermont,3d4njk,nightslayer78,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:25:44 2015 UTC,It's not. I'll see how the Wifi is in hell and upload the drive if possible.
vermont,3d6beu,stanmox,2,Mon Jul 13 21:30:28 2015 UTC,Cruising in Montpelier isn't hard to do. Parking in Montpelier on the other hand...
