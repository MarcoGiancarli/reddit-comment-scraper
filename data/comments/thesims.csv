thesims,3e1uew,whiscious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:52 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! My brain bugged out and I thought it was a Sims 3 world for a second. Didn't know Sims 2 worlds could be so cute and fleshed out!

thesims,3e31y8,ARecycledAccount,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I figured it was just an unintentional bug.  Maybe I'm overstepping here, but do you know anything about why the male eye colors are not working correctly? Normally I'd just let the guru's do their thing, but this bug's odd because it seems like a simple code error, so I wonder if the Guru's are aware of it.  For the record, I'm talking about certain colors not ""sticking"" when you choose them in CAS. If you switch to another sim and back, the eye color sometimes changes to something else.  Probably nothing to do with you, but it might be worth checking to see if the rest of the team is aware."
thesims,3e31y8,Puggerfly,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:23 2015 UTC,I'll check on that to make sure people are aware.

thesims,3e2xi7,spud_simon_salem,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"The only time my game was ever slowed down while playing was when I downloaded a mod wrong, other than that if your cpu has low specs then it is likely you'll get spikes. I would say mods that affect townies can slow you down as well."
thesims,3e2xi7,Sraniale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, basically what I came here to say. The mods shouldn't noticeably affect the performance of the game (aside from however they were intended to). Also, OP, if you had those problems with TS2&3, it's probably the computer you're using and it will probably continue happening."
thesims,3e2xi7,AshleyVakarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the mods do, and how many you have.  But, it's barely noticeable.  I have probably 8 or 9 GB worth of mods and CC installed, and it only lags just a bit on loading times."
thesims,3e2xi7,dfn85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I have a bit over 5 gb and haven't had any issues, the game takes a bit longer to load at the start but that's it (and that probably also has to do with having GTW + GPs + SPs)"
thesims,3e2otd,Dr4kir,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't built up any romantic relationships in this game but I will say that what bothers me a lot about the Sims 4 is the lack of personalities the sims have. Yes, the emotion system is fantastic and without a doubt superior to the previous games, but personality wise, it's lacking. I feel like my sims in 2 and 3 had a lot more personality than the sims in 4. I create various types of Sims in 4 and they all seem the same, no matter what traits I pick for them. That's what takes the joy out of the game for me."
thesims,3e2otd,spud_simon_salem,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:49 2015 UTC,Thats weird. Whenever my sim gets home from work (scientist) her husband comes out to kiss her or hug her or one of her children comes to tell her a joke. Have you got their relationship up high? They seem to do more autonomously romantic actions the higher their relationship is.

thesims,3e2zo1,eaken,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, sometimes, I'm not very good at explaining myself or understanding miscommunication without a visualization, so I'm sorry if this feels like beating a dead horse, but I just want to make sure we're on the same page as far as what I'm saying and what you're saying.   Alright, when you go to the gallery, then under the ""My Library"" tab this is what it should look like and the Advanced setting is on the left side at the bottom of the list. Please, forgive the really badly-done MS Paint job with the arrows showing what I'm talking about. Then, you click on the button next to Advanced and it opens up  like so. Finally, you select to include custom content and it will load any rooms or houses with custom content or really anything labeled as ""Modded.""   If what you're saying is that you don't even have the Advanced button thing or the custom content option isn't there when you open it and scroll all the way down, then you may need to repair the game via Origin. Also, if she has any mods, maybe try taking them out and adding them back in one-by-one to find out if one of them is causing UI issues for you. After trying to repair the game, or seeing if a mod/custom content is breaking the game, the only thing I know to do would be a complete re-install."

thesims,3e26ov,Pinkturtledove,4,Tue Jul 21 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, people complained shortly after release how lady Sims would look really muscular when they exercise a lot.  One of the patches changed this, but I don't think it was on purpose.  Currently there seems to be some sort of glitch that if a Sim has maximum fitness but zero fatness, they don't look super muscular in live mode.  If they gain a little bit of fatness, they'll look really muscular, but it seems to come and go.  This is nice if you don't want your lady Sims to have the She Hulk look.  It's annoying, though, when you want your Sims to look muscular.  One of my main Sims is a former Mr. Solar System, and spends a lot of time trying to stay in shape; it's weird having him eat a few extra helpings of pie in order to achieve better muscle definition."
thesims,3e26ov,Bryaxis,2,Tue Jul 21 12:35:29 2015 UTC,Ive noticed this too. Very annoying having to go into full CAS all the time and manually change my sim so she looks like her usual non-hulk self.

I guess recolouring is where all cc creators start :D I don't play The Sims 4 anymore so I didn't download them (only to save hard drive space) but these look quite good and I like the designs! Soon you'll be creating meshes :D

thesims,3e1sp8,Socosims,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly easy.  You export the specific dds file with Sims4Studio, open it in your image editor of choice, paste whatever image/texture/color/etc on top of that original file in a new layer.  Save it as the same file, and then import it back into Sims4Studio.  It automatically shows up previewed on the little model.  Then just save as whatever you'd like to call it."
