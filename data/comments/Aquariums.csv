Aquariums,3e3fye,kattikawn,5,Tue Jul 21 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"I've neglected this thing for two years.  It got a brown spot on the bottom once after not turning it enough. I sometimes clean the snail poop off it, but mostly I just let it mooch rent free in a corner of my Spec V.  It started out the size of a golf ball.  It's now about the size of a baseball and not as nice and round as it once was.  Last night during a water change I moved it out of the way and found a stowaway behind it.  This is what happens when you don't love your moss ball enough."
Aquariums,3e3fye,funktopus,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:10 2015 UTC,I picked up two of those last thursday. They move at night. Not sure who is moving them but they are in different spots in the morning.   I'm thinking it's the plays as they are well kinda dicks.

So far a population of RCS has taken up residence in the filter, and they seem to like crawling into the pot scrubbers and pulling crap out of them.

Aquariums,3e341f,alcimedes,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:00 2015 UTC,Interesting idea about the RCS in there cleaning up to buildup! This may change my mind about using scrubbies instead of poret foam! Besides the fact that the foam would cost me 3x as much!

Places where they're pressed up against the glass I can see build up, but the rest of the pad is getting regularly scoured by shrimp, some endlers that found there way into the sump, and snails.  The pot scrubbers have been in the sump now since Dec. of 2014 and I haven't had to clean them yet."

Aquariums,3e341f,flabbyjabber,5,Tue Jul 21 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"Ceramic rings are much more porous than sponges. They have a much surface area to volume ratio, so they support more bacteria."

Aquariums,3e341f,JosVermeulen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:47 2015 UTC,Right. I understand i could use it. But am i going to benefit from it in any way?
Aquariums,3e341f,ShadowRancher,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. Biological filtration is done by bacteria. The bacteria will fill all the tiny tiny little holes in the ceramic. Thus allowing for more bacteria in your filter.  More bacteria=more biological filtration. And yes the bacteria will grow on ceramic rings/pot scrubbers/sponges in HOBs just as well as in canister filters.   I just read a good source on different types of filter media. The surface area of each kind of media was listed. BioBalls and ceramic rings blew everything out of the water. Pot scrubbers were a good, cheat option. I'll see if I can find the post.

As for aggression towards my bristlenose, I have seen none, but it has only been a few days. The driftwood was given to me by the LFS for free with the dempsey because they were happy I could take him from the conditions he was in.

Wouldn't worry about the charcoal, its not that useful unless you are actively trying to remove a chemical from your water (medication or something that was accidentally spilled) its pretty much unnecessary in a cycled aquarium. I think they put it in those inserts in an attempt to keep the fish alive until you get bac in the filter floss again after they tell you to change it out."
Aquariums,3e2qkl,bryanfuel0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"sounds good thanks...now about water changes.   How often and how much. I have been doing about 10% per week and for the heck of it got my water tested at Petsmart. Result was  Ammonia - nil, nitrite okay, nitrate a little high, alkaline low..they said it could be the result of too much water changes and should do once every two weeks or so. And I assume that it would also be affecting the good bacteria. When I do the water change it is mainly a gravel cleaning exercise"
Aquariums,3e2qkl,Encelados242,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:59 2015 UTC,Nitrite should also be 0 and most people say 25% every week. Couldn't they give you exact params? Low and high could mean anything.
Aquariums,3e2qkl,flabbyjabber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:46 2015 UTC,The good bacteria live in the rock and sand. You don't have to worry about getting rid of it with water changes
Aquariums,3e2qkl,flabbyjabber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:11 2015 UTC,even with vaccumming the gravel as part of the water change?

Aquariums,3e2axd,patonieto,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:55 2015 UTC,I reccomend you to raise the back of the substrate even more. That will create depth in your tank. Advice on plants depend if you are going to get co2 or how strong is that light.
Aquariums,3e2axd,ihebfehri,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:44 2015 UTC,Better :)? http://i.imgur.com/9m7vKTE.jpg
Aquariums,3e2axd,patonieto,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:11 2015 UTC,I think so yes.
Aquariums,3e2axd,TotesMessenger,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"Bear in miind that this is something I would do. You can do as you please. I would  go for a rise in the center back part of the tank, get a hanging filter (with a sponge obviously because of baby shrimps). Put a java narrow leaf in the center back, in the lower part of the java you could go with nubias nana or petite or some hydrocotyle (i think its the name) all of that in a very root like set of wood that stems from the java fern to the front. I would keep the front clean so you could see the shrimps. Those plants  are not very nutrient heavy consumer and the ferns needs to be dosed with fertilizers and trimmed constantly. Sorry for my sloppy english"

Aquariums,3e08bc,misterfall,3,Tue Jul 21 10:53:34 2015 UTC,I actually didn't buy this directly from the breeder. I got lucky and the only decent LFS (an hour away) happened to have this bad boy hanging out in the tank!

Aquariums,3e297p,Cowturtle,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, would you say they're worth the algae control to sacrifice a few plant leaves? I think they've already laid eggs so I might stick them in the pond outside to get rid of the bigger ones"

Aquariums,3dywql,Pkock,16,Mon Jul 20 18:35:38 2015 UTC,Why are you guys letting family members and cats put limbs in the tank in the first place?
Aquariums,3dywql,xJusteezy,51,Mon Jul 20 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"The family members have all been people who volunteered to feed him while I was away. When you take off the lid to feed him, He jumps for hands. If I tell people ""watch out he might jump out and bite you"" they don't believe me and they test him. Which is a poor plan because he is an elite fish athlete and can do anything.  If I don't tell them, well then he sneaks up on them, cause he is the devil.  The cats were just trying to fish around in the gap between the filter and the lid and caught more fish than they wanted."
