You JUST STOP going to those sites. You MOVE your attention, again, and again, ad nauseam, to something else that is less damaging. It does NOT have to be productive. Play videogames instead. Watch TV. You want to go to the gym and become HE MAN and travel around the world instead of watching porn, yeah sure, good luck with that. How about solving one problem at a time yes?

pornfree,3dzzvn,BodyKeepstheScore,7,Mon Jul 20 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you have to go through this, but maybe I can share some insight.  I've never gone as far as declining sex with my wife but I have the experience of said sex being ""bad"" and therefore resorting to masturbation shortly after. First note that it's probably not about you. Of course I can't say for sure, because I don't know your husband, but if his situation is anything like mine, it has nothing to do with whether he loves you or whether he wants to have sex with you. It's probably just that he cannot enjoy it very much at the moment and that it feels more like work or a chore for him.  He might have been using porn and masturbation for so long that not only his brain is basically trained to only fire through visual stimulation (like many videos over a short time) with extended periods of edging (as an addict you don't usually just watch one video and be done with it, you watch them by the dozen, zapping around like crazy), basically pumping insane amounts of dopamine through his synapses. Real sex isn't like that, and that's why it doesn't give him the same highs that porn does.  Second, excessive masturbation over a long time also leads to other problems like the dreaded ""death grip."" With your hand, you can grip as tight as you want and you can basically jerk as fast as you want, while during real sex, there are certain physical limitations that prevent you from doing that. When your penis is so used to the death grip, the ""loose fit"" of a real vagina might not work so well anymore, so it leads to either delayed ejaculation (ED) because the stimulation isn't strong enough, or even erectile dysfunction.  The only way to get rid of this seems to be to cut out the porn and basically relearn sex. Your husband should cut out masturbation as well, at least for a period of time, but since you guys are in a relationship, I'd even say cut it completely and focus on real sex together instead. It might not work at first, it sure didn't for me for a while, so I'd suggest your husband does a months or so of NoFap's so-called hard mode (which means no porn, no masturbation, no sex) to calm his brain circuits down. After that, you two should try and learn to enjoy yourselves together again. Don't expect any miracles, though. It takes time. Depending on how long your husband has been hooked on porn it might take months or even over a year to really heal.  The most important thing is, though, that he has to want to do this for himself. If he doesn't really want to quit or if he doesn't realize that he has a problem, I'm afraid that all your best efforts won't work. Maybe you can point him to this subreddit and show him Gary Wilson's TED talk on the topic to make him realize that something isn't right.  Wish you all the best!"
pornfree,3dzzvn,ObservingDuck,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"he knows about this subreddit, i gave him all the links to TED talks and yourbrainonporn. He is not interested. He was just able to quit. It was really hard he said but he doesnt need to read about it or talk about it with others. This is scary because it is the turning inward that is a slippery slope."
pornfree,3dzzvn,UnpluggedZombie,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear this is happening to you.   Too much porn and masturbation can sexual condition the brain to crave pornography over real sex.  I first realized I had a porn problem when my girlfriend would come over for sex and I struggled to get in the mood/have an erection, but the minute she would leave I would start looking at porn and getting erections wouldn't be a problem.  You have to understand that those of us that really struggled with porn have a long road ahead of us.  Its important to have a period of complete abstinence from porn and orgasm at the beginning of recovery and then to introduce what rebooters call rewiring with an actual partner.  During the rewiring part its important to be patient and go slow.  Too much sexual activity at the beginning might send him back into a flatline (a period of no libido).  And don't be surprised if he struggles with getting erections at the beginning.  His brain has to be sexually conditioned to real sex again.  I would recommend the website yourbrainonporn.com.  You can find a lot of info on the effects of pornography and what to expect when quitting it for good.  I hope this helps."

I understand it must be frustrating but he should be active on pornfree and nofap.  Its also important not replace porn with some else.  I lot of people think soft core pics or reading sexy stories aren't affecting them the same as hardcore videos do but it does.  The fastest way to get better is to completely stop looking at any super stimuli.  Even sexting can count as porn.
pornfree,3dzzvn,rainbowSober,3,Tue Jul 21 06:48:57 2015 UTC,"Porn addict gets used to the high stimulation of porn. Which is caused by the changing faces on naked bodies. There has been scientific studies on mice where mice would lose their interest in sex if it was just one partner, but when new partners were introduced, their brain would provide them with new dopamine high every time new partner was introduced, to a point they would have sex until they died.   It works the same way with people. Real sex can not compete, because the lizard brain does not see the difference between people on the screen and real life. So it is fooled in to thinking that the person watching porn is impregnating all the people on the screen.   So basically your husband wants that high. The normal sex is kind of meh to him. It is what happens when you are porn addict."
pornfree,3dzzvn,myPornFreeAccount,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate, not everyone is a porn addict.  Maybe he just has a lower sex drive than you? Masturbation is different to sex and male sexuality is different to female sexuality. If he feels on pressure to perform when you instigate then that can defo affect his enjoyment to the point where he doesn't want to do it. Masturbation doesn't have that pressure. If you were more accepting then maybe he would be more open to sex. Even so, if you didn't want to have sex one night and your husband got annoyed with you how would you feel?"
pornfree,3dzzvn,fenrir_01,2,Tue Jul 21 10:11:55 2015 UTC,"Has he been doing this a lot lately, or was this just a particular occasion?

pornfree,3e0zxu,porn_issues,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:06 2015 UTC,I do think it would it would be good for you to see a separate therapist about your own sexual issues and inability to talk about sex as that seems to be a large part of the problem.

pornfree,3e0zxu,AzraelofSeraphim,2,Tue Jul 21 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"The way i see it, the reason you started masturbating again is stress and you used it as a coping mechanism.

I had to really explain to my girlfriend of two and a half years that my addiction is just as biological as it is social, the dopamine receptors in your brain still crave that instant rush porn gives you. And that's unbelievably hard to kick, but the fact that you've not looked at it for 20 months and only masturbated is a genuinely positive thing. After having a pretty up and down ride with my significant other the only answer I can give you is to try and open up, explain that the masturbating was from stress and anxiety and not because you crave or are attracted to other women. The only way to resolve something with someone you truly love is to be as open and honest as possible, nothing else seems to work from my experience."

I think the important thing is to stay porn free and not go crazy with the sex. I also was on anti depressants and they also killed my sex drive. I also came off the anti depressants and am now not taking anything..   What I am now trying to do is to become less sexual. Once a week kind of a thing. Which is huge difference from my younger days when sexuality was really just a emotional crutch for me. I was constantly looking for the mini dopamine serotonin highs by lusting all the time..   Wife walks out the room, I checked out a couple pictures.. Etc..   She was traumatized too by my porn use and she says it was not about the porn use. It was about me being angry at her.. I was angry at her now looking back because I wanted my precious porn.   You can not fuck your way back to happiness. If anything I think it is important to let go of that whole way of behavior. I let go of the lusting, the fantasies, the porn. Other than my relapses. I usually always got back on porn free..   It is hard to be this way when you still have sex drive. But I think it is essential. I have not really fought with my wife since I began doing this and I think it is going to take a lot of time.. A lot of time for these wounds to heal and things to be forgotten.. On both sides.. I would be angry at her and she would be angry at me back..   I do not think there is any easy way out.. Just do the pornfree. Commit to her. Try to regain her trust by walking the line."

pornfree,3dyviy,Cksp4444,4,Mon Jul 20 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"When you're addicted the brain comes to associate the very act of masturbating with porn so the corresponding dopamine pathways are lit up.  Before my last porn relapse, I masturbated without porn a week prior and in a few days the urges were unbelievably high, which led to a full blown relapse and the end of a 43 day streak. Same thing happened after my last wet dream a week ago- after about 3 days there was a massive spike in urges.  You should make sure you're completely rewired and withdrawal free before fapping. So be careful of the chaser effect in the upcoming week."
pornfree,3dyviy,ObservingDuck,5,Mon Jul 20 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"I can't stress enough how important this is. While masturbation will help you with immediate urges, note that your brain is probably still trained to associate it with porn because every time you masturbated in the last x years, porn was probably involved some way or the other.  While you're learning to masturbate to sensation, these porn circuits in your brain will probably get stimulated a little bit and will hit you back with a chaser effect. Remember that this chaser is not the same as a real libido surge. Only fap when you're really feeling horny, not when you're hit with a chaser porn craving. If you do that, you're basically firing those circuits over and over again and the urges will get stronger every time. Remember that you don't watch porn anymore. You know you're doing it right when you have little to no chaser effect after you fap. Your real libido is also not as high as it might seem to be in the beginning. Porn cravings are not the same as horniness. They're just your brain asking you for a dopamine hit. Don't fall into that trap. The key here is to relearn healthy sexual habits which include mindful masturbation and real intimacy.  Stay aware and good luck!"
pornfree,3dyviy,ObservingDuck,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"Damn, a huge thank you to you and /u/CKSP4444  I wasn't even aware that it can still affect the brain like that. And after I made this post I felt just really tired and kinda unmotivated. I think I'm sticking with both pornfree and NoFap from now on!"
pornfree,3dyviy,BodyKeepstheScore,3,Mon Jul 20 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not a scientist and I don't really know how it affects the brain so all I said is from my own experience, but that showed me that going NoFap can be beneficial in the early stages. Try it for a week or two and see where it takes you. You will probably feel a real libido surge after a while, and when you do, try to masturbate to sensation only and avoid death gripping. It's hard, especially when you've never done it before (or haven't done it in a long time) but you will see that over time it becomes easier and the orgasm will be orders of magnitude better.

Masturbation isn't wrong but when you start with pornfree you should do a period of NoFap. You fapped after some porn urges? Well you just served your porn habit. It may not feel connected but it is. The longer you'll go the more you'll able to tell. It's so easy to mistake cravings for real libido. I still encounter this on a regular basis. You'll get more and more sensitive to it. I actually feel if my masturbation was ""clean"" or if porn thoughts were involved. Your brain uses the same pathes it used when you were looking at porn and it still links masturbation to it. I can only masturbate healthy when I don't start with sexual thoughts at all. They'll lead to pornographic ideation in 90% of the time. Pornographic ideation means transferring the patterns of porn onto your fantasies (and other things). So of course your urges are gone.  Sorry, I don't want to discourage you. 12 Days are a great achievement and I hope that you'll get to 120 days and more. But just take masturbation with a grain of salt. It's not that easy. Actually, the cleaner your brain gets the more sensitive you get towards pornographic ideation. So stay strong."

It's right up the alley of something that I wrote in my recovery journal last year, at the time that I stopped thinking about my addiction, i.e. my monster, as being an evil thing inside me that I hated and needed to destroy.  I said then that my monster is part of me, and as such, I should love it.  Since then I've tried to see it as an ill-behaved pet that keeps pissing on the rug and knocking over dishes.  It doesn't mean to be destructive, that's just how it is.  But nurture it?  I don't know what it means to nurture my porn addiction.  On a good day, my monster sits at my feet like a good boy, and I have peace as I live with it.  On not-so-good days, he tries his best to slip his collar, and I try to stay patient as I struggle to get a shorter grip on his leash.  That doesn't sound like nurturing; at best, it sounds like management.

I just feel like sometimes I get caught up seeing it as this external monstrosity that either washes over me or infects me to make poor choices in all areas of life. But, I suppose what I meant was more along the lines of what you said, with the key focus being on management, not outright removal or defeat. Instead of seeing it as this polarizing battle, it's more of a choice. Just putting it in a better perspective than me vs. it because that can get extremely draining after a while.

I would rethink this whole topic. I am not an native english speaker, therefore I have to circumscribe and maybe first you should define 'objectifiying' and 'feeling excited'.

(In a way of, ""I 'like' your boobs."" or ""Your tits are/could be pretty and I 'would love' them..."" 'like' and 'would love' because you haven´t seen the girl naked and your imagination of her tits could betray you).  In the first case, I would stop it, because it is a kind of real-life-porn (or it would have the same effect like porn). But I would accept the second case, I mean, why shouldn´t I accept and see the beauty of women? I watch the faces of girls, too and I am happy, if the girl is really beauty without make-up.

These 2 sentences ring really true to me: 'Even though [some sucky aspects of your life] are not directly linked to porn it is possible that porn was a way to deal with these emotions. When you find other ways to deal with these emotions porn will never find a way back into your life.'"

Anyone who's ever succeeded knows the pain and horror of failure with great intimacy.  The #1 waste of your time (aside from looking at porn) is feeling stupid, and guilty, and beating yourself up for looking at porn.  Guilt can't ever get you to your destination.   When you're eyes are on what's wrong, you never get to see what you're doing right. When you don't see what you're doing right, you can't build momentum and do more of it.  Too often we rely on our emotions.  What emotion is going to help you? Anger? Disappointment? Frustration? Guilt?  Not one of those things is going to help you.  Actions. Taking steps to quit. That's what's going to help you.  Have you ever worked in sales? I have. It's shit.  I'd dial 100 times a day. You know how many people actually picked up the phone? Maybe 20 on a good day. Out of those 20, maybe 7 would set an appointment. From there, 2 of them would show up.  I couldn't know ahead of time which two people would actually show up. I couldn't know which 20 would actually pick up the phone. I had to call all 100 people to get there.  The only way to reach success, is if you wade through the failures first.  You don't know what's going to make it click for you  I didn't. If you would have told me a year ago that I'd be pornfree today, I'd have laughed.  I had a proven track record of failing miserably.  But I kept trying. And one day, it wasn't so difficult anymore.  You'll get there.  Take each failure in stride .  You're not stuck.   You're getting closer and closer to your goal.    When you're stacking up failures and lots of things you're trying aren't working, you're far closer to success than you think.  When you're daydreaming ideas that are going to work perfectly but aren't failing yet, you're much further away than you could possibly imagine. -- Sebastian Marshall    Sounds like you're suffering a bit.

For example I would regard it as a kooky but essentially legit opinion that masturbation could be a violation of the fifth commandment, if it goes outside the consensual boundaries of a relationship.

If you really need a cold turkey reboot, go NoFap for a week, a month, 90 days or whatever period of time feels appropriate to you. After you're done with that, you can (and, quite honestly, should) reintroduce sexuality into your life. Be it with your partner or, if you're single, through masturbation. Just be careful not to fall into the porn trap again. But also don't starve your sexuality forever.  I did a hundred something days of NoFap hard mode and it was really difficult whenever I was not in a flatline. I felt like shit. After it was over I had sex again, it was amazing, and then I told myself that I could watch some ""harmless"" porn again. Sure enough, after a while I drifted back into the stuff I wanted to escape from. Now I'm going pornfree but allow myself to masturbate (if possible to sensation only) whenever I feel I need it and it's not that difficult and I don't feel like shit at all. The urges are very manageable and my libido did, I think, return to a normal level.   This is, for me at least, the way to go."
pornfree,3dt9le,ObservingDuck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"I have only been able to go 'sensation' once in my life, years ago. I think this is my 'goal' so to speak in terms of sex."
pornfree,3dt9le,fenrir_01,4,Wed Jul 22 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"It's very important to separate porn and masturbation so that after you MO you won't have urges to watch P. If you feel confident enough try it, try and masturbate to sensation only, because fantasising can be triggering at the beginning.  When i fantasised before, i always added some fetishes, or at the very least some scenarios from porn with me and a girl i know in the place of the actors, and it made harder to stay away from porn. A few months into pornfree and i found out, that even when i relapsed, the porn was softer, and lately i didn't even watch people have sex, seeing naked woman were enough, and my fetishes dissapeared even from my imagination. Now when i fantasise from time to time it's simple and feels natural.  Try to masturbate to sensation only, if you won't be able than it might mean you are not yet ready and need to wait a little. In the beginning you can add a bit of fantasy, but it should be as ""soft"" as possible (if you start imagining porn scenarios or some fetishes, you should withdraw in my opinion). The sensation when masturbating without fantasy is better and more rewarding for me and it tends to be so strong, that i'm sometimes unable to fantasize at all. What's best about it for me is that porn lost it's attractiveness to masturbate to. When i PMO'd, after i finished i felt like ""wait, that's it?"", when i just MO i feel satisfied and relaxed.  Give it a go, one day you should see the difference and you won't find porn attractive to. The only urges for porn i face now are to see naked woman, watching people have sex feels disturbing and just wrong."

I'm also prone to depression and i think fapping and porn were driving that as I feel I've been much less depressed after quiting.  During this period, I've done several stints of hardmode, the longest being around 150 days.  When last I was having consistent sex I found it to be an amazing experience.  However, i struggle and wonder if this has anything to do with nofap/pornfree or if it's that I was extremely into my girlfriend at the time.  My gut tells me being pornfree helped.  Nofap, i don't know.  I still had a lot of issues with lasting more than a minute or 2 the first time, most of the time.  I had a sexual experience a few nights ago.  Something totally meaningless with a girl I wasn't attracted to.  I lasted maybe 5 seconds the first time.  2 or 3 minutes the second despite all of the working out, kegals etc.   I was embarrassed and shamed.  Really, I just think I wasn't into it and have since developed a need for lots of emotion during sex.  I need to feel something for the girl I'm with.  I think pornfree did this for me.  Benefits of nofap?  Having more energy here and there but I could also see this happening because of better moods, a better diet, etc.  I'm thinking of starting to fap again to working on my staying power but I know I'll have to keep it in check."

But fantasies that derive exclusively from porn or derive from porn or internet use are a dangerous game and should be avoided if you're trying to give up PMO.  Sometimes our memory can be the worst tube site of them all.

pornfree,3dtbqo,roadkill_er,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Quitting drinking was and is one of the hardest thing I've had to do.  I wish I had some pragmatic list of things you can do to quit, but personally, I had to reach a point where I was so desperate to quit that I was forced to make a lifestyle change.  I tried and failed to quit for over 3 years, and this is the first time I've had any success.  So far, I haven't needed to ditch all my friends.  I was in a fraternity and most of my college friends know me as a heavy drinker, so I had to be open with them and set some boundaries.  I had to cut some people out, and I had to add new people from A.A. that are around my age and that understand what I'm going through.  Having a support system in place has been absolutely crucial.  As far as social life centering around drinking, I know exactly how that goes.  Being sober around drunk people gets old, fast.  I went to a 4th of July BBQ a few weeks ago with friends and I ended up having a great time, but by around 7 PM everyone was totally wasted so I had to get out of there.    Even outside of normal drinking activities, it's been an issue.  I recently organized a hike with some friends and two guys brought flasks to drink on the trail.  I've started to be hypersensitive to that kind of thing, so for now I try to avoid it when I can.  I've found I'm just naturally gravitating away from bars/clubs/parties when the only activity there will be drinking.  I'm fine if there's a pool table or lawn games or volleyball or something else to occupy my attention.  Come on over to /r/stopdrinking, lurk a little and I'm sure you'll see plenty of people with similar stories and concerns as you have, and the folks there will be able to give you a better answer than I can here.  If stuff like the ""Your Brain on Porn"" video help convince you or strengthen your resolve, check out Pleasure Unwoven.  I'm pretty sure it's on youtube.  Also, Allen Carr has a book on the subject, ""The Easy Way To Control Alcohol"" that's worth a read."

So the thing is, my life has been a symbiotic dance between alcohol and porn. I watch porn so I drink so I watch porn so I drink... One shame drives the other. I think quitting the booze, at least for me, is the easier of the two (went 90 days DRY last year) but, and this is a big one, what tricks / tips have you found to grease the skids socially if hooch is not an option? Sometimes avoiding situations with alcohol is impossible. Example: my gf had a big birthday party (100+ people) complete with kegs, cocktails and fine wine. I was the ONLY one there, no seriously, not drinking and felt like absolute shit the whole time.   btw, I'll subscribe to SD... thanks for the link."

In my case it was because I couldn't be in a healthy serious relationship without being in a healthy relationship with myself, but you mentioned ""best revenge"" so maybe this doesn't fully apply"

While I can totally subscribe to the negative effects of porn he describes, I really don't see any of the fapping facts to be true. Except for loss of sensitivity and spontaneous erections maybe, but that's more a problem of excessive masturbation than fapping itself. If you fap like once or twice a week and have a normal functioning libido, I really don't see it having any negative effects.  Of course, if you fap like six times a day it will, but then you have to ask yourself why you're fapping six times a day, and in 99/100 cases I guarantee you the answer will be ""because porn.""  Also I think that having normal sex six times a day will have the exact same effects."

pornfree,3dtll3,roadkill_er,2,Sun Jul 19 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with masturbation is actually the fault of porn too. Before internet porn we didn't have this explosion of sexually dysfunctional young people. The problem is, that now people have become compulsive w***ers due to the readily available and pretty much limitless, free porn accessible in the privacy of their own rooms.   So although Nofap has worked very well for me, I don't actually think masturbation is wrong. Lots of people do it without problems.  I think the porn industry stinks though."
pornfree,3dtll3,moododude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:32 2015 UTC,"I've never had any of the negative side effects you listed for fapping except for loss of sensitivity. How does it cause bad breathe and weight gain exactly lol? As long as it isn't more than 1-2 times a week I really see no problem with it. Sometimes it even kickstarts my libido when I've flatlined; the next day I'm wildly horny again.  If you have problems with doing it compulsively then stop completely for a few months and NEVER watch or think about porn. Otherwise, some occasional relief isn't going cause all of the physical symptoms you were listing."
pornfree,3dtll3,adaman360,0,Sun Jul 19 13:57:39 2015 UTC,You should probably realize that when a lot of guys say fap… They mean PMO and very often on r/nofap the focus is on the P.   Synecdoche is the appropriate word here. :D

It's like getting led on by a con artist, as if you're offered a great deal on a dream vacation, the more excited you become the more disappointed you'd be when you find out about the hidden fees and that the hotel is a dump in a shady part of town.   Whereas if you have sex in the right context (with a partner you love or care about) then you don't think or feel like ""I'm alone, I just PMO'd, I failed,"" but instead we can enjoy the afterglow and pure bonding from a wonderful shared experience with a real woman.

pornfree,3dtf64,roadkill_er,0,Sun Jul 19 15:06:55 2015 UTC,"Wrong.   When you do anything that pleasures you, the reward system of the brain is activated, generating a lot of dopamine and other 'pleasure chemicals' making you feel good. Once the source of our pleasure goes away, so do the pleasure chemicals. As a consequence, we feel unhappy.  In short: overstimulation causes desensitisation.  Probably there is a difference in the pleasure derived from 'fake' and 'real' pleasure sources, but I don't know about any scientific evidence to support that."

pornfree,3dqhis,j_master_d,22,Sat Jul 18 13:42:23 2015 UTC,Best thing to do at this point is get counseling with your wife. I had that same problem and I chose to ignore it she is gone forever and I could have had a shot at getting her back.
pornfree,3dqhis,terminatorisalive,15,Sat Jul 18 13:52:30 2015 UTC,"Firstly you need to accept that you asked for this. You swore to your wife you wouldn't look at it again, at the risk of losing your marriage. Yet last night you logged on and started hoarding porn. And judging by the fact that you're hoarding it, I can only surmise you didn't just finally give in to the urge after fighting it off for so long. You swore to your wife without any real intention of giving it up. So she has every right to be furious.   So that's what you need to look at first. If you can't find a way to give your wife the respect and trust she deserves you'll let her down again. And if she forgives you this time, I doubt she's likely to forgive you a third time. When you make a promise of this gravity to your wife you have to mean it. And never use porn again.  I may sound particularly harsh but that's the truth of it. You let her down badly and you need to take a long hard look at yourself.  To get her to listen to you I'd suggest a letter. Since she's likely to tell you to clear off if you go home to talk to her. Tell her you'll get outside help, and mean it. It might help if you've got some evidence that you are already arranging it.  This happened to me and I went to see a councillor and joined r/nofap. And so far so good. Both of these things helped me immeasurably, and my wife and I are still together and much happier for it. But if I gave in to temptation and my wife found out I have little doubt she'd walk. Or more accurately she'd probably kick me out and file for divorce.  I'm not sure exactly how else you can win her back. Obviously you need to convince her that you really do love her and you feel awful about what you've done. But how you word it is down to you.  Good luck. And sorry again for being harsh but you need to hear it."

pornfree,3dqhis,foobarbazblarg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"yes and no. Just because your an addict it doesn't mean that your SO should expect for the eventuality of a relapse. As a SO I know if that was truly the option I would not stay. Addiction is a beast and porn is the worst I feel. You have to suffer in silence while your victims do as well.  I hate the wording  j_master_d chose in his post. ""She made me swear not to look at it ever again or she would leave me"" Ok look back at that conversation. Was that comment made in the heat of the moment? Most likely yes. In mist of her heart break she became black and white with her thinking. I would like you to examine the time following that ...months, years? who knows but I would believe you had more than one conversation about it and in those conversations you made the promise on your own time and again. If that is the case then darling  j_master_d you have knowingly broke the heart of the woman you love. If you did genuinely plan to stop using and the struggle became too much that is when you should have been man enough to reach out for help. I can in some way sympathize with you not directly going to her with your relapse but if you did nothing (that being short of aggressive treatment IE: Sex addiction therapist or SAA meetings) then you knowingly choice porn over your relationship. Not over your wife. It was a simple break down of this.   I want to look at porn. I know this would hurt my wife, even if I do not feel it should. I choose to look at porn. I do not disclose my relapse to my wife.  This is the dance that you and porn have brought into your relationship. With a freshly broken heart try to hear this. You need help for you. Not your wife not your children not society for you. No matter what partner you get with Porn will break apart that relationship.   Love yourself enough to talk about the shame of your addiction and find out how you can heal and become a better happier healthier you.

pornfree,3dqhis,BodyKeepstheScore,3,Sun Jul 19 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting combination here of the helpful, the unhelpful and the outright sexist.   moododude has it right. I suspect you're not past the point of no return (pun not intended) - relationships survive much worse. But you're probably past the point where you can go it alone - like a couple of other people have said, you need to think seriously about couple therapy / counselling. If you put yourself in her position and think about the hurt that this breach of trust has caused her, then you'll understand why she reacted so badly. However, like all addictions success is never simply a matter of needing to want to give up enough. It certainly helps, but the severity of the situation you're in doesn't change the fact that there may be relapses in the course of your recovery. This is part of the reason why some sort of counselling, or at least sharing your feelings with a trusted mutual friend, is essential - another grand promise of eternal sobriety is not going to help you here.  I wish you the best of luck. Like I say, it's certainly not an insurmountable problem, but to regain her trust you will need to make some genuine and perhaps difficult changes."

From what I experienced, being with someone who prioritized porn over me and especially his own well being, was never going to help me achieve my best but only leave me hurt and with an increasingly drained heart and energy.  Sorry to hear it's not well with you two :("
pornfree,3dqhis,MsAmelie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Accept whatever happens, don't fight the solution. Sometimes recovery from an addiction takes precedence over a marriage. You might need to experience the strength and power of being on your own as you move through this. You and your wife might not benefit from the complications of being married as you recover. I'm not saying that is the solution, but if it is, don't make this difficult. Go with a good solid motivated recovery and watch your future open up beyond what you dreamed."
pornfree,3dqhis,BodyKeepstheScore,2,Sat Jul 18 14:51:21 2015 UTC,I agree. There is no recovery in the marriage without movement toward recovery in the addict.

I am sure her comment brought up feelings that relate to your individual situation but each person reacts to a stressful situation differently.

pornfree,3drwfx,Dont_stop1,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:18 2015 UTC,I can't really comment on loneliness as I'm a married older bloke. But I deal with the urges precisely as you did. Dismiss it quickly and move on. There's no point dwelling on it.  Perhaps you should try and join some group with an interest you have. The only way I can see to deal with loneliness is to get out and meet people. I'm quite introverted myself but I try to push myself out of my comfort zone when I can. If only to stop me retreating further into myself.  Congratulations on your success BTW :-)

pornfree,3drwfx,recoveryrebel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on 30 days, man. Like moododude suggested, joining a group can be good. It's helpful for introverts because a ready-made structure is provided. There is no substitute for human contact in person.  looking back, I've gotten best results dealing with sensual desires by learning some ""game"" or conversation skills and going out and talking to / ""playing"" with people including women in a healthy fun way.  You are good with words, and you're sincere. I'm not suggesting memorize cheesy pick-up lines.  But something like, a few fun conversation starters and open-ended questions and transitions to have at your disposal for an event, along with structures like groups you've joined so you have a stream of events to attend and people to meet, can be a powerful 1-2 combo for overcoming loneliness and enlarging one's sphere of perspective and activity.  I like to do running or other athletic / fitness groups or classes, because they're often cheap and I get to exercise and meet other people going in a healthy direction, many of whom are also solitary much of the time. :-)  Meeting more people in person won't cure loneliness but it will give you opportunities to develop real connections that help fill the void.  When I deal with loneliness by taking action toward being more outgoing, playful, or social, I notice positive changes and end up meeting others for nurturing relationships and even SO's.  I am glad you are doing well!"

Maybe that's something to examine.   Online counseling is available via Skype and phone, it might be something to check out. There are also 12 step meetings of various types via phone and internet. You Tube has a bunch of videos on the topic of recovery (resources posted by AA & NA members, etc.). I've had difficulty finding online sponsorship, but maybe that's out there too. Texts for the 12 step programs are free and downloadable. 12 step workbooks are also free and downloadable. Recovery material helps a lot, though the charism of 12 step groups is a detriment for many people.  You're right, the hypersexual mindset that our culture and porn induces is definitely not good for us as individuals or as a society."

I'm quite a late sleeper as well and I only tend to go to bed when I'm sleepy so that I fall asleep right away instead of lying awake in bed.  When you're sitting in front of your computer being bored (a situation I would have considered watching porn a very good option just a few weeks back) just do something else. Play a video game, watch a movie or an episode of a TV show, read an interesting or funny thread on Reddit, or just watch some random YouTube videos about a topic that interests you. When you become sleepy, go to bed.  And while you do this, remind yourself that you don't want to watch porn."

I'd recommend banishing electricals from your rooms so you don't get distracted (helps both with PF and sleeping in general), and doing something relaxing like exercising, having a bath or reading before going to sleep. It'll take some time to get used to it if you're in the habit of always using computers late at night but for me it was a big step forward."

I 'waste' my time late in the night, just by hanging around in the internet instead of going to bed. Earlier I had installed ""Auto Wise shutdown"", you can set an alert and also the programm shut down your PC at a special time, which you set. Today I use my reminder/alarm clock of my smart phone. If I want to go to bed by around 22:30, then the alarm clock starts at 21:30, 22:00 and 22:30. It is a reminder for me, to question myself, whether I have got something important to do or whether I am hanging around. If I am hanging around, then I shut down the computer..."

I then spend time reading a book, taking a bath or just whatever is relaxing. I try not to watch tv (potential triggers) or use my phone, also because the light of electronics tends to keep me awake.   What also works for me is taking my computer power cable and putting it in a different room. Iv'e noticed that it just gives me an extra barrier that i have to go through. That just gives me a little extra tick of time to think about my priorities before i do something i will regret.  Also, meditation. This helps me sleep so much better, i can really recommend it.  Hope this helps."
pornfree,3dpexn,BabblingBrewer,3,Sat Jul 18 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, it happens to everyone. Just try to bounce back stronger this time.  My advice to you is never get complacent. Don't think you can handle the urges and maybe one look won't hurt. There's plenty of guys with 100 plus days who let their guard down and relapse. Always remember there is that chance but when the urge comes just think of the reasons you're quitting. Just go over those reasons repeatedly in your head and remember how low you feel after you do it. As you get further into recovery it will become easier but always remember those reasons to keep you strong when you need it."
pornfree,3dpexn,Dont_stop1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:01:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is once you know this, your brain will try anything to get back to where you were too.  Anything.

Your brain tells you then to go a sexchat room and see what sup.  Then towards porn trackers.  To finish watching 1 clip of porn.  And so on..5 days like this to get back to P.  I wasted 18 days.

pornfree,3dptb4,moododude,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:29 2015 UTC,It's pretty normal now. I still occasionally wonder about what's new on the old sites but I don't dwell on it. I promised my wife I'd never look at porn again. And she would probably divorce me if I did so I have a pretty strong reason to be determined.  But yes it's nice. I don't have that niggling worry of being discovered at the back of my mind anymore. And I don't feel ashamed when I look at my daughter either.  I still don't want to get complacent though. I've seen plenty of posters with badges in the hundreds who relapsed. You're only 1 weak moment away from a reset I suppose. And remembering when I got found out by my wife I'd better not relapse.  Stick with it anyway. It's pretty much down to willpower in the end. Make your decision final and don't look back. 1 day at a time :-)

I think that takes volition out of the equation.  Sexual desire is an appetite albeit a strong one.  I have strong urges to eat cheeseburgers and ice cream everyday, but understand that it's an appetite that deserves to be bridled and kept under control.  Our sexual appetites are no different.  Enough is never enough once we start to feed that proverbial beast.  Overeaters know this as do addicts across the board.  Putting ourselves at the mercy of 'biology' is often just a way to excuse our poor choices and behavior or give us a backdoor excuse when push comes to shove and we can't control ourselves.  Keep up the good fight.  One can really see how devastating pornography is when in a relationship.  It warps one's perception of not only other human beings, but, worse, the very person one claims to love."

Although you have put it across better than me.   I don't see biology as an excuse for porn use. In fact that is precisely my point. I just find it bloody irritating that it gives me these urges I'd rather not have.   And there's no claim at all. I love my wife and my daughter. My past porn use doesn't call that into question as far as I'm concerned. Nor any temptations I have these days.   But you're right, it's not an excuse. Just part of the problem."

pornfree,3doa19,robrobrob5,2,Sat Jul 18 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"To produce an independent happy person must take 20/25 years minimum. Frequent and varied sexual partners aren't conducive to a healthy family unit. A dysfunctional family unit produces a dysfunctional person. I f***ing wish evolution could just catch up a bit. And let's be honest, an unlimited urge of filthy, willing, guilt free sexual partners, available in the privacy of your own room, aren't really helping. So fing thanks for that porn kings!  [...] 58% of divorces filed in the US cite regular internet porn use as the reason.   Thank you for seeing that.  One of the latent dysfunctions caused by porn IS divorce. It erodes men's abilities to maintain long term relationships.  And when you chip away at that family structure, you're destroying one of THE building blocks of a society.  Porn's doing a great job of tearing apart society, and no one's seeing the full extent of the effects yet. PIED is one thing, but increased divorce rates, lack of a family structure, there are SERIOUS cultural repercussions from that."

Not particularly because I'd have to admit to a porn addiction. I think most of them would understand that.   More because they would find giving up porn weird. This is just a suspicion. But I'd not bet on an understanding response. In fact if I admitted I'd given up porn I'd be preparing for a s**load of pi* taking. To me that is f***ed up! But that's what society thinks is ok.

While it may not be politically correct, it's perfectly healthy to look at a women's body and think ""I'd love to have sex with that"". I guess it depends on how old you are and what you're looking for now, but having sex with a women purely because she has a nice body is fine so long as you are clear about your intentions with the woman (think one night stand). You may simply want a real relationship, and that's cool, but don't criminalize your desires because some SJW's told you so."
pornfree,3dnqwe,dontneedporn,3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"The good news is, you're 18 so you can change bad habits and learn something new about yourself. You have conditioned yourself to follow a certain procedure and that's how your brain works right now - but I don't see a reason why you shouldn't be able to install a different program, so to speak. But first you would have to uninstall the old program. Maybe quit watching for 90 days like many of the people here and allow your brain to clear up. You might experience mood swings, similar to withdrawal symptoms. Your bf should be on board at this point so he knows what's up.  Try and masturbate without porn. Use your imagination. If it's too hard at first, try erotic literature instead of porn. Anything to break the program."

pornfree,3dnqwe,moododude,2,Fri Jul 17 22:49:48 2015 UTC,"I suspect there's a connection. But I wouldn't panic too much.   It seems to me that as you've gone weeks without porn you should be able to stop using it. And that should help with your orgasms. No porn, no subconscious link with orgasm.  In the meantime I'd just enjoy sex with your BF. You don't need to have an orgasm to enjoy it."
pornfree,3dnqwe,free_lefthand,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think I can't orgasm by myself or during sex without watching porn. How do I get over this? Is there something else wrong?   You're not the only one who can't get off without porn.  Unfortunately for you, many women have extreme difficulty reaching orgasm regardless of porn use. While it may indeed be a factor and I encourage you to break free of porn, it's not the only factor.  The thing about sex many of us forget is that arousal happens in the brain. It's not about ""technique"" like we've been so misguided to believe. Sometimes, no amount of patience or trying will lead to an orgasm because your body or your brain just won't cooperate.  This is normal.  So please don't feel guilty about it.   It sounds like you have a wonderful, loving, and kind relationship. Communicate with your lover that it's not him, it's not his fault, but it's just been difficult for you to orgasm without porn.  Porn affords you a world of stimulus at the touch of a button. It's an easy way to reach peak arousal levels, and by  relying on it for orgasm, you're conditioning yourself to REQUIRE that high level of stimulus in order to orgasm.  That's porn induced erectile dysfunction. In female form.  I would recommend getting off the porn. It's hard now, but if you don't, chances are you'll keep training yourself to orgasm only when porn's around.  But also, take it easy on yourself.   You're young, your sexuality is still developing. You have much to learn about your body and the way it works. Give yourself time to do that.  It sounds like you already know this, but just in case, I want to remind you that foreplay, masturbating with your partner, cuddling, or even just being naked together is sex too. It doesn't have to be penetration for it to count as sex. And you don't always have to orgasm for you to have a fulfilling sex life.  Now, with all that being said...  You may want to get yourself a Hitachi magic wand if you haven't already. I can't even imagine going back to any other vibrator after having one, because that would be going back to the stone ages of vibrators. It may vastly improve your chances of reaching orgasm, with or without the porn.  tl;dr: Yes, porn is a problem. You've likely conditioned yourself to require the high levels of stimulus coming from porn in order to reach orgasm. BUT. It's not the ONLY factor. Many women have difficulty reaching orgasm (that's a sad fact of life) and no amount of technique or patience will alleviate it. A Hitachi magic wand may improve your chances. Ultimately, listen to your body and know that what you're going through is normal.  Hope this helps."

pornfree,3dmgzv,Thunderstorm654,5,Fri Jul 17 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say that I have no experience with this question.  Recovery is what? It's being able to control the compulsion/addiction or drop it forever. It's not getting drawn into the behavior, sometimes against our will. Many guys report that ""they don't even like the material anymore, it's ugly, gross, even offensive"", but the moment occurs when they cant resist typing in the url and PMO-ing.  Given that, if a binge causes an increase of PMO or related hypersexual out-of-control behaviors, then the binge set recovery back. Notice though, it doesn't void recovery, it can't. It merely sets it back. The individual has the power to set it forward again."
pornfree,3dmgzv,dannygojo,3,Fri Jul 17 14:43:56 2015 UTC,It depends on how long the session lasted and how extreme the material was. A 5 min session isn't going to have much of an effect compared to a 2 hour session.
pornfree,3dmgzv,OG_Mango,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said it really depends on how long your session was. A quick 5 minute wank to porn will honesty do less damage than a 2 hour porn session with a lot of edging, even if you don't bust a nut. When I first started nofap I was foolish enough to believe that watching porn while edging was doing less harm than just jacking off real quick, and boy was I wrong.   But to be frank with you though, and i'm not trying to demotivate you bro, but 2-3 days isn't really ""progress"", if you feel any different it's mostly placebo. When it comes to porn and masturbation addiction you really have to give your brain 2 weeks MINIMUM to start repairing itself. Those couple of days haven't really changed you neurologically/hormonely but if it's enough to give you a motivational boost all power to you. Good luck."

Literally this. I remember my first NoFap streak. After three weeks or so I thought that some stimulation wouldn't hurt. I started with just sexy pictures, then moved to stories, comics, et c. I thought as long as I didn't MO I was fine.   This was the worst decision I've ever made during my reboot attempts. Urges went through the fucking roof, anxiety surged and frustration skyrocketed for days on end. I've never felt so shitty in my entire life. At some point I had an actual panic attack complete with shaking, dizziness and destructive thoughts, and in the end I caved and fell back into the porn trap. And it took me months to get started again.   Don't do this. This is like putting alcohol in your mouth without swallowing it when you're an alcoholic."

pornfree,3dni4b,iBanana32GB,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"I hate it. and it's been happening since I was 15.   Pornography makes you lust. While it seems to be the case that some people have more ""vigor"" than others, it's a fallacy to think your porn use is because you are more ""sexual"".  Let's not fool ourselves here. If you have more vigor, well you can see that in the bed. We're talking about fantasies and looking at porn online yes?  In regard to fantasies / ""fetishes"". Let's face it, many of us found out we liked something only when we saw it. What is the ""truthfullness"" of any such fantasies? Is a butt made for sticking things into it? Pornography is a constructed world. While there is nothing inherently wrong about spicing up your sex life, let's get real, again... we are talking about pornography here. Looking at sexually arousing material, becoming addicted to the dopamine hits, escaping and zoning out from emotions or just life's responsibilities in general, not growing up emotionally...  Pornography obviously exacerbates the need for masturbation, partly because of the immediate arousal and need for relief, and then afterwards by the constant ""circlejerking"" (heh) in the mind that becomes somewhat obsessed with the material.  Decide what quitting porn means for you. You can't quit unless it means something true for you.  If that helps honestly I recommend a gradual approach. It helped me to get started. Try to stick to pictures only for a month. Then try to fap to softcore pics only for a month. It will give you confidence in observing some basic rules, achieve a goal, and as you do that you'll learn more about the urges and your mind will gradually quieten down as well with less arousing / extreme material."

I need to do it manual, and it even takes a while after I get it out. It's like hey, I've been going at it for almost half an hour already with 3 tries already you need to end it"".  I know the reality of the situation I am in. The thing is my ""sub-conscious"" (for the lack of a better term) doesn't. This is why I get into zombie modes and I REALLY start craving my fantasies and porn. The zombie in me makes excuses and I just fall into it. And you are right, there is a circlejerk within my mind. It's like there is one person that says its wrong, and the other part of my grey matter says ""so what?""   That actually helps. I never thought of it way, not just interpreting it as a goal, but as a meaning.  I'll tell you what it means to me:  1: I'll finally be able to have some self control. 2. I won't waste time trying to find what stimulates me.  3. I will finally be able to stimulate ""normally"" while having sex with my woman.  4. I will put this in the past and accept that it was something that should never be done again and never will be.  5. I won't be depressed as much and it maybe able to cure my depression.   Thanks for the tips by the way. In your experience with that method, at first did masturbating with softcore take you a long time and then gradually decrease?   edit: I've installed K9 on my computer and so far it's working great. The thing is I'm still able to access porn pictures through Yahoo search, but I don't want to block it because it is my main email account."

And, try to recognise what are your triggers. Do you look at porn when you're stressed, tired, anxious, depressed etc... Once you know these triggers you need to work on trying to rid yourself of these feelings as much as you can.

Due to anxiety and porn creating unrealistic expectations. However you're here and on the right track.  My biggest piece of advice for removing the unrealistic expectations and feeling that sex is more meaningful is to begin your pornfree journey and learn how to appreciate women again. Appreciate intimacy, love and other positive feelings. Don't compare it to porn or the feelings it gives you and explore your own sexuality naturally."

However even after I recovered, I couldn't bring myself to initiate sex with my ex (who I was really fond of, but sexually... not) and even when she did I had to simulate and usually left before long : I guess I can't be honest without saying as much as I loved her she disgusted me in bed. That was really horrible because I believed she felt reaaaaaally bad, and we weren't mature enough to talk it through.  So yeah, I've been experiencing this kind of issues.It really was a disappointment, and I'm still not out of it but NoFap helps me have better relationship with people (not only women) and I am now in better position for this not to happen (well, you can also tell yourself that it cannot be worse than before anyway).

But whenever I think about my current situation and want to relapse I have this quote from Edgar A. Poe: “I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason.

pornfree,3dlwi2,thebeatofmyowndrum,2,Fri Jul 17 09:35:24 2015 UTC,"What happens to the determination? If I'm understanding the neurology correctly, primitive brain can convince neo-cortex that porn is not a problem. Primitive brain promises strong physical pleasure which can thwart ability to make a rational decision. The 'pleasure' neural loop can short circuit our 'determination loop'. Emotions (anger, pleasure, etc.) impede frontal cortical functioning. Have you tried to concentrate when you were angry? It doesn't go very well. The Nike advertising campaign is a prime example: ""Just do it!"" They don't want us to use frontal cortex, just go with the emotion. Similarly, ""Just say no!"" is a technique to get us to cease frontal lobe functioning. Don't think, just behave - whether for the better or for the worse.    So, that means the determination still exists right there in your cortex, even at this very moment. The brain still has everything it ever had (e.g., memories, information, data, etc.). The determination can be just as powerful as it ever was depending on how we manipulate our cognitions and emotions to make the brain take the neural loop that we want it to take. With time, the neural pathways of porn usage become less powerful because over time, we constantly manipulated our brain patterns away from those reward circuits.  What about wrong and right? We all have a moral code, few people really examine and define what they believe is wrong/right. 'Wrong' might entail unhealth, less productivity, less self-actualization, harm to self or others. 'Right' might be the opposite. Even if we take the time to define our moral code, being able to live up to it can be a significant challenge. So then, having a moral code and living a moral code are two different aspects of morality. Read some of these papers at the Stanford Dictionary of Philosophy on the topic of morality. It's quite fascinating. You clearly like to think.  tdlr: The determination is still there in your cortex. Invite it to move forward again and let it take over. The porn guy keeps pushing it to the back of the bus."

They are both socialy acceptable, they are both easy to get, and they are both forbidden for minors by law.  But at the same time they are also targetted at minors, because they can develop an addiction while growing up and become a solid base for the industry as consumers. Kids don't now the consequences of smoking or watching porn, and it's not rocket science that the older you get it's harder for you to develop an addiction, because you are aware of the dangers that go hand in hand with them."

You're seeing behind the curtains, mate.  Guys who are seeing the effects of PIED are the canaries in the coalmine, warning everyone else about the dangers of porn.  But because it's such a big part of pop culture, people blow it off as nonsense and are otherwise oblivious to the dangers of porn.

Also with our culture it is hard to even watch a movie without seeing some triggering material. I used to smoke and quitting that was  much easier. As long as I didn't have cigarettes, I wouldn't smoke them. If I had them, I would smoke them. Therein lies the difference.

pornfree,3djcvr,omoest94,6,Thu Jul 16 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"You pay too much attention to the counter, also you should stop making promises to yourself, because you make it worse that way. When the urges strike you start panicking that you'll have to reset the badge or broke that promise, and thus you relapse. That very stress is a trigger itself. Accept your addiction and stop feeling bad about it. When you are fat, don't weep about it, keep calm and treat it as a imperfection, something that you just have to work on.      This is not a competition to find who will have the longest streak, therefore the counter should be treated like a tool to measure your progress. Rome wasn't built overnight, you see progress when you see higher numbers between relapses.       When you lift do you feel depressed because you can't lift 100kg? Or if you run do you feel bad because you can't finish 100m in 10 seconds? No, you keep working and training to finally achieve it. Can't do it now? Ok, i'll train my ass off and try again after a month. Didn't succeed? No problem, it still was 10kg more, or 1 second less.     Most importantly, try to live life as if porn didn't exist. Don't concentrate on not watching porn, concentrate on everything else that you have to do. Because that is what you really want to do, all that cool stuff out there in the world. A stain on your shirt doesn't mean you can't go to a party and enjoy it."

pornfree,3dib1c,mrnoone56,6,Thu Jul 16 14:30:07 2015 UTC,"I accidentally tuned in to some on the TV late at night. I was 14 and I had a TV in my room but the rule was I wasn't allowed to watch it past 9pm I think. I respected this rule for a long time, then one night I couldn't sleep and turned it on out of curiosity and there was boobs. I remember watching it, shaking, with my finger over the power button in case my parents walked in. I had the mother of all erections which didn't seem to go away and I couldn't sleep very well that night.  I carried on doing this and eventually worked out when the porn was going to be on. I would scour the TV guide looking for more. I would stay up later and later. I remember even trying to stay up past midnight because a film was on that might have boobs in it. Funny thing was I didn't masturbate. I had an idea what it was but I always thought it was something bad so I didn't touch my dick at first. But I got curious and rubbed it a bit. One night I found a way that felt good and carried on doing it. Before long it felt really good and there was all of a sudden a massive mess on my bedroom floor. I had no idea what ejaculation was before that so it shocked me and I didn't masturbate again for a few weeks. But once I did masturbate again I never stopped...  Trouble is porn and masturbation was the only way for me to have an orgasm. And I was quite happy with that. I never tried to have sex because I thought I couldn't. But recently I realised that I can actually have sex if I want to. I also realised that my brain associates orgasms with MO only. I can't stay hard when I'm with a woman, and I still find it really difficult to imagine having an orgasm with a partner :("

At the beginning of Shrek, he takes a mud shower and even when I was young it seemed sexual and mud baths/showers were a fantasy I'd had even since. Well one night when I was eleven I searched up ""mud bath"" on YouTube and found some videos of cute Asian girls playing in mud. These videos were removed a few months later, and I started searching for them on Google, which brought me to porn sites. By the time I was 12 or 13 I got an iPod touch and it was all downhill. Full on porn videos, face fucking, JOI, way more hardcore mud videos, (I never got into the other aspects of WAM, like food or slime) giving girls swirlies (like dunking their heads in the toilet), etc. I've only just gotten around to stopping porn use. For the longest time I never thought that was the true problem. And while I've slipped up these last few days watching the same kind of shit I just talked about, I know how much I need to quit. I'm going to."

The feeling was unique, and amazing. This was in the early 80s, so no computers, and either imagination, or static images from magazines and such.   Eventually I'd take care of myself via watching video tapes, and then the Internet happened. Just a natural progression. Dial-up sucked, but for an addict, that's just a minor nuisance. Again, I started with static images, so worse comes to worse, and the dial-up stops, I've still got pictures on the screen to take care of business.   Now I don't work it 3-5 times a day like I did in my youth, more of a 1 time per day habit now, which I'm working on eliminating, but the Internet, for someone who grew up with much less to stimulate myself, is like going from weed to meth."

I was 12, so I got scared AND curious. I closed out of it but found myself back a few days later searching for the same song to get those results. Started with just reading the titles, then clicking on a picture, then more pictures. Then came videos and I was pretty much toast for a while. So porn was something I accidentally happened upon and I resisted the urge to look for a long time but I ended up giving in--still working on climbing out of that hole."

We would go to the computer labs and there was always some guy that would bring a floppy disk full of porn; I still remember that initial feeling of excitement, curiosity and 'feeling funny down there' by simply watching a few pictures.    It escalated when I had internet installed in my house. I was always good with computers so I never had an issue covering my tracks. Installing P2P clients (eg. Kazaa, Limewire, Ares) to download music certainly made it worse as I'd use it to download porn as well (not pictures, full length videos). The weird thing is that I didn't start jerking off until I was 18, I was happy by just watching it.    I'm 25 now and started Pornfree just last year and I wish I had started sooner. I wasn't until now that I realized the toll that excessive porn watching had on my development, both physical and mental."

There was a public access channel that showed late night seedy porn scenes (edited but still pretty graphic) and a show with female and male strippers dancing. That right there was the beginning of this downward spiral.  I was all of 10 years old. My dad would go to sleep and I'd creep over to the tv and watch this stuff that made me feel funny ""down there"".  It's 28 years later, I'm still creeping. Fuck, that's a bummer to admit."

The text of its url was a somewhat unconventional euphemism for a particular grooming preference.  I had heard as well about the whitehouse dot com vs. dot org kerfuffle on the friggin news or someting, or perhaps even from my fairly easygoing parents.  I wasn't too mystified about what I would find when I visited these sites, and I had free and unsupervised time after school (ah the 90s).  So I went, I saw, and I don't even know if I put the mo on the end of it until years later.  But to know that this stuff was just out there, free, and so easy to access was powerful knowledge to me.  My dad of course happened across my browsing history soon after, so I just got better at hiding it.  Edit - Also the local video rental didn't give a shit, so in that same unsupervised period, I'd go snag whatever the latest R-Rated ""teen"" movie was with the usual single quick nude scene in it.

Even then, I only rented (and copied) 3 tapes and used those exclusively for about 10 years. But then I got internet access and could access a limited amount of jpgs. Then, I got high speed internet access, and at the same time the porn industry bumped up its product using the new technology. So free video clips became my substance of addiction. I've never paid a cent for any of it, I only used free stuff, but as we all know the availability of free stuff is massive. At worst, my habit was one session per day lasting 2 to 3 hours, though there were some rare benders that went on for 6 hours. There's so much to see, you know? Yeah, right.  What a waste of my time it's all been too. In the past couple of years as I've worked on this problem my usage is down to about 1 session per week. However, that's on the chopping block as well.

Now, after it calmed down i have flashbacks of the times i drank 6 beers or half liter of vodka daily and see it as one of my happiest times and have thoughts like ""maybe i should take a drink or a beer?"" most of the days."
pornfree,3dh71t,fenrir_01,3,Thu Jul 16 06:47:23 2015 UTC,"It's not really something to be ""cured"". Sexual impulses are a normal human trait - porn addiction is what happens when they're overstimulated in certain ways enough to damage your lifestyle. Wanting to see people doing sexy things is something that naturally will happen - and for many this isn't a problem, but for some of us it's something we need to be careful with to avoid an addiction-style spiral in behaviour. In the same way, many people can drink without major effect, but others will become alcoholic - but both groups of people will want the effect of alcohol from time to time. Thus, it's not matter of removing desire, but redirecting it in a way that suits you.  When the want for porn strikes me, I take it as a good sign that my sexual engine is still running, and usually focus on satisfying that craving with something more ""healthy"" - i.e. sex, or masturbating using only thoughts of normal sexual situations. This may lead back to an addictive behavior for some, but for me I find it helps to cajole my mind back into associating pleasure with real life situations. In these situations, I try to strictly prohibit myself from accessing any material that I think might be overstimulating."
pornfree,3dh71t,throwawayfornf10101,3,Thu Jul 16 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Some people have a bad habit and not a full addiction and they are cured a few weeks or months after they stop. For me I don't think I reach a point where I am totally cured and don't have to think about my recovery. Put enough emotional pressure on me and I will have an insane and strong urge to go back to looking at porn. Untreated, this becomes unstoppable, and it doesn't seem like this feature goes away. I have to practice meditation and stuff like that to stay balanced and keep away from this thing. Not doing a great job at that lately, but I know that it works."
pornfree,3dh71t,sir_tom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"Some say that cure from addiction happens when the desire to use goes away. Perhaps the substance or behavior still seems appealing to some degree, but the desire is gone. I smoked grass for many years and loved it, I couldn't quit. But I began to pay more and more attention to my dislike of grass and wanted to quit. So I joined a 12 step group and got clean. In just a few weeks, the desire to smoke was gone. I'd reached a point of no return and I haven't smoked since (15 years ago). I still remember how nice grass can feel, how alive music becomes, how relaxing it is. Yet, it's not strong enough to pull me in anymore because I also remember how disgusting it is.  So according to this theory of cure from addiction, the individual can work on losing the attraction to the substance/behavior, lose the desire to use."

They couldn't be intimate be their partner because of ED,  their partners were just disgusted with them,  they injured themselves due to excessive masturbation, they became progressively deviant and it was embarrassing to talk about with their partner, etc.   Everyone has a very different experience, and you're not going to be able to check off elements and say ""yep, I have a problem"".     I'm here because I watched ""Hot Girls Wanted"" on Netflix,  and then I watched (part of) the ""Your Brain on Porn"" video linked in the sidebar.   I noticed some of the negative qualities that the video talked about in myself and decided I would try this,  and try to control my urges instead of letting them control me.  I never experienced sexual dysfunction as a result of porn watching,  but I do have brain for and ADHD (I was diagnosed at 7, long before porn, so its not entirely native to porn use), and occasional depression.   I'm heavily addicted to dopamine, which is something I've noticed in other facets of my life,  and so the discussion of the neurochemistry of porn really bothered me.   So far I haven't experienced the difficulty a lot of users talk about with quitting and relapsing,  and I've made it this far on my first try with only occasional urges to watch, mostly triggered by boredom.    It's definitely there, though, and it takes effort to force myself not to follow the NSFW links or go lookup something to watch.       I don't know if I'm an addict, if I need to do this the way others here feel they do,  or if I'll ever go back, but I do know that it's been a liberating experience, that I feel I am more in control of myself, and that I miss my girlfriend more and am excited to see her.   Watch the videos in the sidebar, and decide for yourself how you want to relate to your dopamine addiction and your sexual habits.  If you're here at all, it's probably because you recognize on some level that there is a problem with the way you consume pornography, so you need to figure out why you feel that way and what you need to do to fix it.   No one here is going to have the answer for you,  you need to find it for yourself.  We're just here to guide each other on the way."
pornfree,3dfuwk,Zankou55,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, the peak of my addiction started about five years ago, and lasted well over a year. On my worst days, I would go to porn four or five times a day. No joke. A day rarely passed without using porn at least once. This went on for almost two years. The porn use had started a couple years earlier rather innocently (I was rather young at the time), but slowly devolved into flat-out addiction.  Strangely enough, shortly after the peak of the porn use went away, I got my first girlfriend, and the desire to use porn evaporated completely for whatever reason, despite the fact that her and I did not have much of a sexual relationship. Over the course of two years, however, she left me several times for other men, ruined her sex life without me getting involved, and I went back to porn almost every time.  I eventually got out of that situation and she went to rehab (she had some substance and emotional issues that developed towards the end), and the porn addiction sent right back in. Not to the extent that it had been there before, but still really bad. I started fighting it actively around the time I got out of my relationship with my old girlfriend, and had several periods of cleanness lasting up to two weeks. Things got worse again about a month ago, and then I discovered this subreddit earlier this week, and am on day 3 of fighting my addiction. The temptation and urge have nearly taken me twice just today, but I won both of those battles, and hopefully I get better at fighting in the near future. I wish you good luck, and hope your problem is not nearly as bad as mine."

In earlier years I was using porn pretty much everyday once a day. It caused a hypersexual outlook, it made me want actual encounters. Rather than actually live life and pursue beneficial goals and activities, I found that I merely wanted to find 'pleasure'. It was like doing drugs. As time went on, I listened to the voice of health telling me that the habit was out of line. So, I started efforts to cut down or quit. I managed to stay clean for 30 days, then 60 days, but went back to it. I did another 30 days, but went back to it. Fortunately though, whatever I did to get the compulsion/addiction under control stayed with me. I learned a lot about this game and developed a lot of skill. It takes effort and time, but anything you do to get away from porn is of great benefit. It's markedly better than just letting the problem go completely untreated.  Set a goal for yourself, something you think you can manage. During that time, learn about addiction/recovery, any kind. Read 12 step texts (free online) work steps, attend any kind of meetings, watch recovery videos about addiction/recovery. Pursue spiritual goals, religious or otherwise.

This, as I found, meant that I could get my dopamine rush going for a longer time than I could ever do if I masturbated and came like a normal person. With all this edging going on, I started exploring more hardcore porn genres. A year later I was in full addiction mode -- 3 - 4 hours of porn every day, increasing to 4 - 6 on weekends.

Leave your computer or any connected device. I repeat: QUIT INTERNET ! Without internet, less porn is accessible. Go outside, make something, practice arts, read, do anything which brings you actual pleasure.  If your urges are really strong, better fap without porn than porn without fap (even nonnude/sexy could count as porn, if the goal is to arouse yourself). If you can, fap without fantasy, focusing on your body feelings. Or fantasize on ""possible"" sex, not that shit you used to see in porn.  If you can wait without porn nor fapping, it's great: your urges will decrease in some days. I usually have very hard days around day 12-14 but the times I succeeded to pass it, it was great.

People, get checked out by a physician if you're having strange symptoms! Swallow your pride and ask if P might be related if you are concerned there's a connection.  If they're not suspicious of a physical cause, it certainly could be psychological.   And for me, it is E."

This variety of brain fog leaves me unmotivated - and that cycles me back into a PMO session; ""Hey, doing that activity isn't necessary, so why not just relax and have a session instead? There's nothing else that I really have to do."" And the cycle continues - and the range of my activities grows smaller and my life becomes less fulfilling, less interesting. And that leads me back into the numb unmotivated place."

Think of it more like I'll be happy to reach 90 days but more importantly gaining the self control to quit this addiction for good.

Now, however, I'm starting to have places I want to go and hobbies I want to pursue, such as learning piano or learning Japanese (I hope to go to grad school there). But they take practice, patience, time, and don't come easy all the time. So I turn back to porn and run away. And then I hate myself. When I try to avoid it, I might go 3 days. I don't know how long it's been since I've gone more than that.   You've said it yourself. You could be doing other things with that time you throw away on porn. Don't do it mate.  I wish I would have learned to separate myself from porn ages ago. I would have been so much more successful, I could be so much farther ahead in life by now.  It's not just that you're sinking so much time into porn, it's also that by doing so, you're cutting yourself off from other opportunities. The negative effects of the time you waste on porn are exponential.  Here, try this for a wake up call."

If you find someone attractive, you can just look them up and look at them sexually like that.  Stay strong, mate, you did well not relapsing. As long as you're not masturbating to porn, you're still a step ahead of where you were before."
pornfree,3dae6j,nopronorfap,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"Loneliness as well as some insecurities, and boredom, seem to make me desire to watch porn and masturbate.   I ended up using PMO as a self medicating thing, due to having a poor family dynamic. Divorced parents, dad remarried 3 times, had 6 or 7 gfs. Meanwhile mom visited from out of state for a week at most once a year at best. Among other issues caused from the family dynamic, this led to classic ""nice guy"" behavior, I viewed my dad as an asshole (he is) and the women who kept being brought in my life never seemed to care for me. So in order to try and make friends I would be nice to everyone to try and make them like me, whenever someone didn't like me I got sad.  Eventually this extended to relationships attempts, I'd lose my individuality in an attempt to make them happy and like me; I'd get clingy, it's pretty bad. Stumbled upon porn at a young age, 12 or 13, yay website popups. It started off slow but it eventually built up, the more I realized women weren't sexually attracted to me, the more I'd PMO, the more clingy I'd get. I was at the point where I'd be PMO'ing 3+ times a day quite frequently. At 24 I feel ashamed of my past porn abuse, but the past will not define my future, it'll only help me grow.  Even last year this was an issue for me, my first attempt in years at a relationship, I ended up going out with a fairly attractive women for 2 months I get clingy she dumps me (which was good, she was a bitch lol). When we started dating I was on my first streak of trying not to watch porn or fap, the more worried I became about her not liking me, the more the urges came, eventually giving in at a I believe 17 day streak.  That plus a conversation I had with an ex who I'm still good friends with, who said she broke up with me because I was clingy (back in highschool mind you) made me realize that I had serious personal issues to get over before I bothered trying to worry about getting in a relationship. At some point in time I had decided trying to stop watching porn was pointless, and went back to it, the start of this month renewed me eliminating porn from my life.  I've smoked cigarettes, I drink, and I've never had issues with them becoming my vices. I always made the rule that NOTHING will ""control"" me. I wouldn't allow those 2 things to become my tool to mask my pain or issues and it was time I made that same rule for anything and everything, which means porn is standing in the way.   Yes I've had slip ups in the past 2 weeks of stopping watching porn (and temporarily MO as well, the two are far to closely interlinked for me atm). I've had a streak of a week, and am now at 4 complete days, finishing my 5th today, but I'm improving. I'll get curious about x websites update, but I resist.  Since realizing my insecurities and loneliness was holding me back, I've done everything I could to feel better about myself and feel comfortable with myself. I've lost weight, I've become more social, I exercise and eat better. I've learned more about myself and what makes me happy, so I don't need to rely on porn.  Actual response to you below instead of incoherent rambling about my issues lol  Growth can come at anytime, differences at any time. It's good you might have found your trigger, own it and defeat it now. Sorry to share my story which was even longer then yours, I just felt I could relate and started typing, it wasn't supposed to be this long lol."

I also have a serious problem of getting to clingy, I have never had a problem with people not liking me because very few people do. Every girl I have tried to date I get way to clingy and can sense its spiraling around the drain my clinginess gets worse and when they end it I go in a bad binge and get super depressed.

If you have some spare time and don't mind reading, two books that have helped me No More Mr. Nice Guy, Models.  No More Mr. Nice Guy, challenges you to change from ""Nice Guy"" habits, such as being nice to people to get something from them. It points many of those behaviors out, including how ""Nice Guys"" can tend to abuse porn. I haven't finished it yet but it was a real eye opener for me.  Models is sold more as a seduction/pick up book, but it's hugely self help. It encourages you to live a more self fulfilling life style and again, wants you to do things for yourself.

pornfree,3d959c,WomanAtALoss,18,Tue Jul 14 13:53:51 2015 UTC,"He has to quit on his own accord. He thinks it is a victimless crime.   I used to think that way too.   For me to quit.. There had to be plenty of pain. I think at his age, the way his life is. He is not feeling any pain from his porn use.. Yet.  It is hard to believe. But porn use does lead to pain. Which is something he may not understand yet. Just like alcohol or other real drugs. You numb yourself with porn..   When you quit.. The pain begins to bubble to the surface. At this point, he wants his porn. He thinks he is going to be watching it until he dies and it is going to keep him sedated and feeling the way he does now.   Most likely that will not be how it is going to be. .   If you stay with him. If you leave. The porn will most likely begin to cause him more and more problems and more and more pain.   But since every time when he watches porn he feels good momentarily, he probably can not see the long term pain that porn is causing you and no doubt him (he may not know it).   So he has a really good attachment to porn. He probably secretly wishes he could watch it with you and you guys could just f**k your way to happiness.   To me the eyeopening period in my life was when I gave myself permission to watch as much porn as I wanted and I began to realize that no, porn does not make me happy. Porn is not a key to a happy life.   He may harbor such a illusion. That if he could watch porn all the time. His life would be perfect. I think that is the reason why he is so angry at you. He sees you as a obstacle to his dream.   In a way he has fallen in love with porn. Yes. It happens. When you watch porn, small amounts of love hormone oxytocin are released just like if you were with another person. Once again he probably has no idea that it is happening..   Anyhow. When I quit. I noticed on the first week. I would always begin to get these violent feelings at my wife.. Thoughts popping to my head such as.. I should hit her..   I realized my sub conscious mind was pissed off at her. It was thinking she was keeping me from my mistress.. Porn..   That actually was eye opening experience and really made me want to quit porn. Because I realized that if it had got that deep under my skin, if it was manipulating my thoughts that much.. Did I really want to keep on watching it..   But again and again when I quit.. On week one.. I would get these feelings.. Then they would pass.. Week two I would go into flatline where my libido would die.. I was experiencing very real withdrawal symptoms. Insomnia, depression and fatigue..   Every time I quit.. It would happen.. When I allowed myself to watch porn.. I did not reach the hallowed happiness that I had thought porn would provide me with..   So I realized.. I really am addicted.. I was the one suffering most because of it. When I had insomnia due to it (first week I had it always really bad), my wife would sleep like a baby.. Damn.. I would be dead tired.. Quitting.. Lately.. I am moving back to 7 hours of sleep.. It is so damn nice.. And I realize.. It is because I do not watch porn..   There are real benefits to quitting porn. Improved over all mood, better sleep, no fights between me and my wife, lessened anxiety and so on.. I get these glimpses of innocence.. When I was on porn.. To feel temporarily better I had to watch hc porn or lust after every woman I saw.. Else I felt like crap..    I just prefer to be off porn.. He is thinking he will find happiness from it.. I do not think he ever will.. But he believes in that illusion.. A lot of men do.. I do not know.. Maybe you should let him watch all the porn he wants, see if he thinks that is the way to promised land.. Maybe not have too much sex with him while he does so..   Maybe at some point he will realize that it is you he wants.. Not porn.. It could take a while.. Sorry about your experiences.."

pornfree,3d959c,iBanana32GB,3,Wed Jul 15 13:41:18 2015 UTC,"He's an addict who isn't making any attempts to control his own behavior. You're the one trying to manage him and control his relapses, etc when in reality he is the only one who can really control and make permanent changes. You need to start taking steps to protect yourself. Installing filters and getting after him about it may come off to him as controlling.  I suggest going to see a therapist who specializes in these things. I'm a sex/porn addict as well. And trust me, the most permanent changes he will make will come from inside himself. You need to start working on your reaction to his addiction. What happens if he relapses again? Keeps lying about it? What steps will YOU take to protect yourself?  You need boundaries. These can be discussed and set up with a therapist as well. If he continues to lie right to your face, what will the end result be? In my opinion these boundaries need to center around you putting distance between you and him in an effort to end the relationship, IF he continues his usage. Because it's only further hurting you and going to destroy you two if it continues.   Sorry you're going through all this. Addiction is a sad thing to experience."
pornfree,3d959c,heres_one_for_ya,3,Tue Jul 14 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for your honest input. I had a talk with him for what felt like the hundredth time. But it will be the last. I told him as long as he doesn't want help, and as long as he doesn't see the porn use and the lusting after other women as infidelity, I will not go near him sexually. I let him know that I literally am afraid to. If this is okay to him, cheating is a close next step and I can't trust him.  I told him if he wants to earn back some trust and stay with me, he'll have to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist on his own and seek help on his own. I also cleared all filters and told him to browse to his hearts delight.   Honestly, I'm just preparing myself to help him pack his things so he can move back in with his parents or something. Sad to say, I don't have a lot of faith he will seek any help. I'll give him five weeks to approach me with his intent to change and if not, he's out. I've been reluctant to kick him out for financial reasons, but there are some things no amount of money can't cure and I want no part in any of them.  Side note: Thank you so much for your post TaterJoe. Even as I told him this he stared at me as if he wanted to hit me, and from your post I now understand how deep he is in this addiction because of that. We were watching a show together last night and he joked that a costume one of the women was wearing actually wasn't revealing enough. I was shocked. He's also admitted to looking at other women. It's a killer for my self esteem."

IMO, even if you love him, you shouldn't sacrifice your life or happiness. You're not yet married nor you have any children, therefore you have no obligations. Then you can show that letter to him and ask if he wants to change or not, does he want to be with you or the porn, because you don't want to end up like that woman.

pornfree,3d959c,andtheotherstars,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"It's a horrible situation, and one that unfortunately I know rather too well myself. I'll say from personal experience that the anger he expresses towards you is certainly deflected anger he feels at himself. That doesn't change the fact that it's hurtful to you, and it certainly doesn't justify it, but his short temper isn't necessarily a sign that he doesn't want to be helped. He's reacting, in a way, to a three way conflict between the restrictions that superficially come from you, the promised happiness of porn use, and the horrible disappointment that's the reality of porn. Maybe he won't say there's a problem, but he certainly feels that there is one.  Does he want help? I'm sure he does. He's shown significant willing in the way that he's confessed what he's doing to you, even if there have been periods of deception and he tries, superficially, to excuse his behaviour.   Advice 1: you two sound like a perfect candidate for couple therapy. Even if it's been going off the rails of late, there's evidently deep trust and openness between you. He'll do much better if he has you to work through things with him.  Advice 2: don't be a martyr, and don't go alone. And despite Advice 1, don't go in too strong for that odd trope of 'the love of a good woman...'. Like TateJoe says, he has to do it of his own accord. I think sometimes a second sub for partners of addicts might be a good idea; partners almost always get a very good response in here but I am sure there are emotions partners are suppressing in order to be kind to other addicts.  Advice 3: if your partner is a redditor, has he tried coming here? He'll probably get more out of it directly than via you. However, I do kind of feel that it has to be one or the other of you on here, unless you can do it without feeling like you're looking over each other's shoulders."

Everyone else has already provided good advice.  I'll just add that, as a guy who has struggled with this problem and has no excuses:  You have every right to see this behavior as cheating.  You are, and always will be, worth more.  You are not an object or just one body amongst many.  Don't let anyone treat you that way.  Have you considered seeing a counselor or therapist yourself?  Even though the problem is his, such things can hurt our loved ones.  His behavior can have a subconcious affect on your mental well being.  Asking for help and taking care of yourself even when he won't do the same is nothing to be ashamed of.  And lastly, if he really chooses to leave his girlfriend of 5 years move back in with his parents instead of getting over his porn problem...  Well, you will have dodged multiple bullets there."

His addiction to porn will permeate nearly every aspect of your marriage and his life.   If he won't seek treatment on his own, it's never going to stop.   You are far more valuable than a 2d image on a screen, his porn addiction will ruin your marriage. Whatever effects it has on you now will surely be multiplied after you say 'i do' and he continues to go back to porn after every fight, every time you're away for the night.   He needs to get better before you commit your life to him"

Just two observations - is 5 times a week a realistic goal for you? This is an honest question - if it is, then GREAT! But I know I couldn't bring myself to go to the gym 5 times a year ;) Secondly, running is brilliant fun and tremendous for the emotions (so don't pack it in) but it's a not very good way of losing weight. Some people thrive in the group context of Crossfit, but you might also want to consider something like kettlebells as well - it costs very little to get started, you can do it at home, and you can get serious results from a relatively low amount of time investment. I don't think anything can beat Tabata sets with kettlebells. Also something like Freeletics might be fun for you. Just something to consider if you find the time spent going too and from the gym counts against it.  Best of luck!"

Pay attention, this could backfire, please give your body a rest and maybe it is better to start with 3 times per week... When you have trained for a few weeks you can reduce the recovery time for your body and rise the times of sport per week (and the length of sport, too). Do sport like your body can bring the power and is in the mood, because the muscles and crave need time to grow..."

Basically go to a monk mode.   Surprisingly if you do that. You will stop objectifying.   Objectifying is a choice in the end. You choose to get these mini dopamine endorphin hits from looking at people. Just like stopping watching porn. You can choose to stop doing that. It helps with going pornfree a lot.

I went about a month and I just noticed it was actually more difficult not to see it around me. Is this the new status quo or was I just becoming ""resensitized""?   You chose option B, ""Take the Red Pill."" Welcome to the real world, Neo.   I'm sorry to say, retraining yourself to stop objectifying women is a completely different skillset from quitting porn. And it's tougher, now that you're seeing just how completely pornified our culture is.  Have you ever heard the saying, ""A fish knows nothing of the water""? Most people have NO IDEA just how sexually charged public spaces really are. And that's what you're currently experiencing.  My wife and I were out shopping recently, and when we got to the checkout stand, their cashier was wearing a top that showed a lot of cleavage.  Now, to that woman, she was wearing something perfectly appropriate, it was a work uniform, everyone dresses like that, it's normal.  But what she wasn't aware of was how uncomfortable it made other people.  Because it forces you into this conundrum. The social norm and the polite thing to do, is to not look. But even as someone who was avoiding looking, it was logistically difficult to do.  It's not her fault, she's completely clueless about this stuff like most folks are, but she was just wearing something that was sexualizing an interaction that otherwise should have been innocent.  If that's something you want to avoid, I suggest lowering your gaze and just looking away. Because really, what do you have to gain from it?  There's a time and a place to look sexy and to cruise and meet people. You don't need to attract attention ALL the time."

A relapse won't erase your progress when you get back on your feet and move on (remember not to give in to the chaser effect or binge).

And if you really need a release, just masturbate without porn. Try to not think about anything and just focus on the sensation, or, if your mind can't handle it at this early stage, try to fantasize about your partner or some girl/boy you've got a crush on, but keep the fantasies as real as possible, don't play porn in your head. Try to rewire your brain by separating masturbation (and in the long run: sex) from porn.  Raised libido is a side effect of porn addiction. It will become easier over time."

pornfree,3d7e5i,NonAddictButNoGood,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:39 2015 UTC,To me it just sounds like what guys go through when they get erectile dysfunction due to porn. You need porn to orgasm. You need to think about porn situations to orgasm. I hate to bust your bubble. But you might very well be addicted.  With guys the treatment is usually to just stay off porn.
pornfree,3d7e5i,TaterJoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:18:10 2015 UTC,This. I think you may need to quit porn completely so your brain can return to its normal state.
pornfree,3d7e5i,Arana91,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"The solution is actually fairly simple. You learned one way to go to orgasm, you need to find another way now. The nerves and the sensitivity do act like a forest, there needs to be a path and if there isn't any, then you need to make one. To do this, simply feel what you do. Have sex with your lover, and accept that you won't have orgasm at first, but be completely with him and with the sensation anyway, you will get more and more sensitive, your body will slowly open up to it, and then it will happen.  You've already reach the goal, so you know you can have an orgasm, now you just need more pathways, more way to do this. Be open to that new way, and try to avoid the old one.  Don't think there is only that one way to do it, it's a pitfall. But be patient with your body and don't focus on the orgasm itself, because that's another pitfall : when going somewhere, know where you go but you need to focus much more on the step you are right now. Sometimes, sensations comes and go, and when you feel a sensation of pleasure slowly fading, don't be mad or frustrated at your body or yourself."
pornfree,3d7e5i,Sebroy,2,Tue Jul 14 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"Cut out the porn now, you're not addicted but you sure are suffering from it.  It's going to take some time before you can orgasm without reverting to bringing up porn scenes in your mind. You've just conditioned yourself to it for too long.  But as long as you're not downloading any new porn into your brain, over time you'll be able to retrain yourself.  Also, remember that your brain is the biggest erogenous zone. There's absolutely nothing wrong with fantasizing. Arousal primarily occurs in the brain.  It's just separating your imagination from porn that's the tough thing to do."

I've read the term ""brain fog"" here before and that kind of seems correct. It may have clouded your vision for so long but suddenly goes away. It's like getting your first pair of glasses after years of nearsightedness during which you didn't even realize how bad your eyes really were. The changes you notice may be small, but they're incredible.  For me that was ...   I have less headaches, which is huge for me because I suffer from cluster migraines. I have more motivation to go to the gym more frequently, write short stories and novels and actually finish them, or do things I've been pushing off.  I am in a better mood in general and people notice that. Orgasms are so, so different. More intense, more satisfying, more intimate. They're not in the same ballpark. Even when you're just masturbating to sensation instead of porn it's like a whole fucking different game all of a sudden.   And that's only after two weeks in.

So it is hard to walk away from it without relapses. With me the first 3 years were constant relapses. Last year I got some long pornfree streaks under my belt, that helped a lot. You could say the porn thoughts began to fade from my mind. And this year it has been even easier. Even with some relapses..   The less you watch porn. The less you think about it. It is essential to stop fantasies too. But it can take a lot of time. So no reason to feel hopeless. Be understanding and kind towards yourself.   It is perfectly understandable to become a porn addict in todays society. But if you want to stop. You can stop. It just can take some time. Not everyone is built for quitting on the spot. Some are. Not all.."

Acknowledge their existence and let them be in your conscious, let them make you sad and angry. I realized when I suppress them they never go away eventually leading me a relapse, but when I let them be ""here"", and you should too because negative feelings are your feelings as much as your positive ones, they fade away in a couple of days. Treat them just like your positive feelings, don't your ""high"" feelings last for about a week at the longest? At least for me it is..

pornfree,3d3vtz,moododude,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:21 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd embrace that flatline. General consensus is that your sex drive will return with a vengeance, and then you have to struggle to fight the urges again. I often feel drawn to logging on to some of my old internet favourites, but having made the decision to never look at porn again it's not an option so I don't dwell on it.  As for lack of motivation, I find the difficult part is the initial ""get up off your a**e"" stage. Going for a run for example, is easy once I stand up and get my running gear on. But before I stand up it seems like a very daunting prospect. So I'd do some physical exercise, play guitar or something. Anything to kick start your mood.  Good luck :-)"

Some are ok with testing their limits and pushing their boundaries to explore their comfort zone.  To me, watching a docu about porn actress or industry in general won't do a thing (because to me, a docu is a film while porn is, well.. porn) while a bikini selfshot on Instagram when I'm browsing it home alone (or alone in a room) can be a huge trigger since I was a fan of amateur porn. Is that a reason I'll stop using Instagram (for a while)? No, but I do know there may be some risky images. What I want to do is to learn my brain that kinky photos to my masturbation are not what bells were to Pavlov's dogs. Or at least to find other ""bells"" that would make my ""dogs"" ""salivate"".

pornfree,3d3lv2,andtheotherstars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"So what's happening now is I'll occasionally expose myself to non video material, focus on not being aroused, and move on. As kind of an exposure therapy so triggers don't start coming back. If I feel compelled to keep exposing myself, I can turn it off and stop. I almost feel like it's running my finger down the blade of a knife to test if it's sharp when I should really just not stab myself with the knife. Any thoughts on this behavior and whether it's damaging vs risky? I haven't given in and had a full porn relapse in almost two months, but have done this exposure things probably ten times since then.   It's damaging because you're conditioning yourself to porn.  What's the goal here? To not be aroused by what you're looking at?  Let's say you do get to that point. What just happened is that you've conditioned yourself to artificial stimuli not being enough.  Porn's not the kind of thing where you can vaccinate against it by taking little drops of poison.  What you're doing is more like eating junk food, and trying to convince yourself, ""This doesn't taste good."" You can't beat biology.  You're going to be aroused by pornographic images, period. They're specifically engineered for that purpose."

I would treat the 90 day concept with some caution however. If your intent is to reboot, the time it takes varies from person to person. 90 days being a relatively short amount of time for people who have become heavily addicted to PMO. And if you have experienced PIED I'd say it indicates quite a strong attraction to porn.  It's good to see you experiencing some success and I hope you can find a romantic connection again.  Porn is the problem for most people in my opinion. Masturbation has been around as long as we have. But porn creates a vast amount of guilt free sexual encounters without any effort or risk. For me the only option is to simply push any porn out of the picture permanently.  I hope you find the strength to defeat your addiction :-)"
pornfree,3d2u59,dktestrun,3,Mon Jul 13 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"The best thing I can offer to you is how to respond if you have a slip up. Have grace with yourself. It's an incredibly difficult journey. Try to tell someone when you slip. Try to surround yourself with people who are in the same boat as you are, or at least someone you can be open and honest with when/if you make a mistake. Porn has an incredible hold on us, and it's even stronger when you're trying to go it alone. Bring it into the light and you'll feel tons of relief. You don't have to do this alone.  Moving forward, try to learn from each relapse. Evaluate your triggers. What makes you want to view porn the most? I've seen you do that with dead time and house to yourself. I'd encourage you to dive in further and search for more. If/when you do fail, try to ask yourself what made that so desirable in that moment. For me, it's often when I'm emotionally distressed. I want to medicate myself and not feel reality. I want to disengage with reality and overwhelm my pleasure sensors so I don't have to think about how hurt I am. The key is to lean in to the struggle. Pain is your teacher. Problems are the key to a new and better existence for you. You can do this. You're on the right track. Good luck to you."

pornfree,3d1bwf,GaryMcMuffin,20,Sun Jul 12 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but as a former sex worker I have to say you are passing a highly biased and moral judgement about something you know little about. If you care about sex workers you will make an effort to get over your own emotions, become informed, and begin thinking critically. Watching one documentary does not make you an expert by any means.  The porn industry does not exist in a vat. The major issues facing those in the porn industry stem from larger societal issues and can't be attributed solely to the porn industry. They come from a society that shames, murders, and attacks sex workers. The critical issues affecting sex workers permeate every industry, setting, and structure in our society -- you are noticing these issues in the sex industry (where it's easiest to see them) but fail to notice that the same issues exist in or even stem from typical workplaces/homes/schools/etc. For example, sex work is not something many job interviewers will accept on a resume even if the worker has displayed extraordinary drive/talent/creativity/intelligence in their career. In other cases, sex workers are pushed into unsafe working conditions by archaic laws (yes those same laws that ""prosecute the client, not the prostitute""). Worse yet, if something unsafe happens to a sex worker they often have no one to turn to: the police will arrest, humiliate, or ignore them and organizations with other sex workers (e.g., sex-worker run brothels) are often illegal due to misguided attempts at curbing pimps.  Sex workers notice how pervasive the issues are because they must continue to live like everybody else while they are systematically kept as second class citizens by those who label them and their industry/clients as 'degenerate'. If you saw how pervasive and prevalent the issues are, you'd realize the entire society is degenerate when it comes to sex worker rights, and the only way out is to empower sex workers to reform their industry.  Additionally, any attempts to stamp out sex industries have consistently been shown to fail miserably. The outcome is always the same: attempts to stigmatize, diminish, or pass moral judgements on sex industries only serve to stigmatize, murder, and pass moral judgements on sex workers. We have seen this happen, without fail, so many times that this isn't something even worth debating.  Sex industries don't implicitly ruin peoples lives any more than other industries. Sex industries have additional pressures applied to them that cause human rights issues. Similarly, there is nothing morally wrong with watching or participating in porn. The people here are addicted, but plenty of people are happy and capable with watching porn in moderation as is true for other substances and drugs like alcohol."
pornfree,3d1bwf,faplessmtl,9,Sun Jul 12 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think op had in mind the participants in the industry who are exploiting others for money in a dehumanizing way. I don't think he meant to level guilt evenly on those who can and those who can't give full consent."
pornfree,3d1bwf,pinechas,2,Mon Jul 13 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"What they did say, regardless of what they had in mind, shows a lack of information or understanding with regard to sex industries and sex work.    The Porn industry ruins lives and families and I hate them for it.   When I read this, it seems pretty clear to me that they hate the porn industry (and likely believe that it should be abolished). Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that this line of thinking not only fails at what it sets out to do, but leads to more violence levied at sex workers and more lives lost.  If they have issues with exploitation in the porn industry, that's a very different topic. Wanna talk about human trafficking? Sexual slavery? Great. All of us are against those issues and industries, but conflating them with the porn industry is like saying a person with no medical insurance is the same thing as the tumor they can't afford to have removed.  OP didn't make a distinction between the industry and exploitation, and I think it would be very hard for them to simply not mention something like that if they truly realized the difference between the industry and the problems of exploitation affecting the industry.   I don't think he meant to level guilt evenly on those who can and those who can't give full consent.   Not sure how to read this. Many sex workers are able to give full consent and choose sex work as a career. They've done nothing wrong, and surely neither have the sex workers who can't give full consent. Why would you level guilt at either of them?"
pornfree,3d1bwf,faplessmtl,3,Mon Jul 13 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Was going to reply to your first post but I figured I'd respond to this on to.  So for first post:  May I ask what your sex worker position was? Conditions seem to vary greatly depending on what your job was and the state you were working in.  Could you provide some examples of how issues evident in the porn industry are also visible/take place in other industries. It's hard to know what ""issues"" your referring too or even if they are legitament ""issues"" due to lack of detail.  Porn as ""nothing morally wrong with it"" activity is an incredibly subjective statement that would merit a entire separate thread for a multitude of issues. (Basic ones being defining a ""moral"" activity and by whose standard)  This is a trickey post because the OPs first post was lacking in depth or detail and your post is too vague to outright dismiss or engage in debate with. Onto the reply.  Reply: Given that the thread is in r/pornfree I assume it was a more shallow idea of ""Oh my gosh, I've indirectly contributed to this one horrible thing, Its made me feel awful and renewed my resolve to abstain from porn. And given the way the porn industry is portrayed in the documentary (and that it mainly concerns itself with exploitation), it'd be clear that he's generalizing. Which is neither a good nor bad thing without inserting ones bias and goals of the conversation.  The medical analogy doesn't really work given that both the porn and the sex trafficking industry are both industries and share traits that all industries have. Given that they're both in the ""bushiness"" of fulfilling sexual fantasies, they do share some overlap and influence each other in certain ways and under certain conditions.  I think I should also clarify that by calling OP shallow I don't mean it in a negative way, just that it lacks the depth due to it being an immediate emotional reaction and its point was to (no matter how poorly executed) state that the documentary strengthened the resolve to be porn free. The type of conversation you seem to be having is (while a deep and fascinating one) may not be appreciated/ be wasted on this thread.  To your last paragraph, I believe he is referring to moments in the actual documentary where women would show up on set to learn that the actual script included more violent/deprecating acts than they initially signed up for vs those who profit from those girls and prey on their nativity."

Conditions seem to vary greatly depending on what your job was and the state you were working in.   I am not answering that. I don't feel like disclosing any of that information here, and it's not germane to the issue at hand. Yes, specific conditions vary widely, but sex worker communities have more or less come to an international consensus (via internet communities) about the main issues they face an how they should be addressed based of longitudinal information about sex work legislation in various places and times around the globe. What I'm writing is all roughly in line with this consensus. Google is your friend, as is twitter.   Could you provide some examples of how issues evident in the porn industry are also visible/take place in other industries. It's hard to know what ""issues"" your referring too or even if they are legitament ""issues"" due to lack of detail.   My post was edited a while back to include more concrete examples. I was on my way out the door when I first posted so it was more vague than normal. I came back later and added more concrete examples.  To be clear, it's not difficult for you to google this. Look up information about the sex industry written from the perspectives of sex workers and sex worker advocates. You will find innumerable examples that go well beyond what I am willing or able to dig up for a reddit post.   Porn as ""nothing morally wrong with it"" activity is an incredibly subjective statement that would merit a entire separate thread for a multitude of issues. (Basic ones being defining a ""moral"" activity and by whose standard)   Don't be pedantic. Yes, clearly we could go into a never ending philosophical discussion about morality. The point is that having a moral opinion about porn is not evidence, nor does it constitute an ethical argument. Since it doesn't constitute an ethical argument, and seriously has no ethical implications, moral superiority shouldn't hold much weight or space in a rational discussion about an entire set of industries.   your post is too vague to outright dismiss or engage in debate with   I don't wish to debate this with you. Why is it assumed that if a person from a minority group posts a strong counter it means they want to debate with everyone who has an opinion? This is sex work 101 type information, it's not fun to debate. It's been debated to death and I am here making that information more widely known, not asking for opinions or soliciting debates. It's like debating with someone about how your first name is spelled: you might have done it when you were a toddler, but it would be quite annoying if, when you told someone how to spell your name, they launched into a debate with you about it.  If you would like to debate this, go look up the boatloads of information written by sex workers on these topic and debate with yourself about what they've written. My time is valuable, and I'm not getting much from this. It's very unlikely that you or other people will bring up points that I haven't already mulled over. I'm an intellectual and a former sex worker, it's not like I haven't thought about this extensively. Even if you're an intellectual, I doubt you would have such a fixation on it as I have had for years due to my lived experiences... it means that, even if you raise some good points I haven't considered, they're going to be like a needle in a haystack for me to find.  If you would like to debate, please go mull things over and reflect extensively for at least a few months (to filter out all the things that have already been written about/discussed to death elsewhere) and come back with what you think is still worth debating. I think that's more fair than asking me to sift through all the stuff I am bored of saying to people that they shouldn't need me to say (because google can say it for me).   Given that the thread is in r/pornfree I assume it was a more shallow idea of ""Oh my gosh, I've indirectly contributed to this one horrible thing, Its made me feel awful and renewed my resolve to abstain from porn. And given the way the porn industry is portrayed in the documentary (and that it mainly concerns itself with exploitation), it'd be clear that he's generalizing. Which is neither a good nor bad thing without inserting ones bias and goals of the conversation.   LOL That's not what OP said. OP said they hate the industry. Also, the generalization OP made was morally superior, which is a strong bias in a direction that has been shown to not work.   The medical analogy doesn't really work given that both the porn and the sex trafficking industry are both industries and share traits that all industries have.   Yes, they are distinct industries. Sex trafficking, however, attaches itself to other sex industries like a cancer and governments consistently enact policies that make no distinction between these industries either. Thus, the analogy.   The type of conversation you seem to be having is (while a deep and fascinating one) may not be appreciated/ be wasted on this thread.   Yep. I agree. I don't usually post stuff like this, but I saw the opportunity and decided to counter with a reply so that people know there are more well-thought-out perspectives out there if they decide to look into the topic properly.   I believe he is referring to moments in the actual documentary where women would show up on set to learn that the actual script included more violent/deprecating acts than they initially signed up for vs those who profit from those girls and prey on their nativity.   This was not what they said. The question is there to draw attention to assumptions they may not have not questioned properly yet based on the depth of their response.  Note: I replied to this one, since you took the time to write out a lengthy response to my comments. As I'm sure you will agree, there isn't a whole lot of point in continuing this plus I really don't feel like debating. Feel free to post whatever counterarguments you have just be aware that I won't be replying to them. It's past my bedtime. Ciao."
pornfree,3d1bwf,faplessmtl,3,Mon Jul 13 04:01:58 2015 UTC,Porn (as a subset of meaningless sex) is inherently dehumanizing.  That's why.
pornfree,3d1bwf,pinechas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"Not that long ago people said the same thing about gay sex. Ignorance and moral superiority are dehumanizing. You're also displaying both with that statement.  Who made you the ultimate moral compass to determine what is or isn't dehumanizing for other people? What you consider meaningless sex is someone else's career.  PS: As noted, the position you're arguing for has been shown all over the world to protect murderers, sex traffickers, and rapists while imposing unsafe working conditions on sex workers. Even operating under the assumption that porn is a subset of ""inherently dehumanizing"" ""meaningless sex"", it's hard to argue that the humane response is to rape, murder, and traffick sex workers in an attempt to prevent the sort of sex you disapprove of (especially since we already know it doesn't prevent the ""meaningless sex"" you look down upon)."

The best thing you can do is talk to real women and meet with them.   That said if you've gone 16 days on your badge keep on going. Instead of finding women on facebook to masturbate to, try talking to them and maybe land a date.   If you have PIED you are going to have to work hard and discipline yourself to not watch porn or porn related material. I don't think that working your way back to vanilla porn and then stopping is going to do it.   I think it may damage the process. My advice is to start dating real women and getting to know the real deal and find a new hobby. Keep yourself busy with something fun and interesting, it will make for good conversation on those dates you'll soon go on.  Good luck."
pornfree,3d2yhu,rammy32,4,Mon Jul 13 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is negative. When you masturbate to pretty girls that you don't know, you're only masturbating to what you see. Their physical appearance is the only thing that matters to you in that moment. You don't care about their feelings or their souls. You're still lusting after them, even if they're fully clothed. The idea that you can look for the prettiest girl or a better arousal from a different type of girl is still active in your behaviour, which is a major component of porn. This basically trains your brain not to be satisfied aesthetically by one woman. If you date someone, your brain will say, ""Sure, she's pretty, but what about other girls who are prettier or who are a different kind of pretty?"" It never satisfies.    I don't think this behaviour is okay, for all of the above reasons. I would suggest trying to masturbate without any lust or sexual thoughts of any kind. When you do masturbate, try to focus on how good it feels, and nothing else. I've found that helps me desire porn and sexy pictures less. When I do masturbate in the way that you do, to pretty girls faces, I find that it increases my desire for more explicit content. So, what you're doing is obviously much better than viewing pornography, but I think you can have much more success by eliminating it from your life. Good luck to you."
pornfree,3d2yhu,TurtleSmile1,2,Mon Jul 13 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"So everything that the other two people have said is totally correct; but here's a counter argument for the sake of thinking about it. Like you say, you're mediating your urge to 'fully' relapse by what is essentially a softer alternative. Is it fine? Well, it's not totally great for the reasons given (which you know full well, based on your OP). But will it prevent you from getting better? Probably not, though it will change the profile of your recovery very significantly. TurtleSmile1's comments are particularly worthwhile taking seriously - you're still feeding the desire for novelty and the self-centred sexuality that porn creates, but no-one would deny that it's better than a full-on porn binge.   I've done similar things at various stages of my recovery (draw the conclusions you wish about my success from my current badge...) and I'm not sure whether they help get me through rough patches or not. It's certainly very different for different people and you're going to make mistakes and learn from them along the way. In my opinion, it depends whether you are just starting out. If porn is still very fresh in your mind then a period of cold turkey would almost be better. Focus on the physical sensations of masturbation - in porn binges, these take second place to being able to last long enough to consume the maximum amount of novel stimulation, which (atmo) is the reason why it can lead to ED.  Short story - it won't wreck everything, but it probably won't help as much as you feel it might when you're jonesing for a binge.  Keep it up."
pornfree,3d2yhu,andtheotherstars,2,Mon Jul 13 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"I have had urges to relapse which is usually mediated by browsing subreddits such as /r/prettygirls or browsing Facebook for girls I find attractive. Sometimes I masturbate to either one and sometimes not. So my question is, is this fine? Or is this like cheating? Ultimately, I'm wondering if this behavior will prevent me from fixing my PIED and prevent myself from being able to control my masturbation.    I wrote about this before here.  What you're looking at isn't necessarily porn. But consider it pseudo-porn.  It still has the same effects on you that porn does. At the end of the day, you're still conditioning yourself to masturbate to digital images and artificial stimulation.  The question isn't just, ""Is this porn?"" But more importantly, ""Is this going to lead to PIED?"" And the answer is yes, that behaviour falls into middle circle to inner circle behaviour.  Masturbate freely, but separate that from looking at (and conditioning yourself to) artificial stimuli."

And you took moral inventory of your actions and saw them for what they were. That's something big. I did not reflect upon that when I was acting a child and watching and doing those actions that I hurt my partner with when I let myself act out and feed the addiction.  Addiction is the ID, it's the childish desire to have that good feeling now. I've been trying to see it as the addiction is like raising the child inside you. If you teach it you will spoil it, it will act spoiled. If you teach it that it will get what it wants, it  will demand it. We have let our children act spoiled and entitled for far too long and it has to stop.   Don't be depressed that you have to restart, because you went 163 days without using.

I really like what you have to say about the self-loathing, especially how these feelings remain even when you abstained from porn for a significant period of time. This has really thrown me off a couple of times. I had the foolhardy expectation that if I stopped using porn, these self-image problems would disappear. When this expectation was not fulfilled, of course I relapsed. I too will start to accept myself as I am, and be confident in that person. Good luck to you!"

I also read the book, marathoned it, by an author who said that you need to tell yourself as part of your mantra ""I will never use p to m now"". He didn't use p and m, he used the actual terms, but you know what I mean. That the addictive part of the brain that we have trained ourselves to allow ourselves to be so powerless for so long only cares about the now, it hates you and everything it cares for and only wants what it wants now not thinking of consequence."

pornfree,3d17jz,macked-out,2,Mon Jul 13 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"Any tips on how to get rid of the disgust caused by porn/erotic materials?   Good question. The answer is that you don't.  When I was masturbating 7 times a day on average, I would feel sick, guilty, and so dirty after every single time. I would ejaculate, feel empty, and then try to have another orgasm just to ""get rid of it"".  It never worked.  I used to take really long super-hot showers just to try to wash off the dirtiness I felt. But no matter how long I showered, or how hot the water was, it was never enough.  I've learned from a wonderful horsewoman, Linda Kohanov, something very useful when it comes to emotions.  Emotions are messages. Feeling are your body's way of communicating to you.  LISTEN.  Don't ignore the message. Don't just try to wash it of. Don't avoid emotions.  Listen to what they're trying to tell you.  What's a message like disgust trying to say to you?  It's trying to tell you to stop.  Disgust is a message that you're not being congruent with your ideals. That you're doing something which goes against your beliefs.  When you feel disgusted, you know that what you're doing is wrong. It's a core   It's a very powerful emotion, isn't it?  Take that negative pressure, and apply it as leverage next time you're tempted to relapse.  Use it to stop.  You can't control how you feel anymore than you can change the weather. You don't choose to feel happy, sad, or afraid.  But you can use it to show you what to do next."

pornfree,3d1utt,NostradamusDallaire,2,Sun Jul 12 21:06:41 2015 UTC,"That's great news (besides possibly the exhaustion part)!  My experience is similar - when there's a lot of dead time and I end up aimlessly wasting time on the computer, it offers a easy opportunity to PMO.  I've kept myself a bit busier this past week and generally avoided having more empty time as part of my strategy for this.  The other part is that when I do have dead time to fill and end up online, I have been trying to make a habit out of visiting this site, Your Brain on Porn, reading Free Left Hand emails, and re-reading my own goal writing to help bolster me up before I go a-surfing."

pornfree,3d07k9,volcano-diver,2,Sun Jul 12 11:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think stories such as yours should be talked about out in the open. So that kids would learn the power of porn. How it can suck your life into it.   If we just pussyfoot around about how ""porn is great"" and ""it is good for you"". We are going to end up with generations of men who miss their families growing up, opportunities to fulfill dreams and so on only because porn fills their every need in the world.   Porn really makes you manipulate yourself and the people around you. Just so that it can happen. It is like a bad seed. Once you let it grow inside of you. It just grows and grows.. Until something happens like what happened to you..   To me it was anxiety disorder that finally made me begin quitting. In a way I count myself lucky, because porn suddenly no longer worked for me. I can not imagine how my habit would have progressed had I not got the anxiety disorder..   I do find that what works best is to leave behind all fantasies. Have a weekly fap or sex and not go much beyond that. In a way the truth is. Porn destroys our sexuality. What was supposed to be beautiful and between two people who are in love. Is turned into  constant lusting which becomes the center of our daily lives.   But thankfully it is possible to stop lusting all the time. Thankfully in the end of the day we still have a free will. If we want to quit. We can quit. It is just that something must happen which makes us want to quit.   Good luck."

He himself has been addicted for awhile and it without a doubt negatively effects the family. The computers would always mysteriously break and I've spend hours wiping them and trying to fix them over the last decade and change. When I put a filter on his pc he instructed me to take it off. If the power goes out or the pc is incapacitated he gets mean and angry. Which I just laugh at tell him to cool his jets however it upsets my mother. We used to do more stuff but now dragging him off the computer is almost sinful. My brother got married the other day and he kept nagging my mom to go home when we leaving etc. It helps motivate me in my journey though bc I don't wanna be like that ya know. I'm not saying that your like that just kinda throwing in my 2 cents I guess as a child of (and currently am myself) a porn addict.  This post for you is good progress we will be here good luck.

pornfree,3d1aw9,TheFirstStepofMany,2,Sun Jul 12 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"I watched the Ted Talk, finally, about cold showers - and I want to try to take this on. Not every day, but enough times that I become comfortable without feeling uncomfortable.   I can´t shower cold, because I would refuse generally to shower, if my brain/body knows that there is just cold water. Therefore I shower first with warm water and make it slowly cold. Maybe it could work for you...   yesterday seeing images of p in my mind.   Hmm... Sometimes, it is a kind of, that I want to relapse. There is the urge and a desire like just to throw off my clothes, start to watch porn and jerking off. When I am in this mood, I talk to myself in the mind and start to make pushups(20 in one set), when the urge doesn´t stop. Maybe it helps you to come over the pictures/videos in your mind?   It's only been 10 days and I am worried but tomorrow will be day 11 and that's my personal goal for today. And tomorrow my personal goal will be day 12.   That is the right attitude. One day after another! Don´t be worried, be persistent. In worst case count the hours and flee from the temptations(, jogging, pushups, going for a walk, shutting down electronics and close your eyes, count to 30 and control your breath)... Keep your head up. I hope the best for you, your partner and your relationship. It is worth fighting for it and you are acutally doing it. In longterm, I hope that one day in the future your partner and you can be proud of the fight and of yourself. (Because, if you will go through this subreddit, you will find some posts from women, where the relationships has been broken because of porn, unreasonableness and so on.)

pornfree,3cycx0,whyamisofuckingstupi,10,Sat Jul 11 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"People say that your twenties is the best years of your life, well I wouldn't know because I threw them out the fucking window.   It's not really true though. Some people are pretty mature. I was still a kid at 20 something. People still grow up emotionally well in their 30s, 40's and some never quite grow up.  If I knew everything I know now (at 40), my life at 20 would have been very different. Except you can't go back. Life is exactly as it was meant to happen due to all kind of conditions. One good thing philosophy brought me is to no longer regret anything (looking into cause and effect).  But right now you can steer your life in a more healthy directon. At 30 you have a life ahead of yourself still. Heck, even Napoleon Hill said some of the most succesful men really started to shine in their 40's.  I am not a therapist but after looking at my own psyche one thing I have learned is to achieve one thing at a time. If the excess masturbation is what bothers you most, and likely is what affects you the most, then focus on that and just try to keep the weed and other things in check.  In my life I have never been able to radically change 2 things at once. Your psyche needs a compensation mechanism, an outlet of some sort. Give it relief in one direction, while you improve another.  Masturbation is not inherently bad. I would say try to masturbate with less frequency, and focus on being pornfree instead, that shoudl be achievable... after all you didn't need the porn until 13 right? Going pornfree definitely helps with excess masturbation. It takes time though which is why you should be patient with yourself. Just go for increasingly longer streaks. As I said here before, it's not a linear thing! Don't lose hope because once you get to a month you'll find it increasingly easier, simply because your brain also changes.  If you can hold a job, it's probably a good idea to see a therapist once a week or so. If that's not an option I would heartily recommend something like a yoga class. It puts you back into your body, relieves anxiety, and is very soft and gradual kind of therapy.   I quickly lost interest in girls. I had no desire whatsoever to get to know them and the relationships that I did have rarely lasted longer than a couple of months.   I watched porn between like 20 to 40 (now). Didn't have the stamina to fap everyday ;)  but it was nevertheless a regular presence in my life. I think there you hit the nail on the head.  Sadly I found this to be the case myself. I always attributed it to ""anxiety"" and somehow expected that ""when anxiety is healed"" things would change. Now I grew up with all kind of emotionally starved, and otherwise imbalanced people around me. I've been pretty much emotionally starved as a child as well, which causes a certain character type (very well explained in Stephen Johnson's ""CHaracter Styles"" book).  And yet.. now after going for longer pornfree streaks I can not deny that anxiety is lower or almost disappeared at times.  But most importantly as you point out, I find I am paying attention to women around me.  In fact desire is a powerful thing and can help you surmount your fears, so it's really hard for me to say how life could have been different.  Would I be in a relationship now? Probably. A year ago I had a pretty young woman pretty much served on a plate and I turned down the opportunity on the phone (had to meet her at a train station, repair her internet.. for the second time..). I had come to a point where I convinced myself that I was ""happy enough"" with my single life. 'Better be single than badly accompanied"" goes the saying right? Reading spiritual and philosophy books doesn't help since you tend to interpret everything so it fits your current paradigm.  The thing is the mind really is just a reflection of the life experiences and environment. Essentially I think the damage done by drugs including porn is that you become disconnected  from your body and emotions and all kind of trauma that needs resolving. And so you don't emotionally grow up and become trapped in some kind of self-referential paradigm.  If talking to someone isn't an option, I found those breathing exercises very helpful to release all kind of tensions in the body. I think it was instrumental for me reaching 6 months. YMMV.  Good luck. I'm sure you can heal within a few years. Slow and steady wins the race."

The last thing you should do is beat yourself up about it.   6 days is good. Just make that go a little longer. Try to get that first month stretch.. I think it took me almost 3 years to get to month.   Programmers say garbage in. Garbage out.. Your mind is full of porn. But the less you watch it. The more you forget about it. It is essential to be actively stopping. Not binging after relapse. Yet being compassionate at yourself. Do not hate your genitals. Do not hate yourself!

Saying you don't care about relationships (love) being ruined or that children like myself and many others are too young to be exposed to this adult content is sickening. Yeah I get their part. But I understand all of it. Equally... ya know bc that's the goal.

Ruins relationships. Gets men addicted. Shows kids sex too young. Turns sex bland. I care that it is VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN and that that alone IS NOT REASON ENOUGH to get people to question it.""   The last sentence is for the feminism the point, where the cat bites its own tail. There are a kind of 2 options: 1.) Porn is violance against women and it should be banned/regulated/etc. OR 2.) female sex workers live an independent life and sexuality and don´t let themselve be judged/concentrated by other living forms...

I have made a point to bike to where I need to go rather than drive, if it is possible. It really wipes me out and at the end of the day I can barely stay awake.

pornfree,3czd9p,mymoonx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"It sort of depends where your problem is. Nofap is for masturbation problems (whether porn is (and usually is) involved or not), pornfree is for problems resulted by watching porn (whether masturbation is (and usually it is) included or not).  So, it really comes down to where your main problem is. For example, I don't have problem with masturbation (nor do I use it excessively) but since I used to collect a lot of porn and generally spend way too much time around it when I was supposed to do more important things, I consider this sub as my home. On the other hand, some other user may see their problem in masturbating 10 times a day (whether it's to porn, Oprah Show, Home Improvement magazines or just using their imagination) and may find more help on Nofap.  It also comes down to what you believe. I, for example, believe the pipes should be emptied at least once a week* (for maintenance reasons) while others believe no-masturbation is the way of life for them.  And remember: if it's on your screen or in your magazine and you fap to it, it's porn. Good luck.  *- without porn, that is."

As an escape of this situation I focus on wiping the folders I am currently ok with to go.  But you know what really bothers me?

There isn't a specific amount of days that you have to achieve in order to recover. We simply dont know. Too many variables come into place.   I recommend that you install an app called Qustodio. This app is free and is available for android/ios/pc. You can block specific sites, allow access to sites that you visit frequently. Not only that but you can also control the amount of hours you have access to your computer and the internet. The best feature is that you can't uninstall it without knowing the password. So if you have any friends/family members that you trust. Give it to them or simply delete the password (type in a random password).   We are here to recover, not to abstain. Start making small steps towards your dreams. These actions don't have to be big or anything. You can simply take one step at a time.   We are all in it for the long run. Start today."

pornfree,3cuhlo,TheFirstStepofMany,4,Fri Jul 10 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in SA (Sexaholics Anonymous), which is similar to SAA. Both fellowships follow the AA model, but have some subtle differences. Congratulations, this is a big step. I won't dwell on the differences between SAA and SA, which are insignificant. They have much more in common.   12-step fellowships are not ""religious,"" per se, they are ""spiritual."" There is a big difference. ""Religious"" would require that members acknowledge a specific God, or perhaps even a specific religion. To do the 12 steps requires acknowledging a power higher than ourselves. This can be the God of one's own faith, or it can be multiple gods, or it can just be the fellowship. (I don't think that it is a stretch for an atheist or an agnostic to say that his SA fellowship is higher than him.) Spirituality itself, as it's defined by 12-step fellowships isn't really belief in God, but rather an attitude of understanding that there is a power higher than ourselves. In recovery, many 12-steppers reject the ""religion"" that they were brought up with, and accept upon themselves a higher power that they now feel they can believe in.  That said, for me, success in SA requires (1) working the steps, (2) going to meetings, and (3) receiving and giving sponsorship. For a long time, I participated in SA, still thinking that I could find better ways to do things, or shortcuts that would keep me sober. For example, for a long time I didn't have a sponsor, and I figured I didn't need to have a sponsor in order to stay sober. That worked for a while, perhaps, but not long-term. Only by doing the whole program was I able to build up strong recovery.  Good luck, friend."
pornfree,3cuhlo,effiebies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"I don't even know where to begin. I've told my partner everything last week. Everything. But for some reason I've blocked things out of my mind, didn't think about it didn't remember it, something. And then I told her yesterday since she told me to tell her everything. It hurt her a lot.   I've admitted I have an addiction, I've admitted that I was powerless to control it and my behaviour. I've told her and admitted to her my failings, my terrible actions, and I feel guilty and afraid.  I don't know when the steps are taken officially. I've gone to two meetings so far and I'd like to go to their online chats for their meetings when I am unable to make it in person. Two people reached out to talk to me and said I needed someone to talk to I could reach them. I took down their numbers but haven't contacted them yet. I've largely been going to help forums and talking to my partner.   I just hate how ghosts of my past keeps coming up and hurt her. We talked for nearly 10 hours yesterday about this, about what I've done, and about how she feels so terrible about herself and her self esteem. We went between fighting, and calming. She was ready to leave me saying I blew my second chance, I blew it. And it scared me. We kept talking we kept trying to work it out.   I told her that anything that comes up will be on the past, that I will talk to her or come to a subreddit if I act out. We laid down specific groundwork for our relationship to continue. That if, for whatever reason there's more that I blocked out, which I don't think she fully believes, to talk to her and bring it up right away. I just feel like  such a freak for blocking things out. Like my brain doesn't want to fully admit my actions.   I'll have to focus on sponsorship more, since I've been looking at the steps, identified outer, inner, and acting out circle behaviours. Thank you for your perspective of the fellowship being that higher power. I've been trying to think of it, how I can accept it, how I can be held accountable to a higher power, and have something that I am held to be accountable to so my warped moral compass isn't creating any lapse in judgment.   It was a really hard day on us, a very hard day, and I'm feeling it today inside me. It feels so tight in my chest and I feel like I will not be able to focus on work. I reached out to her last night after she felt terrible and I talked to her, yelled at her, pulled her from her shell because she's like me. She finds unhealthy ways to cope with it. For me it was my actions I think - I don't know entirely what or where inside me lead to my pornographic addiction. That I had to see nudity all the time. But for her it's that she shuts down and lashes out at people. And I had to talk through to her when I could. I don't think I have ever yelled at her in my life. But I didn't want her to keep telling herself I don't care about her and go to bed so upset, angry, alone, rejected, and upset and thought it was the only way to reach out to her. I apologized afterwards and tenderly talked to her until we both fell asleep."

If I were you, I would get more support from the program before you make any promises or attempts to reconcile with your girlfriend. Once you're in a fellowship, you're not alone anymore. Get to more meetings, and get a sponsor, even if it's temporary, who can give you guidance on how to handle your girlfriend. A lot of other people have been through this before you, and from their own experience, they can help you through it.

pornfree,3ctuho,wheresmydopamine,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"So, just a quick response based on the video.  I see where he's coming from and what he's addressing. If you're going to watch this, you have to understand that he's presenting to an atheism conference, and that's his audience.   He's addressing sex addiction as a myth in the context that religion uses it as a scapegoat for sexual behaviour. Which he's right about. And the way that they use sex addiction, like he points out, does lead to guilt, and trap the ""addict"" in a frame of helplessness.  So he's right about the failures of the sex addiction model and its treatments:  * Abstinence only doesn't work.  * The moral judgments don't help anyone * There are poorly defined diagnostic criteria (not that this is impressive. The DSM isn't reliable. It removed narcissistic personality disorder, because too many people fit the bill! If that's not a statement on our culture, I don't know what is.) * And it is culturally and religiously biased.  What he doesn't understand and present in the video, is that there are negative consequences to porn use, as we here at pornfree know all too well.  And you don't have to be an addict to suffer from the negative effects of porn. And these effects have nothing to do with guilt.  Porn use leads to:   A distorted view of sex and unrealistic expectations Conditions men to rely on extreme stimuli ...which leads to difficulty maintaining erections or inability to orgasm without porn   etc. etc.   Does that make sense? It's a good question to ask, as he does bring up valid points, but understand the audience he's addressing and the context he's speaking in.  Addiction or not, porn use is harmful and has latent negative effects."
pornfree,3ctuho,free_lefthand,2,Sat Jul 11 17:51:19 2015 UTC,I agree with your analysis. As an atheist who was raised as a Christian I agree with his points of the shame and guilt trape religion puts on sex and porn. This does indeed not mean there are no negative consequencesof porn use.
pornfree,3ctuho,free_lefthand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad you got something out of that. I saw your post yesterday and meant to respond then but got too busy.  I think that many of us come from a religious background and the guilt and shame that infuses into sex and porn is a major obstacle to seeing through things clearly.  From the religious upbringing, we learn nothing about sex -- it's treated like a black box. So we get our sex education primarily from porn, and end up with this skewed understanding and unrealistic expectations for our sexuality."
pornfree,3ctuho,DDave1239,2,Sat Jul 11 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"I watched it for 15min and imho it is bullshit. And here are the reasons: 1.) The last thing I saw, was the question with the survey and sex addiction. Those surveys are in general bullshit and not meaningful and to generate from such a survey, that there are so many sex addicts in the room is bullshit. (A survey like that can be an indicator and can sensitize you not more, not less). 2.) An other big point is, you have to difference between porn addicts and sex addicts. I think it is a big mistake to throw both in one pot. 3.) I have been educated after christians values, attended church to the end of my youth and since I´m am 22 years old, I have been leaving church, my religion/believe/faith. I also changed a few times the church. No christian church told me, that ""Sex is bad""(, which he insinuate/assume in the Australian Broadcast-part).  (If a church tells anyone, that ""Sex is bad"", then you should ask for the passage in the bible, where the sentence ""Sex is bad"" bases on. After that you should inform yourself in the internet about the scripture and you will find enough passage in the bible, that sex is good and then confront these guys, who are talking this shit.) The only thing about sex, what church told me, was, that I shouldn´t have sex before marriage. The church told me, that I SHOULD NOT have sex before marriage. (I still can have it, but I shouldn´t, because ""not everything, what I do/can do, is good/the best for me"". This passage is from the roman letter, if I am not wrong.) 4.) He want to convey a message (, that church is bad and that the church say that you have to feel bad about sex and porn, but if you aren´t religious and separate yourself from church then you won´t have any problems anymore, because then sex is normal and porn is healthy). First of all, I don´t like church-bashing. In this time it is normal to bash the church, but it isn´t okay to criticize islam or you are islamophobic. I know, that churches very often do wrong things and make wrong decisions and for this, they have to be criticized, but in this topic, he construct something, which isn´t a problem of the church. Second thing is, if you see, how many guys are struggling with that topic (, whether they have a medical diagnosis of porn or/and sex addiction or not), then it is a mistake to tell, that all this stuff is church-related. Look at reddit, there is pornfree with ~22.000 members; NoFap with ~160.000 members and there is NoFapChristians with 8.500 members. If porn addiction is a problem, which is made up from the church, why has NoFap 20x so much members more than NoFapChristians? Because the christians should be the ""persons with guilty"", I mean, they aren´t allowed/shouldn´t have sex before marriage, they shouldn´t watch porn, they shouldn´t masturbate, and so on. For all the Non-Christians it is normal to have sex, to watch porn, to masturbate. It is a kind of, if you don´t do it, there is something wrong with you. What you don´t watch porn? You don´t masturbate?, do you have any problems with your sexuality? You are 27 and are a virgin?  TL;DR: imho it is bullshit, just look at the socialization of the people, porn, masturbation, sex is normal and common in the society. Therefore you can´t argue with guilt, because christians should have guilt, but the NoFapChristian-reddit is 20x times smaller than the NoFap-reddit."

When we started viewing porn it was usually pretty normal, with naked women often doing the trick for us. However, the thing about the arousal template is that it's amoebic in nature, meaning that it changes depending on what you feed it. So, in your hyper-aroused state, if you search out stuff you normally would have found disgusting, it can offer a bigger thrill. Your pornographic interests are re-adjusting back to their intended ways. That's great news. I'm happy for you.    But please, in the future, don't post anymore clickbait. Your title is misleading.

pornfree,3cr0iu,forgiveangel,3,Fri Jul 10 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think you have to trust him. He admitted his addiction to you, and I think he knows when to admit things to you. For example, he might feel ashamed when he relapses, or might not want to make a big deal about it. But if, for example, he got really bad and was relapsing all the time, I think it sounds like he'd tell you.  Relapses are pretty harmless. I mean, not really, but when you allow yourself to get back on the horse and try again, they don't do too much damage usually, because you're in the right frame of mind to accept it, move on, and keep fighting the addiction. So I think he wants to avoid making it a big deal, and maybe even he wants to try to do it mostly alone.   I get why you want him to open up to you, but I don't think you should resort to snooping. I think trying to have calm discussion in a nice, calm environment, would help you both. Discuss how you sometimes feel like you need to check up on him, discuss how you'd like him to try to open up more when he relapses, discuss how he feels about it, allow him to express his opinions on those things, etc. Communication's important. You don't necessarily have to tell your SO every little detail, but communicating to give each person an opportunity to express their concerns and suggestions can allow you both to come to a compromise or a solution and better understand each other. But similarly to how you want him to tell you he's relapsed, he would probably rather you told him how you feel rather than snooping."

pornfree,3cr0iu,getinthecagewithnicc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"I've written about this before here, but there two very important things you should know specific to your situation.   He struggles and still would lie to protect himself. In the end I had to go through his phone a lot to see if he would actually try... It bothered him when I found some thing. You know, relapsing. Relapsing is normal but I just wanted to know when he would relapse to tell me. So I at least know he is recovering.... He rarely did so that explained my snooping   Your question is should you check/snoop on your husband.  And the answer is no. Never. Nothing justifies snooping.  Because when you do that, you're TEACHING HIM THAT HE HAS TO HIDE THINGS BETTER.  You're socializing him to be better at lying and hiding things from you.  You have to trust each other if this relationship is going to work. That's what any good relationship is built on.  By snooping through his phone, you're teaching him that you don't trust him, and in response, he's going to feel like he can't trust you.  If you're going to snoop, you might as well break it off, because that's what that snooping leads to.   What do you gain by snooping? It just confirms your suspicions, which tells you not to trust him. And if you don't find anything? It doesn't prove that he's not using, and you still suspect he does.  Do you see what a trap that behaviour is? It doesn't lead to anything good. It's bad boundaries. You're mothering him. It makes you seem like a controlling bitch, and it makes him feel like a little kid who has to hide his porn from mommy.   Are you familiar with self-concealement? It's why men lie to their spouses about their porn use.  Men feel guilty and ashamed about using porn, and so they hide it. This leads to their partners feeling disconnected and distrustful (rightfully so). But that disconnect and lack of trust between you two, further contributes to him using porn. And so begins this downward spiral.  That's what you want to avoid when dealing with your husband's porn use.   Here's what DOES work.  Make it uncomfortable to watch porn in private. If he's going to watch porn and masturbate, he should do it in front of you. None of this ""in secret"" bullshit.   The whole hiding your porn use and lying about it? That's not the way a man acts with his wife. That's little boy behaviour.  It's what a kid learns from his mom when he's 12 years old. ""Gotta hide my porn from mommy or she'll take it away.""  So when he does that, he's treating you like he does his mom. Don't let him do that.  At the end of the day, if he doesn't want to quit porn, there's nothing you can do to make him stop.  But if he does want to stop, he might not be able to on his own. His brain and habits are working against him. You've got to shake things up by doing something different; what you're doing right now isn't working.  Make masturbating and using porn in private uncomfortable. And make him feel comfortable to do it in the open, and that it's okay to share that act with you.  No one teaches men that. We make masturbation this criminal act you've got to hide from your partner. And because men get introduced to porn at such a young age, he can't help but do it in secret and hide it from you, because the two are synonymous in his mind.  Sometimes, men just have to masturbate. It has nothing to do with you, or even being aroused, or even porn. Mammals do it all the time.  it's just that, culturally, porn and masturbation are inseparable -- show him otherwise  My $0.02 as someone who's been on the other side of this equation."

pornfree,3cpiua,NateJagger,9,Thu Jul 9 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"I would think that the reality is that the truth about addiction lies somewhere between the perspective he raises about needing healthy bonds and the current view of it that addiction causes dysfunction and treating the addiction is needed to treat the dysfunction.   First of all, he supports his theory by claiming patients on heroin medication doesn't become addicted. However it is widely known that the risk of addiction from chronic pain treatment with opiates is real. NIH cites a 3-40% figure.. While the ambiguity of in those numbers shows that it's possible that it's not addictive, it wouldn't warrant the firm statement from the talk that it's not addictive at all. I mean, drug tolerance and withdrawal is a real and well known phenomenon that doesn't all of the sudden become irrelevant because a couple of addicts recovered after being given jobs. Furthermore, in citing the 50% recovery figure of people given jobs, he doesn't provide any numbers on the control group. A number is useless without a control group to compare it to.    Furthermore, his view of addiction would have some questionable interpretations as well.  Let's consider the case of the married husband with kids who has a porn addiction. The current lens to view it as is that porn destroys families. But going by the talk, the family was already destroyed and he was using porn as a way of coping with it. Porn is more rewarding than having a healthy relationship with the family. That would suggest that he would need to fix the relationships he has with his family and the porn addiction would go away rather than fixing his addiction to fix his relationships with his family. If you consider the Coolidge Effect where the desensitization to porn results in the chasing of novelty, that itself demonstrates that porn damages healthy sexual relationships. So it makes more sense to fix the porn addiction to fix the relationship than the other way around.   But what about the porn addicts who are single? They may reason they are a porn addict due to not having a girlfriend and once they have a girlfriend, the addiction would stop. But really, we all know how well that works right?  On the other hand, it's well known that quitting the porn addiction first can bring many benefits in energy, motivation, and confidence that can help with bonding with a mate.   On the flip side of the coin in support of the talk, I could definitely see how being lonely with no goals can lead to porn addiction. If you're out having fun, hanging out with friends, or engaged in some activity, there likely wouldn't be an urge to watch porn.    So I could definitely see truth in his view on addiction but it seems like a stretch to outright say that the current views on addiction is plain wrong."
pornfree,3cpiua,dopadelic,3,Fri Jul 10 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I agree with what you said. As an ex-smoker, the headaches I got from withdrawal were very real and their cause wasn't my lack of social life.  What his findings help is to find a more effective way to reform the way we think of addiction - until now people were separating behavioral addiction with chemical addiction in order to figure out a plan to attack them. This is wrong. Both behavioral and chemical addictions must use the social route as the main route, but chemical addictions have an extra factor to consider.  It's why I try to approach random girls I like in the street to get out of my shell instead of being content with imagining myself having sex.  It's why I'd rather to go out with friends having fun instead of sitting yet another night inside farming gear in an MMORPG.  And yet I still slip and watch porn, and I still slip and play games. Because I confuse cause and effect. It's not my habit of playing games that caused me to have no social life. It's my lack of social life that caused me to play video games. Same goes with porn. The true treatment for my case would be to dare get friends I have fun doing activities (gym, play basket) and approach girls I find hot to get a girlfriend and a healthy sense of sexual life. It's true that you can say ""porn made me complacent enough to not attempt to flirt as often"" but my cause of inaction (avoid flirting) isn't porn: Is my lack of confidence that stems from undesired results from past experiences.  At least that's for me, I can't say that it works the same with everyone."

On the other hand, it's well known that quitting the porn addiction first can bring many benefits in energy, motivation, and confidence that can help with bonding with a mate.   Maybe I didn't understand the talk right, but I think he never said that the effects of drug abuse aren't real. Of course, if you pump your veins full of heroin, your body will show some reaction to the chemicals, just as a brain pumped full of porn will have a reaction on someone's sex life (PIED, DE, etc.). He just said, that withdrawal effects are to some extent a result of the environment, as well as the first introduction to the drug.  Let's look at this from the other side for a second. Why does someone become a porn addict? I can't speak for anyone else, but I guess I can speak for myself. I did it because I was bored and because I had too much time to spend on it. I might be completely wrong here, but if I imagine myself fifteen years ago with a large group of friends who I would go out with every day, maybe a girlfriend who excited me, I don't think I would have sunk hours per day into looking at porn. And then maybe the addiction wouldn't have been so severe. If my first sexual experience was with a real girl instead of pixels on a screen ... well, I don't know, but I just suppose I would be in a different position now. This is kind of the rat cage Johann is talking about, and it doesn't sound too alien to me.  The same is true for the withdrawal effects and I can actually see this every day now that I'm going pornfree. When I'm out with friends having fun, I don't feel anxiety or anything. When I'm working out at the gym, the adrenaline rushes I get are completely different. However, when I'm siting at home, I feel them. It's weird, but this talk kind of offers an explanation for that which I at least would like to believe.  It's an interesting concept, but as long as there aren't any peer-reviewed studies, we can't be sure.  By the way, I took a look at some of the other people Johann mentioned and in the abstract of Dr. Gabor Mate's (mentioned around 8:15 in the talk) book ""In the Real of Hungry Ghosts"" two passages stand out.   [...] Dr. Gabor Maté presents an eloquent case that addiction – all addiction – is in fact a case of human development gone askew.   And:   [...] brain circuits develop, or don’t develop, largely under the influence of the nurturing environment in early life, and that therefore addiction represents a failure of these crucial systems to mature in the way nature intended; [...]   I think this is an interesting concept. I kind of counters the argument that porn addiction has become a severe problem nowadays as opposed to, say, 25 years ago, because of the wide availability of pornography through the means of ubiquitous broadband internet. Instead, you could ask if the way society interacts with each other these days also plays a role, maybe a more important role than we thought.   Take a look at this article from Westender which sources an interview with Dr. Mate. He doesn't deny that the availability is a problem, but he also says this:   [...] people are inherently lonely.   The addiction, whatever it is, might just be a coping mechanism for that. So let's ask ourselves if our grandparents would also have suffered porn addiction if porn had been widely available back then, maybe not through the internet but, let's say, on television. Or would it have been different because the society was different back then and wouldn't have paved the way to the addiction in the first place?  Okay, sorry, I'm just ranting here. I find the talk and it's ideas super interesting, though, and I kind of want to buy Dr. Mate's book now and read it."

It's easy to say the elephant is one thing if you just consider one piece of evidence. But it doesn't mean that other views of the elephant is wrong just because you considered your one piece of evidence. Addiction is a part of human behavior, and with any behaviors, it's incredibly complex. It's reasonable that a multitude of perspectives can be all part of the picture in describing the causal factors of addiction. Garbor Mate's developmental theory of addiction can be a part of that as well."

In the midst of my addiction I would LOVE to be sexually surprised by a nude from my girlfriend or an unexpected pretty girl in a bikini on my newsfeed. These are more difficult to avoid because they're so random. You can't avoid it. You can just continue to train and work hard not to give in to the urges. Get out of there as soon as you can. Limit the amount of time you spend in situations where sexuality could occur. For me. I shouldn't browse /r/all because there are some NSFW links that could potentially come up. I should stay on my front page where I am not subbed to anything that readily provides porn or NSFW content.  Keep at it. You can do it. It's okay to struggle.

pornfree,3cgzjy,sovereignbrain,10,Tue Jul 7 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, good advice that I think a lot of people can take a lot from. A few things, though:  Loving sex or having a high sex drive isn't the same as being a sex addict. It's a very big misconception, and a lot of people think wanting to have sex a lot makes them a sex addict, when there is a line between enjoying someone and being dependent on it.  Also, masturbation isn't always a good thing. For example, for myself, I can use my imagination just fine, but what do I think about when I use my imagination? Pretty much all the stuff I watch porn of combined. So afterwards, I feel exactly the same as if I'd just watched porn, because in my brain, there's really no difference between a screen and my mind. I still feel guilty and ashamed and whatever else, because I'm still 'watching' exactly the same thing.   I think for those of us like me, the best thing is to try not to masturbate (unless you can actually separate yourself from those thoughts) until you've had enough of a break from porn that you can use your imagination without linking it to porn, and instead linking it to things you enjoy, personally.  I love the comparison with the water bottles though, I think that's a really great way of explaining it."

That's great if it works for you, but if you find after some time that you're hitting a plateau, may I offer another way of looking at it?  When you've conditioned yourself over so many years to masturbate with porn, even masturbating to porn in your head is a step removed from that. That's progress.  It works because you're breaking the habit of looking up porn. You're also not downloading any new porn into your memory.  If you're having a hard time getting any traction, don't try to go for perfect, just pick the low hanging fruit. It's still an improvement over your old baseline."
pornfree,3cgzjy,free_lefthand,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:53:40 2015 UTC,"I agree on a lot of stuff.   Sure you can become a sex addict. I don't personally know anyone who is one (although I do know people who have sex with strangers like they're training for the Olympics). My assumption is that real ""sex addiction"" is a fraction of porn addiction numbers. And probably a combination of logistics + genes, of which you can still control a big part.   RE: masturbation - to clarify, I do believe masturbating to your memories of porn still qualifies as porn. Unfortunately ""stop doing it"" doesn't sound like much of an advice, does it? haha  But my experience has been that when you stop watching porn for a few weeks, your memory of porn gradually becomes less intense.   So the answer is probably in between. Like delaying masturbation as much as possible until you feel you'll die unless you watch porn - and then simply fapping from imagination. But it's still dangerous, it assumes a level of self control that you don't really have yet."

NoFap is great if you can manage it, but personally after around 2 weeks my balls are the size of grapefruits, and it feels like I need to milk them in order to walk more like a human and less like John Wayne..  Cutting the connection between porn and masturbation is a huge step I believe, Also I think that without porn, masturbation in itself is much less of an addictive thing to do..   although everyone is different, we seem to be on the same wave length :D there is a great post on Nofap called 'every no fapper should have this on his computer' or something along those lines, it is a edit to a script which can block websites, I find that even if I am tempted, that one deterrent is enough to remind myself why I don't want to do that shit.."
pornfree,3cgzjy,Jev420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"my own experience with scripts that block websites is bad.   It teaches your brain that you're a weak person, someone who can't control himself. Urges come and go - I found myself getting very ""creative"" when an urge would take over. For instance my script would block Chrome but then I'd remember I still have Internet Explorer.   My point is - we have to remember porn is here to stay, and most of the people on this thread will live at least another 60 years (with probably another 20-30 very active sexual years). Your strategy needs to be sustainable, you gotta find a way to live with yourself and with porn ""within reach"" without relapsing to the addiction.   This is why I guess my post needs a second part - what do you do when you start gaining back control, even a bit? The war is not won, porn addiction is for life and even after 6-9 months of sobriety you still get the occasional cravings (but it's 1/month vs. every single day).   That's got to go into beliefs, CBT, lifestyle changes, honest communication with your partner, and a bunch of other things that I know help."

pornfree,3cgzjy,starseedlove,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"haha PAs are good but the whole idea is to understand your habits as a chain of events, and then script what needs to happen to either reinforce the habit or to destroy it.   Quick example that is still relevant to porn:   I've been going to the gym almost every single day in the last 6 months, at 9 AM before office. Weekends included.   Before this year, I used to go to the gym for 2-4 months, typically 3 days a week. Habit was inconsistent.   So what did it? I looked at my ""gym habit"" as a chain of events that need to happen. Again, logistics.    I need a gym within 15 minutes from home, or else I worry too much about wasting time driving.  I need to wake up at 8 AM every day. -- but guess what, waking up is easy when something else happens:  I need to go to bed before midnight every day --- this is where the big problem was, and when I fixed this, waking up and going to the gym was a breeze!    And a few more things to help my first weeks:    waking up at 8 after having problems all your life waking up is hard. So the tiny habit I installed was to put on my pants right after hearing the alarm. New habit: keep pants near bed. Hard to get back to sleep with your pants on haha I needed more reasons to go to the gym than to stay at home. There's this implied myth that somehow you need to be 100% motivated to do something (like... not watch porn). I believe 51% is all you need. So for the first week, I started packing my gym bag right before going to sleep.    So now I'm awake, with my pants on, and my gym bag is already done. You've got to be a complete moron not to do it now.   It's the same with porn, just the complete opposite. You have a porn habit because your porn habits are optimized to death. Everything that needs to happen so that you can masturbate to porn, happens. Might be worth sabotaging the mechanism a bit."

pornfree,3cgzjy,NoIdeaJustOneName,2,Wed Jul 8 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"My solution is to ""decriminalize"" fapping. In fact, I suggest ramping it up during the first two weeks of being porn-free.   Coincidentally enough, after my last relapse this was my new plan. My goal is to cut P off and limit M to 1-2 a week but after countless attempts (no longer than 20 something days), I decided I'd narrow my focus to strictly my P issue.   It's only been a couple days so I can't comment on its effectiveness yet, but by giving myself a blank check for M in the first few weeks maybe this time will be different. Keeping the tank low so that I don't have the gas to drive myself to relapsing."
pornfree,3cgzjy,foobarbazblarg,2,Wed Jul 8 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"it's always a combination of things.   It's like a switchboard with 100 buttons. You've got your genes and natural sex drive (different from other people). You've got your urges (not set in stone, they fluctuate a lot based on what you do, what company you keep). You've got all your other habits. And so on.   You don't need to push all the buttons for something to happen. If 80 of them are pushed, yeah you'll be in the ""I'll die if I don't watch porn now"" more. But if 49 are pushed... yeah it's still sort of uncomfortable, but manageable. Hence my suggestion to fap during the first two weeks.   Anyway, be careful with ""a-ha"" moments, the subconscious loves any opportunity to say ""hehe now I have the cure, might as well watch some porn now"".   What's your theory about the 20-something days? Why then, why not after 6 months? Do you get ""sad""? Bored? Anything you say to yourself? Just curious."
pornfree,3cgzjy,foobarbazblarg,2,Wed Jul 8 07:13:33 2015 UTC,"If I look at my pattern of relapse, which I would wager is fairly typical. I either relapse within the first week or in the 20-somethings usually around 25 days. The first week relapses are when im really not taking it seriously, the ""ehh fuck it"" mentality is strong, as are the sex urges which im sure my pmo problem exacerbates.  The thing about the streaks that last upwards of a month is that in that time, I start to minimalize why I'm doing it while sensationalizing porn. There's no tangible benefits, there's no instant gratification, and after abstaining for multiple weeks porn and the idea of it just doesn't seem as bad as it did. Then it just takes a bad day or a day filled with thoughts and urges. It's very much attached to my emotional state as well as sex drive."
pornfree,3cgzjy,pornfree95,2,Wed Jul 8 08:49:07 2015 UTC,"Great advice, this almost perfectly describes my porn habit: when I am in a situation where porn is not an option (for example, away on holidays with my girlfriend) I have no problem abstaining, and this is usually when I get my longest streaks going.  Problem is I work from home, I am alone on my PC all day and I end up watching porn about once a week, usually because I haven't masturbated away from porn so my urges are ramped up, usually after a long session on the PC and almost never have I gone online with the express purpose of looking up porn - as you say, it just happens out of boredom, loneliness, habit, whatever.  I am actively looking to change my line of work though so I'm hoping when I get an office job and I have far less ""alone time"" I will be able to drastically reduce my porn consumption.  In the meantime I will do my best to avoid staying too long online alone and will try to masturbate more regularly away from porn to release tension.  Again, thank you, this is great advice and much appreciated!"
pornfree,3cgzjy,ohthatdavidwooderson,2,Wed Jul 8 07:08:53 2015 UTC,"Very, very interresting post, indeed. A very rational and efficient analysis of what porn adiction is, and how to fight it.  But I would like to moderate a little bit the part about fapping on fantasies: of course it's better than fapping on porn ! But still, you get your arousal from a somewhat artificial source of excitation. In this sense, I'm not sure it would rewire your brain correctly.  I would suggest to anyone to try fapping without thinking, only focusing on what you feel, your body feelings. Just like when you meditate (or get into receptivity state for Vittoz fans).  Why do I find it important ?   Because even if it's your imagination, it's already an artificial arousal. It's clearly more natural than watching animated pictures of people fucking with a scenario, but on an already damaged brain it might be a bad idea. Because you'll learn to distinguish a ""true"" horniness from a need for a fix of dopamine. Sometimes I get aroused, maybe from a girl I saw, a suggestive picture, or anything... when fapping without fantasy, sometimes everything goes good (when I'm actually, truly aroused) and sometimes I cannot stay hard if I don't fantasize: the latter means I'm not actually aroused, but I'm looking from any dopamine fix. At least that's how I understand it. Last but not least, focusing on what you feel while masturbating will help you knowing your own body, and what feels the best. Girls are sometimes advised to masturbate to explore their own body and find what make them come. Even if it's easier to come for us guys, I can promise you that orgasms won't be the same if you know what's really pleasurable.   Whatever, remember: what I propose is a supposed improvement, compared to fapping while imagining a fantasy. But remember, the best can be the enemy of the good !

She asked me before she left for an hour to go to get her school done if I will be okay. It made me feel so powerless. I know why she asked. And I know why it's important that she asked. And that I need to tell her if I am or am not okay.   I haven't felt like doing anything sexual in about a week now. I just feel so low that my sexual drive is down.

If you masturbate to a picture of a girl and you're not imagining porn-related stuff (I know that's a big category, but you know what I mean), I think that's OK. If you feel negative feelings afterwards, that's not OK and you should treat it as porn.   It's all about your own feelings and reactions, and I think the best thing to do is to explore your own boundaries and draw your own lines.

However, relying on such artificial means to abstain from porn has a downside. I did give myself a few times ""free pass"" to binge when I found a hole in the fence.

As >it turns out, nothing – or rather, nothing negative.    1969 pornography, specifically the availability, is not the same as today's internet. Lab porn is an interesting concept. Do these people have a mouse in hand and free reign? Do the couples pick what they watch together?   I'm also curious how the correlation between porn <-> bad relationships implied causation in the bad relationship -> porn direction.   A good read, thanks for posting.  I love you."
pornfree,3cdzbe,badass114,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:01 2015 UTC,"Part of accepting reality is accepting that this is you. You are someone who IS currently addicted to pornography. That's okay. You're still lovable. You're still cherished and desired by those around you. If you say it's not you, you don't really have communion in your soul. You'll be living two separate lives where one loves and watches porn, and the other is disgusted by it. It's healthy and helpful to bridge the gap and come to grips with who you are and what you've done. I'd recommend telling a support group/sponsor to help you along in your journey. It's life-giving to tell someone all the bad stuff you've done, so you don't have to hide it anymore. Good luck to you."

pornfree,3cdrk7,Caillou1231,5,Tue Jul 7 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"I do believe there has to be SEVERE pain to make a man quit. To me it was not threats from my wife. It was a severe anxiety disorder I developed in a matter of weeks when I was 37 year old.. Somehow my porn use always made my anxiety disorder worse.. But still it has taken me 4 years to come to these long pornfree streaks.   I am not going to lie. I was very selfish about my porn use. I felt I deserved it. I was willing to lie about it. Had I not developed the anxiety disorder and began to feel horrible after relapses (extreme insomnia, I could not take it anymore when my wife felt bad about it).. I probably would not have quit.   Your boyfriend is very young. His hormones are working and porn.. Damn it. It is so addictive. In his age. It seems there are no negatives (other than your pain ofcourse). But when you are on porn, you feel so numb, that you do not care about the feelings of others. It is selfishness in the end. But a lot of young guys feel it is a victimless crime..   They think that since there is no real life cheating going on.. It is not cheating really.. Once you buy into that lie. It is very hard to quit.   I feel bad for you. But I have been the bad guy like your boyfriend. I know how it is to be so numb that you can not see the pain of your partner.. Thinking why can not I have my cake and eat it too..   You can leave him. But one of the big problems these days is that just about everyone is porn addict. Even religious people (and sometimes especially religious people) are into it.   What can I say. You are not alone with your suffering. I am sorry. I hope you guys get it all sorted out and you begin to feel better.   Maybe you could take some of those feelings and become more active in anti porn movement? That could help you deal with those feelings."
pornfree,3cdrk7,TaterJoe,3,Tue Jul 7 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with TaterJoe on this one.  It DOES seem like a victimless crime, and the brainfog from porn addiction makes one selfish and short-term pleasure-seeking oriented.  What helped me reach my decision/dedication is realising the full extent of the harmfulness. Whenever I see a list of potential harmful effects and side-effects that porn addiction can have, I can check off the majority: erectile disfunction, not being able to stay in the moment during sex, not being able to concentrate, constantly seeking distraction, not being able to connect emotionally to people or even my partner, leading to failed relationships and social isolation etc etc etc.  Getting off porn feels like supercharging my life.  And then there are the relapses..and you know what? Knowing the difference between my life before quitting porn, and after, should be enough to make the commitment, right? Well, relapsing is a good reminder of what I left behind before..relapsing makes me feel like shit, and that's even without shame involved.  Make him have a look at something like yourbrainonporn.com if he needs the reminder."
pornfree,3cdrk7,Egregius2000,2,Tue Jul 7 12:36:34 2015 UTC,"For me the hardest part about this entire process is telling the truth.  I had lied to myself and others for so long that it became, much like your SO, a ""knee jerk reaction"".  This addiction is humbling and it is a very isolating addiction.  We view porn on our own time in our own fantasy world that no one has access to except for us.  Porn, for me, is very personal.  Talking about this addiction is very hard at first.  It feels wrong.  It feels dirty.  I felt very exposed when I first started talking about my addiction.  Since going to rehab and going to SAA meetings and meeting other people who understand what I am going through makes all the difference in the world.  I would recommend a therapist that is also a CSAT (Certified Sex Addiction Therapist).  This addiction is extremely hard to get a hold of and it takes time and rigorous honesty with not only yourself, but with the people you love as well."

I hope your boyfriend will get his big moment in which he starts taking things more seriously. And in the very least that he stops lying about his slip-ups."
pornfree,3cbfne,pornfree95,7,Mon Jul 6 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"Those are just ingrained habits.  Nothing to worry about.  Everyone has spent so much time doing the same thing over and over again.  Your brain is just strongly connected to do those things, but you are aware and are able to beat it.  Over time it will fade away.  Just takes time.  That is why you have to review what you study, in order to keep it in your brain."
pornfree,3cbfne,exp0wnster,6,Mon Jul 6 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"It's not easy.  While I haven't ejaculated to porn (or even masturbated to orgasm) since December 15, 2013, I have looked at porn or porn substitutes from time to time.  The rationalizations are sitting there in my brain if I let them.  And this weekend I said ""what the hell"" and looked at some porn.  The result is predictable -- after the initial rush, there's dissatisfaction and wasted time.  So I am resetting.  But unlike before, I know that I can go months without looking at porn, and I know the benefits.  So I will start anew.  Generally, porn does not control my actions the way it used to.  My sex life with my wife is better.  So while I am disappointed that I looked at porn,  it's not at all as if I have gone back to square one.    But . . . going back to look at porn is, in my experience, totally counterproductive.  And I always need to be aware and afraid of my porn addiction."
pornfree,3cbfne,nofap490,2,Mon Jul 6 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"dissatisfaction and wasted time   Yeah. That is exactly it. I had a large block of free time by myself tonight.

Dissatisfaction and wasted time describes it perfectly."
pornfree,3cbfne,osadigabu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"Live and learn -- that's what we all have to do.  What has worked well for me is to have a checklist of daily things I need or want to do (play music, clean up, plan trips, etc.).  And when I think that I want to look at porn, I think ""OK, but first I need to finish my list"".  And by the time I have done the tasks on my list, the urge isn't there and I feel good because I did more satisfying things.  It is like a grid, with a column for each day, and a list of tasks or fund things to do, or goals to meet.  Try it out."

And you are feeling the need to escape for a little bit? Or is it something else? I've learned a lot about myself and why I do compuslive things, and for me it either comes down to procrastination, boredom, or stress.   I keep asking myself this: When are you really healed???   Perhaps after a decade? I assume you used porn for a long time, like everybody else here. So it will take a long time for you to be completely rid of it."
pornfree,3cbfne,thesilvergoat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same: my urges are the strongest in times of stress, or when I don't feel great, since fapping is a form of escapism/distraction. Maybe the fear of relapsing is even adding to that stress, thereby increasing the urge.  Maybe the way forward is stress-management, like say using the pomodoro-technique, where you study intensively on a 45-minute time, and then take 10/15 minutes break doing something pleasant (like reading your favorite book or playing a game, or even going for a walk), and then study intensively for 45 minutes again. The promise of reward will keep your brain focused."
pornfree,3cbfne,Egregius2000,6,Tue Jul 7 12:49:52 2015 UTC,"Healed is a strange notion in regards to porn.  It's like asking when won't I like something that is specifically designed for me to like a lot?  The answer is clearly NEVER!      But much like a 350 lbs. person that has lost 150 lbs. the recovered porn ""addict"" realizes that eating that delicious pastry has a cost.  You end up feeling like shit.  It just becomes so blatantly obvious that its not healthy.      I think your problem is the notion that some day porn won't seem alluring.  That to me seems highly unlikely…its designed to be alluring.  The whole key is to just get away from it long enough that you can see through the allure as opposed to falling for the trap."
pornfree,3cbfne,Thevents,3,Mon Jul 6 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think that probably we're never healed; even if we're off it in the long run the effect on a recovering addict of a binge is far greater than on a a non-addict. Myself, it's whenever I get complacent that I'm guaranteed to slip up. It's not a matter of 'brain' vs 'you' by any means, but it's funny the tricks we'll play on ourselves to get around our higher level functions. Being pornfree is about building new habits, new routines that supersede the old ones. Sounds like you're doing pretty well, actually."
pornfree,3cbfne,andtheotherstars,3,Mon Jul 6 21:27:00 2015 UTC,You're never really healed if its an addiction. You'll keep fighting it until one day you wont have to and you won't think about it anymore.

It's takes a spark, an inner voice that remembers the feeling of defeat, that tastes regret after a relapse, to say today, right now, right here, I REFUSE to go with the current. I REFUSE to allow my nature dictate what I can and cannot do. I REFUSE to just let it be. My body is my slave. Michael Phelps did not get where he is by stopping after his final lap. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't become who he is by simply saying that all he did that day is just ""good enough"". I hate those words. Those words say, We've made good work. Let's take a break. The journey doesn't end when you decide that now you can take a break. Your journey begins when you're faced with a situation to go one more step when your body says no. That spark I mentioned earlier. It's there. Smoldering. Waiting for fuel and breath to help out grow. You my friend, are a furnace, built for the sole purpose of housing a wildfire inside you. But this fire WILL die if you do not stoke it. Fan the flames. Rise with honor and dignity. Your body is a child throwing a tantrum. Do not let it have its way. Be firm. Be confident. We are an army.

As I see it, you have done excessive use of porn, but my guess would be that it won't take you more than 2-3 months to get your sexual appetite for real life females up and running!  Personally, I never really watched so much porn to the point of not being able to interact with girls, so I am seeing less changes in my life than you are going to!

This App has the abillity to block all porn sites, also specific sites that you do not wish to waste your time on, a timelock and a specific time as to when you're allowed to browse the computer. The best feature is that you can't uninstall this APP without knowing the password. So i would advice you to give the password to one of your friends/family members or simply delete it.   You can be this ""hero"" trying to do it the hard way by simply going based of off your own willpower. But 9/10 times that method doesn't work.

You can be this ""hero"" trying to do it the hard way by simply going based of off your own willpower. But 9/10 times that method doesn't work.

I'm not forcing you or anything, i am simply sharing some advice. A way to make your journey easier and help you along  the path that many have failed over and over again. Relying solely on willpower alone is going to lead you straight to the path of failure.   Willpower isn't infinite. You might feel awesome today, but what if the situation ends up being  terrible? Everything is going against you, where will you go? Your willpower is depleted. Your only source of going forward is simply gone. Thats right, you will go straight back into the arms of porn.   I'm not saying this to demotivate you. I'm talking from experience and anecdote evidence that willpower alone won't get you trough this tough battle that lies ahead. Putting focus on your life is what makes you recover.  You said it yourself. Pornhub is on your most visited tab. How do you even expect to tacle on something that is ingrained in your daily routine?  Saying no isn't going to preven't that from happening. One little trigger will send you off into overdrive.   I also forget to mention that Qustodio is also available on your iphone/android. But i see you want to rely on willpower alone. Not my problem.   I wish the best of strength to you."

Rather then rely on what I view as a crutch, i'd rather power through it myself, and if I can't, that's that, but at the minimum I can decrease my use.  I'm a strong believer in the power of the individual, and I have no problem with people who choose other methods, this is just my method. Introspection, discipline, and willpower."

pornfree,3c9w88,recoveryrebel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone. It's like real life, when a boob or two pops up. Your choice is whether to take the second look (lust) or to be clean (yes!).  For your inner inner peace about that choice: Ideally you can see the humanity in all people even those with boobs, and appreciate and emphasize other connections besides lust.   Health, fitness, and spiritual goals are good for this. For example imagining that a hot girl and you have looking good as a goal in common. It emphasizes your shared humanity and makes it not so much about who got a peek of what... and can remind you to follow up on your own health goals, but especially for this maybe it gets you thinking about who she is as a person - not name and personal info, but infinite unique beauty deeper than the flesh. We all have it, and it's pure! If she has a baby she's breastfeeding, to that baby the boob is definitely not porn!  All a matter of perspective I guess, if that makes sense?"

pornfree,3c7ik1,smb89pf,5,Sun Jul 5 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"Those fantasies are almost certainly fueled by pornography.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy here who has watched some gay and shemale porn out of curiosity. Shemale was mildly arousing sometimes. I've watched videos involving horses... which definitely turned me on. Does that mean I'm into horses? Erm, no.  The mind is a convoluted thing that works by association. Don't take your fantasies or dopamine kicks too seriously :)  Keep going for longer and longer streaks and  this will settle itself.  Imho, if you are having a hard time at 5 days don't be silly and just do pornfree. nofap is next to no use and you will just be full of tension and stress. Fap to whatever you like in your imagination. Just try to fap less than usual. You will find you don't want to fap that much without the porn anyway. Once every 5-7 days seems pretty common.  People can be addicted to fapping, yes. And fapping can also cause dopamine rushes, yes. However if you leave the porn behind you'll find that the fapping gets less and less bothersome.  One of the physical symptoms I had that got me looking seriously into pornfree is that my penis was tense and remained semi erect several days after fapping, even without a video. After one year of increasingly longer pornfree streaks (last one was 6.5 months), this problem is still there but about halfway gone. I used to have pains in my belly when lying to sleep, those are gone. I used to have some kind of heatwaves that disturbed my sleep. Those are gone. Recovery can be long, but the remedy can't be simpler: QUIT pornography.  Just get started and things will get better slowly but surely. :)"

pornfree,3c7ik1,MultiNatural,2,Mon Jul 6 01:30:28 2015 UTC,"Most likely yes. At the very least your ""shemale/sissy"" fantasies will subside regardless of what turns you on in real life. The hard part is maintaining abstinence like all addictions.  Also keep in mind, the majority of people who consume ""tranny"" porn are straight men. I would say the same for the ""sissy"" stuff too although that doesn't mean all porn addicts who watch tranny porn escalate to the sissy/crossdressing/hypnosis variety. I have no doubt for some people pre-existing autogynephilic and crossdressing tendencies were present prior to becoming addicted to porn. That doesn't make them gay either.   And keep in mind that shemale are a produect of the porn industry. They don't exist in nature as a rule (psuedo-hermaphroditsm and intersex conditions don't count).   The performers are pre-op transgender woman who have yet get SRS which most do. And considering how passable and feminine most of them are, of course many hetero mind are attracted to them."
pornfree,3c7ik1,Ratcliff01,2,Mon Jul 6 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's all.  Just stop looking at porn for a little while.  3-4 months should do it.  If you can, just fap once-twice a week and do not do it to porn.  It'll be a little more challenging then I'm making it out to be, but if you cut porn out of your life for a little bit your brain will reset and you'll be back to normal.  It's 100% reversible.

If that is the case, you will be much happier embracing yourself as you are. It is 2015, and it is definitely more acceptable to be gay than it is to be a homophobe."
pornfree,3c7ik1,smb89pf,4,Sun Jul 5 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"While this is true, it's also entirely plausible that this is a matter of porn escalation. Only OP can really know his sexual orientation. We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that he's suppressing."
pornfree,3c7ik1,MultiNatural,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"I can see you're coming from a place of sincerity even though I think you're off the mark. Although I think it's healthy for all of us to examine our sexuality even in the absence of porn or sex addiction.  In this case I would say the OP being gay is unlikely as the trajectory of his porn tastes is extremely common among straight porn addicts. First, like I talked about in my other post, the main audience for ""shemale"" porn is almost exclusively heterosexual men. Gay men aren't usually turned on by a passable trans woman despite their penis.  Second, the escalation of porn tastes and preferences is well documented and often opposes viewers actual sexual orientation. It isn't just hetero men this happens too. Gay porn addicts who are male sometimes become hooked on straight porn. There are accounts of gay woman who escalate to hetero porn or even ""sissy porn"" like the OP. Which often involves giving men oral sex and focusing on their penis. Like straight men, these gay woman become addicted to these videos and begin fantasizing about actually doing it.  Another issue is some porn addicts start as young as 10, maybe even earlier. Is it really surprising that they escalate to porn that isn't consistent with their innate sexual preferences when they've been masturbating daily to it for years or decades? Those early years around puberty are still a sensitive time for brain development and it's that plasticity which can unfortunately allow porn to morph one's sexual tastes. It can even get to the point that it competes with the viewers actual orientation which makes quitting porn/not giving in to urges extremely difficult. Not impossible as many decade or longer fappers who have stopped have demonstrated."

AFAIK the idea of latent sexuality differences is a myth. People who are gay and come out years later always knew deep down that they were gay, it's not something an adult just realizes.  OP I doubt you are gay since this is a common thing for people who have gone far down the porn addiction path. Of course it's fine if you are, but that's a conclusion you need to reach several months removed from porn so it's not clouding your thinking."

Nevertheless I still think about porn occasionally. Although nowhere near as often as I used to. Time has weakened it's grip on me considerably.  I found pornfree by accident about a year ago and joined. And I have to say that I agree with you. Up to a point.  As you quite rightly point out, masturbation is practiced by animals. And I don't doubt humans have always done it. So it is natural. But I do feel that too much time spent in the company of ones hand is a little unhealthy. It's not great for the self esteem and it can be, and often is used as a retreat from ones problems. So I would always recommend moderation.  I also agree that porn is by far the worst of the two. The industry itself has very close links to the criminal underworld. Drug abuse, people trafficking, physical and mental abuse. It's all there. And when someone logs on they feed it.  It also encourages misogyny. Young kids see porn and see it as the correct way to conduct a sexual encounter. You don't see kissing on porn.  Kissing is possibly the most important part of  initial physical contact between two people. Kissing speaks volumes about a persons feelings and passion. In a porn film it's all about the violence and domination. And kids today are getting their sexual awakenings and their education from internet porn. It is corrupting millions of young minds the world over. Incidence of PIED is rapidly increasing in the younger generations.  Anyway good luck and welcome :-)"

pornfree,3c6w36,fallen90,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"Just play games and stay at home all the time   Sometimes I wonder if too much gaming has the similar effects in our brains and in our selves as porn do.   In Phillip Zimbardo's TedTalk, which pretty much put my struggle agains porn in motion, he specifically says that what is causing the demise of guys is porn AND videogames (The link is right here: http://www.ted.com/talks/zimchallenge#t-212587).  In a way, the same mechanism of hunter/gatherer and constant drive for novelty is present in my gaming sessions. And I think that a huge hit of dopamine is also present when I play, although it is not a natural hyper stimulus, like sex and hypercaloric food. There are few things I rather be doing instead of gaming, and even somedays I choose the game.  While it can be a problem for me, maybe it is not for everyone. And the worse part this: while I am very confident I am able to stop watching porn forever, I am also sure that it is impossible for me to stop playing video games. I know I will not be able to do it. So I barely try to limit it. In part because I see positive things in gaming (logical thinking, problem solving, socialization), while I am unable to find one good aspect of consuming porn, besides the escapism pleasure (that is not really a good thing).  I know this sub is not about video-game addiction, but, nevertheless, maybe it is a thing that some of us should also adress. Maybe someone here had the same idea or struggle with games and porn.

pornfree,3c6w36,moododude,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"Being pornfree isn't going to fix everything just like that, but it's certainly not going to make anything worse. Have you ever, ever felt good about using porn, even once?  A few other thoughts before I go to bed:   It certainly takes more than three months for a normal well-adjusted person to build a close friendship with someone they know. You're recovering (with enormous, enviable stamina) from a problem that cripples you socially, so a further delay is no big surprise. That doesn't mean that your casual friends of the moment won't be your close friends of the near future.  Social bravery is both a learned habit and a limited psychological resource. It'll take time to get into the groove enough to build the habit, and still sometimes you will wish you had more. I am definitely an introvert and it sounds like you might be too; a big thing that helps me cope is remembering that my character just means that being with other people wears me out. No big deal, I just have to accept that and structure my social life in a way that works rewardingly for me as well as for other people.  Going out on your own is pretty good fun. I don't mean anything fancy, just going for a walk with some music or something like that. If you're interested in exercise there are a few things out there that have satisfying and motivating game-like aspects, and often good social sides as well - Freeletics for example.   Keep it up, mate."
pornfree,3c3n5w,mymoonx,21,Sat Jul 4 13:20:20 2015 UTC,I have to say sadly that you will probably be in for some hard time.   The chase for ever harder orgasms is a road that has an ending. To me it came at age 37.. I was left wanting more.. Unsatisfied..   But it only makes sense.. You can only up your excitement so much.. Until you hit a wall..   The answer was to let go of that search for ever stronger orgasm..   And boy at first.. It is hard.   Porn numbs and soothes you to a level where a lot of shit can go down in you life and you wont even notice.. But when you are no longer on the porn drip.. The smallest things can get to you..  Your moods will swing like you were a little girl..   Yet it is doable to give up porn..   But if you try to keep even one iota of your higher orgasm chasing behavior.. You will probably relapse..   Because nothing in the real world compares to porn. It is super normal stimuli for people that fools us just like a giant plastic egg fools a bird to sit on it instead of on its real babies. It messes you up and leaves you wanting it..   Because it is super normal stimuli and since you bought into it. You just can not walk away from it and forget. You will dream about it.. You will have flashes to it.. You will have extremely strong cravings to it.. You will find your self rationalizing your way back into it.. Only to find out the reasons why you want to quit..   It is a long and weird road.. I wish you good luck!

Started with first folder, saw thumbnails and among them was one of the ladies with puppy eyes and I was like ""Fuck.."", I feel like I'm dumping a proper physical woman, not a piece of zeros and ones.  So I'm currently onto folders that feel more... safe? I don't know how to describe but I'm wiping portable Firefox folder with all settings, bookmarks etc and videos of certain company I generally like a lot but right now feel comfortable with wiping. In short, selecting to wipe what I feel it's ""ok"" to go first.  I sort of got used to having occasional flashes and craving and I just thought of them as ""horny moments"". You're right about the ""rationalizing"" part - I caught myself earlier thinking under what conditions it would be ok to, you know, just download a video or two. To me, the problem I currently see it, is the hoarding one. And certain images/videos feel personal to me. I'm not having problems reaching orgasms, I'm ok with experiencing the ""regular"" ones but every once in a while there's an orgasm that will just blow my mind - and I wasn't doing anything special, perhaps not even watching at porn. I don't think I am on a chase for better orgasms... I mean, if a chase for it is a full-time professional job, then I'm doing this as a weekend hobby.

pornfree,3c3n5w,reboot2015,6,Sun Jul 5 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"I've been in your shoes. I gave up porn about one year ago after being addicted for about 20 years. I know the constant search for new and more exciting porn, with many tabs open, always trying to find the newest and complete material for certain porn stars. I would download porn even when I wasn't horny, and I'd masturbate 4-5 times a day, especially on days when I was at home (morning, noon, night, and middle of the night). And I couldn't wait to get home to torrent and download the new material was posted that day. I followed many hot chicks and porn stars on Twitter and Facebook and it basically enveloped my life. Now, you're probably all too familiar with this.  Here's the difficulty you're going to face. This is all from my own personal experience:   Relapse (you may go on streaks and you may slip back into binges, you'll be disappointed in yourself and be angry with yourself; but as long as you continue to want true change you will continue to fight the habit) Withdrawal (this one is big because it'll effect your daily mood and your brain/body will hunger for porn on a daily basis; you'll be irritable and frustrated more often) Pornographic dreams (your mind will constantly hunger for porn and it's used to certain imagery that you have consumed in the past) Thoughts of porn stars (you will feel the need to slip back to download their material again and you may relapse due to this) You may feel it is not worth it and feel it would be easier to quit (have an accountability partner, someone who you could share your thoughts and feelings)   Lastly: Do. Not. Give. Up. You are taking a positive step in your life to rid yourself of a disgusting and debilitating habit. Even if you're disappointed in yourself that you relapsed, the next day is a new one. It look me a long time to get to consistent porn-free streaks. As long as you have the desire for true change and take action to accomplish it, you will. It will be hard, but it's not impossible."
pornfree,3c3n5w,irateMD,3,Sat Jul 4 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"(Wrote a long reply, tried to delete a word and was pushed back one page and now it's gone. I'll try to tl;dr it)  We probably have similar story. Also about 20 years ago it started in high school with phone hotlines that made a mess on our phone bills; at that time I also bought my first few porn magazines. As freshman college discovered internet porn and never looked back since. Spent hours in a library saving images to floppys. ""Good times"" indeed.   I was guilty of following a few porn starts on social media. I unfollowed them (recently Suicide Girls) because they either quit their business and only posted about their football team or the content became tame. I am aware relapse & withdrawal will happen. I try to look at this transformation rather as a process, not as a walking path from point A to point B. It's not the goal, it's all about the way to reach said goal. Then again, I can be all smart about it now but may look at it differently once I'm a week or so in the process. I don't mind sex dreams, still have them every once in a while and I must be one of rare mid-30 guys who still regularly wakes up with a boner. Again, I can be smart about it but I'm sure these dreams may not be fun once I'm porn-free for some time. Thoughts of porn stars... Well, in my case they're amateur women. There are some I think of every once in a while and often it's not in a sexual way. But I see your point, of course.   It's definitely a HUGE change for me and I'm not taking it easy. Sure, I can look at the process from a point of view of a challenge. I'll try to think of positive results this brings me."

If you've seen the video you'll recognize that it is probably the novelty of having so many attractive girls available what screwed our brain.  Who would care about anything else in their life if they had a harem of young attractive women waiting at home?

pornfree,3c3n5w,irateMD,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not. In fact, some of the claims are inconsistent with evidence from reasonable peer reviewed studies.    Critics of Gary Wilson are also quick to point out his lack of science background and the conflict of interest regarding his and his wife's business doing counseling that includes a porn-free approach.    That does not mean that the conclusions on YBOP are entirely wrong, just that the evidence supporting them is poor and that the source is biased.    Regardless of the published research, I believe that porn is often harmful to the user. I know it was harmful to me."

However I will say I find the info from ybop compelling only because of the significant amount of peer reviewed journal articles cited there. That not to say Gary doesn't have a potential conflict to address. But certainly in my experience the evidence he is offering is far far stronger than anything I've seen from people arguing that there is no harmful effects of porn. Most of which comes from people who have a much greater conflict of interest such as the pornographer who posted comments here last week debating the idea that porn was harmful and addictive.  I'm not saying suggesting people need to blindly accept the info on ybop. Everyone should read the evidence hand make up their minds (ideally).   Please share with me more information on other compelling research contradicting the statements in ybop, or pointing out significant flaws in the studies posted. I freely admit I'm not an expert and am always willing to learn more info."
pornfree,3c3n5w,L4rk,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:18:40 2015 UTC,"Don't have time for a complete lit search right now, but here are some samples:     Habitual porn use may reflect hypersexuality rather than addiction    Another article from the same group    Similar findings in women       Pornography use may not be associated with ED      Pornography use may be inversely correlated with ED       fMRI studies like this one cited by YBOP are only useful for generating theories. Porn could be either the cause or the effect of underlying differences between users and non-users       As for the DeltaFosB question, I am not a rodent.      Most of the research on both sides is association/correlation data. It does not address cause vs. effect. It does not show that abstinence helps or harms. That being said, avoiding porn has been helpful to me. My life is better for it.    Edit: I'm not very good at reddit formatting..."
pornfree,3c3n5w,andtheotherstars,3,Sun Jul 5 11:23:31 2015 UTC,"Fully agree that many people mistake the correlation for causation. I agree that it's inappropriate to declaratively state that porn use will cause effect x (whatever x is), but  worry that it's also confusing to dismiss statements linking behavior and outcome in a not statistically insignificant sample of persons. Bottom line for me, if a person is concerned about potential negative impacts connected to his or her porno use, there is sufficient evidence that there may be some behavioral, physical, and social side effects that are worth discussing.    Habitual porn use may reflect hypersexuality rather than addiction     I have strong concerns about this paper for a few reasons (sample size, ethical issues stemming from exposing self proclaimed addicts to triggers, and clear bias in the researchers impacting their analysis of data). Wilson answers many of the critiques in a comment to the article that I think is worth reading.  I agree with him especially that viewing static images is a fundamentally different act than viewing of high speed porn.   Thanks for the additional studies, Ill review as I can. Again, I'm not defending Wilson without question. I feel he overlooks the role of trauma and promotes a simplified model that promotes stopping the behavior vs. a more holistic approach that promotes overall health. (There are many, many children exposed to pornography as a means of being groomed by perpetrators of sexual abuse, and this is also a major factor for instance.) But I do think it's uncharitable to say he is unscientific."

I don´t feel sure about this, therefore I would expect, that /u/foobarbazblarg or /u/freelefthand (or somebody else) will tell their opinion...  You should be happy, that he realized, that he is addicted and that he want to quit. You should realize, that there will be relapses, the important thing is, that he doesn´t stop quitting. I think it could help you both, if he honestly tell you every relapse(, therefore you both have to define porn).   The change in the way he treated me and our relationship post porn is huge. Certainly enough to highlight that he wasn't exactly a serious or engaged partner whilst 'addicted'.   I think you should tell him that, because it will support him in his progress. You could also show him this subreddit, maybe it helps him to quit porn."
pornfree,3c6gr1,DDave1239,3,Sun Jul 5 08:16:56 2015 UTC,"I see porn as any material you are looking at for the purposes of sexual stimulation. So Game of Thrones is ok as long as you aren't watching it for sexual kicks.  Give your SO time if I were you. Giving up porn is difficult, I can attest to that, and he is trying to stop. I'd also be open with him about how you feel. Particularly with regards to his differing attitudes towards you when he's using porn.  The ""all men watch porn"" thing is part of the problem. The porn industry is a vile business. It has links to drug abuse, physical, sexual, and mental abuse, people trafficking, and child abuse. There's plenty of material available that confirm this. So don't be fooled into thinking porn is just harmless fun. The fact is that if someone is using porn they are feeding this industry, and if they're also aware of it's dark side then they are complicit.  We are genetically disposed to desire other women. Google ""the Coolidge effect"" for an explanation on that. So giving up a guilt free, limitless archive of willing women is a real challenge and you really have to work at it. I've not looked at porn for over 2 years now and I still experience the desire to log onto some of those old porn sites occasionally. What stops me is remembering what I have to lose. I'm happily married with a beautiful baby daughter, and I have little doubt that if I used porn again it would be a deal breaker for my wife. I also remember how unpleasant I used to feel after I'd used porn (basically I was ashamed). Now I can look my daughter in the eye without that shame.  So if you're serious about your SO then give him a chance. If you're open with each other then he's far more likely to get porn out of his life.  Good Luck :-)"

I agree, the attitude that women must put up with porn is part of the problem. Sadly, I fall into the age category where every man I could possibly date within a 15 +/- year age range has grown up on hardcore porn being easily accessible.  As a teenage girl you simply learn that the standard for a relationship. It'll always be you, him + porn.

When I gave up porn I also stopped masturbation. Not really with the intent of making it permanent, just to help with getting away from the porn. But I've found that I have an increased sex drive without it. So I don't bother with it anymore.  The odd thing is, I wouldn't admit to my mates that I no longer use porn or masturbate. Not because it would lead to me having to explain about having been addicted to porn, but because they would think it was weird to not use porn. It seems ridiculous but self abuse and pornography are considered normal, and not indulging would be considered a bit strange.  Anyway I wish you both the very best of luck getting this sorted out.

pornfree,3c6gr1,scotthrow29,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"I've found that most guys in their 20s - 30s seem terrified of actual intimacy, to the point of serious mental health problems. I'm now starting to think porn has a role to play in this as the depiction they're being given of sexual intimacy during teenage development is so warped.  I've also dated a couple of men around 24 - 30 with ED. Even to the extent of specific scenarios/positions being the only way they can get off. A lot also ask for sexual acts that are clearly from porn.  As a woman, you just take the above as standard. Not all guys will have problems relating to the above, but in my experience most have one or both to some extent.  With my current SO when he stopped watching porn he no longer had ED related problems. He was less inclined towards porn 'style' sex and was more engaged in mental person-to-person way. He also suddenly decided that relationships/emotions/mental heath really do matter and as a result all three improved.  He also found it easier to concentrate and study for difficult mental tasks. Less distracted and prone to stress relief through porn.  Seeing this kind of change in someone in the span of three months really highlighted to me that the thoughts and feelings I had towards porn use may not be unjustified.   I'd also like to say that I'm also not of the opinion that all sexy material should be removed from sight. I think the fun images of women like Betty Page are great. They have real feeling and fun to them. Most hardcore porn i've seen these days is so horrible and emotionless - and I think that may be one of the main issues with excessive porn use."

It's possible porn helped you realise this, and don't beat yourself up about those opportunities or impulses. Best of luck with your journey!"

When I objectify a woman I cease to care for her heart, her soul, her emotions, or her as a person at all. I only care about how she can please me or give me more satisfaction. So, it's possible for me to lust after my wife. It's important that I don't. It's important for you to decide if this is drawing you closer to her as a person, or is it just something to get you off and you'd be satisfied with any other beautiful woman showing you these videos. Does it matter that it's her in those videos? Or is just important that she's sexy and showing you attention? These are tough questions, and one's only you can answer. Good luck."

I recognise that this is relevant, but its still me jackin it to a video on a screen. It definitely stops me watching porn with other women in it! So I feel like that is a positive thing."

It's been the best thing to ever happen to me. I can be myself. My true self. I can actually say what my deepest darkest secrets are and be accepted for them. I can have peace in my soul making restitution for the wrongs I've done. With these new tools that are life changes, choosing to escape reality via porn is no longer as desirable. When my reality is so great, what's the point in leaving it? The reason I left it before was because it sucked. I've been in 12 steps for a year now. It's fantastic."

Society makes it such a norm these days that it's hard to realize how bad it really can be for the brain. Not to mention how it affects the girls who are in it. For me it helped to realize why I was stopping, because once I could get there it made a lot more sense to me to stop. Still very tough. But a whole lot easier.

pornfree,3c11ei,TheFirstStepofMany,2,Fri Jul 3 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear this habit destroyed your relationship. I, too, am quitting because I hurt my own girlfriend. The number of times I believed I should break up with her was because my porn addicted brain was addicted to sex and the novelty of seeing other women naked everyday. From then on I vowed to become a better version of myself. I believe subscribers to r/pornfree and r/nofap deserve to be the best versions of ourselves. We are not in denial of our inner demons.   Everyone's experience in quitting porn is different. You may experience times when the struggle is very difficult, when your urges seem to control you. You may relapse, and you will be ashamed of yourself and feel disappointed. You may contemplate giving up and wonder whether or not quitting porn is worth it. Let me tell you, as a porn addict for nearly 20 years who has been quitting for one year with varied success, it is 1000% worth it. It feels almost unbearable at first, having to change such a deep-seeded habit, but let me reassure you that it gets easier and easier over time. Whatever you do, do not give up.  Remember, you are doing this for yourself. Giving up would be giving up on yourself. You deserve much better than that."
pornfree,3c11ei,Walk_Like_A_Man,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's difficult. Since she is talking to me off and on trying to understand why I hurt her so badly, but I don't understand myself. She doesn't buy that it is porn addiction. Which I don't know, I am seeking counselling on Monday, but I worry that I am using ""addiction"" as a crutch to excuse my own actions. That's my worry. I do feel terrible and am trying my hardest to own up to my actions. I showed her all my credit card and bank statements upon her request. I have been answering every question she has asked me with the upmost truth. And have been trying to keep focus on that it is her pain caused by me and leave my pain out of it because it is self afflicted.   I lost her but she is getting her closure. It really hurts to have her lash out on me - but I understand why, and agree that it is something I should let her do because the pain and regret I feel now is nowhere remotely close to the embarrassment, hurt, and betrayal she is feeling. I let myself believe that what I was doing was different that it somehow weaseled out of her definition of limits. I'm not sure what I am going to do because she is a huge part of my life and my future plans - and I screwed them all up through explaining away my idiocy, my actions, and manipulating myself.   I feel absolutely ashamed, and scared. At first she told me not to give up porn because it's all I had left, but the more questions I truthfully answered the less she felt inclined to give me one last chance. I have had too many chances already, I would try to break the cycle only to screw up in another way.   This is why I joined this subreddit and am browsing noporn's sub forums and reading everything I can. I hurt her because of my habits, they were destructive, self centred, piggish, disgusting and I am filled with regret. I didn't allow myself to see what I was doing for what it was."
pornfree,3c11ei,BabblingBrewer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:02:46 2015 UTC,Here for you on Day 1. I have a similar situation to yours. So here's to taking on the struggle with company.

It wasn't until she found out and confronted me on it and I tried to explain my actions and - I couldn't - suddenly all my reasoning from before fled me and I saw it for just how stupid it was. How stupid I was.   As I looked into the reasons I could come up with and the reasons I told her, the circular logic and the logic I believed at the time I looked out and saw that the similarity of my reasoning lined up with the admin of no-porn's reasoning in his book.  I don't want to use ""I have an addiction"" as a crutch, but I know it's something that I used to try to stop watching, as a whole, several times over the years but would always gravitate towards (porn in general, not camgirls). And it so easily becomes a slippery slope.   I'm reading through the really helpful information material here to try to break the cycle. I just wish I did so before hurting her."

I have a phrase taken from the free book from noporn ""I will never use porn to masturbate now"" that I will be repeating, as well as using urgezapper. I'm going to try to use them in tandem. I'm tackling this as I would any research paper or project. It's something that has to be fully understood and mindfully aware....or so I think at least. I'm tired of doing something that hurts her, relapsing and doing something slightly different that hurts her, and on and so I repeat with the excuses.   If you are in college, or even through your work some services might be covered. I set an appointment with a counsellor at my school who I'm hoping will help me with the right mindset or right early decisions. Really I won't know for sure how strong I am in my convictions until I have a few sleepless nights. It's usually then when I had the majority of my disgusting behaviour.

pornfree,3c11ei,ShivvyT,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"I decided that, if I am to take this seriously at all, I am going to join a sexaholics anonymous meeting. I don't know if I fit the criteria but, it's something I have to do. I got into a long fight with my ex (or rather she unleashed her pent up hurt and anger, which is the least I can do so I listened and agreed with her) and I am realizing just how much I hurt her and how I absolutely broke her trust in not just me - but in men.   Since the groups in my city are all closed groups by inquiring on an invite I sent an email asking to be allowed to attend. I'm not entirely sure what to expect or even if I am taking it too seriously - I just know I lost my girlfriend, my future, and spent too much money on porn. I am also feeling like absolute garbage seeing how much I hurt her - and how she is absolutely right in all her anger, frustration, and attacks.   This is quite intense for my first day, but having all my behaviour shown to me, and being asked to justify it really hit me hard. The reality sunk in. And the future repercussions will start hitting me in waves."
pornfree,3c11ei,Nemacolin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:28:06 2015 UTC,Going pornfree it is good to recognize how porn makes you lie and manipulate. Because those are personality traits that most of us would not like to have. Yet. Porn makes us do it..   It tries to become a center of our lives. A rotten core that sooner or later is going to make us regret the day we picked up the habit..
pornfree,3c11ei,Nemacolin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:39:04 2015 UTC,"That's what I want to stay away from though the ""porn makes us do it"". Regardless of addiction or not I have nothing and no one to blame but myself. This is not the person I want to be and while there's definitely chemical dependencies due to the release of dopamine and creating a correlation between orgasm and pornography that reinforces this skinnerbox, I cannot in full conscience in full truth say it was that ""porn made me do it"". I let it happen. I manipulated myself into allowing the little excuses to multiply and resonate."

Everyone is surrounded by it and it is normal to watch it.   I understand if this community doesn't exactly accept me with open arms given everything,   I wouldn´t understand it, if the community doesn´t accept anyone with open arms(, who is willing to quit porn or willing to change his/her life). Because then I would ask myself (and everyone else of the community should do the same), what the community is worth. I don´t think that here is anyone, who has the right to judge anyone. We all have our problems and nobody is better. We all are on a journey to a better life/habit by quitting porn.   And never loved her the way she should have been treated.   Did you tell her this? If not, please do it, it will help you and her.  In general, I have to thank you, because all the storys with the bad things, which comes from porn(like broken relationships), are an encouragement for me to keep going and not to give in the desire...
