BasicIncome,3e21w7,lnava,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's not good for such a large discrepancy in standard of living between communities.   People living at the poverty line today are much richer than the middle-class of the pre-industrial-revolution 1800s.  When we say ""poverty"", we mean one of two things.  The one we measure--the one referenced by the poverty line statistic--is the one that says, ""Some people are more poor than other people.""  In 1000 years, when the poorest of poor are much more well-off than the richest of rich today, they will still fall below that poverty line, and be considered destitute.  Manipulating society has a toll.  As we move forward, we get richer; each step we take to manage the economy damages it, but stitches to seal a wound must puncture skin.  Trying to raise the minimum standard of living slows the growth of the economy, meaning people in the future will be worse off than they otherwise would have (and recessions will do more damage and cast more into poverty).  A Citizen's Dividend as I often describe has that great benefit of not doing much (if any) damage to society (it should cost 98% of what our current welfare system costs; it's got a big cost compared to having less-effective welfare, or none at all), while providing great socioeconomic benefits.  Creating a firm minimum standard of living is a big one:  it eliminates all absolute poverty, which is technically ""solving poverty"".  Relative poverty is an imaginary construct where we decide people who aren't as rich as other people are particularly poor enough to draw our attention; but I could also complain I don't have a 1 acre homestead, so I'm living in relative poverty.  Not having the means to adequately feed, shelter, or clothe myself is an indisputable fact:  I either have the means to live or I don't.  The acceleration of wealth growth is another one:  generation after generation, the very poor, the lowest standard of living, becomes better more quickly under an effective Citizen's Dividend.  This means, essentially, that relative poverty in the future is different:  under a Citizen's Dividend, those living below the poverty line in 100 years not only have enough to eat, but have more wealth (more buying power, better standard of living) than they would have if the Citizen's Dividend were never implemented.  You can try to weasel-word it here and say it's a solution to relative poverty as well, but you'd be bullshitting people; there is, by definition, no solution to relative poverty.   I fear this will lead to a fractured society.   I'm not sure what you mean by this.  There will always be leaders, followers, the poor, the rich, the abused, the abusers, castes, classes, and whatnot.  It cannot be avoided; we can rename the labels to hide it for a while, until a new culture emerges which no longer remembers the old labels, and sees past the new labels to the reality.  Even a pure, direct democracy is held at the hands of the cult of personality:  he who can exert charismatic influence can command the masses with no legitimate authority, just as he who has the god-given mandate of kingship can find himself executed by a revolting peasantry.  What we need is efficiency and balance.  The great masses should be weak; they should not be so weak as to not balance against the powerful.  Individuals with the self-driven negotiating power of trade unions would suffice to balance society:  no individual could command and rule (aside from the familiar mechanism of election or independent wealth--start a small business, hope for a lot of luck), but they could rebuff abuse by their employers; the great machine of the common man's opinion becomes the driving force of employment policy in that design, without trade union organization (creating more places for abusive leaders to amass great power) or whatnot."

This may be true, but it also might not be. Right now the poverty line actually reflects a pretty barebones subsistence where any unexpected expense is a serious financial crisis that threatens well-being on several fronts. It's not necessarily the absolute minimum of what you can survive on if you're lucky (though in some places it certainly is), but it is still quite related to ""absolute"" poverty in a world where the basics cost a significant amount of money. People living below the poverty line today don't live better day-to-day than the kings of a thousand years ago, at least outside of improved public services."

The fall of the Roman Empire had interesting consequences.  I was, however, thinking noblemen; though kings weren't as rich as you might imagine.  They were kind of like ghetto lords, living in abandoned garages with their rag-clothed servants, dangerous water, poor medical care (haha...), iffy food, and the like.  They had the luxury of a lot of dirt and rock; running water would have astounded them, and kings would have been taken aback at how cheaply you can get hot water (back then you needed hand-cut wood, boilers, people to operate bellows, someone to manually operate a pump... think $250,000 showers).   Right now the poverty line actually reflects a pretty barebones subsistence where any unexpected expense is a serious financial crisis that threatens well-being on several fronts.   That's a consequence of markets, too.  There's a lot of mark-up and unit services sized to common demographics, due to risk.  A Citizen's Dividend at just above half the poverty line (yeah if I said half, I'd be lying:  it can be done technically, but it's too much risk) would create an enormous zero-risk demographic to target, which can be done at enormous profits (as a landlord, I'd be richer than Warren Buffet in 3 years).  I like the idea of a built-in growth mechanism:  the Dividend will work in 2013 at 17%; in 2018, probably 15% would be exactly the same.  Let's lock it at 17%:  the poor get slightly richer every year, and the system becomes more resilient against bigger economic collapses.  That may need a revisit eventually, but I think it's inherently impossible for a small percentage of the total income to suddenly become an excessive income (middle class would always have way more money sans-dividend than the dividend pays out; and besides, the dividend eventually redefines those income levels to include itself), which (hopefully) avoids some of my projections about what extremely large dividends would do to the economy (mostly, destroy it by hyperinflation before any other complaint about a basic income becomes relevant--loss of employment incentive?  Don't make me laugh).  If I'm wrong, we'll need to reduce the benefit eventually, which is itself dangerous, but less so than increasing it (and it's politically unpopular, so is self-limiting)."

Thanks again for your reply."
BasicIncome,3e21w7,bluefoxicy,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"I have never seen conclusive evidence that the minimum wage actually hurts the economy   Minimum wage is not the only way to accomplish a raise in the minimum standard of living; my statement was more general.  I have been lately repeating an economic theory of wealth that I will shorten here.  Implications are vast, and nuances are many; economics is incredibly complex and tends to draw thousands of tiny implications from the smallest basic principles.  This is ... a little scattered; I've written it with the intent that you absorb each piece so you can reflect on the next in such terms and see implications, rather than as a textbook to confer theory in the most blunt way.  Essentially, all costs are human labor costs.  People espouse supply-and-demand, mark-up, profit margins, competition, and the like; but the truth is all of this is limited by human labor costs.  I'll give some examples of these nuances:   Supply is limited by labor required to produce a good.  Assume it takes 100 human-labor-hours to mine a 100 cubic meter block out of the ground.  If your mine produces 100% Anthracite coal blocks and the next best mine produces 50% anthracite mixed with 50% rock and dirt, your coal costs half as much.  Supply of coal at the cost of your coal is limited, since it takes more labor (more cost) to get coal elsewhere, thus that other coal is more expensive. As per above, competition can bring your prices down; but competition doesn't work when your coal costs $100/tonne and theirs costs $200/tonne.  You can mark your coal up to around $200/tonne without your next best competitor undercutting you on price. When competing for an enormous volume purchase deal, you pass that opportunity to your supplier.  Your 15% steel mark-up becomes a 1% steel mark-up; the raw ore, you are bulk ordering hundreds of millions of tonnes from the mine, and they'll cut their mark-up back as well; they need coal and oil, and will have big contracts for those, so can shop suppliers, who will cut back their margins to get an enormous and profitable order; and so forth.   As you can see, and continue to project on your own, the profit margin on top of human labor is volatile, controlled by human labor (can another competitor make your product for the same cost?  If so, will they undercut your prices?  If not, how about raising your price to make more per-unit profit?  When someone figures out how to make the product more cheaply, will they undercut your inflated prices?).  So how do I turn this into a theory of economic wealth?  Simply put:  we grow wealth by eliminating jobs.  You need 100 human-labor-hours to mine a 100 cubic meter block of coal.  You employ 1000 miners (let's ignore the human labor hours in producing the fuel to run your machines, building the machines, maintaining them, etc.) to mine, in an 8 hour day, 2 million tonnes of coal per year.  With $10/hr workers, that's $20 million of coal.  Develop new mining techniques.  Sub-level cave instead of longwall.  SLC poses less risk of injury, extracts more ore, and does so in half the time (I'm making this up).  Half the time, half the workers:  you produce 2 million tonnes of coal per year with 500 miners, at a cost of $10/hr.  Well you fire 500 miners.  Well, now that means coal is cheap.  Consumers of coal and products made using coal pay less (see above economic complexities re competition, volume products, etc.).  Those consumers have more money in their pockets after buying all the shit they buy already.  Let me repeat that.  Those consumers have more money in their pockets after buying all the shit they buy already.  Since consumers have more money to spend--residual wealth (money isn't wealth, but is a measure)--you can start selling more products and services.  You can invent a new good or sell people more of an old good; or you can improve goods (cars with AC, radio, anti-lock brakes).  In the production of new goods, you will need labor--that's your cost, after all.  You can, for the most part, find enough money in consumer hands to hire back those 500 displaced workers.  Now, you might not hire back the 500 unemployed miners; you'll hire some 500 people--or, rather, $5,000 per hour of labor--who may be other people than the recently-displaced miners.  In the end, same employment, same amount of money, more goods bought.  Wealth increases because you spend $100 and get $200 worth of shit (which is now worth $100).  Then it gets complex.  With the lower cost of manufacture (hey, fuel is cheaper, so all that farm equipment costs less to build, maintain, and operate, so food is cheaper), the minimum standard of living costs less.  You can lower real wages and yet not lower standard of living, meaning you can actually create more jobs. You can also go half-way, lowering real wages, but not all the way, creating more jobs filled with people who make larger real-wages than before.  Lowering wages lowers the cost of labor.  Just as if you cut off 500 miners, you could keep 500 miners but cut their wages to $5/hr and achieve the same effect as above.  This, of course, relies on the miners keeping the same standard of living (or on there being too god damn many miners, so you can become abusive with wages--this is why businesses love government incentives to put everyone through college).  A Citizen's Dividend provides a basic standard of living without raising costs (it's as expensive as the Welfare system in current), effectively substituting for part of the wage.  That means you can lower wages instead of raise them, but only to the degree that you offset the worker's inconvenience:  $2/hr is not enough for me to put up with your shit, and I have the means to survive without your shitty job; pay me $5/hr and I'll consider working at McDonalds.  A Citizen's Dividend has a cost (so does any welfare); it also achieves a greater benefit than just raising the minimum standard of living.  By my wealth theory above, such a Dividend puts more money into consumers's hands.  This happens in steps:   The lowest of low are, effectively, irrelevant.  They have no discretionary spending; they pay for landlords, food, clothing, etc., the basic needs of life.  they at least survive. The landlords, grocers, food producers, and so forth get a lot of income from this, which pools into richer people's hands (the lower-middle class and up--people making $5/hr, but also receiving a dividend).  Discretionary markets can target that entire market demographic. My particular design gives full benefit up to $400,000 and a break-even point of $625,000; people have a fistful of discretionary spending to play with. The cost is almost neutral (it's 98% at the lower bound, 103% at the upper, compared to our current system; the actual cost depends on if states decide to roll back welfare and return the taxes, or roll back welfare and spend the taxes elsewhere).  Rich folk, businesses, etc. aren't any worse off.   Cheaper labor (no minimum wage, but they have negotiating power), more money in the hands of consumers (most notably, spread among lower and middle classes--wide demographics), and reduction of damaging impacts of high unemployment (they still buy homes from landlords, food from grocers, etc.).  All of this helps hold the wealth engine up in the worst times, and even pull it forward.  By contrast, labor laws which increase demands on business, raise expense of labor, take more taxes from productive work (especially payroll taxes!), raise income taxes (yeah, if you make $60k and suddenly pay 15% more, maybe your employer needs to pay you 15% more... making labor more expensive), and so forth slow this wealth growth cycle, making goods and services more expensive.  Every such action you take provides some benefit, but also extracts a cost; if the cost outweighs the benefit, you harm society.  One such cost, harder to measure, is the compound cost of slowing the wealth growth cycle.  This is why I suggest caution in trying to force society to play nice:  it may offend you that some people are very rich and others are very poor, but I like to go long and ensure that the very poor are much wealthier in 2-3 generations, rather than try to extract tribute from the very rich and balance things out.  Oh, they'll still be poor, and the rich will still be obscenely rich; but will they be less poor 3 generations later my way than they would if we just tried to level things out?  Will their buying power and their real quality-of-life be better or worse?  It seems obvious that we're debating time:  if you speed up the wealth growth cycle, you will eventually overtake any other attempt to raise the quality-of-life of the lowest of low.  From there, you just project:  is that too far out?  Is it so far out as to be unreachable (10 trillion years)?  Is it 10 generations and you want your grandchildren to feel the impact?  Etc.  Long-term goals..."

Others may look quite different in a ""gig economy,"" as you have recognized. Would you support a negative income tax? What about flexible benefits, like workers compensation or unemployment insurance, that are independent of any given employer, similar to the the model of the Affordable Care Act? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/innovation-hillary-clinton_55a51147e4b0a47ac15d5540   It should be noted that the person who asked this question is Alexander Howard, Senior Editor for Technology and Society for The Huffington Post, and author of the above link. If she actually reads that link, it contains the following excerpt:   Albert Wenger, Wilson's partner at Union Square Ventures, agreed that the nation needs to talk about these issues. In a blog post, he suggested framing the conversation not simply around jobs, but in the context of a ""universal basic income"" where a government provides a single payment to all of its citizens.    As long as we frame the debate in terms of “work-place protections” and a “good job” we are still caught in the industrial system. The hallmark of the industrial system is what I call the job loop: most people sell their time and receive a wage in return — they then use that wage to buy products and services, which in turn are made by people selling their time. This job loop has been extraordinarily successful. In combination with relatively free markets it has given us incredible progress. But it is now breaking down due to automation and globalization.  The rise of the gig economy is a part of this break down of the job loop. Instead of trying to fix it and to imprint traditional work and labor thinking on these new platforms I propose an entirely different approach: truly and deeply empower individuals to participate on their own terms.   It's unlikely that this Congress will seriously consider a universal basic income. That said, that policy suggestion, along with proposals for negative income tax or flexible benefits, like workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance that aren't dependent on any employer, shouldn’t be beyond the boundary of debate."

You are asking exactly the kinds of question that we all need to be asking   but since we aren't all asking about it yet, there just isn't much I can do.   I certainly don't have all the answers   I haven't created a plan to address technological unemployment yet, or it's too early to announce it.   But we have to resolve these questions   Actually, I think this issue is important, and plan on doing something even though I can't say what.   While embracing the promise and potential of these new technologies and without stifling innovation   I don't support protective measures that would block the use of new tech, nor preventing companies from laying people off when their jobs are made obsolete.   or limiting the ability of working moms and veterans and young people to get ahead.   We need to find a way to help the people who are most vulnerable to the impact of technological unemployment and job loss.   On the issue of benefits, the experience of the Affordable Care Act shows that we need to make sure people have access to benefits and that they are portable as they move from job to job.   The health care coverage compromise in ACA left a lot of loopholes for people to not receive health coverage. It proves that my original advocacy for nationwide public health coverage was the right one, and that public, not private, solutions are needed to make sure everyone who needs benefits gets them.   She may not say UBI is definitely the type of benefit she would implement, but she does express a desire to extend public benefits and ease some of the same problems that many UBI supporters have with the current system.

The department’s “denial for not being enrolled was proper and correct.”  In other words, the department was right to drop Martha and her family from welfare even though the decision was made on the basis of erroneous information.    Four weeks later, another judge ruled in Martha’s favor after finding she “never actively transferred her daughter to any other school.” In addition, Lisa had been enrolled on the day Martha last applied for welfare. The judge ordered the state to backpay several months of assistance and no longer deny the family’s welfare applications.  Martha won.  Lisa did not. She died of cancer before the second ruling.   Another example of means-tested benefits in action."

We are afraid of a world without slavery because desperation makes sure my train runs on time, and the cinnabun shop is open.  Politics is about your team winning at the expense of others.  You grab power in order to help those who helped you grab power.  The left may try to reward a larger group of people, but some elites get to control it all, and industrialists will pay them too to keep relatively the same system.  Leftist groups that howl when conservative governments give handouts to industry aren't as critical when their party does it, and so its easier to pass corruption quietly.  The political process itself is the greatest enemy of UBI.  Its important to reward any party that makes concrete UBI proposals.  This is an excellent start by the Greens.  Its important to pressure them on adopting some plan specifics as well and comment on improvements.  Help defend the platform and so on.  99% of citizens lives will improve from UBI.

They say that there is an almost infinite amount of work that needs to be done and that only a fraction of all human capacity is being used today. People hate their jobs, consequently losing tremendous amounts of productivity. With jobs tailored to a person’s passions, we could create a work environment in which people give 100 percent of their capacity to work and the economy expands because more is being done. This is indeed a utopian dream; but it’s something we can and should aspire to.   Admirable, but it's a top-down solution for a bottom-up problem.

BasicIncome,3e19qu,sayarimoja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"The way I see capitalism today, it is primarily about private money creation. The financialization of capitalism results in a shell game with bankers' IOUs representing the shells and a small amount of public money (US Treasuries, basically) shuffled around between banker balance sheets to lend some credibility to the circulating IOUs.  As an example, consider mortgage-backed securities. The value of the derivative is set by the market (see http://subbot.org/coursera/financial_engineering/yields.png) and can exceed by an order of magnitude the sum of the value of the individual mortgages bundled within it (see The Rise and Fall of US Credit Markets, page 5: mortgages totalling $10.6 trillion were inflated to $62 trillion in derivatives based on the mortgages). The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. Thus, money creation through securitization.  Banks and traders bid up the market value of derivatives, and insure against a loss of the value. They are hedged so that they will make money if the derivative goes up or down.  Goldman Sachs was hedged with AIG in 2008, but AIG had problems rolling over its short-term debt. But the Fed stepped in with its unlimited liquidity so that Goldman Sachs got its full hedged value and AIG is still around today with annoying ads on TV.  Conclusion: capitalism is about the creation of capital. We should have the Fed employ the tool of money creation to fund a basic income on its balance sheet, at zero cost to taxpayers. The Fed should also be directed by Congress to focus on maintaining purchasing power rather than promoting full employment and price stability (see Federal Reserve Act, Section 2A)."

The fact that they are done on a community level using funding from outside of the community dodges the main negative consequence of a policy like this while showing all of the positive ones.  The policy would be truly tested if it were using currency that was only usable in the community in which the basic income was implemented and the exchange rate of that currency could be monitored as well as price levels, or if it were conducted entirely using funds from taxation of the community."

Like stating the problem with a meritocracy is not everyone can make it to the top. Isn't that the point of a meritocracy? People who are natural leaders rise up leadership chains and people who are good at designing bridges become top bridge designers.  He gets close at stating that those who are unable to achieve meritocracy shouldn't be subjugated to minimal pay and long hours, but doesn't state how a meritocracy could be improved by a UBI because it brings more people to zero rather than starting below zero, gives more people a fair shot, and more talented folks can excel rather than being brought down by poverty, class, or race. A UBI won't be the magic bullet to solve these issues, but it can certainly help.   TL;DR it was a meh article and didn't articulate on some points very well."

But that's not what meritocracy means.  Meriticracy does not mean everybody has the same advancement potential, it means that people with the same potential are allowed to achieve equal advancement / position (and, ideally but not necessarily, nobodies innate potential is worsened by circumstances of birth).  I won't argue we have true meritocracy (many things interfere with both developing potential, and advancing to the level potential should allow, or artificially advancing people with low potential) but that doesn't make the idea can never be more closely achieved.   I was trying to show that we have to scrap the whole idea of a meritocracy due to our differences    Why?  Doesn't picking the best suited for various roles among many different choices make for a better system?  Lets look at your questions:  So is it a fair meritocracy that disadvantages one when: someone may have a low IQ, someone may have struggled to learn in school because they couldn’t concentrate or didn’t have as much energy as others, someone would have been better suited to a different teaching method, someone has an anxious or unconfident personality, someone had to look after an ill relative, or because of any of the mass amounts of variables internally & externally largely and in most cases entirely out of their control?   Meritocracy is not an artificially leveled playing field between those with different ability, its only ""fair"" in the sense that any other competition is fair.  Would it be a fair meritocracy if people with substantially higher IQ's did NOT have a better outcome in fields that require IQ?  No, in fact it would not be a meritocracy at all.  There is no such thing as ‘merit’   Ah, well there you go.  I'd argue there is also no such thing as fairness in the complete absence of any merit based reward, but you seem to reject that.  In which case, what merit does your article have, vs a pile of random words typed by a baboon?  One of the things I like about basic income is it provides a floor that should support all people in achieving a high portion of their potential.  Yes, some people will be rewarded either for having more potential, or having less holding them back from developing it... but isn't it better to allow that and provide a decent base level of support to all, than to say 'nope, no matter what you do, you get the same reward as anybody else'?"
BasicIncome,3dxm4y,sebwiers,0,Mon Jul 20 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, someone wrote that in a grumpy mood! I never said that meritocracy was about having the same advancement potential. With regards to - 'it means that people with the same potential are allowed to achieve equal advancement' - nobody has the same potential, which is what I was getting at. Who said anything about getting the same reward? You've just made an assumption on that. Ultimately the idea of reward (which I assume you mean pay?) needs to stop, we need to move towards the idea of us all having equal worth regardless of what you would see as being justification for reward, that doesn't mean communism or everyone getting the same reward but about an entirely different outlook/system on things such as 'money' & 'ownership'.   I support a basic income within our current capitalist structure & for now yes I suppose your last paragraph does apply & is correct, but ultimately it would be a temporary stepping stone.  'Why? Doesn't picking the best suited for various roles among many different choices make for a better system?' - Yes for now, but you assumed that was the correct question to ask after my statement, the question is why we place value & worth on things in the first place? Merit as a concept depends on things having a value, which ultimately leads to some things having more than others, which leads to some people having more value than others, which is what we need to move away from.    Hope that answers your questions!

I don't think this assertion is coherent.  A societal meritocracy is not a democracy as such, its a meritocracy. Those with the merit are making the decisions, not the general masses.   I suppose you could call it a social meritocracy as a functioning democracy if you only got to vote on those matters you show a sufficient threshold of merit for, or as an alternative, your merit multiplied the power of your vote so as to make the votes of those without merit irrelevant.  Either way requires the entire redefinition of democracy in order to mesh meaningfully with meritocracy.   So is it a fair meritocracy that disadvantages one...   Fair.  Meritocracy.  I feel like we have a coherence problem here again. Life is not fair. We are all different, as you go to great lengths to talk about. The only fairness inherent in meritocracy is the relationship between merit and reward.  The collection of factors from whence that merit arrives is entirely tangential.  It certainly doesn't mean we shouldn't allocate the resources to level the platform from which all people start, so that things are more fair than they would be had we not taken such measures. We want everybody to become as self-actualized as possible.  A fair system allows each person to pursue what makes themselves happy and productive (which to me are mostly the same thing), without being coerced into working a stupid job.

I believe the author was quite clear on their definition of 'meritocracy' and illustrated this well by beginning his article with an accepted framework defined by the Oxford dictionary. With this in mind he set about defining the abuse of the term which has become synonymous with democracy. It would be fair to say that within the current model of democracy the author is dismayed at the the lack of opportunity provided to those who aren't positioned to succeed.  If one isn’t positioned to succeed and subsequently doesn’t, should all those who held a few more IQ points laugh off in the distance? The comments I have read in response to the author's article astound me. The replies reak of a humanity that is contrite in their disadvantage but permissive of forgetting those left behind if one manages to break the mould. Why are we fighting against those who pity the plight of a struggler.  Sure, the post you attack may have holes and may even oppose your own ideals but why fight the poor man when it's the top you despise? The underlying motive for this author to place pen on paper was not to attack you but explore how democracy could be designed to benefit all rather than a chosen few. If the naysayers in this thread insist that democracy should see losers succumb to winners than I guess your idea of a ‘basic income’ amounts to nothing more than welfare payments.   The author quite rightly envisions a society that moves beyond this mentality and embraces a world where every last one of us as are considered worthwhile contributors to society."

There is no reason to suggest that if many families receive an extra $1000 a month that anyone who doesn't own will end up losing much of that in rent increases (why not its free money) and possibly price spikes on goods when taxes go up.   This won't complete negate BI but it will mean that gains are a lot smaller which means projected increases in living standards might not happen and even in populations  that are effected by smaller increases, they may not happen either.   lastly, if the total fertility rate stays too low. That creates other problems no one needs."
BasicIncome,3dzx3l,ABProsper,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"within a generation   Or two. It's not immediate. It's a delayed effect. We have plenty of examples that a higher standard of living corresponds with a lower birth rate. The reasons for having excessive numbers of children are connected with insecurity. A BI grants security so long as it is enough to meet the basics.   It won't even qualify you to rent an apartment in many areas and that amount of income is basically constant struggle to stay afloat    There are a lot of economic distortions in the US economy thanks to the QE money that has artificially inflated prices in assets such as property and stocks. There's also no reason why someone needs to stay in a high cost area. There are no risks of moving and not finding work with a BI safety net.   Handled improperly what's meant as a universal safety net could actually end up creating a lot more homeless and hungry when prices jump a ton.  There is no reason to suggest that if many families receive an extra $1000 a month that anyone who doesn't own will end up losing much of that in rent increases (why not its free money) and possibly price spikes on goods when taxes go up.   You seem to have a specific idea of how to implement a BI. There's no reason to expect that the worst option will be chosen to cause prices to jump, that taxes on the basics will jump and that landlords will be given a green light to profiteer.   lastly, if the total fertility rate stays too low.   Immigrations is being used in many countries to offset declining birth rates."
BasicIncome,3dzx3l,goldygnome,0,Tue Jul 21 02:10:11 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree but I'm not sure the amount of BI will have that effect even in two or three generations   . Its impossible to redistribute enough to put people into the working class much less higher since the  economy is by no means post scarcity,   Also if you look at welfare states which function and a more complex BI the middle and upper tiers suffer the greatest fertility declines. The  people who are culturally and behaviorally poor stay that way and have many offspring.   That is exactly what you do not want since those cultural traits get passed on and are broadly ineducable as well. You can only train them away for some of those people, not all of them.   Also expecting people to suddenly up and move to make BI work is terrible policy. People want, nay need to be where work and family are for happiness and yes support in case of bigger emergencies   Even BI isn't going to revitalize main street America. Its just moving more   lower class  incomes into small towns which won't help.  Look at college prices and how fast they've risen from all that money . Any subsidy means price increases.   Now if you are suggesting BI come with package of price controls, state owned apartments like UK council housing and than essentially you've just lost your entire Libertarian and Conservative support base and many Democrats to the Right of Bernie  Sanders, Its meant to be a broadly applicable program not repackaged  Marxist  Welfare state crap   Also if you put price controls on housing, people won't move. We  have many examples of  the effects of that   policy right now. If you ratchet down in price controls, you had might as well have the State seize them since they will not be maintained, again something we've seen from experience  As far as immigration offsetting birth rates, true. It comes with heavy consequences, California is great example, it went from 10-15% Latino to about 45% and that is incorrectly correlated with huge declines in educational attainment. We went from top 3 to bottom 3 in education in a couple of generations and many schools are now dropout factories.   Its also reduces support for BI when millions of people who don't even speak the same language, have remotely similar customs and may be violent  are now being given free money. BI by necessity comes with closed or nearly closed borders.    What people who support BI have to understand it while its a good and workable policy choice, its not static in its effects. Its comes with very heavy consequences up to and possibly including  including economic failure."
BasicIncome,3dzx3l,ABProsper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"Also expecting people to suddenly up and move to make BI work is terrible policy   While it would be nice to allow people to live where they want, it's not practical. What if everyone ""needed"" a New York penthouse apartment to stay close to family? The line has to be drawn somewhere for the system to be sustainable.   Even BI isn't going to revitalize main street America   It probably would, at least for a while until technology catches up and does away with most main street America jobs. The people receiving money would spend it in shops and restaurants, which employ local staff and that would directly boost the economy and jobs. It could also be used to retire debt which is a huge drag on economic activity.   Now if you are suggesting BI come with package of price controls   Price controls don't work.   California is great example, it went from 10-15% Latino to about 45%   Certain parts of the US have a huge illegal immigrant issue which is largely ignored because it's very profitable for some   BI by necessity comes with closed or nearly closed borders.   Yes. The main argument for eternal population growth is to keep the pool of consumers growing so that the economy grows, tax revenue grows, and services can be funded as the elderly retire. This is a dead end because markets and populations cannot be infinite, so growth must end at some point.  In the long run, technological efficiency gains will lower the cost of providing the basics, so if it's managed with even a little bit of common sense, a balance could be achieved that will allow falling tax revenue to still meet people's needs without affecting their standard of living."

BasicIncome,3dyya2,kreael22,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:10 2015 UTC,First I do not see the source for his graphs and how no idea where the numbers he is using are from or if they are accurate. Statistics without sources are useless. I also have no idea what he means by employment % growth does he mean % of working population employed change or does he mean raw number of jobs? It's a pretty graph but ultimately pointless. Furthermore GDP does not directly equate to productivity.  Wages and productivity have been decoupled for quite along time now. That indicates an over supply of labor that has also existed for quite along time. If it was possible for a company to make money by employing that excess labor I think it would have happened by now. But 20 years after the decoupling occurred we instead had job growth begin to decouple as well.  Graph  Keep in mind I think the Guardian article is a bit pie in the sky for my taste as well.
BasicIncome,3dyya2,JonWood007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Im guessing there is a correlation, it's just weakening a little. When recessions happen, machines dont stop working, people do. So linking it to the economic cycles could still theoretically show a link between the two, if the workers are the big bottleneck.  The thing is, this doesnt make the original argument any less real. Automation isnt gonna happen over night. it's going to be a creeping normality, a slow death. We still might be a couple decades away from seeing the extent of automation, if we even see it then, our jobism might actually hold back progress on this front by insisting we keep creating new jobs for people, or we stifle automation because we want to keep people employed. These attitudes are very deeply rooted in our society, and as you can tell with Hillary's non response to UBI, very hard to change. Most people actually have trouble thinking about the kinds of things we talk about daily on this sub, which is why hillary started talking about jobs and getting ahead when you actually asked her about UBI.

BasicIncome,3dukz2,axelztangi,7,Sun Jul 19 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"When Grillo talks about ""basic income"" he really means ""guaranteed minimum income"". Despite what his minions may like to believe, the millionaire comedian-politician doesn't really know how to use the Internet so he doesn't even bother researching stuff online.  He does have some pretty unshakable beliefs though. Like the poor having to work under any condition in order to survive, or internal democracy in a political party being counterproductive. He runs his party like a corporation where he has all the shares. He even has ads on the official party blog and when campaigning he asks for donations to cover the costs.  So don't look at this guy for guidance or inspiration. By his own admission, his ideology is closer to the extreme right. He'll never allow an unconditional basic income."
BasicIncome,3dukz2,stefantalpalaru,2,Sun Jul 19 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"Here's the section on Grillo's ""basic income"" -  One of Grillo’s big economic policy ideas is to introduce a basic income of €7,200 per year for every citizen who is actively looking for a job. He would combine it with a dramatic overhaul of the tax system, scrapping income taxes and introducing a single, flat, consumption tax. “It’s income that inserts you into society, not work — so it has to be guaranteed from birth,” Grillo says. “My dream is universal income, with a completely different fiscal system to finance it.”  Given that Grillo links income to jobs (or seeking same) and at the same time says ""It’s income that inserts you into society, not work — so it has to be guaranteed from birth,” seems, to say the least, contradictory.  And it is difficult to take Grillo as an ""inspiration,"" especially if you read to the sexist concluding remarks. However, no matter what we may think of this conscious clown (as opposed to the oblivious clowns who rule us) the Five Star Movement with 1/4 of the Italian population endorsing it, cannot be dismissed.  And on another level... the question of UBI clashes with the notion of the work ethic and we, who support UBI, need to be very clear about the response. I mean for me, to simply respond that there aren't the jobs out there to support a minimum income scheme (which means if that proposal is means tested - like current unemployment benefits in the US) due to automation or outsourcing or whatever, is inadequate. It is better to stress, on the contrary, the right to a living based on the productivity of an abundant society - an abundance that today's technology is restricted from providing."

Given that Grillo links income to jobs (or seeking same) and at the same time says ""It’s income that inserts you into society, not work — so it has to be guaranteed from birth,” seems, to say the least, contradictory.   Maybe the party's proposed ""citizenship income"" law can clarify things. They want the beneficiary to be at the disposal of the employment office for any job opportunity that might arise (and make a weekly visit there), and they must also ""volunteer"" a minimum of 4 hours weekly for public service work.

If you poor choices has left you in a place where rent cost is preventing you entrepreneurship, then that is your fault. Should of made better life choices."

Basic income solves many problems, one of which is excessive inequality.  Due to automation, more and more money will accrue at the top. Too much inequality will be devastating for the economy. It would be cheaper to just deal some of that out to the bottom."
BasicIncome,3dqmej,Jay27,0,Mon Jul 20 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"one of which is excessive inequality.   Honestly, I don't see this as an issue. Yes it is crazy that there are a few people with so much money, but that is really not an issue.   What is an issue is when people cannot succeed on their own, which is not the case (at least today).    Due to automation, more and more money will accrue at the top.   No, capital accrues capital. Automation is just the latest line of work that companies can make money from; one hundred years ago it was trains and coal, today is bits and bytes.    Too much inequality will be devastating for the economy.    Not sure about that one, inequality itself does not devastate the economy; lack of opportunity does, which is the real issue with automation. We have to make changes to our system so that our workers can become more skilled to remain relevant.    Becoming a welfare state simply does not work."
BasicIncome,3dqmej,GadflyIII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"1. Excessive inequality is definitely bad for the economy. This is just a documented fact.  2. First you deny that automation will cause money to accrue at the top. Then you go on to confirm it. Automation makes it possible for fewer people to create more wealth in smaller timeframes using smaller resources. WhatsApp makes as much with 35 employees as Kodak did with a hundred thousand.  3. Basic income has absolutely nothing to do with welfare. It obviates the need for welfare, if anything.  A long time ago, humans spent all their time hunting and gathering. Then, farming came along. Foodstocks piled up and humans were free to do more productive stuff.   It is the same with wealth. Due to automation, there will be so much wealth available, it would not make any sense not to redistribute some of it.  Basic income is inevitable. Every technologically advanced society eventually gets it. It is merely nature taking its course."

BasicIncome,3dqmej,Ghandithegman,21,Sun Jul 19 07:03:38 2015 UTC,"Here is my take. You have guys like Elon Musk, that didn't start out with a trust fund, or inheritance or Very wealthy parents. So people would say 'he is a hard worker and he earned it'.   But there is still alot of luck involved in Elon Musks succes even though he doesn't have rich parents.   He was born in a family where his father was an engineer, and he lived and grew up in a middle class lifestyle. This is his first lucky point.   He was interested in programming, from an early age, when the internet started coming up in the late nineties, he was lucky because he cultivated the skills to come up with an innovative idea. Purely because he happened to be intersted in something that was very lucrative field at the time. (ofcourse, maybe it had to do with his father being an engineer, or the books he happened to have stumbled upon or the friends he had, or the events in his life that influenced the amount of interest he had in computer programming)  I am not saying that Elon Musk is not a hard worker or intelligent. But what is the cause of his intelligence and work ethic?  The way he thinks and the habits he picked up are a product of his enviroment parents, friends, role-models etc.. these are completely random to where you are born.  He was lucky in a way that he was born in an enviroment , with parents, friends, rolemodels, books that influence him and events that influenced him , that made him have the habits and understanding to create 'succes' in this freemarket.   The way his life went and the information and knowledge he was exposed to, is a product of pure luck (Maybe there is a destiny, but we don't know yet, so we call it luck)  and that all add up and cumulated to his success.   Now if Elon Musk was the one educating all people of earth, we maybe wouldn't even need basic income, since I THINK, and assume, that Elon Musk way of think is that of doing that which improves all lives of human beings. Most of the time that has something to do with technology, engineering, problem solving.   Our educational system has very little of that, and that our parents did not get very much of this way of thinking, so they couldn't/can't pass it on."
BasicIncome,3dqmej,rooky2222,34,Sat Jul 18 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"According to his biography, Musk was given unlimited access to books, and his parents bought him ""everything he was interested in"", including a computer when they were very expensive. They had their own small plane, which they would vacation with often...I don't know many middle class families with that.  He read a lot of science fiction books, which gave him a strong sense of the future. This is largely why he feels solely responsible for getting the human race onto another planet (and neatly ties in with his interest in solar power and electric cars).   When he started Zip2, while he was working with very little, his father still gave him seed money, and he did the rest. This allowed him to work on a startup without worrying about basic things like food and shelter. He did well enough from this to not need further assistance.  To his credit, he drank the water, and not all horses do."

My parents are moderately well off, my mother is in designing and retail so I know how small businesses are run. The first rule of starting any business is always capital, the second rule is connections and the third is hard work. Without capital, you need a lot of luck to hit that jackpot idea and a lot of effort to make it work. With capital, it is so much easier, because at least you have a decent shot.   Many people are willing to work very hard to succeed but they will never make it to be successful entrepreneurs simply because they start off with so little.

This is largely thanks to the AHCA, which requires employers to provide health insurance to anyone working over 30 hours/week.  McDonald's will not be giving the minimum wage burger flipper more than 30 hours per week.    So.  This person is making $940/month, minus $500/month for rent.  That leaves this person with $440/month to spend on all other expenses.  You stated that you can feed yourself for ~$200/month.  So after food expenses, this person has $240 left to spend on other expenses.    Using this calculator I figured that someone driving a 20 mile round trip commute to work 29 hours per week would spend approximately $50/month in gas.  This person now has $190 to spend for the month.    A cell phone plan with Ting will cost about $30/month.  This person now has $160 to spend for the month.    Assuming that this person has no other expenses EVER, it will take about 15.5 years to save $30,000 for their start-up.  My math assumes $160 in savings per month.  $160*12= $1920 saved per year."

It essentially doubles minimum wage if you hit the 40 hour threshold which reduces the number of available jobs for unskilled workers by a significant number.   It should just be illegal for you to pay employees with medical benefits. You aren't allowed to pay people with something other than cash, it doesn't make sense that you are able to pay them in medical benefits.   This is my opinion on the issue.   So. minimum wage budget   Yeah, minimum wage dudes are going to have to live a very frugal lifestyle.  They are, however, gaining experience in their job and exposing themselves to potential advancement within the company they are working for.  If they are able to increase that 30 hr/week minimum wage gig to a 40 hour/week $10/hr gig over the course of 2 years, now they have more money.

BasicIncome,3dqmej,BegorraOfTheCross,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:52:57 2015 UTC,"Child labor laws prevent someone who is 14 and probably fully capable of getting a job from working. So only ""rich kids"" can get a job in some kind of family business and learn how to work.  No one at 14 has a degree. Most schools suck, but at the least a basic education is obtainable.  When I was 14, I read everything. Not just kids books. I read tons of history. I read an old encyclopedia we got for free at the end of a garage sale. We had stacks of National Geographic that my mom bought from the thrift store for $.10 each. I spent hours each day reading those things. I read Popular Science, Poular Mechanics, and any sort of technology related magazine I could get my hands on. My mom had a paper route that us kids helped with, and I would dig for tech magazines when we dropped paper off at the recycle dumpster.  You can get all this and more on the internet these days.  We didn't have jack for money, but I did have both a mom and a dad, so I did have social support.  Someone who is 14 would have to determine what they really wanted out of life, and avoid the crap that would derail them. If they wanted to get 30k and own a business, I would suggest they avoid drugs, parties, bad friends, and bad situations as much as possible. Learn as much as possible about varied topics, personal finance, accounting, art, business, tech, science, engineering, every topic one might be remotely interested in. Strive to be a Renaissance Man, but also learn a trade or vocation. You can always get a job doing something. Work hard in school. Don't get stuck in a rut, keep looking for better work opportunitys. Save money, don't spend it. Spending money should cause pain. Work as hard as you can.  TLDR:  Hard work and diligence.  A widely varied and thinking/problem solving education.

If I actually manage to ... am I prepared to sink it into a business that may fail?  For someone who has a few million dollars in their back pocket, this isn't even a question. For someone who is tying the ends together it's a serious question with serious, possibly life-altering, consequences. 30k could help in buying a house or a car or putting it in a college fund for kids ... if that is all you can save up for in a few years you have to seriously consider if you're willing to give it up if your business fails. While buying a house won't make you any money, it definitely seems like a more sane investment than starting a business in a market like this.  If I fail I risk a hell of a lot more than someone for whom 30k is absolutely nothing. And let's please be honest I already come from a privileged position because I am educated and hold a job which pays reasonably (all things considered). What about people without (much of) an education, with kids to take care of, who have to hang on to whatever shit job they can get or risk ending up on the street?

Nobody works 2 jobs just so they can afford an iphone (ok, maybe some do but I seriously doubt that's any kind of majority among the poor), they do it so they can survive. Calling this a lack of discipline is disingenuous to say the least. If you don't make all the right choices the second you learn to talk, apparently you lack discipline. If you're a 16 year old who does a little worse in school and doesn't get all the right scholarships you're lazy ... please.  Perhaps you were the perfect student and made all the right choices and if so I applaud you for that but that doesn't make it right to turn the people who may have been a little more foolish when they were young into slaves to society."

Yeah, the government regulation and inflation are two giant costs for me long term.  I'd like them minimized so that I maintain control of a higher percentage of my income.  I'm not sure how wall-street speculation has much relevance aside from the fact that it causes stock market bubbles.

The point I'm making is that if you don't take out debt, the impact of these bubbles on your personal life is reduced significantly.  In fact, if you accumulate assets, you benefit from the plummeting prices that accompanies the bursting of bubbles.  When you have no debt and you in stead save all of the money that you would have put toward paying down your debts, you don't really care if your job disappears because you aren't reliant on your next pay check to pay off your loans.  Loans are responsible for the cascading effect of the consequences of these bubbles popping, as well as the run up in price that defines the bubble in the first place.  Just find a way to live without debt and you don't have to deal with the insanity that the debt slaves face when they make stupid decisions and things start to fall apart.   I've laid out my story, if you've got some genuine advice, I'd love to hear it.   It's tough to give any advice outside of paying off your debts, but once you do that, continue to live as you did while you were in debt and use the money that you would have spent on debt to put into savings.  You already made your bed with your decision to go to school on credit for a degree that you can't monetize.  That means that the risk you took when you took on the debt was a failure.

I would imagine that many teachers are financially irresponsible themselves, which would even lead the education system to indoctrinate children into irresponsible habits.  I'm sure you're going to lean toward basic income as some sort of panacea for irresponsibility, but I'm definitely not convinced.  There's plenty of people out there with huge incomes who are still broke, and giving people who are irresponsible a greater percentage of society's wealth doesn't seem like a rational solution to that problem.

Also note, that well paying jobs have a bigger chance of getting automated than lower paying ones, as long as they're well defined enough.  So traditional welfare really isn't going to cut it and we'd probably do best in providing everyone a basic level of security and liquidity to become entrepreneurs, as you said.

But it's a waste of human potential better used otherwise, sadly. I'm pro diversity. Especially considering some STEM qualities or what you get from Ritalin, are not particularly useful in finding problems to solve, finding market opportunities and social opportunities to improve the world, or just opportunities to make yourself some good money.  All it gives you is improved access to skill sets that are increasingly redundant. (Especially if we gave everyone the setup to excel at STEM subjects. There's only so much money going into providing for these people, depending on state funding and entrepreneurs seeing value in em.

Sure, let all the regulators go and they can take a basic income and figure out other ways of changing behavior, than through finger-wagging and rule enforcement. We should figure out how to motivate people to want to do good, and reward them for it, or at least not punish them with poverty and marginalization.  ""Critics of wage subsidies such as the NIT say that they will incentivize employers to push wages down, since the government will make up for it.""  Where's the problem? Fund government through the Fed, without involuntary taxation. The Fed has unlimited liquidity as it demonstrates every day in the Fed Funds market when deficit banks come to borrow from it so they can put off final settlement for another day. The Fed has no limits on what it can supply, it can meet all demands. The market has tested the Fed's liquidity, in 2008, and the Fed won; the Fed has proved it has unlimited liquidity.  Thus, the Fed can put a basic income on its balance sheet, at zero cost to taxpayers.  ""Critics of wage subsidies such as the NIT say that they will incentivize employers to push wages down, since the government will make up for it.""  The key is to realize that the money supply is growing, exponentially. Most of the increase, tens or hundreds of trillions of dollars per year, goes to the private sector.

The value judgement to make here is whether or not society would be better with or without this particular product being produced. People want it - enough - to pay for it if they don't also have to pay for the externality of several thousand workers not having jobs. So as a result of this setup of the rules, the market doesn't have two things - several thousand jobs - and a product that people would be interested in purchasing at a low price.

Mainly the optional vs non-optional items in life.  Let us say you need 10 humans to produce 100 pizzas per day at a reasonable pace where the people are using machines to aid them in their word. They use an oven instead of a firepit. They use giant blenders to mix the dough.  Now let's say we replace the ten workers with 1 that is the manager to oversee the work doesn't get messed up somehow. We have allowed 10 workers to not work a menial job.  In order for those 10 people to still buy things such as the pizza, they would need some kind of value to spend. This would have to be derived from the system. Since our system is very small and only considers the pizza we look at the value of the pizza based on resources and labor to create it and then can see how much value the people that would buy the pizza would need to buy some pizza from that place. You also have to add in the value of the people buying the pizza other than the 10 employees that were displaced. Assuming 100 pizzas are sold each day to non-employees we can say we have to make 110 pizzas a day. Some of the cost of running the business is to pay the people that own it and the tax man and all the other folks that have to get paid. So you add the pizzas value and the value that is added based on costs required to keep the business afloat and the owner paid.  You have displaced 10 employees that somehow fed 110 people and paid the taxes and the owner and was doing well and making profits that were not nessesary.  The money spent to run the replacements is going to cost less than the workers ever would have cost. Let us say that the replacements  to the workers costs 50% of the normal workers costs.  You are still making healthy profits, are basically only employing 5 people, but still are making the same output. These employees don't require income taxes.  By reducing the number of entities able to pay an income tax, we end up hurting the country as we don't have enough money to pay for stuff we need to be paying for.  What can be done is to create a model in a computer with all that setup and all the other entities and such that need put into place. Then run the whole thing as one equation and you will find the balances of taxing and where to do it best in order to provide the outcomes you want. You have to put all the fun little bits and bobs into the system though or you end up with a very messy result.

In my counter-scenario here it makes more money for the owner to close out his pizza place and invest in a new enterprise that has one manager and makes 110 pizzas a day. The lack of direct tie between the corp that employed 5 and the corp that employs 1 releases him from the liability of providing the value entirely.  The other side of it would be to say that you have to tax the value at what it would take to do the job without any machines at all - hand mixing, tossing, hand-firing a brick oven hand-built for the purpose.  The use of machines might be increasing your profit level presently but without the value judgement of approving of your use of machines instead of humans for these tasks, we have to tax the value generated in accordance with the lost human jobs don't we?  Why are we approving of some automation and not complete automation?  Is our current state somehow blessed acceptable and the future state of less employment is not?  Why?  one of the ideas that has been proposed to me by somebody close to me (I don't know where he got the idea) is to pay people who are eliminated from the work force UBI, and pay people who find ways of eliminating people from the workforce double or triple ubi.  This is the society saying to the workers, we are very sorry that there is no longer any work for you.  here, have this a secure income and go do what you want. It says to the eliminator person, Good Job. You have benefitted society and earned a bounty on being such an effective humanist to eliminate people from doing stupid work. Please have this comfortable income and go do what you want.   This provides an interesting way to transition onto a UBI - for those people who currently have work now, while encouraging automation.  And encouraging the automation will skyrocket productivity, don't you think?"
BasicIncome,3dqzlz,skylos,0,Sun Jul 19 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"As soon as the combine was created, automation had already altered the economy forever.  I'm unsure what metrics are the good ones to pick. The reason is that some jobs are just crap and we should consider them crap. I mean why should doing the laundry take an entire day? Why should drying the laundry involve hanging and taking it down and hoping that stuff didn't fly away or get filled with hog poo smell?  However when it comes to something like the combine, I think we have to consider a few consequences of being able to only feed your family to being able to feed hundreds of families. That is a pretty crazy thing. HOWEVER it somehow has to be tied to supply and demand at their most real levels. What I mean by that is that the supply should be potential supply, not current supply. This is because that is the manufacturing and delivery mechanisms potential value which gives you how many people could be possible if running full tilt.  Now we should consider that some machines are just tools while others would be human replacements. For instance, we have a small truck vs a massive truck. I don't think we would ever really compare a person's carrying capacity vs a wagon or truck. That would be silly... or would it? Maybe you see something I don't.  I don't know what other metrics at the moment. I am tired and a bit annoyed at things at the moment. I'll try again some other day."

Sure for someone making exactly $20000 that is an extra $1600 of in pocket income, but it means making $21000 puts you worst off... or so is the impression I get from the way they have worded it.

We must understand that purchasing power is unaffected by even hyperinflation, if the Fed increases incomes in lockstep with prices. Knowing that government will maintain purchasing power, and having unrestricted ability to lower costs by cutting wages and jobs, why would businesses raise prices just because the poor can now have some dignity?"

Every other business on the planet should be wanting lower rents since it means people will have more money to go out and buy other things, things they cannot currently afford like cars, computers, new TVs, furniture, etc. Even more money to go to college.

If rents got too high in cities, people could just decide to move to rural areas and live off of the UBI, thus bringing rents rents back down.

You don't have to force people to do things in order to progress. Plenty of people do things because they are passionate about it. To think that would go away, is silly. In fact, the opposite would happen. People, generally, would become more productive at what they do, meaning less people would have to work because you have less people contributing more actual work.  Unless you think having a bunch of employees where half of them stare off and do other things unproductive for half of their work week simply because they are expected to, not because they want to, is productive and economical. But it isn't.  You don't need to force people to work for progress. It will happen period. All that changes is people will have more of a choice of who they want to help progress, as opposed to getting stuck with whatever you can get. Which happens far more often that one might think."
