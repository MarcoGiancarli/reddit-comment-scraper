travel,3e2mqo,QuasarMonsanto,128,Tue Jul 21 20:10:09 2015 UTC,I should go to Albania.
travel,3e2mqo,Kittyfiever,67,Tue Jul 21 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry about hijacking your comment, but I think most of you guys would love some tips.  Here is a list of tips if you want to travel in Albania.  Public Transportation  Don't even think to use trains. They are old. Use minibuses (called furgons here) or buses. Taxi prices are a lot more expensive than minibuses but they get the job done faster.  Communication  English isn't very well spread here, and you should try to learn some words. Try finding young guys and girls because they can translate and help you with everything.  Money  Albania has adopted a new ""Lek""(Albanian Currency) which removes one 0 from the price, which means 100LEK (New) = 1000LEK (Old). Most people use the old currency when communicating. (The price is the same though, just the way it is spoken changes).  Partying  Try Albanian night clubs. Really, just try them.  Drinking  Raki - Albania's favorite drink. It's a traditional drink and it's stronger than ""rakia"". Home-brewed ones are stronger than commercial ones, be careful with that. Also, beer is very high-quality and cheap. In most of the bars you can get a big glass of beer for ~1.2$.  Eating  Try Albanian fast foods, really nice food if you want to get away with spending less. Burgers cost 2$ (maximum, in most places it goes down to 90 cent) and a can of Coke is mostly 1$. If you want to try traditional foods most restaurants serve it.  What to visit  From North to south:  Shkodra, really beautiful city with a big lake.  The Albanian Alps that you saw in the photos.  Durres beaches.  The capital, Tirana.  Elbasan (My city is worth mentioning here). You will find some antiquity sites here.  Berat, a UNESCO city. Don't miss this, one of the most beautiful places here.  Pogradec, a beautiful, cold and quiet city. Lake Ohrid looks beautiful from there.  The South Albanian Riviera (All the photos with beaches and sea are in the south riviera).  Saranda, beautiful city.  Syri i Kalter, beautiful place - search it on Google.  There are too much places that I may have missed, and fellow Albanians surely will post them here.  Please ask me if you have any other questions."

Dubrovnik was basically as touristy as San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, but pretty. It was a lot of cruise ship tourists, unloading by the thousands every day.

Visit Butrint the next morning - one of the best, ancient sites in Europe, spend the afternoon on the beach and then have dinner at Lekuras for sunset (it's an old fort on a hill that has amazing views of the sea).  Then hit Gjirokaster to see the dictators home + the castle. Maybe spend the night here.  Head north to Berat which is just beautiful and deserves it's UNESCO status.  Then maybe go to the more middle Albania beaches like Dhermi, there is also a beautiful castle on the coast but i can't remember the name.  Hit Tirana for a day at most (I am biased against Tirana but it really isn't that great for tourists) and see the old mosque, the bunker museum and go out for a night of partying.  Then hit Kruje for the castle, and then further north to Shkoder to see the castle + lakes. And if you have time head to Kukes and see the kosovan border area which can be extremely beautiful.  Albania has lots going for it, and could be a great tourist destination. It is for the most part extremely safe for tourists, and the people are very welcoming.

travel,3e2mqo,ukfashman,6,Tue Jul 21 16:35:05 2015 UTC,I went to Tirana about 5 years ago and the drive through the winding  mountain roads on a minibus was pretty epic and scary. Great food and it's very cheap. I would've loved to see some more of the country side/beaches/mountains too.
travel,3e2mqo,Zogolli,5,Tue Jul 21 16:00:53 2015 UTC,I wonder how you should travel there. It's not part of the interrail network but I assume the public transport is alright?

We started in Dubrovnik and you make your way through to Sarande over the course of four days.  It was pretty affordable, and the tour guide was a 20 something Albanian who gave a tremendous tour.  It was great for us as we were looking for a way to get form Croatia to Greece but wanted to do better than simple bussing from point A to B.  Amazing and beautiful country, it is still at the top of my list for favourite places I've been to."

travel,3e2mqo,ezzyezborn28,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:43 2015 UTC,I went to Saranda in Albania (just over the water from Corfu) last year for two weeks and rented an apartment with a couple of friends and it was pretty much amazing.   The city/town itself seemed very much in development as there was construction everywhere outside the very center but there were plenty of amazing places to go that wasn't far away at all such as the Blue Eye and Butrint.  Since we lived in an apartment we bought a lot of stuff at the local farmers market and cooked for ourselves but there are also plenty of restaurants if you rather fancy that. I'd recommend anyone going there without hesitation.

For me the mountains on the Montenegro border were the most beautiful part of Albania. There is a very strong tradition of hospitality in the Albanian culture and I found friendly people everywhere. You can also eat very well there though the diet is a little meat heavy. My only worry is that because of all these positive comments Albania will become ruined by tourists."

I think if they don't do better in the next decade, those beaches won't be very enjoyable.   Also not a lot of preservation of old architecture and customs. Lots of new buildings with little sense of style. A sense of ""if we build it, they will come"" to their construction projects in cities, but I'm not sure that anyone is coming...   Weird place.

travel,3dybsc,Nolat,103,Mon Jul 20 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"I've had these types of problems several times on both Spirit and Frontier, which both follow a similar discount model.  The bottom line is that their networks are just far too sparse to be able to offer any kind of buffer for cancellations.  A major network carrier like Delta can almost always re-accommodate, whether that's via a different connection city or on the following day's flight.  But Spirit and Frontier may not have a flight the following day, and don't really support making connections as they don't really follow the hub-and-spoke model.  Instead they just throw 50 bucks at you and hope you'll just accept the refund and leave them alone.  The staff at the airport are not empowered to rebook, and call centers are thrown completely over capacity from even just once cancellation.  I was on a Frontier flight that cancelled, and they were pretty much just announced 'it's cancelled, next flight in 2 days, we can't do anything here... call in and get your voucher. Goodnight!'  Interestingly, I had this work out in my favor once with Spirit... I wasn't going to make the flight, and didn't bother to cancel because I wouldn't have really gotten anything back with the change fee.  Then, I later found out it was cancelled and was able to claim a voucher and a refund."

travel,3dybsc,vbfronkis,10,Mon Jul 20 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"The decline of Frontier always makes me a bit sad. I used to fly them a lot in the early 2000s since they had good availability between the Bay Area and the Midwest. I eventually started using United when I met my wife because she had status with them. Apparently everything went downhill once Republic bought them in 2009. Maybe it started going downhill earlier but it seems like that cemented it.  Republic also bought Midwest Airlines (formerly Midwest Express) which was an amazing airline back in the 1980s and 1990s. Unfortunately it was a business model that they couldn't keep up with financially. They really were luxurious for the time. Their entire planes up until the late 1990s or so were two wide with leather seats. Basically what you get in business class today on most domestic airlines. Free freshly baked cookies, champagne, etc. I used to love flying them. Republic bought them around the same time as Frontier and eventually killed them off. By that time though they were three wide with seats and a lot of the amenities had gone away.  Anyway, yeah Republic can go fuck themselves pretty much."
travel,3dybsc,bg-j38,4,Mon Jul 20 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"Frontier has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  Last year I showed up to the airport 3 hours before my domestic flight was set to leave & there was no one at the Frontier desks to check people in or to take checked baggage.  The line kept building with people starting to call Frontier's hotlines and running around trying to get security to find their employees.  Eventually someone came...and there was 1 line open to deal with at least 70 people trying to get on their flights.  We got to our terminal about 40 minutes before our flight left.  If we had arrived at the airport at the normal 1.5 to 2 hours prior to boarding time for in-country flights, like most people do, and this had happened then we would have missed our flight.  I know other people did miss their flights because a few women were getting frantic waiting in line after we had all been standing there for an hour.  If I have another choice that's only moderately more expensive, I would go with the competitor instead of Frontier."
travel,3dybsc,frostfromfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:11 2015 UTC,Our flight was delayed on Frontier once because the Flight Attendant called out sick so they had to find a substitute.

travel,3dybsc,jlt6666,34,Tue Jul 21 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"Also remember that Spirit doesn't have interlining agreements. So beyond the fact that it's super hard for them to rebook people when they have to cancel a flight, they also can't rebook on other airlines without actually purchasing a ticket for you (at retail pricing). Part of the built in cost of the ""legacy"" airlines is that they can rebook you on their competitors should something like this happen.   The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is always at play. People don't realize that if you pay more, you get more and they just look at the upfront price. Well how much time are you going to waste accommodating your schedule.  Spirit only makes sense to me if your expectations are low and your margin for error is high. If you understand that you are getting a barebones point A to point B transport, and you just want to transport yourself and a few personal items, it makes awesome sense. You can totally game the system if you are traveling by yourself with a small bag, don't care when you leave, when you get there, or if your flight is canceled. But they have built the system to basically surprise the average uneducated consumer by offering a low up front price and making you pay for things that are commonly understood to be standard. It's arguably very close to a bait and switch scheme for those people who have no idea how these things work."
travel,3dybsc,irelayer,18,Mon Jul 20 18:13:54 2015 UTC,I took it once and all their extra charges like 'boarding passes' and 'water' made it cost just as much as a normal airline would have in the long run. Plus I got horrible service. Never again.
travel,3dybsc,sexlexia_survivor,7,Mon Jul 20 19:26:27 2015 UTC,What the heck is the charge for boarding passes? Like you have to pay to print them at the airport or what?
travel,3dybsc,thefeline,26,Mon Jul 20 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah- They have a $10 for printing and the kiosk and $20 if you had issues and needed to go talk to an agent to get it printed. Your bags were a lot more if you didn't pre-pay for them more than 48 hours in advance or something like that, and double if you need to check something the day of. They will also charge you for carry on if its larger than a small purse, and if you didn't pre-pay it is like $60.     The one that bothered me is your seat is not guaranteed, and you don't choose your seats. So if you are traveling with someone, its extra if you want to reserve your seat or sit next to your buddy, and that was like $20 per seat.  But it isn't like southwest either where its every man for himself, they still assign you seats, just not next to your companion. And again, if they overbook and you can't fit, too bad, cuz you didn't pay to guarantee your seat.   I actually didn't get hit with any of many these fees (we did pre-pay for a checked bags which was like $50 EACH WAY). What got me is I spilled coffee all over myself while in the plane and they wouldn't give me water, napkins, or a cup to use water from the bathroom without paying for a drink. I just went into the bathroom and washed my dress in the sink. The stewardess was a brat. I'm kind of surprised they even had bathrooms really.  Anyways, Southwest would have cost the same because you get free checked bags, plus you get snacks and drinks on Southwest and everyone is super nice."

travel,3dybsc,eromitlab,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:51 2015 UTC,"I was talking to a gate agent for Southwest when a flight was delayed once in Minneapolis.  They're expanding the budget airline terminal, but it's still tiny, so Spirit and Southwest are right next to each other.    The agent told me they loved having Spirit there because they were so bad some people would rebook on Southwest right there.  Each time Spirit cancelled a flight, the Southwest people would kind of make it known that the passengers could book with them and make it to their destination that day.  They earn a bunch of customers doing that, more than if JetBlue or Virgin had won the gates."

travel,3dybsc,Brickie78,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"I won't fly Spirit but I have no problem flying Ryanair. (well, I don't like it, but if it's going where I want at the right price...whatever)  The main difference is EC261, and Ryanair being liable to pay you more money than your ticket was worth if they don't get you there on time. They are actually somewhat reliable and will rebook you on other carriers if it's absolutely necessary."
travel,3dybsc,LupineChemist,11,Tue Jul 21 08:08:25 2015 UTC,"According to any source I can find the kiosks are free to print a boarding pass and it only costs $10 if you need a agent to do it. You can also check in online and print your boarding pass as home.  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579214260795108536  https://customersupport.spirit.com/hc/en-us/articles/202098006-How-can-I-check-in-and-get-my-boarding-pass-  It's entirely possible to fly extremely cheaply on these airlines, you just need to know the rules and follow then exactly. I haven't flown Spirit specifically but I regularly fly Ryanair in Europe and Air Asia in Asia which have all these same sort of fees for any extras and I have NEVER been caught out paying more than the ticket price. I don't bring more than the one carry on bag, I am fine risking that I won't be able to sit with a companion, I bring my own water bottle and I (usually) don't eat anything, or otherwise bring my own sandwich. It's not difficult, you just have to not have a sense of entitlement to anything beyond the airline getting you from A to B.  I acknowledge in this case the airline didn't get him from A to B, but that's what travel insurance is for if you are on one of these airlines, they even usually offer to sell it to you automatically when booking and you have to explicitly deselect it."
travel,3dybsc,blorg,3,Mon Jul 20 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"I've flown on hundreds of RyanAir and AirAsia flights in the past few years. I've also flown Spirit a few times and they really do take the tricky nickel and dime policies to the next level.  I never got caught out, but I saw dozens of people paying for things they didn't expect when I flew with them last time. Actually, maybe it's just that Americans aren't used to the budget model now that I think about it."
travel,3dybsc,9to5traveler,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely not $10. But here under ""other"" it does say that they charge $2 for it which doesn't seem too unreasonable for a budget airline"
travel,3dybsc,reddit3200,3,Tue Jul 21 00:38:32 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what happended to me. After I paid for seats, my carry on (both ways). I wound up pay as much as a normal carrier with shittier service. never a fucking again"
travel,3dybsc,siqniz,11,Tue Jul 21 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is always at play. People don't realize that if you pay more, you get more and they just look at the upfront price. Well how much time are you going to waste accommodating your schedule.   But why is this only true in the US? Budget airlines in Europe maybe aren't as nice as the big guys, and they'll nickle-and-dime the hell out of you, but you'll get to your destination on time. Frankly, if an airline can't be trusted to fulfill the basic requirement of transporting their customers with reasonable reliability, what are they good for?"
travel,3dybsc,anti09,16,Mon Jul 20 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Short answer is: consumer protections are better in Europe (specifically the EU).  Long answer is: Contract of carriage is probably a bit different with Spirit. Spirit probably compensates you the minimum amount if they leave you stranded.  Keep in mind, Spirit is attempting to apply the ""Ultra Low Cost Carrier"" business model to the US market. The closest equivalent of Spirit (indeed, what they modeled themselves after) in Europe is Ryan Air, who are notorious for stranding passengers, nickel and diming, flying from remote airports far from the cities they serve, and packing as many people as possible into an aircraft. Southwest, on the other hand, is more akin to what you'll find with EasyJet, which is to say not too bad. In both cases, the suitability of the respective business models depend a bit on the geography of the US vs. Europe. In Europe, the distances are relatively short, sectors are generally 1-2 hours maximum, and anything 3+ hours is really considered ""long haul"". Compare that to the US, where the idea of a ""short"" sector is stretched a bit to include stuff like CA-Texas (which can be 3+ hours) or NYC-Florida. This is not to mention transcons or midcons (SAN-ORD, for example). So as the distances are larger, comfort becomes more of a factor, and you'll see a corresponding increase in complaints. You can go without water for 1 hour, but how about 3 or 4 hours? This question of geography becomes a factor when you realize that, for Spirit to get another plane out to an outstation from a hub would take hours if not next day because of the distances involved, and the fact that they are utilizing their aircraft to the maximum extent possible. There is absolutely no slack in the schedule. That's how they can sell you that cheap fare in the first place. So if a plane is simply broken, and they can't rebook you on other airlines, and you can't drive to your destination (like you could maybe in Europe), then you are super screwed."

travel,3dybsc,Kdogg2,65,Mon Jul 20 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"I looked at their contract of carriage and customer service plan. Page 33 section 7.2 says they may rebook you on the next available flight. The wording used appears that they won't voluntarily do this - but you have to specifically request it.   More importantly their customer service plan - which they must file with the DOT - page 46 section 12 - says that they must work with you to rebook on another flight. The Department of Transportation enforces violations of this plan. I suggest you file a complaint with the Department of Transportation, unless you want ""more"" from Spirit. If you want more from Spirit contact them and tell them if you don't get what you expect that you'll file a complaint with the DOT.  That will get their attention."
travel,3dybsc,nlderek,27,Mon Jul 20 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing this to me, wouldn't have thought to find this on my own. I'm going to do my due diligence, and file a complaint with the DoT. Although I'm sure they've accounted for the cost of complaints/fees in their business model, so this is probably just standard operating practice :/  I definitely don't want to fly with Spirit again."

If you have vacation, wedding, or any kind of real plans when you get there pay a little more for a decent airline"

travel,3dybsc,RiverboatCarter,7,Mon Jul 20 23:22:02 2015 UTC,Oddly the only time I've flown Spirit was to have lunch with my girlfriend in Houston. With some coupon they had at the time the round trip was like 35 dollars. I spent more on the supershuttle.  At the same time though I do fly frontier a lot but I live at the hub so maybe thats why I've never had a canceled flight. They've really cut back on flights and the schedules are pretty shitty now so I'm just using my points and switching to another airline. I don't have high standards but I'm not taking a domestic flight at 7am or 11:59pm. Ain't got time for that shit.

I think they still showed why they are a budget airline and I would be hesitant to use them based on your story.  But the way your wrote it makes it sound like they cancelled your flight, kept your money and offered you $50 in future credit.    Which is somewhat believable in that if a flight on some airlines is cancelled due to weather, they will usually get you on another flight, but they take no responsibility and you have no real priority and do not get a hotel room paid for."
travel,3dybsc,Sptsjunkie,17,Mon Jul 20 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is flights increase in cost the closer you get towards that date - so refunding her $200, when the cost to get to the same destination at the same time is now $700, is pretty shady."

With the $50 back plus the original flight coming back you (eventually), was the difference more than a couple hundred bucks?  That seems low enough to not cancel an entire vacation over.  Edit: I see you paid $200, so with the $50 you only needed $250 to get there at the last minute.  Not worth cancelling your vacation over."
travel,3dybsc,MMSTINGRAY,17,Mon Jul 20 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"Not worth cancelling your vacation over.   Depends on how much extra $$ you have laying around, and how many people are going on the trip.

When I called them, alarmed, a week before the flight, they offered only to refund me for the value of the second leg.  Not the first leg.  And certainly not the value of buying a ticket that day, which was several hundred dollars more than what I originally paid.   I told them I had to investigate other options.  When I called back wanting that offered refund, they told me they could no longer give it.  Spirit Airlines is a fraud and a sham.  My story, and this guy's story, are not unique.  You can search /r/travel... it's come up before.  The DoJ or other relevant department should have shut them down a long time ago.

The plane supposed to pick us up was coming from Atlantic City, and couldn't leave because of a storm between it and us.  The girl at the counter was doing her best to be helpful until some rando (assuming a manager or someone)  took over and said ""Either you accept the refund,  or get scheduled on another flight. Of you get scheduled for another flight it's totally up to you if you want to go or not."" What an excellent solution! Thanks genius.   That was also my first experience at seeing how desperate people can become to get to their destination. When I went to other airline terminals to see if flights were available to Houston, there were people 'discreetly' approaching others in line and offering them cash to take their spot in line. Also my goodness the instant my flight got cancelled I looked up other flights and American had a 1 way ticket for about $300 when I entered the line. By the time I got to the counter it was up to $800.   So disappointed in Spirit for not even offering something for my time."

If you are delayed, ask the airline staff if it will pay for meals or a phone call. Some airlines, often those charging very low fares, do not provide any amenities to stranded passengers. Others may not offer amenities if the delay is caused by bad weather or something else beyond the airline's control. Contrary to popular belief, for domestic itineraries airlines are not required to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled.

They don't have airline agreements with other airlines, they don't transfer bags, and everything costs extra. Usually fairs are non-refundable from what I've seen, so you can't change days. If they are changeable, the price is usually more than a new ticket or at about the same level. They contract their tech support, their ground handling, their above wing operations, and their reservations. They are an airline that operations in the margins on a razor's edge of profitability by reducing cost at all costs. Anyone who operates their business like that is NOT worth your time."

After reading a lot of other comments, and having spent my share of time on many flights as a former software consultant for 8 years, I'm going to chime in with my own $0.02 story:  Basically, I got a pair of slightly cheaper than typical RT tickets to Florida for my wife and I.  We travel pretty light, so why not give it a go, right?  However, Spirit has this great new thing where they charge you for even regular roller-type carry-on's.  ...what's more is, if you don't pre-pay, the fees are even much higher at the airport.  You know, like 50-100 bucks.  So, the night before the flight during online check-in, I was seeing how the system asked about this and that and realized that we really had planned & packed all of our stuff to go carry-on.  ...Note that the only free carry-on's on Spirit are the under-your-seat type, which has very particular sizing.  This led to the 1st of several rounds of re-packing and scrambling.  Next day, in the line, lot so other people were going through all of this complaining and holding things up, delaying, etc.  All just nastyness.  So, my issue is this:  It's clear that Spirit has lot so crazy rules for nickle-n-diming, but also they don't always STATE that upfront.  Or it's not easy to understand.  ...It all boils down to a bait-and-switch routine   And yes, in the end it still cost me more than Southwest or AA and was a much, much less pleasant experience.

To me it is not really a low cost airline because frankly the level of service on all US domestic carriage is low by international standards and Southwest is just a little different, but it doesn't feel cheap.  They board differently, they provide wifi with onboard video options, but no seat-tv's. They don't charge extra for bags so they are nice for long trips or sporting trips. They still give you soda and snacks. They also don't charge absurd change fees to move your flights around so they are really nice for business trips.   My choices for my most common trip now are United or Virgin for DCA-SFO or BWI-OAK with Southwest. Virgin is the nicest plane with tv's on each seat usually for a little more money. United doesn't even try to be a nice plane for a 5.5 hour flight and is basically the worst of the traditional airlines combined with every new trend in fee gouging I can imagine. Southwest doesn't charge for bags, doesn't have tv's, doesn't charge change fees, and is actually a little bit faster flight. The only downside is the airports are not the same but OAK is a lot cheaper than SFO and the positioning of SFO vs OAK makes it almost no difference as far as access to San Francisco and OAK is easier for getting to much of the rest of the Bay area."

travel,3e24gi,LupineChemist,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"I find the whole process of airlines very interesting. I actually read OMAAT and it's pretty good. Collecting miles is just like any other hobby and some people are REALLY good about it.  Now here's the trick, they aren't actually flying for free as those miles have an actual accounting value. People just pay for them via credit cards (where it's paid for via fees on the merchant) or other random bonuses. Basically it's a way to consolidate all the general marketing.  People who run blogs can get huge amounts of miles and even cash solely from the credit card referrals they generate. There is the real trick.  I personally enjoy the /r/churning game a little bit with collecting miles. But I see it as an end to basically be able to fly business class for the prices I used to pay for coach as I have a few credit cards and fly for work but that's about the extent of it."

Just look at this http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/trip-report-index/airlines/  It's valuable info but Rolling Stone makes it out to be something it's just not, not to mention their prose really annoys me because it sounds like someone that wants to sound cultured and literary but doesn't know exactly how so it comes off like a pretentious student trying to imitate what they think should be a good style."

UA banned him because he we would reuse e-certs. Back before the change over to SHARES, if you did something to your computer (I think set it to reject all cookies) UA.com would have been unable to record the number of the e-cert used. Lucky was able to reuse the same cert over and over again. UA audited his tickets and dropped the banhammer. I suspect UA allowed him to keep his redeemable MP miles and allow him to book tickets on non-UA metal in exchange for his silence in this matter. I think that because he still books star alliance flights specifically he got in on the SQ mistake.  View it here - http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/22917959-post145.html"

I'd suggest a multi-destination ticket where you fly into one city and out the other.  I prefer to use Google Flights.  For example, if you wanted to do London, Paris, Amsterdam, look into a flight from your airport to London and then from Amsterdam back to your home airport (and look up your home to Amsterdam and then from London back to your home as well).   Once you have the itinerary and flights, the rest is pretty easy."

Being a Russian station with just a few dozen staff, I also highly doubt they have janitorial or other no-skill needs they cannot fill from back home or by the scientists themselves.  The best you could do is to apply to work at one of the American bases. They need cooks, cleaning staff, etc., but even for those jobs thousands of people apply every year.   /r/antarctica is a pretty informative sub and has a lot of members who have been working there, so start there.

travel,3e3d2n,lexxylee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"I handled the ACAA for a major airline for a number of years. To question a service animal is a pretty rare thing. We did have our rogue agents that would go off the reservation and do some stupid stuff. I think you will be fine - but like the other poster said, call the airline and ask. The ACAA doesn't cover animals in training with a trainer - I just doubt you'd be questioned about it if they are wearing a harness and identified as a service animal.   Now direct from United Airline's website: United only recognizes service animals which have been trained and certified. Animal trainers are permitted to bring one service animal that is training to assist disabled passengers onboard free of charge. These service animals must not occupy a seat. Trainers transporting service animals in the ordinary course of business or service animals who are not in training must check these animals.  I couldn't find a specific policy from Delta or Southwest - so United is the one clear way to go - they clearly permit it."

You're looking at a minimum $250 change fee, plus possible fare differences, just to change the date of the return. I'm sure Lufthansa would also be happy to find a way to change your return ticket from Palma to Bordeaux, but it would cost a small fortune in addition to whatever you'd have to foot simply to change the date.

Change fee, $300 + fare difference (probably in the high hundreds).   do you think I could just fly out from Bordeaux?   You cannot just change your PMI-Cali ticket to a ""fly home from Bordeaux"" ticket unless you want to pay a huge fare difference for that... If you want to fly back to Cali from Bordeaux, you're better off to just buy a new one-way ticket.   My flight is with Lufthansa, which is just a subcompany of united I believe.   LH is not a subsidiary of UA. They are Star Alliance partners but I am not sure what relevance that bears.  tl;dr: your choices are:   call in and change the date of your PMI-Cali flight (to Jul 31st or whatever), do PMI-Bordeaux round-trip ditch the PMI-Cali flight altogether and buy a new one-way from Bordeaux back to Cali   Both choices will be very expensive - my estimate is more than $1k regardless of which you choose."

travel,3e32kb,PatBat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:17 2015 UTC,"If you travel between June and the beginning of September, public transportation is okay for Jotunheimen.  First, you can get from downtown Oslo to Gjendesheim, a large hikers' hostel/cabin right on the border to Jotunheimen, on at least one daily bus. It leaves in the morning and takes you past some fairly nice scenery to an excellent starting point for both easy and hard hiking. And even if you don't hike much, the scenery is splendid right where the bus stops. The bus you want is ""161 Valdresekspressen"", http://www.nor-way.no/getfile.php/Filer/PDF-Rutetabeller/160-161.pdf  From Gjendesheim you can either get on the boat across the lake Gjende, or you can hike along the water (easy) or you can hike Besseggen (semi-rough). Both the trail and the boat will take you to more great cabins where you can stay the night and do short, but brilliant hikes from, or you can walk across the entire Jotunheimen (2-3 days) area to Spiterstulen, at the northern end of the national park. From there you can get a bus to Lom (http://www.opplandstrafikk.no/Handlers/fh.ashx?MId1=380&FilId=25), and from there you can get a bus to Åndalsnes. And if you think you can do Prekestolen, you can definitely walk up the trail that starts in the middle of Åndalsnes up to the beginning of Romsdalseggen, from where you will have amazing mountain views.   From Åndalsnes you can get a bus to Geiranger, and from there you can get to Bergen in various ways. It should take you past Flåm and give you ample opportunities to experience Hardangerfjorden along the way.   If the weather forecast for your stay is good, I'd try to do that, and maybe skip Ålesund and Stavanger. They're sort of too major detours, I think, although they can definitely be nice.

That's why you are supposed to be there at least 90 minutes early. All the major US airlines are basically the same. In a network that large, mistakes and miscommunications happen.

Obviously you are not very experienced with travel, and sorry to be harsh, but that isn't the airline's fault. Any other traveler on that plane would have known that 1 room will not have 3 beds.  Also, for you to act so entitled that you think American should delay an entire flight for 3 people is outrageous. Do you have any idea how much money that would cost the airline? If they hold the flight for you, then that same plane will be late getting in to Uruguay. Since it arrived in Uruguay late, it risks departing late and getting back to Miami late, where many more people risk missing connections. It's not as simple as just ""holding the flight"" for you.

You do NOT have to take that much time off to feel fulfilled from traveling and it is not the only way or the only chance you are going to get. Yes, it CAN be a great thing to be able to take that time and it will forever change you but - you are somewhat established already so why don't you work around that? I'm doing it and plenty of other people can - it just takes courage. repost ""First step, live below your means. This will allow you to have enough money to travel. Remember, experiences are the only thing that you can buy that no one can ever take away from you. Second, it is all on the job negotiations in where you can manage to get more time. When in the process of finding employment, of course, ask what the PTO policy is but also make sure to mention you like to try to take more time off than the average person. Ask if there are chances for unpaid time off? As long as you schedule your trips well in advance if you get hired, it should never be a problem. I work with IT projects I'm able to do some work while I travel and get paid for those hours. Managing to get in 10-20 hours in 2-3 days isn't too hard, it will take away from the vacation a little, I admit but those 10-20 hours for the two weeks you are away will be a big help when taking time off. Have confidence when it starts to come to looking for jobs. If you ask that question about unpaid time off sheepishly, they won't take it seriously. I'm 34, manage my finances well enough to be able to take off 2-3 months each year since turning 30. Put your place on Airbnb when you leave, put your car on relayrides.

I am a biochemist, so I have the whole career thing looming over my head like you do, but I mean, if we take a year, or even a few, out of the beginning of our lives, it is not going to matter. We are qualified and just going to be rehired, if our old job doesn't save our spot. But even if not, who cares to have a safety net? Not everything rare & valuable is convenient, nor do I think it should be, and I think genuinely ""jumping"" is one of those things.

That those people like those things is fine, it's great. But at least for me, safe & stable is against the spirit I love.

travel,3e0u1f,queefbrisket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking off a year to travel. However, if you think you will want to return to the U.S. to work afterwards, you are going to have a hard time finding a new job that allows you to continue advancing in your career. Personally, I think that's dumb since a year off isn't going to make you lose much momentum, but unfortunately that's just the way it works here. It is very likely you will face setbacks though, like a harder time getting interviews and lower salary offers for your next position, although not a given.  It sounds like part of the problem is your job since you are not passionate about what you do. Start doing some soul-searching and think about how you might feel if you switched companies or industries. Figure out if that's the issue and if you're using travel as an easy out, or if you really do feel passionate about taking a year off to travel because it's an experience you want to have n life.  If you do want it, then you could just save up money and travel around, or you could live and work in another country so that you have less of a gap on your resume and a better way to fund your experience. Research work visas in other countries. There is something called a Working Holiday visa that is available in places like Ireland and Australia. Sometimes there are stipulations though, like you have to have graduated college within a certain time frame or you are only allowed to stay in one job a certain amount of time, so you should start looking into it immediately.   Just know that you may still have difficulty finding a job in your field in these places depending on these stipulations, but it's not impossible. If you're comfortable doing something like working in a bar or on a farm then you will have an easier time. But again, afterwards you may have a harder time than you think transitioning back to your current field of work since that experience doesn't translate well into engineering.  Or who knows, maybe there is a country with an engineering shortage and you can actually get a sponsored work visa (these are normally hard to get) to work for a company, which would really be ideal since it would manage a lot of your current concerns.   Honestly though, I had a great job in my field when I lived abroad and I still had a really hard time moving up to the next step in my career when returning to the U.S. just because of location restrictions. All of my offers were asking me to take a step back in terms of title and salary since I didn't have the same work experience here as I did abroad. Not everyone has that happen though...there are other people who are able to transition more smoothly because they work for an international company that can transfer them, or go into graduate school during the transition period, or just are able to find a better job offer from abroad before they have to return. The key is just to start working on this all before you leave so that you don't come back home at the end of your year expecting to slip seamlessly back into your old lifestyle. I'm not trying to discourage you at all since I think this is an awesome thing to do and I don't regret my experience at all. You just have to understand that there are going to be trade-offs.  I think that if you're okay with taking a risk that you may potentially take a minor career step back when you return or will need to shift into a new line of work/grad school, then now is absolutely a great time for you to do this. You may always regret it if you don't take the chance while you're young before you have more obligations start piling up. Just do your research ahead of time and try your best to think about some of your long-term life and career goals, and then find a way to integrate travel into your life in the way that best helps you reach them (whether that's work visa, taking a year off, switching to a job with more vacation time, etc...no right answer, just whatever is best for you!)."

PEK is pretty straightforward to transit through on intl CA to intl CA flights.  Tell ground crew that you have a connecting flight leaving very shortly.   Arrival: run to the international transit immigration counter. Have your passport, your arrival boarding pass (JFK-PEK), your departure boarding pass (PEK-NRT) READY FOR INSPECTION. Don't be a knob holding up the line. Go downstairs after immigration. Keep your passport and departure boarding pass handy. Line up for security: all electronics OUT, including cameras, batteries, laptops, tablets, phones, etc; liquids out, jackets OFF Haul ass to your departure gate.   All that should take 45 mins, so yes, haul ass!"

But then again, a lot of these might be Chinese so they might ignore you to begin with and not respect the queue.  Tell a flight attendant your situation before you land. If there are still free seats near the front (bulkhead, perhaps), try and get those at check-in.  Carry-on: maybe don't put it in overhead if you don't have to?"

travel,3e1rvu,theblackswanson,2,Tue Jul 21 08:56:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like telling a little story relating to this, so why not.  I grew up in a rather large city but on the outskirts (suburbs but not on this scale).  So architecture was never something that I noticed, let alone interested me.  But every guidebook or travel site on every city I went to always seemed to include information about the ""unique architecture"" of a place, or at the very least subtle differences that made it interesting.  So, I sought out buildings the guides directed me to and tried to appreciate the effort of the architect, not because I really wanted to initially, but because I thought it was an aspect of the city that I ought to observe, seeing as I made the trip out here.  It wasn't long before I realized I was really into it.  How would I have known about this interest of mine if I just followed the advice of people on Trip Advisor.  About a year into my trip I was in Budapest, Hungary.  It would take a cold soul to not acknowledge that it is a beautiful city.  Truth is, it is even more beautiful than people tell you.  I was constantly tripping because I couldn't stop from looking up at the facades of the surrounding buildings.  You are never going to see the top review on trip advisor being a 5 star ""Walk around looking up.""  But that doesn't mean it is not a great way to spend you time.  One of my last stops, years later, was Moscow and St. Petersburg.  I do not doubt that the appreciation I have for that architecture there, and those cities, would not be as strong if I hadn't tried something unfamiliar to me earlier.  Basically I am saying that you should really exercise your freedom while traveling.  You are free from your everyday schedules and instructions.  Take advantage of it by not following other's lists.  Seeing the highlights are certainly worthwhile, but set aside time for discovering your own."

For Italy if you stay 10 days, you can see 2-3 major cities depending on how fast of a traveler you are. I spent 7 days there and did 2 cities (Rome + Florence) - felt a bit rushed but it wasnt too bad. Of course I left myself a lot of things to do the next time I go back!  Rome is a must see - it's centrally located (so it's accessible whether you want to visit Southern Italy, Northern Italy, etc.). It has incredible history and the city is quite beautiful - it has some really touristy areas and some more local areas which are still close to the city center. You will never run out of attractions or things to do there. Food is amazing and the nightlife is great and varied. Just make sure you venture away from the touristy squares - just go a few blocks down a side street and the restaurants become magically cheaper and more authentic. Also there are some fantastic hostels in Rome - there are a few well known larger hostels such as Alessandro and Yellow but my favorite one is called ""Dreaming Rome"". It's a bit smaller but has a really cool setup (it's basically an apartment owned by 2 brothers who regularly cook you free dinner, take you out in the evenings as a group etc.).  Do you need a rail pass? it depends on how many cities you are trying to do and how far away they are. It might be worth it if you were trying to do, say, Naples + Rome + Venice or something and had to take long distance high speed trains. On the other hand if you are doing a more limited geographic area such as just Rome and Florence, probably not necessary - local (slow) trains in Italy are quite cheap and run very often."

travel,3e0z1d,pinkfilco,0,Tue Jul 21 02:59:16 2015 UTC,No there's nothing than can do to you for doing what your propose. You're right - booking through cheapoair makes changes essentially impossible. You could be a good travel citizen and call whomever you aren't flying on and cancel that booking so someone else can buy a seat on that flight.
travel,3e0z1d,nlderek,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"Can we get grounded from our flights/get in trouble for doing this?   Not sure where and on which flight you think this can happen, but no.   Is there any way they will revoke our second flights or anything?   Well, yes, if you don't get on that return flight on Aug. 8, that ticket will likely be cancelled without refund (or unless you pay some sort of fee). But you don't want that ticket anyway, right?"
travel,3e0z1d,tariqabjotu,0,Tue Jul 21 04:38:03 2015 UTC,"Your situation is unique to your booking (so read all that fine print in the terms you agreed to), but in general the following is true.  Independent of what anonymous posters have hypothesized, there is a possible impact.  Basically you are violating the contract you had with the airline.  They can come after you for additional compensation, basically the full fare one way price for each leg used, which is certainly far more than your fully refundable ticket.  If the new flight is on the same airline the risk is greater.  On the plus side Air Asia, or who ever the contract is with that you violated, has a pretty small police department.  It is likely, however not guaranteed, that they ultimately won't care enough to pursue damages.  I have yet to have problems myself in similar situations.  I would contact the airline directly to explore options for altering your flight.  I would not tell them that you intend to throw away the unused ticket though (that would just increase your odds of scrutiny)."
travel,3e0z1d,6YearsRoundTheWorld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:38:25 2015 UTC,"Realistically this doesn't happen. People book round-trip tickets and drop the return portion all the time. What are those airlines going to do? Sue you? C'mon. It makes no sense to chase after people who ditch non-refundable tickets that, by definition, are often unable to refunded. And this does not happen."
travel,3e0z1d,tariqabjotu,0,Tue Jul 21 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"What? In what situation would that occur? Tickets are not a contract, but a product. Once you buy it, you can do what you want (within the terms of use). In fact, airlines OVERBOOK flights expecting people to just not make their flight."
travel,3e0z1d,blueberry_crepe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:15:24 2015 UTC,The consequences of them overbooking is part of the contract you agree to and they will hold up their end. Loads of people have plans impacted by over booking are are compensated as per the contract.  The opposite is also possible.   (within the terms of use)   That's the contract.

He got about 100 of the passengers to give him their email addresses, and then they threatened to coordinate a written complaint campaign. The written complaints get mentioned in securities filings or something, and the 100 passengers would have doubled or tripled the monthly complaints for the airlines, which could influence the stock price (especially if automated systems pick up on it.) Then he posted everything to the Twitter account of the airline.  Anyways, moral of the story is that you need to unionize your flight if you want the airline to take you seriously."

travel,3dx0im,TheReverendBill,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:01 2015 UTC,Is your ability to estimate the number of people on a plane (many of whom are not visible from where you're sitting) directly related to your ability to read a clock?
travel,3dx0im,shook_one,4,Mon Jul 20 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"We have to believe that OP is providing factual information rather than making wildly inaccurate estimates in an emotionally heightened state. If there were nowhere near 450 people on board, did they really sit on the tarmac for 4-1/2 hours?"
travel,3dx0im,TheReverendBill,0,Mon Jul 20 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"That's a massive logical leap you're taking. It's a lot easier to say ""oh I boarded the flight at 12, it's now 4:30. Guess I've been sitting here for 4.5 hours, than it is to estimate the number of people on the plane. What reason does OP have to lie here? I just don't see how the estimate of the number of people on board is really relevant."
travel,3dx0im,mofang,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"That the passenger count is in the title of the post makes it relevant per se. Maybe not particularly significant, though it does speak to OP's credibility, which is important when we are relying on him/her to establish the facts for us to answer the question, ""Is this legal.""  Mostly, though, it's just a travel geek thing about capacities and configurations of commercial airliners."
travel,3dx0im,mofang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"Except it's provable that the OP did not correctly account for time, either.  The math simply doesn't add up:  8:15 PM + 4:30 of delay + 3:00 of rebooking would put you at 3:45 AM, but they clearly say they posted at 2:00 AM."
travel,3dx0im,shook_one,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Because the details matter:  there is a tarmac delay rule that cuts in at exactly 3 hours, which directly determines the answer to the OP's question of ""is this legal"".  And the fine to United is directly determined by the number of people onboard.  If the tarmac wait time truly exceeded 4.5 hours, the difference between the OP's passenger estimate and the actual capacity of the plane is 181 passengers.  If those passengers were really onboard and the OP's account of the flight is correct, the potential fine would increase from 7.4 million dollars to 12.4 million dollars - a difference of almost five million dollars.  (!)  Given this potential financial burden, airlines tend to be extremely careful to never exceed three hours of tarmac delay, and many of us find it unlikely the OP's estimate of time is correct."

travel,3dx0im,tariqabjotu,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"The tendency to overestimate and exaggerate certainly is correlated with both.    More to the point, the OP says their 8:15 flight took 4.5 hours of delay and 3+ hours of rebooking, yet said the time was 2am when they posted.  The math doesn't add up - there's nearly two hours of exaggeration there.  United has been having a pretty terrible summer, but it's pretty unlikely they would risk a $7 million dollar fine.  And if they did actually subject the OP to that situation, getting the specific details right is important so they can credibly follow up with the DOT and get justice by enforcing the tarmac delay rules."

Business is clearly better because of space and service, but now that I'm flying on my own dime it's always coach (sometimes premium economy - I'm at the upper end of fitting into a coach seat for height.)  The 787 was great. It was quieter (though I've heard A380s are better), the A/V system was top notch, the windows were much larger, and it seemed like the air was better (I know it's supposed to be, but maybe I biased myself.)  Next time I fly internationally I would pay extra for a 787 over anything aside from an A380. And actually I'd rather have a 787 than an A380 because (hopefully) it won't overwhelm customs & immigration as much. Flying from Denver to Tokyo (Narita) was awesome too as I don't think it's a route that's traveled as heavily as Asia to SFO or LAX."

travel,3dx0im,mofang,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"How did you book the flight?  If you booked though a third party website, you can always reach out to them and ask them to pursue compensation.  If you booked directly with UA, you will have to deal with their customer service; they hay have a spot on their website to submit complaints.  They are not fast, but they generally respond eventually and you should get some sort of compensation, most likely future travel vouchers.  For future reference, if you buy decent travel insurance (something like TravelGuard), you should have access to a 24 hour hotline, they will call and yell at the airline for you."
travel,3dx0im,DrMambo85,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's not 450 passengers - the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight appears to be an ex-Continental 777-200 configured with 267 seats.  Your best bet in a situation like this is always to call the airline while you're in line.  Calling won't prevent you from getting helped at the airport - and you'll likely still have to queue to receive new boarding passes, vouchers for overnight accommodations, etc. - but it strongly increases your chances of scoring one of the limited seats on a better rerouting.  You definitely don't want to try to do it online - the electronic rebooking system will likely muck up your reservation further - but a human on the phone should be able to help, at least for most US-based airlines.  Out of EWR, there are alternate flights to BOM on Jet Airways, Lufthansa, and Air India.  I'd specifically ask United if you can be rebooked on one of those options;  they'll likely only offer their own flights by default, but they may have the power to rebook you on other airlines if you ask.  In particular, Lufthansa is a close partner and you might have good luck pushing for that option.  If you're willing to go across town to JFK to catch a flight, there may be additional options out of there as well - and they might not be quite as backlogged as EWR will be after two consecutive cancellations of this flight on UA."

Good plan, guy."
travel,3dx0im,tacogrande7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"In IROPS situations, when you're accommodated at a different airport within the same city (usually known as a 'coterminal'), the airline will usually pay for your cab fare.  United already has language in their contract of carriage covering diversions between EWR/JFK, so providing cab vouchers is something they know how to do on a regular basis.  Getting to JFK is actually a great plan, if you can convince United to rebook you on another airline.  The vast majority of international airlines serve JFK, not EWR, so there will be numerous additional options - and because most passengers won't be willing to make the journey, you'll be competing with fewer people for the available seats.  Interestingly, some airlines, like Delta, actually will pay for your cab fare if you're connecting between EWR/JFK/LGA - even if all your flights are on time.  It's a very obscure benefit that not many people know exist...  That said, your point that getting between the two airports isn't convenient via train is a good reminder to anyone stuck in a similar situation."

This doesn't necessarily correlate to any door closure times that determine how long passengers were onboard, though - it's just the estimates that were entered into the system.  United's notes say that the final reason for cancellation was to crew scheduling.  /u/tariqabjotu might have been on to something here - perhaps the cancellation two days ago of EWR-BOM resulted in a shortage of crew members to operate this flight.  Or it could just mean that mechanical fixes took a while and the crew ran out of hours.  (The last HDQ line is simply a link to instructions for agents on how to rebook affected passengers.)

For a foreign airline, flights arriving in the EU don't qualify:  only flights departing do.  By convention, the laws of the departure country apply.

It has a seat attached to it so you can read or sketch or write or draw. Sit there for a half hour and you should feel inspired by the valley's beauty.   California. San Diego. Mission District.  For amazing Mexican food and entertainment. Truluck's in La Jolla. Seafood that you should expect to spend an arm and a leg on. The quality and portions are stupendous. Crazy good.    Los Angeles. Cole's/The Varnish. Have a french dip from the place that invented the things and then enter the speakeasy in the back to have a classic cocktail to wash it down. TCL Chinese Theater. If there's a movie that you're interested in seeing, it's worth seeing it here in Imax. The cosplayers outside add to the atmosphere. The place has a lot of history. The theater is beautifully appointed, and the sound and screensize are pretty amazing. Tiki-Ti. As the name suggests, a bar specializing in tiki drinks. Quirky.  Haven't lived here too long, so I don't have too many recommendations yet.    Las Vegas. Herbs and Rye. Supposedly the best cocktail bar in the city, according to just about every bartender I talked to. The food is kind of overpriced (and the drinks for that matter), so make sure to fill up before you go. Sage in the Aria resort and casino. Get the Queen Bee cocktail.    Portland. Hair of the Dog Brewing Co. Kind of a snooty brewpub in my experience, but some really delicious beer with good flights in case you don't know what you're into. Go to a Timbers game. They have great fan support and atmosphere."

I feel bad because I left out entire neighborhoods from my Seattle writeup. I have a love for that city that I can't do justice in a single post. Ballard and West Seattle and I guess Fremont and all the farmers markets. Park after park and the arboretum. The Cascades and the Olympics encircling the horizon.  The seaplane tours. It may not line up with your travel plans, but Seafair is the weekend of July 31st. They have blue angel flyovers and a drunken mess on the lake."

Probably the unexpectedly best part of the trip was going to Dog Beach in San Diego. It's a leash free beach and even my father, who is not a huge fan of beaches, loved it. We never had a dog, but we both like them and people were happy to let us play with their dogs in surf. It was a really fun time. East of San Diego, we went to Julian. We toured a tiny winery and an old gold mine, and finished the afternoon off with some of their famous apple pie. That trip was more than a decade ago, but I still have very fond memories of those places."

Check out the Fremont area in Seattle.  Its an artsy and alternative neighborhood with a lot of quirky bars and eateries. Take a walk to the gasworks park for a great view of the city and place to hang around. Id also highly recommend you go up on the Columbia Tower, it is the highest building in town and makes for an awesome view.  If you are into EDM Id highly recommend you check out a nightclub called ""Mighty"" in san francisco. It has a great vibe and is very low key. Dressing up is not needed. The avenues south of the Golden Gate Park connecting to Lincoln Way offer free parking, which can save you a bit of money. Travel back into town by bus or train.  The Ocean Beach neighborhood in san diego is worth a visit. Very laidback and colourful. Lots of surfers and locals hanging around.   I am on a budget myself but a helicopter ride in the grand canyon is supposed to be amazing.  Part from the interstate when driving in Arizona and utah. Stunning landscapes are present in these states. Highway 62 and 92 take you right trough the desert and highway 64 and 89 stretching from the grand canyon to zion NP are also amazing.   I did the angels landing hike in zion. Very impressive, rather scary but it makes for an expierence I will never forget.  Vegas is a lot of fun, but very tacky. Went to a poolparty at the mgm grand today, would highly recommend. Same goes for downtown vegas located around freemont avenue, quite similar to the strip just a bit more locals and fewer foreigners. However, if you do not like tourist traps you would better skip this city altogether, if I must be honest."

travel,3dzw5c,axel_val,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:21 2015 UTC,We're most interested in going somewhere all-inclusive to get the most bang for our buck and have a well rounded experience.   Those are two things you don't get by going to a resort.
travel,3dzw5c,toozler,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"Care to expand on that more?    By going on an all-inclusive package certain ones include tour credit (through CostCo at least) and by staying at a resort that's catered towards vacationers there's bound to be things in the area for us to do, it'll be somewhat easy to get to and from the area, and the hotel employees will be required to be at least a little knowledgeable about the area.  I fail to see how all of those things combined don't add up to a great vacation experience, considering we're going with the intent to just spend time together."
travel,3dzw5c,toozler,2,Tue Jul 21 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"When you mentioned that you're looking for the best bang for your buck, consider that resorts and such charge a premium price for services - that's part of their business. In most cases, these services (e.g. food, transportation) can be found locally cheaper and just as easily.  If you are at destination that receives tourists, anyone involved in the industry can advise you things to do, not only the resorts ""concierge"", so that's not a thing you should worry about. On the ""well rounded experience"" note, I understood you meant a more authentic and varied trip, is that so? That's not what you find within the confines of a resort."
travel,3dzw5c,foggysf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"Well, with the ones we've looked at so far it really is a good deal, and that's why we're looking at all-inclusive vacations for the most part.  Like, a week in Europe that includes complementary champagne and fruit upon check in plus daily breakfast at the hotel, includes airfare and transportation to and from the hotel, and (some) include a gift card for various things like travel vouchers or hotel bar money, for under $4k.  There's a two-week UK trip that even includes three different car rentals at each city you stay in, though due to length it's a bit pricier ($6k).  I'd like to see a local place that offers similar perks or where the savings would be worth not getting them at all.  We're not looking for advice to stay in a cheap hotel/hostel and go out and mingle with the locals because that's not really the point of a honeymoon.  We want to experience a bit of local culture yes, but not a nitty gritty experience.  Especially if people recommend countries where English isn't the primary language, we'll need to stay in a tourist-laden area where more businesses will speak English.  We'll be getting a more authentic experience than a lot of other tourists do simply because I dislike things like museums and cultural centers.  But I'd still like the option to tourist-trap stuff if the mood strikes us (for instance, if we go to England and are close enough, I would love to go to Stonehenge), so staying in a bigger tourist area makes more sense.  By well-rounded I more meant that we can choose what we do.  If one day we want to go to an authentic restaurant and sit by the riviera or whatever, it's an options; but on the other hand if we feel like lounging at the hotel and just hanging out by the pool/bar that's an option too; or even if we want to be tourists and check out a tourist trap, there's the ability to do that."

travel,3du9t3,mass922,10,Mon Jul 20 11:13:10 2015 UTC,How do you get to these places? Is hiring a car/driver from Beijing an option?
travel,3du9t3,atrich,18,Sun Jul 19 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"I went to mutianyu (spelling?) last year and took a driver, which cost about 70€ - if I recall correctly.   The dude drove us there which took about 1,5 hours, waited for us and drove us back. On the way back he even stopped by the birds nest on our request, at least on some weird highway besides it where we had a view of it.   The other option would have been a bus to some village next to the Great Wall where we would have needed a taxi anyway - and honestly after driving through this village and not seeing a single tourist, we were really glad we took the driver.   Taking a tour bus would be a cheaper option I guess, but I'd not really recommend going there by public transport."
travel,3du9t3,RummyRumsfeld,4,Sun Jul 19 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely don't go by public transport. I did that in February, bad idea. The bus to the town near Mutianyu is easy and no trouble at all. But from there to the Great Wall is a pain. No tourists, it was extremely unclear where I should catch a bus or shared taxi, and they see dollar signs and fleece you when they see a foreigner.  I took a shared taxi, after a bit of haggling and waiting, and one of the people in the car with me later chatted with me on the wall and mentioned how the driver told him not to tell me how much he paid. Of course, he ignored that advice, and told me on the return trip the correct amount to hand over and just leave.  I'm sure it came out cheaper as one person, but it might be even more expensive as two people and it's a hassle and huge time sink regardless."
travel,3du9t3,tariqabjotu,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:54 2015 UTC,You screwed up somewhere by getting off too early. There are buses that go straight to Mutianyu.
travel,3du9t3,iwazaruu,5,Mon Jul 20 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"I believe you're referring to the 867 bus. Multiple sources I saw before I took the trip indicated that that bus no longer runs to the Great Wall, and also may have never run during winter months.  This info is provided here:   August 29, 2014 updates: Mutianyu tourism bus 867 no longer stops at Mutianyu–It  ONLY drops you off at Hongluosi (Red Snail Temple / 红螺寺), which is about 20 km away from Mutianyu. Re-opening is unclear.   Also here:   The only direct bus to the Mutinyau Great Wall section is a special service of the 867, which only runs during the tourist season (15 Mar-15 Nov) [...] The special service of bus 867 to Mutianyu had been cancelled since June 2014. If you still want to get to Mutianyu by bus, it is still possible-you will need to take the bus 867, get off at the Honglousi, the final stop of it, and wait for a special bus service at the return stop of Honglousi (which is opposite the road from the place you get off). The special bus service costs ¥4 each way (¥1.6 with metrocard) and will only depart at 10:00 and 12:00 from Honglousi, and 14:00 and 15:00 from Mutianyu.    In fairness, at a more popular travel time (I was there on the Lunar New Year, when most people are spending time with family), when the drivers can take more people, it's probably easier and cheaper to find the transport from Huairou to the Great Wall. I appreciated the freedom, and adventure, associated with doing the trip myself, but hearing how much people paid for transportation on those tour buses made me think that may have been a better way to go."

My hotel (Regent Beijing) had the option to hire a private car (900 CNY for 2 people from 5am-2pm), he drove us to the wall so we could get there first thing in the morning, got us set up with some breakfast at a restaurant there, waited for us to finish getting our fill of the wall, then drove us back to Beijing. Once there he took us to the Summer Palace (huge mistake to do back to back after Badaling- that hill is brutal after you're already tired lol), waited for us to finish and took us to 2 more places before taking us back to the hotel for the end of his shift.  You can also take public transportation which is much cheaper, but we were on a time budget and I didn't want to waste time waiting on people or stopping for whatever on the way there and back."

travel,3dzpd0,gingerfailwhale,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"First off, I don't mean to sound rude, but please don't expect us to be your concierge. You can easily search through backpack reviews yourself, both here and on other sites and the same holds true for getting a general grasp of things on where to go. This sub really likes the Osprey Farpoint 46 and it's ideal for the hostel-hopping style of backpacking as it comes with a detachable daypack. Either way, hit up a professional gear store (NOT Decathlon) and have a chat with an employee about what you need, you'll be sorted out.   As for locations, if you are entirely without ideas about destinations, hit up Flickr and other image hosts, enter some keywords and see where the pics you like were taken in. If you're into modern history/politics related/Communist sights, any country between Estonia and Bulgaria will be great for you. Lots of people visit Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and sometimes Slovakia in a loop.   Your budget could be a limiting factor though, especially regarding the distances you could cover and number of countries you could visit. With 95 days, 3500€ (37€ a day) isn't going to be much. Even in Eastern Europe that's the 16-bed dorm rooms and supermarket food level. 5000 would be a bit better, but still you'll have to be watchful of your spendings. Depending on how quickly you go through your funds, you might want to consider working at a hostel or just simply staying put in one city for more than just a few days or weeks, you'd save a lot on a day-by-day basis by doing that."

travel,3dzcz8,meatsalad_yumiyumi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"If you need vegan dining in China, stick exclusively to Buddhist vegetarian restaurants - they aren't ubiquitous, but if you look up restaurant listings on a city's expat site or ask a Chinese person you'll probably find some. In normal Chinese restaurants, even if you order something that appears to be meat free, chances are they've cooked it with bits of pork fat or in oyster sauce.   Pizza is pretty common in big Chinese cities, so the mostly vegan could probably get a cheese or veggie pizza and be okay."

American meals are much more protein heavy (steaks, burgers, etc.) than normal meals in China, Korea, and Thailand. It shouldn't be a problem asking for any protein dish to be subbed for tofu too! There are a good amount of vegetarians in China and Thailand and restaurants will be accommodating if you tell them you don't eat meat. Lots of Chinese people are lactose intolerant, so dairy isn't as prevalent as it is in the US.  The only thing I'd be careful of is eating out in Thailand! Many things are made with fish sauce, even if the recipe seems vegetarian. Make sure to clarify that when you choose to eat out!"

If you're on an early morning flight to Dublin (I think they all are?), you could probably explain your situation to the check-in personnel at the airport, check in before midnight, walk through the passport control and sleep on the benches outside the Schengen border ...   If you don't think that'll work, it's maybe a good idea to change your flight to the day before. You can fly to Gatwick for 399 that day, and you should be able to find a cheap bus+ferry combo from London to Dublin. And there's always Ryanair, 329 on 1 August, from Rygge, near Oslo.

If your flight gets in at 14:25 and you have luggage to collect, you won't be able to be at the airport near Chichen Itza by 16:00, not even if you chartered your own plane for this.   If you love ancient sites at all, you will eventually have to give Chichen Itza at least a full day, from sunrise to sunset, or maybe even two days. Just a quick look at it won't satisfy you. For that kind of follies you have Google Earth! :)  When you decide to go to Chichen Itza properly, do stay at the old hotel inside the premises. It's a wonderful hotel (the building where the archeologists used to live), and it will give you a headstart of about an hour on all other tourists. You can enter through a special entrance in the hotel gardens before the official entrance opens, and WAY before the hordes of Cancun/Merida tourist buses arrive."

As for how doable it is: it was a lot easier traveling with her, because her native language is Spanish.  We got by in Brazil reasonably well, since Spanish and Portuguese are so similar.  Having said that, prior to this trip I spent 10 months backpacking through Europe by myself and did just fine.  Bring a smartphone or a laptop, something you can get online with, and you can figure out most things on your own.  I use the GPS feature on my phone and an app called Maps.Me, which is an offline map that can give you directions and everything without an internet connection.    When you don't know the language, it makes certain things harder, but that only lasts a week or two until you figure out how to get what you need without speaking the same language.  It's a great experience."

In the richer, whiter southern cities people usually speak a pretty decent english, but in the poorer regions (north, amazon, centre) you would have quite a few difficulties, as most people dont speak more than a few words. But spanish is very similar though, so it will certainly help."

travel,3duzzd,dmtmakeamandream,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:47 2015 UTC,Nice pictures ! What camera did you use ? Where was the shanty town located ? Did you propose on your trip ?
travel,3duzzd,valeyard89,9,Mon Jul 20 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"These were shot with a Canon 60D.  As for the shanty town, I think you're referring to one of the favelas in Rio De Janeiro.  Yeah, I proposed in Cartagena.  One of the most important things for me was meeting her parents and asking for their blessing before I asked her.  So after we made it to her hometown (Bogota), I spent some time getting to know her family and finally got the nerve to have the talk with her parents.  Despite the language barrier, it went really well.  I went out and bought a ring, and then did my best to hide it from her until we made it to Cartagena.    Choosing a place to propose was the biggest hurdle, I knew I wanted to do it before going back to the U.S., but I'd never been to Cartagena and didn't know if it would be the right place without seeing it.  As a backup, I had Santa Marta, and finally Tayrona National Park.  So we arrive in Cartagena, and find a cheap place to stay, a room small enough to be a closet with a mattress thrown in.  Cartagena is ridiculously hot and humid, and we spent the entire night under a fan at full blast just sweating.  It was easily the worst night of the entire trip.  The next morning we wake up, and look at each other and all we could do is give each other a sympathetic 'what the hell?' sort of look and laugh.  There were many, many times where I was reminded why this woman was unlike any other I'd ever met, and that was definitely one of them.  We packed our bags and I insisted on finding somewhere else.  I found a great little hostel nearby (with air conditioning!) and rented a room to ourselves.  Day 2 was off to a much better start, and we spent the day wandering through the beautiful streets of Cartagena.  The city is incredible, and I started feeling like it was the right moment.    As sunset was approaching, I took her to the castle that sits in the center of the city, the only castle in South America.  We shot some photos, learned a little bit about the castle, but the entire time I was looking for a place that felt right.  The stars aligned near sunset, as most of the tourists had left and we had a spot to ourselves with nobody in sight.  I told her I wanted to take a picture of us, and asked her to go stand in a scenic spot as I set my camera up on a tripod.   As she had her back to me I walked up, she turned around, and I got on one knee.  The next thing I remember was her saying 'yes'."

travel,3duzzd,lowrider88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"Dangerous as in not too safe for swimming.  The waves were crashing over rocks, and on the other side of the small bay were waves coming in directly from the ocean, crashing over a wall of rock that sat at a 45 degree angle.  So if you fall in, you're not getting back out."

travel,3duzzd,ohheyyouagain,5,Mon Jul 20 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"It was a big concern before I left.  My fiancee and I both love photography, and I'd spent 10 months in Europe traveling around with both my camera and my laptop, so I felt reasonably comfortable with taking them on this trip as well.  Granted, there are situations where we'd opt not to bring our camera's out of our backpacks, but we managed to shoot a lot of the places we'd wanted comfortably.  I think the key is just to be aware of your surroundings, without giving the impression that you are.  If you're nervous, it signals to others that you have something worth being nervous about.  As a general rule, we'd keep the cameras in our day packs until we'd been in an area long enough to get a feel for the people.  If others had cameras out, and nobody was watching them, we'd take ours out and do the same.  In almost all of the smaller cities and villages, it's a non-issue.  In the big cities it is.  Not much different from the U.S.  As for the camera: a Canon 60D."

Some of the shots I got from the market in Brazil were unexpected, I'd try to sneak a shot of the people as they were working, and a few caught me, but ended up being really friendly like the guy with the eggs.    So my approach to shooting people varies, but I always aim to capture a portrait without the person knowing I'm capturing a portrait.  I like when people are natural and in the moment."

But the BEST would be (as u/K_State mentions) to go to a store like REI to try them all.  Load up a small garbage bag with clothes to stuff in the bag to see how it feels on your back loaded.  Loaded vs. unloaded packs feel totally different.   If you are on a 3 month trip where you are making constant use of the pack think about paying more for quality and fit.   Enjoy your adventure!
travel,3dy1mp,showtime8-24,3,Mon Jul 20 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"Chichen Itza for sure; but a word of warning.... alot of these companies that run the tours waste so much time doing everything but Chichen Itza. Back in December my wife and I went with a tour group. We left at 745am from one of the gift shops in town, I can't think of the name but it is big and next to the bar Tom Cruise filmed cocktail. Anyway, at about 1000am we stopped in a small town for an hour to see some church, at which point they recommend we stop in the shops because ""jewlery was cheap"". So back on the road by 11 and stopped again at noon to eat a terrible lunch at some ""resort"" in the middle of nowhere. So this took 2 hours up until we got back on the road by 2. THEN we stopped at a gift shop for an hour and a half where they wanted us to look at onyx and let us know this was the only place in the world we could get authenic onxy. I haggled with the guys there on the ridiculously priced items, which they wouldnt come down on until we left. We finally got to Chichen Itza at 400pm and they told us we had to be back at the bus by 5! ONE HOUR is all the time we got to spend there! We left, stopped at a cenote and did not get back until 1100pm! This was a 16 hour trip to see Chichen Itza and we only got to spend 1 hour there. Be cautious who you book through and definetly read the reviews. If possible rent a car, it may cost more but you will actually get to enjoy it and not spend all day helping them get commision from the places they stop.  Market 28 is another great spot to go. If by taxi, tell them market 28, if your staying in a resort where they have a shuttle  make sure theyre taking you to the actual Market 28. The resort we stayed in had a shuttle to a place called 28 market, which if youve been to market before you know this isnt it. The real market 28 is a big city block with a bunch of shops that look like a flea market setup. looks really sketchy, but its not. Just remember not to make eye contact with anyone because they will all tell you they have the best deal and to come look at thier stuff. While your there, look for three shacks in row that are selling food. The red on on the left has by far the best mexican food we've ever had anywhere.   When you leave the resort and go into town have the cab driver take you to the big grocery store by the Cancun Clipper Club. Its a three story grocery store with some unique food and has ala cart food inside.  Definetly spend a day at Isla Murejes. Theres a great restaurant there called.. La terriza? I forget the name but it a block from one of the ports and has amazing food and each year weve gone they always have BOGO margaritas with dinner. Get there first thing in the morning and rent a golf cart. You can drive all around the island and there is a turtle zoo type thing and a place to get a picture in the water with a shark. Theres alot of one way streets on the island and peoe get pissed when you go the wrong way so be mindful of that.   But whatever you do, dont spend alot of time listening to the guys saying they can get you the best deal on this or that. Because more often than not you will find a cheaper price an hour later."

Zip lines and ATVs shouldnt need much explaining, but if you don't know what a cenote is please look it up as it was one of the coolest things I didn't know existed.  You swim in it and there's a rope swing at the top so you can swing and jump in.  From the resort area it was about a 30 minute van ride, transportation came with the package.

travel,3dyw33,bFallen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"If I remember right from when I was there and looking into public transport to Skocjan, you'll need to allow up to a couple of hours each way - based on bus timetables, where they drop you off, and how long it takes to walk from the bus to the Caves as there's no stop right next to them, it's in a small town ""nearby"". With time for the caves as well, this can eat up a decent chunk of a day.   but that would leave me with only a day (perhaps a bit less even) for Ljubljana.   I think that's enough, personally, especially since you said you get through cities quickly. It's a very compact city, everything is close to each other and within easy walking distance (usually <15 minutes)."
travel,3dyw33,CantLookUp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"No way.  Unsurprisingly Škocjan Caves aren't exactly located next to the train station (Divača) and there's a few miles of hike to reach the park entrance and from there some mostly downhill forest hike to the caves.   Best you could do is visit the caves then proceed to Piran, sleep there and return to Ljubljana the next day. There aren't really huge sights to tick off in Piran and Portoroz, it's mainly the feel of them, walking through narrow, cobblestoned streets, taking in the views, eating something, etc., so if you're not one for that, maybe you could skip it."

You can either keep up with them and listen or just wander a bit slowly, but one person will be 'herding' the slow ones to a certain pace.   I was there a couple years ago, with everything, including the hike from the train station and inside the park, the visit itself and some lunch after, we probably spent a good 4-5 hours there, but you only spend 1 or 2 inside the caves."

I'll make a big list of things I enjoyed and what I've heard about from others to see if anything piques your interest. This will probably get pretty long, sorry:   There is a famous cathedral at Chartres, which is on the way closer to Paris. Mont St Michel. Big draw for people all over. The abbey is pretty interesting, but the town felt aggressively touristy so not my cup of tea, but to each their own. Galettes (any kind really, like a savory crepe but they do have sweet options), cidre, kouign amann, far breton, salted butter caramels. nom nom nom! St. Malo is a cool walled city on the Channel with a history of piracy.  Dinard is near St. Malo (you can see it across the water) with beautiful homes and beaches, felt like a resort town. Dinan has a small medieval town with a very pretty basilica, a chateau, and some walls to walk on. Vitre has a castle and a ton of preserved medieval dwellings, apparently in the top 50 in all of France. Fougeres has a castle, and a church at the top of the city with a good view Broceliande/Paimpont, besides lovely hiking, has several sites like 'Merlin's Tomb' tied to Arthurian legend since the 1100s. You will need a car to see all the sites. Carnac, to see the standing stones. Nantes is one of the biggest cities in France. I didn't have much time there, but I really liked the Dukes of Bretagne chateau, cathedral of st peter and st paul, tour bretagne, and the jardin des plantes de nantes. I spent most of my time in Rennes. There's Thabor (gardens), Champs Libres (museum/science space/library), Parlement building tours, place des lices (second biggest market in France), Portes Mordelaises and the Duchesne Tower/Wall (medieval fortifications), musee de beaux-arts (art museum). Most of the old city center is pedestrian only, so I'd park outside the main area and take the small metro/bus system around. Most of my recommendations are in the Ille et Vilaine department. If you end up not renting the car, don't want to deal with parking or putting too many miles on it, etc, there is a department-wide bus system called Illenoo that is very affordable."

Generally, with some exceptions, west of that line is the more expensive half and east is less expensive. In the west, hostels will be $25-40 a night depending on season, busses between cities will be $30-60 depending on time of day and distance, and going out to eat/drink will be roughly the same as in the US. For Scandinavia, multiply these ranges by about 1.5. In the east, hostels will be $10-25, busses $15-40, and food between half and 2/3 the price of going out in the US. Maybe even less than half in the southern Balkans, Ukraine, Russia, etc. due to economic conditions. There is definitely room to save large amounts of money though. Easiest way is to cook frequently, especially if you team up with other hostel guests and cook large meals together, and not drinking as often as you might want to. Also if you're an outdoors person, camping is obviously cheaper than lodging.   Edit: also ridesharing and minibus type of services are getting popular all over Europe, those are cheaper than trains and busses, not always significantly so, but much more convenient and an alternative to not being surrounded by 50 other humans on a bus."

travel,3dzl09,toozler,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:12 2015 UTC,"Just go to an outdoor store, ask an employee to help you try on a few packs and buy whichever feels the most comfortable with some weights in. Even if you only airbnb now, a good pack will serve you for many years to come and will be worth every cent.   Don't go overboard with the volume, a 50L or so pack is more than enough for most people."
travel,3dzl09,vernazza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"I would worry about getting what is going into the pack paired down to the lightest kit you can. I see a lot of travelers bringing huge backpacking bags, like the kind I bring into the mountains. If you will have decent access to stores/restaurants and are mostly staying in buildings (not camping) you can generally pack a small amount of stuff. When I worked in Ghana I only brought 2 carry-ons for a 6 week stint which included camera gear (photojournalist) in one and clothes/toiletries in the other. I had an amazing experience and never felt weighed down. Just be prepared to do a little laundry in the sink.  As for gear that helps with that:  Castile Soap: Can be used for your body, hair and for doing laundry. Helps with the ""no liquids"" TSA rules and handles a lot of job for minimal space and weight.  multi-use travel pants: Bluffworks are my favorites but unfortunatly don't make ladies pants yet. These bad boys look stylish and are tough. I once took them hiking in desert heat in the morning and went to a 5 star restaurant that night. They looked and, surprisingly, smelled good still. I typically only pack two regardless of trip length.  Shoes: Again find shoes that fill as many roles as possible. In my case I have very inexpensive and thin sandels for beach/around my room/in the hostel or hotel, and nice looking boots. With the bluff work slacks the boots are nice enough for dining and they clean up really well after a hike.  Once you have your kit down you can look at getting the smallest bag that will fit everything. I personally use a ThinkTank Airport Essentials and my girlfriend prefers Victornox bags."

travel,3dxa05,caprismart1978,4,Mon Jul 20 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Two weeks in the US is quite short to be honest, especially given its size and number of destinations.  Much like how Americans want to view ""all of Europe in a month"", perhaps going from one part of the US to another in such a small timeframe isn't the best option if you want to have a good time.  Since you said you want to visit NYC for a few days much of New England has lots to offer in regards to tourism.  Boston and Philadelphia for example are great destinations for pre-revolutionary architecture and tourist attractions.  Niagara Falls is stunning and only a few hours north of NYC.  Washington DC has lots of fabulous sights and attractions, plus some interesting museums and restaurants as well.  If you and your partner haven't seen much of the US what's better than the nation's capital!  Having gone to the DC area multiple times due to family it's almost always a delight to visit, plus if you stay in the city public transportation is surprisingly decent for the most part.  Although I'm a bit biased, living in San Francisco and everything, but SF is also a quite lovely city as well.  Lots of food, culture and ambiance, riding a cable car is quite an experience! (Funny enough my apartment is right by a cable car track and I commute with it every day).  Although flying from one coast to another is around a 5 hour flight, depending on the flight pattern and route.  Although due to the time zone difference you wouldn't be losing much in terms of relative time it's quite a hassle overall.  In the end though there's so much to see and do in the US it's worth visiting more than once just to soak it all in!"

Niagara Falls would be fantastic and would fit in really well with going to NYC - a few people have suggested San Francisco, I'll definitely look into that.

You could also do NYC and New Orleans in that time period.  I live right near Niagara Falls, and tbh I don't think it's worth adding into your trip given your time frame, unless you really wanted to add Toronto onto your trip (which is a great city btw).

You can see the redwoods / sequoias, yosemitte, big mountains an geysers etc. Also there are great cities on the west coast, but they are much farther apart, actaully everything is a lot farther apart, and you will probably need a car.

But I grew up in a rural part of Austria and I am used to tour and trek through mountain ranges from 1500 to 3000+ Meter altitude. We have every winter people getting lost in the mountains because they are either from the flat lands (e.g. flat parts of Austria or other countries) or they perish in avalanches because they can't read the environment. Also weather changes are extremely quick within mountain ranges and often lead to fatalities of some hikers.  I am currently on a 4 month trip through south east asia and I would not have expected how exhausting a 3 hour trek through a forest in tropical heat could be.

Keep in mind they get a TON of snow in the winter. You ever see that viral picture of the bus driving down the road surrounded by huge walls of snow on each side, that's from the Hakkodas. Snowshoing is popular, but make sure you go with a local guide. People get lost and die there pretty often. Also a big hazard is volcanic gases. Occasionally hikers wander off the beaten path and die of lack of oxygen in certain areas."

travel,3dxwt4,ambivalent_owl,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"In a decent world your article shouldn't need writing!   As much as I wish we would, we don't live in a decent world. It is getting more and more clear that animals such as dolphins and whales and primates and crows and parrots and elephants are smart and have complex brain structures which allow them to feel many emotions, yet we as a species continue to exploit and use these animals for our own leisure, entertainment or to do our work for us. We keep them as pets and in zoos and we use them to make our lives easier. Check out the documentary Blackfish (it's on Netflix), read up about Caledonian Crows and Alex the Parrot for examples of intelligence in birds and look up the exploitation of elephants in (amongst others) Thailand. It is high time we realize that (some?) animals deserve rights too. Shoutout to /r/animalrights and the Non-Human Rights Project. Sorry for soapboxing on this sub but I think it's a relevant subject for many travelers, as is illustrated by OP and by previous posts about elephants in Thailand. I hope the mods will allow it."
travel,3dxwt4,ruk_hai,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"While I share your outrage, I actually think it is quite understandable for people to not take the time to consider the conditions of the animals. The abuse isn't that obvious if you don't know what you are looking for (chains may not look different to dog leads) and they are cute and adorable and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. That's why we are trying to get the government to acknowledge it. It's illegal and frankly an embarrassment for a country that has decent laws to combat this sort of thing.  But also, I think it's important to warn people before they go. So that they fully understand the issues.   Also, now that you mention it, I have been reading that monkeys in Gibraltar have higher stress (cortisol) levels. But in my opinion, feeding the monkeys (or allowing them to steal from your car etc.) is a bigger problem."

What were you pros/cons of the tour as opposed to doing it independently?  My friend and I are looking at doing Trans-Siberia in the near future and this isn't an option I've considered. Thanks in advance.
travel,3dx9zo,Andromeda321,2,Mon Jul 20 09:48:31 2015 UTC,"Hi,  We traveled on all the trains in the 'Kupe' or 2nd class carriage which is a 4 berth room It's very small, however it was easily enough room for all of us (3 people). You do need to be comfortable in close quarters with people, and the occasional foreigner may join you in your cabin. The rooms feel secure, and there's bag storage under the beds, which is also fine, and I never really felt in danger of being robbed etc.... (which i was slightly concerned about prior to the trip starting).  If you speak the language of the country you are entering I would be very confident in doing the journey independently, however if not, I would recommend booking through a tour. Very few people spoke english in Russia and Mongolia, and to a lesser extent China. This is fine for basic things, but I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I needed to explain a complex problem. Within the tour we had someone to meet us at every major town. So we had someone there to organise everything for us and speak the local language in restaurants, shops and in train stations. I wouldn't be too against a tour now I've done one, I was nervous but it was a great experience. Plus if you are travelling with a friend you will not have the risk of being with a group of people you don't like, which is always a problems with tours. If you do go independently, i'd definitely buy a few good guide books, and do lots of research. Learn basic Russian and Chinese. you would save a lot of money this way, but expect a bit more stress.  image"
travel,3dxdyf,electrichedgehog,4,Mon Jul 20 09:15:43 2015 UTC,"Midtown/Times Square will be close to the tourist attractions but will feel very commercial Upper East Side will be mixed. Most units will be in highrises. Upper West Side will be older, shorter (i.e., 15 stories instead of 40), more stately. More stone facades. More neighborhood feel in places Chelsea/Village will be more neighborhood feel, dominated by walkups (5-7 stories) Brooklyn will be more neighborhood feel, hipster in places. But you will spend a lot of time on subways getting to some locations in Manhattan (i.e., AMNH, Met, etc...)   As you are looking at places, also look at a subway map to see how close it is to a subway and how many changes you will need to get to the neighborhoods that you want to spend the most time in.

For taxis off the street: - Know where you are going, and how much it's roughly going to cost - In some places the drivers might ask for extra payments for any kind of BS reason, those being that the sun is shining, or that it's not shining, or that it's raining, or not raining. Judge whether or not that payment is worth it (protip, usually it's not) and take it from there. - Insist on the meter, and just jump out if they refuse - Keep your eye on the meter, and if it's rigged in any way, just stop the car, pay, get out and get another one"

Although this is probably one of the more common scams out there, a really good bit of advice is to never purchase anything from someone who approaches you while travelling. Even if they turn out to be the best vendor for whatever it is you need, refuse at first. Take a breath, get your bearings and do your research. Once you are armed with the info you need (expected price and service, knowledge of common scams), then YOU make the approach and take the lead in the negotiation.

travel,3dw73s,IWanderlust247,2,Mon Jul 20 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"A similar thing happened to me first time I was in Hongkong a couple of years ago. A man approached me at the airport asking if I was in need of hotel. I said yes and he said he would take me for free to the cheap but good hotel centrally located that he worked for. The hotel fare (which I don't remember) seemed good and I joined him. At the hotel I told the man that worked there that I was gonna try to find a train ticket to Beijing for the following day but he replied that it would take me at least 3 days before I could leave since all trains are fully booked. I agreed to stay 3 nights and left him my passport and he gave me the bill which was about the double amount of 3 nights. When I complained he said there were 2 types of tax on top of the hotel fee (which nearly doubled the amount).. I was tired and wanted to sleep so I paid. The following day I found a cheap flight to beijing the next day and also discovered a nice hostel in the same building as the not-so-nice hotel I was in. So I managed to get the man at the hotel to refund me for 1 night out of 3 when I moved to the hostel after only spending 1 night in the hotel. I tried to get 2 nights refund but then he threatened to call the HK-police so I left it at 1 night refund.. Well, what can I say, there were lots of warning signs along the way, but I was young (21) and an unexperienced traveller. All I knew was that HK-hotels were gonna be quite expensive. My advice to all travelers out there: You don't always need to book hotel/hostel but make a research to find out rates, taxes etc so none can fool you."

I'm also jealous you were able to take photos in Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen and Saudi Arabia, not exactly easy places to travel or get into.

travel,3dvi0p,dswphoto,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a motorcycle travel writer/photographer. I have a variety of cameras and lenses to choose from, depending upon need and luggage space.  What you choose is partly dependent upon what you want to do with the photos when you return and how much you are willing to carry. For prints up to 11x17 (and even 18x24 if you know what you are doing), Micro Four Thirds cameras from Olympus and Panasonic provide a good balance of quality and size. Look at the Panasonic GX7 and Olympus OM-D series in particular as well as the tiny Panasonic GM5. The system has many wide angle lenses to choose from.  Also consider good compacts like the Sony RX100 series and Panasonic LX100, as well as the Canon GX series.  Or you can buy a wide angle lens for your Nikon, add a GoPro for video, and take a photography class before you leave."

I had a very old Nikon D50 and upgraded to a D800, with the ""problem"" being the D800 is full frame, so I've been working up upgrading my lenses. My photography is more landscapes and architecture than street photography. Anyway-  Nikon D800 with the following lenses   Rokinon 14mm f2.8  Nikon 28-80mm f/3.3-5.6G (super cheap used) Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF (full frame replacement of my old 50mm) Nikon 80-200mm f/4.5-5.6 D-AF (super cheap used)   And the only other lens I want is the Nikon 16-35mm. The 14 is great in the meanwhile but I can't put any filters on it, pfft.  Travel tripod is the Benro Travel Angel B0 tripod. Has some really nice options on it and collapses down to a small little thing that easily fits in luggage or attached to a backpack."

travel,3dvi0p,elank515,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"If you're hitching I'd probably stick with something small and light, otherwise it'll become a big burden, especially for your back since you'll probably be moving around a lot. That said, if you already have Nikon lenses it might be best to just upgrade to a D5500 which is an excellent camera but also relatively lighter and smaller. It might be easiest to stick with one lens (a zoom) something that covers the wider end to medium telephoto, like an 18-200mm which would give you a lot of flexibility.  Others have mentioned a Panasonic or Olympus Micro Four Thirds and they both have some excellent, small and light cameras, with a few drawbacks but many of them have the ability to change lenses so you could get maybe 1 or 2 that again cover something wide and something like a medium telephoto range (24-70mm equiv.)   The sony a6000 would also be an excellent camera since its cheap, produces fantastic photos, has a lot of features, and there are a variety of lenses from cheap to very expensive you could buy.  In terms of my own experience, I'm quite passionate about photography so I've upgraded my gear over the years as my ability increased. I began with a Nikon d90 and Sigma 17-70 which covered a lot for me. Then I used a Nikon D7000 and took with me a 35mm 1.8G, Sigma 17-70, Nikon 70-300 and Sigma 10-20mm. While that kit covered almost any situation I encountered from very wide 10mm to a long telephoto at 300 mm, it was really annoyingly heavy to lug around in the heat throughout my travels in Sri Lanka. It also took up a lot of room and I had to deal with spots on my sensor from switching lenses constantly. Today I use a Sony A7 (small full frame camera) and the last trip I took to Ethiopia I took with me a Samyang 14mm, Sony Zeiss 55mm and 35mm 2.8. For a variety of reasons and to simplify my setup while giving me more flexibility I've sold the 14mm and 35mm and bought a Zeiss 16-35. You can see my recent photos at www.shefman.com"

We typically use a mix of GoPro and the 60d for video. I also use a smaller Canon M1 with a 22mm f/2 when I need to be more discreet. I will echo what a fewer other said I would invest more time and money learning your craft than worrying about gear.

It is advised to not visit the south (both of Beirut and of the country) as it is more hardcore Hizbollah territory and east (Beqaa Valley).  Lebanon has lots of Palestinian and Syrian refugees who are in camps or sort of Ghetto's. Avoid those areas as much as possible.  Apart from that the country is not that dangerous for a traveller. Watch out where you're going and what you do at night and you should be fine. Of course there are bomb attacks every once in a while, but the chance you'll be in them is minimal."

We drank beer in a boat all day with a couple of friends so we didn't really see the surrounding nature.  1 day to Postojna and Koper. I wish I had gone to Škocjan caves instead. Postojna was very very touristic. Koper was fun :)  1 day to Tolmin to see the gorges and hike some. From what I've heard it might be better to go further north and hike further upstream of the Soça river. From nearby Tolmin we took the train under the mountain to the east.  1 day Bohinj.

travel,3dxdg6,WillMTB,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Glad I've found my first post on this subreddit I can help out on!  I spent 6 weeks going around from Bangkok to Cambodia, into Vietnam, up to Hannoi, into Laos and back into Thailand. Whilst you are only doing about half of this journey, one week is a very short period of time to cover a LOT of distance!  For instance, I spent 3-4 days exploring the temples of Angkor (and bars) in Siem Reap, and then spent pretty much a whole day going straight to Phnom Pen, where I spent a couple of days sightseeing (tuel sleng genocide museum was eye opening). I then spent a day or too at the beach of Sihanoukville.  This raced right through the country missing out a lot of places, I didn't get to see the Tonle lake, the colonial town Battambang, any of the national parks, wild dolphins at Kratie etc etc.  My point is that you could easily spend two-three weeks in Cambodia alone!  Vietnam is another matter. I spent a week in Ho Chi Minh alone, going round all the museums and generally chilling in the parks in the day, drinking with everyone at bia hoi at night. Check out the War Remnants museum, very moving. I stayed in a cool dorm called Halo. From Ho chi Minh you can go to the Mekong Delta and explore the islands.   I did this and then bought a motorbike after speaking to so many people who had made the trip down from Hanoi, wanting to experience it myself. This is a very time intensive way of travelling, but it was an amazing experience. I didn't make it all the way to Hanoi!  One thing you may want to do is explore Ho Chi Minh, and then fly to Hanoi, missing out everything in between. This would be way more practical and allow you to see two really cool cities, when I was there I believe you could get a ticket for about £75. You could check out Ha Long Bay.  Travelling on land up Vietnam will take a long time, even with taking the 24 hour and overnight buses, you won't get too far!  My recommendation would be either to spend all your time in one of these countries, or to take several flights to make the most of your time.   Happy travels and best of luck! These are amazing countries to explore. Feel free to AMA!"

It looks like we're going to spend 3 days in Siem Reap and then fly straight to Hanoi and spend the rest of our time there.

Get tickets there and basically go straight in. It's nice considering how terribly hot it is at the moment.   Barcelona is amazing. Do you know where you are staying yet? Do the Sagrada Familia during sunset if possible. The light into the window were so incredibly beautiful then. Seriously go in though, it was my favorite part of the entire trip there. Be prepared to have tickets to everything, so prebook if you know where you want to go.   Remember to have some down time and relax!

travel,3dwbxh,nlderek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they probably sent you to Elektra and I think the ATM in there only works for Elektra accounts and it is usually out of order :) We have an Elektra account since it is the only bank you can set up on a tourist visa so we got our first account there to start sending money for construction until our resident visas were ready.  To be fair we live here and have a vehicle so I guess knowing where the banks/ATMs are would make a huge difference, haha...but you're right in that the touristy areas don't really have many. We recommend to our guests that they take out the max at the airport before arriving to make it easier.  There are ATMs inside Chedraui, the big supermarket up on the hill and then most of the banks are in that general area. There's Banorte, HSBC, BBVA and then Banamex at the top of the Adoquin near the fishing boats (this is the closest non rip-off ATM in the general tourist zone)...there are rip-off $6 fee ATMs now along Zicatela, the main ones are near the Arco Iris Hotel....but the good thing is that these ones always work, whereas some people have trouble with their cards at the banks.  The best bet is to just catch a cab to the HSBC or use the ones in Chedraui (formerly Super Che).  Also, a little trick (which isn't as useful for Canadians) is that Chedraui accepts US dollars at a very good rate. You can't ""exchange"" there, but you can pay for $10 worth of groceries with a $100 bill and get your change in pesos. I've never tried to ""over-pay"" with say 5 twenties for a small bill but they probably would be fine with it.  The toilet seat thing is pure economics...they surely had seats when they were installed but then they broke and the owner didn't want to spend the $15 to get a new one. It's not a ""cultural"" thing...Mexicans certainly prefer toilets with seats.  The thing is that a lot of plumbing stuff here is super low quality and the good stuff can be insanely expensive...at our place we've had to replace every single toilet seat from the ones that came with the toilet in just 2 years. They just break.   It's just part of living in Mexico...cheap stuff that breaks more often. Any sort of upscale place will have seats....but Puerto doesn't really do upscale in many places, although that is changing fast."

You're in luck - it's at the tip of a peninsula not attached to the mainland so there is no drug trafficking going on and that removes a vast majority of the safety issues. On top of that the tourist police (which look like the army) are everywhere.  Tropical? Sure it's a beautiful place. The beaches have some views that are absolutely...out of this world. I have a recommendation for an area to stay in if you're interested - that includes a private beach on the Pacific side that is magnificent - but also walking distance to the party scene.

We stayed in a place called ""Casa Hald"" which was a 2 bedroom condo...absolutely loved it. It was about a 7 minute walk to everything - far enough away to be quiet and peaceful, close enough to be convenient (and did a mention the incredible beach on the Pacific side?)"

You might not actually find what you want yet but it'll get the ball rolling and get you back into the mindset a little ahead of time. Last time I came back from a big journey, I just posted on FB if anyone knew a temporary place to live, and within hours I had a room sorted with a friend of a friend who didn't mind having a lodger for a month or so. That then became my initial base from which to sort out something more permanent."

travel,3du5hd,HarryBlessKnapp,9,Sun Jul 19 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"What the fuck is wrong with people in this thread? I'll risk the downvotes. Traveling is fun, but it's much more fun when going with somebody who you care for and who cares for you. Seriously, why would anybody's first advice be ""Go alone""?   That's not solving the problem, it's avoiding it altogether. Maybe I'm naive, but it feels like that's not how relationships work.  OP, my advice would be to do a bit of both. Start planning the trip together, seeing what cities each of you would like to see. While researching you might come across some cities that are not as easily connected as others, and maybe there a tour (which has its own bus) would come convenient.  Otherwise, you can spend some time in very touristy places where English is very likely to be spoken, and some days in places you're more inclined to see.  Also, you could consider leaving the Asia trip for later. Asia feels like a completely foreign place if you look at it from her point of view. Have you visited much of Europe? (Your flair says 25 countries so I assume you have, but maybe you still want to see places like Eastern Europe or something). That might feel less foreign for her and she'll learn she can spend a few days in places where you don't understand local language.  Finally, I'd say that whatever you choose, you both openly discuss it in a calm manner. Don't force her to nothing, but try to persuade her that you're willing to give her some of what she wants if you get a bit of what you want.   Oh, and don't ignore the usefulness of apps nowadays. Maps (CityMaps2GO), offline translators and dictionaries (or online if you buy a sim card where you go, though personally I'm against having 3G on trips), that kind of stuff. Reassure her that you don't need the local language.   Talk about your past trips - ordering in restaurants is easy since you're likely to find a place that either has pictures or a menu in English/waitress who speaks English. Say that hotels' receptionists can always help giving recommendations.   Have a plan, tell her what you'd like to see, discuss activities to do. Otherwise it feels like you are in a very foreign place, with no idea of what to do, or where you are, or how to communicate. That's scary. Having a plan takes that away.  Good luck!"

I love my wife dearly and we have great travels together but traveling solo is still something I miss, and she does too. We're both very independent and have different things we enjoy.  Last summer I did a trek through the mountains of Guatemala and she's more of a rock climber than a trekker...so if we'd been on that trip together this is something we probably wouldn't have done.  I'm not suggesting they take every trip apart. Just some.  To be honest, having time to do your own thing is in fact what makes many long-term relationships work.  Yes, compromises are part of any healthy relationship...but so is making sure you each get time to be yourself on your own terms."

The food and wine are great. It's about as challenging as travelling around, say, Spain or Italy, i.e. not at all.

The only way to convince someone otherwise is to gently and slowly expose them to traveling, a little bit at a time. If you go directly from Western Europe to Kyrgyzstan and it turns out you don't have reliable electricity or running water, it could be a real culture shock that a lot of people are not going to be down for, and it could scare them away from traveling forever.  Most of us on this subreddit have a serious case of wanderlust. Many of us have traveled extensively and roughed it, and are comfortable with that, but a lot of others haven't, and that's OK too.

I honestly don't think that the countries you picked would be great if she hasn't travelled much. Try picking something a little more ""mainstream"" or go alone. Central Asia could be a little intense for someone who hasn't travelled a lot. She may fall in love with it, and you can go to Central Asia.

travel,3duxqe,NF_,4,Sun Jul 19 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the wall of text. This is in no particular order and a list of things ive seen and done during work travel.  Lubbuck Texas is the hometown of Buddy Holly.  Whitesands is in the bottom left of new mexico. After there, drive through roswell, nm.  Get a sopapilla at sadies in Albuquerque and go up sandia mountain. (Sandia means watermelon)  Grand canyon, of course. The Painted Desert, Petrified Forest, and Meteor Crator are all must sees.  I am a big fan of Lowery's in vegas for a great prime rib. Havent been there in about 6 years, but it is on flamingo st a block or two off of the main road if I remember correctly.   In Mississippi, on I10, you should stop at the shed. It at one time was the best bbq in the US (in my opinion). I havent been back in quite some time, but I hear their fame has gone to their heads.  New Orleans is a must if you enjoy great food and cheap/good drinks. The last time I was there for 2 days, 1 night and ate lunch at luke (2 dozen oysters at $0.30 each), walked to bourbon st and had a hurricane, absinthe from the old absinthe house, a big ass beer for $12, a fantastic 3 course meal at Emeril's NOLA, and finished off the night at cafe du monde for beignets.   Florida:  I go down to south florida somewhat regularly and have been meaning to go to lion country safari.   I enjoy fruit and spice world in homestead.  Stop by st augusine. It is the oldest continually inhabited city in the US. I myself enjoy eating at the columbia when I am there. Rollins college has the largest collection of tiffany glass, if you are into that. Ghost tours are pretty fun too.  Kennedy space center is fun if you like science/space. They closed the launch pad tour again, which is a shame.  Orlando of course has Disney World and Universal Studios. Big fan of 4Rivers and The Coop for food. There are tons of restaurants in Orlando and unfortunately all of the tourists stick to the chains.  Bok Tower is the tallest point in Florida and has nice gardens. I havent been back in more than a decade, but I'm sure its still nice.  If you are going to Miami, go to Key West. I don't think I have ever enjoyed myself in Miami and I dont think I have not enjoyed myself in Key West.  I'll add more if I think of it and get time. I am currently traveling for work and it may be difficult.   Edit: Oklahoma City? Brick town.  Edit 2: I would probably continue down to san antonio and see the alamo and hang out at the riverwalk. Dallas is great and all, but I like san antonio.  Edit 3: I forgot the hoover dam on the way out from vegas  Edit 4: Phoenix/Tempe are a great staging point for the grand canyon and all of that. If you plan to see whitesands, you drive by Tucson. Davis Mothan AFB has the boneyard.  Edit 5: I read through your comments. Is there some reason you chose that route? Like others have said, there is nothing in the middle of the US. Oklahoma City is not a tourist hotspot"

If you are looking for suggestions, I would start at San Fran/Diego -> Vegas -> Phoenix -> San Antonio -> New Orleans -> Orlando -> Miami -> Key West. Tuson, Albuquerque, oklahoma city, etc. are not bad places to be, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back to the others. They are mostly good places to raise a family or have one attraction that has local significance. Case and point, would you rather see walt disney world or the site of the oklahoma city bombing? You can go to Waco, Tx and see where the Waco standoff was (dont bother, its just a field) and the home town of mountain dew or the grand canyon, petrified forest, meteor crator, and painted desert (also americas top rated pizza is in downtown phoenix)"

I spent about an hour and a half at White sands and drove on. Alamogordo is near by, but that is small town where the local economy is propped up by the base there. If you are seriously interested in Roswell, you may as well stop at White Sands since you can make it on the way. If it was me (I like a good bar, great food, big history, and national parks) I would spend a fair bit of time in San Fran (US Mint), Vegas (bars and food), Phoenix (national parks), New Orleans (Bars, Food, US Mint) and then pick a couple things in the middle. I go to all of these places for work, so I end up spending a few days to a few weeks there, so I don't have to stress about budgeting my time. I can see how someone would regret not seeing the grand canyon or regret not spending more time in New Orleans, but a lot of people in Oklahoma City, for example, want to be anywhere else. Not saying its a bad place, there just isn't much to do. Funny story, on my way out there at the end of last year, I sat next to a newly wed couple from England who were honeymooning in Oklahoma City. After the flight, I talked to a few people while waiting for my luggage and everyone that talked to them before the flight or overheard us talking thought they were morons for visiting Oklahoma City for a honeymoon.

So they just eyeball it, and if it looks reasonable, they will let you in. So use a black bag - the color makes it look smaller. The only time an airline will not allow your bag is if it physically cannot fit into a cabin/under the seat. In which case, they will check it in for free. So if you have a bag you know won't fit, but it can fit through the security scanner, and the airline charges for checkin, bring it and they will check it in for free.   Also, as a general rule, newer airlines have WAY smaller cabin space for bags, while old airlines have absurdly large ones. So if you are travelling in a poorer country, you most likely can get away with larger bags.   A good rule in my experience is that the bag size they give you is bullshit. All that matters is your bag can physically fit. So for instance, if you go into the plane first and take up the space that was allocated to another seat, then they will fuck over the other guy, not you."
travel,3dvw3i,electricsheep12345,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:12 2015 UTC,From my experience I think it depends on how full the flight is.  I've had times when they don't even give you a second look and other times they check every single carry on!
travel,3dvw3i,Enuratique,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"In my experience, European airlines are much more strict. They weighed my carry-on at the check-in counter along with my actual checked baggage to make sure it wasn't over their 1.5 kg limit (or whatever it was). Domestic airlines, however, don't care - especially if it's reasonably sized for carryon."
travel,3dwhv9,JayReddt,2,Mon Jul 20 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with a foreign currency; online purchases from foreign merchants are often declined for fraud purposes. Call up your credit card company and let them know what you're doing. Also, if your credit card company will let you get a temporary virtual card number through their website (ShopSafe is one name for this), do that. The temporary virtual numbers will usually go through even if your main card is declines for fraud protection purposes.  Call or report online your travel before you leave. Otherwise you risk having your card shut off mid-trip because they think someone stole it. Do the same for your ATM/debit card."

If you have time open an account with Schwab Bank - they have a free checking account with free unlimited foreign ATM transactions with no surcharge/fee/whatever.

Chip and pin has been in my country for several years now without that explosion. Pay-wave is also here and is leading to some fraud problems, but the banks usually accept responsibility for correcting those provided they are advised of the loss in a reasonable time.  I've been using debit cards in my travels all over the world for years without ever having problems with fraud. In fact the only time I have experienced card fraud was when using a credit card, not a debit card.   It will eventually be stolen and you will bounce your mortgage/rent before it is refunded.   I use common sense. Before a trip I load the debit card with an appropriate level of cash including a safety margin. In the unlikely event it is stolen or fraudulently mis-used I can't lose more than I've put in it. That is not quite the same with a credit card, which can be maxed out to the credit limit."

I like to look through local (as in the destinations) media as well and see what is happening. This can have variable usefulness depending on if you know the local language. I am lucky enough to work in the travel industry so I tend to poke around in my network to see if anyone I know has traveled there or know someone else who has. I also check in with ex-pat communities online and try to finds books on the locations history. Depending on security, and whether I am on a production schedule, I also plan a day at the beginning of my trip to just walk a city or hike a region with no particular goal in mind. If I see things that look interesting I note them for a day near the end of my trip that is my ""flexible"" day.   . I enjoy meeting people from the countries I visit and exchanging with them and thus learning about the country/culture.   Be prepared by learning as much of the local language as you can. Find tips for local manners and don't afraid to pop into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.

We met some solo travellers and they were often enjoying themselves but I also found that they spent more time in their room at the hostels on their phones/iPads... At the same time, I am a pretty slow person/person who likes to take his time/person who likes to spend an afternoon in a park reading a book even while travelling and I found this harder with three other people... Overall it was great because our interests are similar but at the same time I like setting my own rhythm and being with others is synonym with compromises no matter what.

I also checked into the healthcare system a bit, just to make sure we would be OK if something did go wrong (Chile is ranked pretty high by the world health organization and has a pretty low infant mortality rate so that made me feel quite safe). I was checked right before leaving and as soon as I got back as well. What my Doctor said was that if you are going to travel, 7 months is a great time just because the chances of something going wrong or of going into labor at that point are pretty statistically low and you can move around quite a bit better than you can later in pregnancy.

It was still fun but I think if we had been able to wait a few months it would've been much better. We already had the trip planned and paid for when we found out she was pregnant.  For what it's worth, we went to a college football game when she was at the ""any day now"" stage. It was awesome because they let us use the elevators usually reserved for rich people. :)  It sucked though because the gamecocks were down by 6 with seconds left, on the 2 yard line about to score and the running back fumbled. I'm still bitter about it."

I am an outdoor person in general but Chile has really nice outdoor spaces so I would definitely try to get out to somewhere like Parque Nacional La Campana and someplace in the Andes. It's truly incredibly.  Quinta Vergara in Viña del Mar is a fantastic place for a daily stroll as well.  The buses in between Viña and Valparaiso and up the coast are quite easy and inexpensive so you will definitely be able to get around and see a lot.  Um, we got a tun of warnings about petty crime and theft but had no problems at all. How's your Spanish? I speak a little bit but I couldn't really understand anyone at all. Apparently Chilean is very colloquial so you may have to ask people to slow down and rephrase if you are rusty. I really enjoyed the Maritime museum in Valparaiso.

But when my husband and I were in the Balkans two years ago, we saw a family of 4 (both kids under 3) backpacking around the same areas we were visiting and it was so inspiring and relieving to me. Now I can't wait to show my children the world. And as for pregnancy, it was slightly trickier to travel during this time but totally worth it and I would do it again in a heartbeat!

travel,3duz4h,midori87,2,Sun Jul 19 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"it seems that most marketing positions are now combined with graphic design positions   In what world are you living in.  MBA marketing positions are never jobs like that. Those are your low level entry positions or specific graphic design jobs, not MBA jobs.  Second dude, you have an MBA- you know what the fuck is going on with the job world, you spent your entire time in business school dealing with recruiting and the current job market. You already know what is going on and how to get a good job. That is literally the entire point of an MBA program-- to get an MBA level job. Most MBAs are career changers as well, every company gets that. You don't need to go into sales if you don't want to  All of your travel stuff isn't relevant. You're back on the MBA recruiting thing. Start applying for jobs that recruit specifically for MBAs.  Commonly in marketing it would be stuff like marketing at a CPG company (usually brand management), a bank, a tech company and such, bigger companies love having MBAs, and are willing to pay. They hire MBAs like crazy. Usually start 80-120K for marketing, the primary requirement is to have an MBA. After that, of course its up to you in the interviews and recruiting process.  Here's another thing -- talk to your previous school! They have tons of connections!! They are there to help. They want their MBA grads to succeed.  tl;dr: You have an MBA, get your shit together, you already know what to do"
travel,3duz4h,CharlieKillsRats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I'm referring to local small companies that only have ""Marketing Coordinator"" positions available. My issue is that since it has been a year since my graduation, it might be too late for me to get recruited into an entry-level MBA position with a big corporation. I didn't go to a top-tier business school. I went to a state school and wanted to change career paths (BA in Psych, I had initially wanted to be a clinical social worker but changed my mind.) I have applied to positions like you have mentioned and I haven't gotten any bites. Most of these jobs also require 2-5 years of relevant experience."
travel,3duz4h,CharlieKillsRats,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from here man, its a tough market, but you're gonna be OK.   it might be too late for me   Its not. You just can't go through the University-centric recruiting process. Companies hire plenty of folks outside of this for their entry level MBA jobs, do some networking with companies-- you know how already. Most companies only recruit from a handful of schools,  but will take people from anywhere, any school, out of school etc. as long as you go through the process and meet their needs.   I didn't go to a top-tier business school.   Understood, of course that makes it harder, but what it really does is that you have to understand that you will probably just get a lower salary than a top-tier person, but the jobs are all available if you try. As said above, some companies just do the top-tier recruiting thing but every company if you network right and are the right person are willing! Hell even places like P&G and Microsoft man!   require 2-5 years of relevant experience   Job postings are sorta bullshit, they put tons of stuff on there that no one meets.. Pretty much every ""requirement"" is waived if you have a graduate degree (especially an MBA), these companies know whats up.  Do some networking and stuff man, you're fine, just get at it.  Submitting a random application to a random company doesn't work in these types of jobs for the most part (occasionally it does though), so get on the phone/email/networks, talk to friends, see what is happening."
travel,3duz4h,TProphet69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"Why would you go for an MBA and then go right back into what you were doing before? That doesn't make a lot of sense. Also, you are setting your sights too low as others have mentioned.  If you have an explanation for the gap on your resume (gaining international experience) then it's not going to be a problem in recruiting.  Lower tier MBAs - depends whether low or mid-tier. Is your business school ranked by FT?"
travel,3due8k,TheHibernian,3,Sun Jul 19 15:58:14 2015 UTC,I know it isn't on your list and might not seem as adventurous but I would recommend Quebec. I would say you could visit both Montreal and Quebec City in 10 days. Montreal is a very nice city with lots of culture and excitement. The old part of Quebec City feels more like Europe than North America. Both cities are extremely safe and you could probably find plane tickets between 400-500 and the accommodations are pretty inexpensive for solo travelers (especially in Montreal)
travel,3due8k,plebsareneeded,3,Sun Jul 19 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"If you're going to South America you should book ASAP. I'm going to Peru and Bolivia for two weeks around the same time and tons of places are booked up, and this was a few weeks ago. We barely got the hotels we wanted in a lot of cities and for specialty stuff like an Amazon trip or Huayna Pichu tickets (limited to 100 a day) likely all gone.   If you liked Cambodia/Thailand though I'd recommend Vietnam. The country is so beautiful and diverse you could easily spend a month there. Also, I went last year and September seemed like the low season not many tourists anywhere we went. When I sailed Halong bay our boat only had like 5 other couples and could fit 15-20 couples it was a great experience.   I could recommend hotels/places if you're interested just let me know.

travel,3due8k,BurtonCat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Sure! this is just a rough outline.  Seattle -> Lima  Stay in Lima three nights and see as much as we can of the capital.   Lima -> Puerto Maldonado (Amazon)  Here we're staying at a lodging deeper into the Amazon for 3 days two nights that hosts a bunch of different tours/hikes/boat-rides and such into the jungle during your stay.  Puerto Maldonado -> Cuzco  Staying here for 5 days and 4 nights to try and see as much of the Inca Valley as we can. Staying at a nice bed and breakfast type place in the middle of town  Also, we got tickets for Machu Picchu (2500 a day) and Hauyana Pichuu (200 a day) and so one night are staying town right next to the site, Aguas Calientes, in a small bed and breakfast as well. That way we can get an early morning start before the rush of trains gets in.   Cuzco -> Puno  On a bus that stops at several different sights to check out along the way. Then just spend one night in Puno as we heard there's not much do to other than see Lake Titicaca which we are doing by boat all the next day before leaving.   Puno -> La Paz  This is part of a joint tour which includes a day trip on the lake before heading out on a similar bus from before that stops at some cool sights and spots along the way to La Paz, Bolivia.  Once in La Paz we plan on staying 5 days and 4 nights and doing a couple hikes, going out of down on day trips, and of course just seeing the sights and such. I want to catch a game at the highest soccer stadium in the world :) staying at a small inn close to a lot of restaurants and the like in town.  Then headed back home! We definitely miss a lot of stuff and aren't in Bolivia for long but with travel you just have to pick and choose! The two things I didn't want to miss though was having enough time in the Inca Valley and that amazon excursion for a few days.  Good luck with planning your trip."

I actually got a 'what the hell?' look on my face reading OP's post above.  Plenty of people backpack all over Latin America without booking anything in advance, all the time.  The only thing I can think of that needs to be booked in advance is Machu Picchu. But even with that there are ways to do it without worrying too much.  Edit: Just saw that that user posted their itinerary... Makes a little more sense now.

Go to bahn.de/en and enter ""München Hbf"" as your start, ""Amsterdam Centraal"" as your destination, enter time and date, and see what connections fit within your budget and itinerary.  If you buy standard fare tickets, you can interrupt your journey at any station and resume it on the same day, however you must stick to the route you chose, i.e. no detours. Advance fares are cheaper, however you must stick to specific trains and cannot interrupt the journey (unless you have a really long interchange.)  Unfortunately, not many of the cities along either route are good for a short intermediate stop IMO for various reasons. Maybe Nuremberg (on the Hannover route) or Stuttgart (on some Cologne routes). Most cities on the Rhine are rather boring IMO (Cologne and surrounding), and the cities in the north (unfortunately) often don't really lend themselves to super short visits (e.g. Kassel, Hannover)."

travel,3dtlj4,Letsgodutchonthis,3,Sun Jul 19 09:48:00 2015 UTC,"Florida is the plan, thanks for reply"
travel,3dtlj4,Letsgodutchonthis,12,Sun Jul 19 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"I can tell you, there are no 'scoops' or 'secret deals' when it comes to Disney World, but there are more affordable ways to experience the magic without spending a fortune.   I recommend staying at a 'value level' Disney resort. Don't stay 'off property' as Disney world is huge, traffic is bad, you'll need to rent a car and then pay for parking. Staying at a Disney resort, you can take the magical express (Disney bus) direct from the airport to your resort, and then rely entirely on Disney's free transportation once you're there. I like the All Star Resorts, but Art of Animation is the newest value resort.   Get the Disney dining plan. You will have more food than you need at an acceptable price (for Disney World.) This will allow you meals at high end Disney restaurants without paying the bill at the end.   There's not really anything you can do about the cost of entrance tickets. There are some discounts you can find but none are too awesome.  Avoid buying souvenirs in the parks. They cost lots, weigh you down, and don't add much to the 'magic.'"
travel,3dtlj4,cchelios5,6,Sun Jul 19 10:42:31 2015 UTC,I can confirm this all to true. One other tip I would make is depending on what time of year you go it might be meltingly hot. When I went we would wake up early to get to the park right when it opened. We would leave after lunch and nap/break at the hotel. Then go back for some more fun and the show at night. Night shows are awesome and you do not want to miss them but after the whole day its really hard to stay that long with the heat. Good luck

travel,3dtlj4,ga_to_ca,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:57:29 2015 UTC,"Allot three days.  I know, additional days add a lot of expense, but in three days, you should be able to do everything you want, and all generations can have a good experience without feeling rushed.  With a six year old and a senior, take a break in the middle of the day.  That's when the park's busiest anyway.    Best daily schedule is, get there as soon as it opens.  If you have Extra Magic Hours, use them.  Around 11, go back to the hotel.  Swim in the pool, or take a nap, have grandma watch your son, and you and your wife grab some down time in your air conditioned room.  Take a lunch (cold cuts and sandwiches out of the hotel fridge can really help you economize), go back to the park around 3 or 4, you, and especially your son, will be re-energized to take on the rest of the day.  A lot of great stuff happens after sundown, but if anyone in your party is exhausted after being there 12+ hours without a break, everyone will have more difficulty enjoying it.  Be sure to watch for parades, exhibitions, extra demonstrations, character meetings. Disney is not the best locale for thrill rides, what it does best is immerse your kids in the fantasy, but what I appreciate as a father is the incredible detail of the art and the rich experience of everything around me."

Staying on site is a must, the transportation is so nice to have and you can use the extra magic hours. I always stay at a value resort to save money (either Pop Century or Art of Animation) but if you have the money the other hotels are nice too. I would go 5-7 days. If you do 5 days I do 2 at Magic Kingdom, 2 at Epcot, 2 at Disney Hollywood Studios and 1 at Animal Kingdom. Booking early (which seems like you will have plenty of time) is helpful, because the desirable fastpasses go quick when released as do dining reservations if you want to do any sit down meals. You can book those 180 days in advance.."
travel,3du8zn,around_the_world_17,10,Sun Jul 19 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"Barcelona to do list!  The basics: 1. Park guell - gaudi's masterpiece. Looks like candyland. Don't miss.  2. La segrada familia - has it's own metro stop so you literally can't miss it. It's been under construction for years and will always be. Dont bother going inside. Its overpriced, and totally anti-climactic.  3. Las ramblas - it's a big street in the main part of town that is really touristy, but also necessary to see. There are tons of shops and little alley ways, if you walk down them you will find tons of cute shops bars and food.  4. Gothic district. Food, shopping, etc. Great burger place that I forget the name of....but if you find it, go. Oterwise avoid the burgers in Barcelona. There completely terrible 5. Cathedral. It's right outside of re gothic district and also under construction. Very pretty inside though.  6. Mont juic (might be spelling it wrong..) take the metro to the mon juic atop and then bus or walk alllllllll the way up to the top. There is a gorgeous view of the city from the top, as well as museums, gardens, the Olympic stadium, and more.  7. Barcelonetta is the city next to the beach. Walk through it and down to the beach. Along the way you'll find an awesome gelato place (or two) and also great falafel and kabob places.  8. Passieg de gracia - huge street with beautiful architecture, two famous gaudi buildings (you can go into one of them--you have to pay to go in but it's completely worth it). There's also great shopping (probably not your thing but still cool to see) and good food, etc.  9. La boqueria - open air market that is partially in doors and partially outside. It's hhhuuugggeee and they have everything. If you're walking down las ramblas from the main square it's on your right next to a dunkin donuts. The dried strawberries are to die for (if you like that stuff). It's mostly food and fruit and stuff. Lots of meat and fish too. This is where most of the locals shop.  10. Tibidabo is a theme park on top of a mountain (highest point in re city) it's a trek up there but you can take the metro to the to tibidabo stop and then walk or train all the way up. There are rides and ferris wheel and it's really pretty and definitely worth checking out (but probably more fun if you find friends to go with you)  Food and bars 1. Chupitos - means shots in Spanish. 2 euro shots but they're all really unique and fun. They light shots on fire and have dumb names for them like orgasm, etc. Shounds dumb but it's really fun. There are two--one in barcelonetta and one in the other side of town.  2.  Oveja negra  (black sheep in English)  is my FAVORITE bar in barcelona. It's the only place where locals actually drink sangria. If you walk down las ramblas you will see a fast food restaurant on the right called pans in company. If you turn right at the alley right past there you will find it. Or ask someone on las ramblas where oveja negra is and they will guide u. It's a hole in the wall, and they make it hard to find on purpose. But it's amazing.  3. Mussol - great restaurant. There are 2 locations, go to either one. The food is great.  4. Ciutat comtal is the best tapas place in Barcelona in my opinion. It's on the street rambla de catalyluna which is on the other side of las ramblas. Don't. Miss. This. Seriously.  5. Rosa negra. Mexican food place not far from the cathedral. I know, Mexican in spain sounds weird but it's really good. Try one of the burritos. it's on via la tiena which is right by where you're staying.  6. Sutton is the Thursday night hot spot club. If you're there and feel like clubbing find that club. Make sure you wear nice shoes and a shirt with a collar. It's really fun and kind of crazy. 7. There is an abainthe bar called bar Marsella  where picasso used to hang out at. It's really old, completely authentic, and they serve you absinthe and a sugar cube. It's on a little street off of las ramblas. You have to go, its literally like going back in time.  8. 7 portes - Supposedly the best paella in Barcelona. It's kind of pricey, but it's good, if paella is your thing. It's on Passeig isabell, number 14. Walk down via la tienna and you'll run into it.  Resteronta bosco   Outside of Barcelona- 1. Sitges- most beautiful beach in spain, so they say. You can take the train or bus there and is about 30 minutes away.    Dali museum is about an hour away. If you have time, it's really cool to see and not your average museum.    A few helpful hints:  Dinner after 8:30. If you go before they will turn you away and laugh at you.  Siesta exists. Dont even try to do anything between 2 and 4.  Clubbing starts at 1 am. No joke. Don't go out earlier.  Evrythuhg is closed on Sunday.  Drinks at clubs are really expensive. Drink before you go."

A great market with beautiful architecture. I totally second Park Guell and La Sagrada Familia. There is literally nothing else in the world like Gaudi architecture. Barcelona Cathedral is gorgeous. When you get to the door, turn around and look at the square. There is a masterpiece hiding in the open. Placa Reial is an awesome square with great restaurants. It is very posh. Casa Milla and Casa Battlo are both on Passage di Gracia. Both are pricey to get in but totally worth it! Placa de Sant Filip Neri is a square in Barcelona where you can see the effect of WWII on this amazing city. Placa del Rei - the place where Columbus was greeted by the King and Queen! Very beautiful. There is also Sinagoga Major - the oldest synagogue in Europe and the Temple of Augustus. Also when it comes to food, you have to try tapas and Paella! If you get a chance, also check out a Flamenco show. Absolutely stunning! Hope this helps! Enjoy your trip, it is awesome."

Most insurances will cover when an insured driver drives a rental car, if that's what you mean, at least to the state-required minimum. Most rental car companies also are required to cover the minimum insurance amount (which isn't all that great, mind you), although I believe that's not the case in California, assuming that's where you're renting. Presumably that's where you're renting if the company is asking about your insurance. The best solution here is to call the insurance company and see how it works."

I just wanted to clarify something - I'm not across the whole landslide situation but is it that several main trails are closed and what you've written up is on the detours available? Can you still definitely travel between the towns on foot?"
travel,3ds474,JulietDelta,2,Sun Jul 19 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"My write up is on two normal paths (Monterosso through Corniglia) and two detour paths (Corniglia through Riomaggiore).    You can still travel through the entire area on foot, it will just take longer and be quite a bit more tiring, to be honest, as another person noted.  Still incredible though."
travel,3ds474,RockLikeWar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:22:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely can still go between the towns by foot. I did maybe 2 weeks ago. Just instead of following the main trail, #2, the whole way, you eventually have to detour up trails 7 and 6b to continue onwards. It's a lot more uphill and more time consuming, but you also get some spectacular views you wouldn't have otherwise. End of the day, my legs were exhausted but it was one of the nicer hikes I've done."

I actually have a couple questions you might be able to answer...  So it looks like you crushed this hike out in one day, bravo lol, I think in my shape right now I might be a two day kind of guy so I was wondering about how easy that would be to do and the logistics of it. Long story short I blew my knee out a year and a half ago and I kinda tweaked it/not feeling 100% but I wouldn't say I'm in bad shape. Just the down stair info your talking has me alittle concerned it puts an uncomfortable pressure on the joints so if you had trouble i figure it needs to be considered.  Soooo would making a night in corniglia be pretty easy to accomadate? I can book in advance just wondering if I were to do a two day journey of this would that be the ideal route? I don't mind the extra time there and I'll be with my gf taking in the scenery.   Also did you do it fully backpacked up? We're gonna be rolling with  full packs and after your write up I'm thinking I'm gonna snag a big water bladder attachment for my pack since there seems to be a lot of unshaded 90+ degree shannanigans hah.   Again thanks for the tips and let me know! If there's a ""best of the towns"" that can become a pit stop that'd be cool I'm sure it'll be fine either way tho."
travel,3ds474,bigspring,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:09:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you have knee problems I would highly recommend finding a shaded spot at the top of the two detour routes and chilling out for a little while, drinking some water, maybe popping some ibuprofen, and resting the legs before the descent.  If you're doing the hike in two days it should probably be okay though.  The first two routes aren't too bad on the knees overall.  As far as a night in Corniglia, there seemed to be a number of accommodations there, including a guesthouse and a hostel, but you definitely want to try booking in advance or accept that you'll need to spend a bit more.  Also, Corniglia is the one that's on a cliff so if you want an easy beach during your stay you might want to stop in Vernazza or Manarola (Manarola is the best for swimming imo).  What you could do is hike to Corniglia, stop and rest for a few hours and enjoy the town, then in the evening as it cools make the hike to Manarola if you think your knees are good and then stay there.  Or stay in Corniglia and take a train to Manarola/Vernazza to beach up.  As for backpacks and shade, I did a day trip so I didn't do a backpack.  You could certainly bring a small one but the detours have some thin paths and thin steps at occasional points so I would highly recommend not having your bag.  You could always check in wherever you're staying and leave the bags there.  Shade depends on the path.  The two detour paths didn't have much shade but the first two had plenty which was nice for a warmup.  As far as favorite towns, my order is:  Manarola --> Vernazza/Riomaggiore --> Corniglia --> Monterosso.  Obviously all this is just my experience and opinions, so take it for what it's worth.  I won't have wifi for the rest of the day as I'm going to Austria through Venice but I'd be happy to answer more questions as soon as I can!"

I don't think you need to cut that much but you are a bit pushed for time. I'd say 9 months would do it. Average of about 2 weeks per every single place you've mentioned. I'd say 2 weeks was the minimum I'd aim for per country.  Budget wise you might be a tad short. I'd say £1,200 a month. Saying that, it depends how you do it.

This surely is covered there.   I don't have the answer for you, but judging from what I do know, I can say this. You do NOT have to pay USD 250 per day to stay with your girlfriend's family for 3 months. If your girlfriend and/or here family are citizens of Bhutan, there is probably a separate set of rules for that. If she is the daughter of a foreign diplomat posted in Bhutan, there's probably another set of rules again.   Worst case, you'll have to pay 65 USD per day. The 250 USD fee that tourists pay is the MINIMUM charge per day for tourist visits. This charge covers a lot. 65 USD is pure tax to the government. The rest must cover food, accommodation and transport, as well as various activities that may be included in the package.   During low season, the daily payment isn't 250 USD, but 200 USD.

As for the beer--most beers should be served slightly cooler than room temp, but not ice cold. Things like bud light can be ice cold because they're shit anyways. So outside of the US beers will seem a little warmer (some nicer craft beer bars in the us do serve theirs at the proper temp too). It helps you taste the flavors better.

You'll be bored before you know it, and the good thing about the city is being able to only be there for a little bit to experience a lot. I would definitely check out Boston - and the surrounding area - northern mass above Boston is BEAUTIFUL AND QUAINT beyond belief. Marblehead, Salem, Gloucester. All of the fishing towns, definitely checkout Portsmouth New Hampshire and lower Maine."
travel,3du8fr,jenefaispas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"I think your general plan is fine, but in my opinion you might want to cut a day or two off of NYC and add time to your other three destinations. I don't really consider NYC to be worth a week (but YMMV) and i could spend forever in D.C. and Boston is lovely as well. And the drive from  NYC to Niagara is pretty long - one night might not be enough there."
travel,3du8fr,hazyspring,7,Sun Jul 19 15:14:11 2015 UTC,I mean. DC is great and all but I can't possibly understand this statement. Not much to do in NYC but you can spend forever traveling DC? To each their own but let's be real here.
travel,3du8fr,jenefaispas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"I was also in elementary/middle school when i last visited DC...so, yeah.  But i stand by the statement that an 8/3 day split doesn't make all that much sense - maybe 7/4 or 6/5. Also not at all a fan of NYC personally, so there's a fair amount of bias in my answer (OP, take everything with a grain of salt...get more opinions if you can find them).  EDIT: last visited DC, not both"
travel,3du8fr,jenefaispas,3,Sun Jul 19 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"DC has tons of history and museums, but there is no city in the world like NYC.  DC has gotten better in the past few years with more restaurants and culture.  But, NYC is literally everything.  It's one of the great world cities.  You can go to museums and parks in Manhattan.  Typical tourist attractions like Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty.  Pick a neighborhood, and just walk around.    Go to Queens.  Eat Greek in Astoria, or have Chinese in Flushing.  Go to Brooklyn and walk around, go the park, walk around Williamsburg or Park Slope.  Go to a broadway show, or see a comedy show or some improv.  Check out Time Out NY and check the listings of the things to see and do every day.    The list of the things to do in NYC is endless and I am literally never tired of the city and always finding new things to do."
travel,3drr02,elduderino260,10,Sat Jul 18 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"I've definitely felt this way before. Usually you can get a feel for the mood of the place, and take photos at your discretion. When I was in India, for example, people were very receptive to having their picture taken even though many were extremely poor. In other places like Western Sahara, I could tell that taking pictures of sheet-metal homes and dirty streets would have been unwelcome. When it's not so clear, I find it best to err on the side of caution."
travel,3drr02,Liberalguy123,8,Sat Jul 18 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but it's all about what our subjects are and how you approach the shot. Taking pictures of destitute, struggling people for the sake of ""art"" is out of bounds in my book. And besides, who wants to see an album of that unless you are making an ad for Oxfam or something. However, I often want to give a sense for the environment or people, so I often use a long lense to avoid getting up in people's faces or I shoot folks from behind. I want people to maintain some measure of dignity. I wouldn't want people up in my grill either when I'm at home.  As a foreigner, you're probably going to areas where locals are very accustomed to tourists. I asked one of my guides in Ethiopia about whether it was disrespectful at all to photograph the people in and around Lalibela. He reminded me that tourists have been going there for hundreds of years and they don't even really pay attention to it.  At the end of the day, ""do unto others""...you know the rest."
travel,3drr02,ElPolloRico,6,Sat Jul 18 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"Not just taking photos, but travelling through those countries in general. Withdrawing the equivalent of a halfyear salary of a poor rice farmer from an ATM in Vietnam, just to get through the next few days or so, kind of made me feel guilty. Of course, life just isn't fair and at least as a tourist I am bringing money into the country I guess.  I don't really take a lot of expensive equipment with me, but I can imagine if you feel the same. Still, as a tourist there is no real hiding that you're wealthier. Your clothing (even if it's for trekking) and backpack and such usually already give off a vibe of being of higher quality (or cleanliness even).  Either way, a picture is just a picture. I hardly see people mind me being the tourist and snap pictures from my mobile phone (unless they say otherwise). Keeping the tourists happy, I guess (and maybe the money flow steady). Edit: Of course I am not making pictures in their faces of beggars and such."
travel,3drr02,Steelfyre,4,Sun Jul 19 06:08:11 2015 UTC,Yeah.  That's a fair point.  My very presence is something of a giveaway as to my socioeconomic status.
travel,3drr02,generallyok,4,Sun Jul 19 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"i don't take anyone's photo unless i ask their permission - or they are incidental to a shot i want to take and you can't see who they are. i don't take ""poverty porn"" pictures.   just being there is flaunting your wealth a bit, i don't feel bad about taking my camera out. it isn't especially nice, just a basic point and shoot camera, but still out of budget for a lot of people. but i think it would be silly to go and not try to have a good time. i think most people who live in developing countries want you to enjoy their country, while appreciating and respecting local customs and culture."
travel,3drr02,nlderek,3,Sun Jul 19 03:18:31 2015 UTC,"""Poverty porn."" I like the term (not the idea behind it, obviously).  It's pretty accurate.  I definitely try to avoid that at all costs.  I just mean that if I'm out and about and see a cool cityscape, I sometimes feel bad about taking out my camera if I am in a poorer area.  This is especially the case when I am working in rural villages and everyone almost inevitably asks me how much my camera cost..."
travel,3drr02,Crater_Escape,3,Sun Jul 19 14:48:00 2015 UTC,When in doubt ask if you can take the photo. My experience is people were glad to have you take them and sometimes would even do silly poses on their own. I do not pull my camera out and start taking people clearly in distress - I don't even ask them.
travel,3drr02,strangenchanted,3,Sat Jul 18 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. As fascinating as pictures of people and markets are, I barely take any due to it making me feel like a voyuer"
travel,3drr02,strangenchanted,4,Sun Jul 19 00:29:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't like to photograph beggars. But I've photographed many communities, and the more underdeveloped, rural communities are often the friendliest and happiest of my models. Urban communities tend to be more wary of photography, but rural ones are open to it. The tribes I've photographed were especially game.  I suggest you relax about developing countries. I know you don't mean it this way, but this mindset verges (a little) on condescending. People in developing countries aren't that different! And many of them are cool with photography and tourism. You're probably far from the first traveler they've encountered."
travel,3drr02,Igisambo,2,Sun Jul 19 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"I have found that it varies.  I travel primarily for research in Central America.  Some rural communities are very open and excited about photos.  Others will shut you down as soon as you take out the camera.  Folks in some urban areas won't bat an eye, while others will look at you like you're committing some terrible act.    I've definitely been told that my travels to these places borders on exoticism, which has a definite negative connotation.  My response is that most people in these areas are as interested in your life as you are in theirs.  Obviously one should treat them with dignity and respect, but the whole point of travel is exchange of ideas and learning about one another. I suppose the same things goes for photography.  Thanks."
travel,3drr02,Igisambo,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm very much against exoticism. But if you're visiting places where you're welcome, well, there shouldn't be an issue. There are many reasons for one to do travel photography. I've been doing it for many years. There's a learning process. You'll grow in assurance and be more comfortable in what you're doing, because you'll know yourself and won't be so affected by others' judgment."
travel,3drr02,uReallyShouldTrustMe,3,Sun Jul 19 15:01:16 2015 UTC,"I live and work in developing countries/conflict areas and pictures of people who I am working with is really one of my favorite things to bring from any project. But particularly because I am working with them I can't walk around a refugee camp taking pictures of old women or kids or anything else because it's dehumanizing.  Travelling in SE Asia and seeing somebody taking close up photos of poor kids in Cambodia with telephoto lenses just seems wrong to me.   What I end up doing is giving my camera to the kids and having them take a picture of me or of their surroundings. That way it's interactive with them and I can take some and they can take some without it being weird. I have broken a few cameras this way, but I would rather have a bunch of cool pictures and buy a new camera every year rather than just saving it for pictures of beaches and temples.   As an example here are some pictures I posted in another subreddit from refugee camps and the like."
travel,3drr02,notfarfromhome,2,Sun Jul 19 10:45:33 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Those are really neat.  I just feel uncertain about giving my camera to kids in some of the places where I travel/work.  I've had experiences where they very quickly learn the physical limits of some of my possessions, if you catch my drift."
travel,3drr02,teaoh,2,Sun Jul 19 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had really good luck though. Working in Africa or SE Asia or the middle east the kids are less careful than I would be, but I guess the cameras are pretty sturdy. I lived in Africa for six months and the kids would borrow my camera almost every day even when i wasn't around them and it didn't break until the very end. And I wasn't super angry either, because it was an excuse to buy a new camera.  I think that it also works well for building trust because you are giving something expensive to a street kid or somebody and trust them to not break it/steal it. That's more because I work with them, but I think that it extends to other kids as well."

travel,3ds3ei,cats_in_tiny_shoes,8,Sun Jul 19 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"As a disclaimer, I travel blog myself. Having been doing this for around 2.5 years now, I have grown to dislike lots of things about the 'industry.' 1) Not an ""alternative"" - Initially, Travel Blogging (henceforth 'TB') seemed like a good alternative to guide books. But seeing how many just take freebies and do reviews on places that paid them to do so, what is the point? 2) No opinion - Too many are trying to be everyone's friend. Everyplace was amazing and 'you can't wait to go back.' This doesn't help me at all and I will be pissed if I go and see you're full of shit. (Macao sucks, yeah I said it). 3) General Laziness - There are many cases where there is no fact checking whatsoever. It is just annoying. 4) Not helpful - I think to someone reading a blog, it is important to be useful in some way. I write guides to certain things I had trouble finding info on. More and more blogs would rather give me ""the meaning of life"" crap than actually provide something of value. 5) No Niche - ""20 something looking for the little meanings of life"" is done to death. 6) Non Expert Advice - Seriously, stick to something you know. Because you went to Paris once for a week doesn't mean you can write a ""guidebook to France."" 7) Click bait titles 8) Travel blogs talking about travel blogs, about travel blogging and how you can travel blog too. 9) Things I ate in x country. That is worthy of a instagram and a footnote, not a post. 10) Anything that has been written about COUNTLESS TIMES. Any idea you have, google it before you start writing."

I love good eating too, but just because you were in a place a week really doesn't make you qualified to write about what is the best food there. A better post would be the route you planned and link some resources of others who are living in said country who have written about the subject in depth. I've only ever felt really qualified to make a ""top food"" list on South korea as I lived there for many years and eat Korean food daily. I feel like I know the subject. Commenting on what I had in Italy really just gives you misleading information about mediocre places that I either make sound good for the clicks or no one reads.

But if I had to read them, please be a little original. I'd rather read a story about travelling the Taiwan coast with fishermen, but no, they're all smoking weed digital nomading from the same guesthouse in Bangkok, so they're pumping out '10 things I learned about life' posts that don't demand them to go out and that would fill my cats' litter box if they had been in print."
travel,3ds3ei,jippiejee,6,Sat Jul 18 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hah! I keep a travel blog myself, so I suppose I should try and defend the decision. Let me just say that I'd much rather write that book about travelling the Taiwan coast, or any other adventure -- my dream was to be a novelist long before it was to be a blogger. Keeping a blog however gives young writers the opportunity to reach a wider audience faster than a book ever could. A viral blog post could get 200,000 views in a week, where even a very good novel could take a year and a half to write and a decade to sell that many copies. Most books won't get near that sort of figure.  The idea then, was always to use a blog to work towards longer stories. A blog lets me get quick feedback on what people like and what they don't, and if I get an active following, will be the perfect place to market a book, online or in print.  With that being said, I agree with you, and see most travels blogs as lacking in creativity. I created this post in part to see what sort of generic posts I need to avoid at all costs."

Many end up here. Most of these guys are incredibly tame, so the distance between you and the animals is very minimal. When I went, we got to feed Sultan, a 5 wk old albino bengal tiger as there were only 5 people in the park. * Channel Islands National Park - Off the coast of LA (and more interesting than the city, take it from an LA native) is the 3rd least visited NP in America. * PCH - LA to SF along Pacific Coast Highway is considered one of the 5 best roads in the world. Make a stop by the Santa Cruz boardwalk which is loads of fun. * Samoa, California - Another off the beaten path spot, in the gold rush era, this was a boom town. Now it is mostly known for the Samoa cookhouse, a communal style eating place with a strange chainsaw and other trinkets museum but some amazing food * Redwoods national park - You probably know about it and its great redwoods. What you probably don't know (and a fantasy of mine) is that Hyperion, the world's tallest tree is in the park with its exact location kept secret. Try to find it! * Astoria, Oregon - From here into Washington is a marvelous bridge, twice the length of the golden gate * Warm Springs Reservation - A native American territory east of Mt. Hood, you can rent a teepee here for the night. It is really out of the way but we were the only ones who stayed the night. There is also a casino :)."

However, both my parents worked full-time, and my dad actually dislikes traveling (he thinks it's too much of a hassle for what he gets out of it), so we never went anywhere far. Besides, my parents were determined that me and siblings were going to have university degrees, so they worked hard to save money to help pay for tuition and other university expenses for all three of us. Any extra money went to their retirement savings, so there wasn't really any money left for vacations, especially for a family of 5. My mom was the only one who traveled overseas, but it was rare and only to visit family in the Philippines. With that being such a long and expensive journey, my parents couldn't afford to have the whole family go.  I remember being interested in traveling my whole life. I would see different places around the world on TV, I'd hear stories from my friends about their summer vacations, my mom would tell me stories of her travels to the Philippines and bring me back cool souvenirs, and I'd long to explore different places, too. I was tired of being stuck in my boring suburban city and seeing the the same ol' places over and over again. I begged my parents to go somewhere, but my dad always said, ""When you finish school and start earning your own money, you can do whatever you want.""  So, guess what I did when I graduated from university? Yup - I traveled :)"
travel,3ds9vi,duckface08,2,Sun Jul 19 13:04:12 2015 UTC,"I wrote this on my travel blog about 2 years ago (excuse the terrible grammar and writing). Since then, I have visited 4 new countries (over 20 cities/towns), and planning a trip this November to 5 new counties:  *The first time I can remember travelling outside of North America, I was 13; my father passed away from Leukemia that year, so my family and I took a trip to Seoul, South Korea to visit family. Though the trip to Korea was awe inspiring, I was too young to really appreciate traveling and the experience of being abroad. I remember hating being dragged from place to place, spending time with family that I’ve never met or rarely seen, not really capable of communicating with people without my mother translating. It was exciting to visit the “motherland”, to eat the food, spend time with my grandmother, to go shopping at the markets, and to say “I’ve traveled outside of North America”…  … but of course, even though there was the excitement of traveling to somewhere new, I was a miserable 13-year-old girl that thought traveling anywhere would be the same miserable experience.  Flash forward to 2005; at the age of 21 I was asked by my employer to launch a new program in a call center in Manila, Philippines. Against my mother’s advice, I accepted the task and went for 2 months. Maybe it’s because I rebelled against my mother’s disapproval, maybe it was because I felt like an independent adult, but the trip sparked a huge desire within me to travel. After being immersed in the culture, experiencing new foods and people, and the ever so cheap shopping, all I could think about was where I was to travel next and when I would be back to visit my new friends.  … but of course, “money was an issue” and my desire to travel eventually turned into a hopeful, yet apathetic, pipe dream.  Jump forward to 2009. I was going through a very low period in my life; I’ve broken up with my boyfriend of 5 years after calling off a wedding that we both, years later, realized that we didn’t want. My world was shattered. At the time, my friend was going through a separation with his wife so we leaned on each other for support, and distracted ourselves with dinner and movie dates. He introduced me to Anthony Bourdain and his show “No Reservations”, and we would talk about how much of a lucky fucker Bourdain was to be able to travel the world and experience not only the culture but delicious local cuisine. One night out of sheer frustration, I told my friend over MSN messenger (yes, back in the MSN days!) that I just wanted to leave Edmonton to get away from the life I lived and start anew. Venting turned into conversation, conversation turned into planning, and the next thing I knew we were enrolled in TESOL classes, planning to travel and see the world. Maybe we were fueled by broken hearts and anger, maybe it was the Tokyo episode of No Reservations that we recently watched but we planned and plotted for days, and thought we had it all figured out.  … but of course, that was the moment my ex decided he wanted to give “us” another shot.  Jump forward yet again to 2012; Jason and I have been dating for just under half a year, after ending a 7.5 year relationship with my ex the year prior. We take a trip to Las Vegas in early 2012 to attend CES, and a short road trip to Vancouver and Seattle in May. I continue to watch more and more episodes of No Reservations and then I finally snapped. I tell Jason “We are going to do 10 big trips in the next 10 years. Give me a list of 10 places you want to visit, and I will do the same. We will compare our lists and make it happen.” A day later he gives me his list, and that following weekend we were having brunch at Cora’s plotting out our hopeful future trips.  … but of course, I have ran out of excuses to stop myself from traveling.*"
travel,3ds9vi,jetlaggedandhungry,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"I was sort of dragged along with my father and my sister to Vietnam, and I was enjoying myself well enough, until the train ride from Sapa back to Hanoi.  I slept most of the way and when I woke it, I was in a gentle daze, just feeling insanely happy.  I was thinking about what I saw up in Sapa and the trip so far.  I remember think how I wished the train would go slower, so I could spend more time just lazing in the bunk.  I might never have been happier in my life.  Thereafter I went back to Southeast Asia many times and always had a very good time, although never again as good time as that night in the sleeping car.  Years later I was reminiscing about that trip with my sister.  Her memory was quite different.  ""It was horrible,"" she said.  ""The people on the top bunks would not stop smoking opium and the smell was making me sick.""  Ah, I thought, the little stateroom was full of opium smoke.  That explains it.  tl;dr smack."

Bulkheads don't have other seats in front of you, so things may feel a bit more open.  For bonus points, they often aren't assigned until 24 hours before departure so they may still be available.  Hainan is a great airline and the 787 is very roomy inside - there are only a few commercial planes out there that are bigger.  If your bad experience on a previous flight was a domestic US trip, you hopefully will be pleasantly surprised by how open the 787 feels in comparison:  it has two separate aisles which makes a big difference in comfort.  Don't wait until the last minute to ask for a new seat.  pick one online now if you can - if not, get to the airport a couple hours early and explain your concerns to the checkin staff.  They will likely do everything they can to get you a better coach seat (don't expect business, though ;) - but you need to ask early, before all the seats are full of other passengers.  If you wait until boarding, it will be far too late for anyone to do anything for you.  And try to relax - I have full faith that you'll have a good flight onboard one of the newest and best planes out there.

I'm confident you'll have a better time this trip.  I see you are currently in an A seat (window);  I do suggest you ask for an aisle seat - that will let you get up and move around.  It'll make a HUGE difference to be able to walk up and down the aisles once every few hours - breaks up the monotony.  If you catch yourself getting worried, just head back to the galley and say hi to the crew - they do this all the time and can help reassure you, and as an added bonus they can re supply you with snacks and drinks :)"

travel,3dmvlh,iwazaruu,6,Sat Jul 18 03:44:44 2015 UTC,I did two years WHV in Australia of which I lived a year and a half in my car. Wages are high indeed.

Been in the same location for 9 years and we're trying to get jobs in Taiwan to go live there for a few years, save up some cash, than travel for an indeterminate amount of time.

travel,3dmvlh,importsexports,9,Fri Jul 17 22:52:57 2015 UTC,"A fine point I'd like to reiterate. People thing you need to go far to travel. You don't. Most people rarely explore the own country. And even then explore the other side of it. That's great, but so many people I know don't even know the cities/villages around them. Or their province/whatever sub-national designation you use at all. If you think people from other parts of the world come to visit your area, why are you?  That's my idea, at least. It's easy to go on weekends and small holidays and see the villages and town and secrets of your area, then province. Going in wider expanding circles. Then see some of your own country. Add that through with international travel...   It's an amazing world right in front of us and, like always, we're too busy straining to see around the next bend that we fail to see the sights in front of us..."
travel,3dmvlh,HenryLollinz,3,Fri Jul 17 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"All of these Australia posts make me realise how amazing a country we live in. I've travelled all over Europe, America and Asia but have never been outside of Melbourne and Sydney back at home. I really need to take some time to explore it properly."
travel,3dmvlh,interestme1,40,Sat Jul 18 03:01:33 2015 UTC,"Is there a subreddit for the financial side of travel? Such as raising money for travel and budget during travel? How about making an income while you are traveling? Or adjusting back to a routine life after long-term travel?  Edit: It seems like there's been a lot of demand for one. I plan on making one tomorrow. If you're interested on a special invite tomorrow, please PM me."
travel,3dmvlh,davidzet,32,Fri Jul 17 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"If there's one I don't know of it, but there are several you can kind of piece together and start making a plan:  Pre-Travel Saving:  /r/Frugal  /r/financialindependence /r/EatCheapAndHealthy   While on the road:  /r/Shoestring  /r/vagabond  /r/onebag /r/WWOOF    There's also blogs a' plenty where other people break down finances:  Never Ending Voyage Nomadic Matt Iwillteachyoutoberich  Then of course depending on your destination there's various subreddits devoted to flying, boating, walking, biking, or whatever in all corners of the world.   The TL;DR of it all is:  1) Dictate a number up front based on where you're going and how long you want to be there. For a single person I would aim for $10k/year if you want to rough it to $20k/year if you want to be more comfortable. Of course those change but those are rough numbers that can leave you a cushion. Always aim for more.  2) Pay yourself first. Even if you're not going traveling everyone should do this, it is the simple rule all financial goals are accomplished with (save suddenly having heaps of money thrown at you). The easiest way to save money is to just never see it. Set up a bank account or two and have your direct deposit put money there first, as much as you possibly can, then into your checking account last. Never touch your savings accounts, and every time you have the opportunity to increase the savings do so (cut bills or get raises, divert extra cash there).   3) Live frugally. Don't have to live like a monk, but just be mindful of what you spend your money on. Just think the faster you save the faster you leave.  4) Leave. Once you have the dough saved up you went for pull the trigger. If it makes you feel better try to get your job to say they'll take you back after your travels. Maybe you just take a sabbatical and don't actually quit. Instead of selling all yourself give expensive low sell value stuff (bed, furniture, electronics you want to keep) to friends as a ""loan,"" with the understanding you may want it back. Then if you go back you'll have your stuff and job and slip right in as though you never left. Chances are good you may not want to though.  5) Use cheap means of travel. You can save in all sorts of ways. For instance couchsurfing or wwoof'ing get you free accommodations and meeting a local. Hostels and AirBn'B are generally cheaper than hotels and offer nice ways to meet other travelers. Search The Flight Deal and google flights.  6) Make money. You can earn money a whole host of ways while abroad. The most obvious way is a working holiday visa in a country that offers it if you're under 30. If you're over 30 still many options.   Anyway, yeah there's a bunch of stuff peppered around but it would be nice to have it all in one place. I can get more detailed on my finances if desired. I left 6 months ago and have kept a detailed spreadsheet (if you have an iphone this app is awesome for this type of traveling, sadly android doesn't have a counterpart yet). The long and short of it is my gf and I have spent ~$17k combined in 6 months in Hawaii, Australia, and NZ (about to head to SEA so expecting the next 6 to be cheaper). We stayed that low by couchsurfing, housesitting, and wwoof'ing cutting back costs of some of the most expensive places in the world to live. We also frequently ate out and partied though so certainly not as low as it could have been."

travel,3dmvlh,ShakeNBakeSpeare,17,Fri Jul 17 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"I started with around 10000 usd I saved up working back home in Belgium.  In Australia I sometimes made over 1000 AUD a week (735usd) working in a bar. It is not that hard, save up money in a rich country, travel in a cheap country. Give up some comfort and expensive eats. I'm in Vietnam now and pay around $1 per meal and my bed for the night is $3. A kilo of passionfruit is $1 and just bought two pineapples for $0,25 each.  I have no rent, no loans, no kids, no bills, no debts, no mortgage, no wife. You'd be amazed how cheap travel can be. Check out the book 'Vagabonding' by Rolf Potts."

travel,3dmvlh,strap,14,Sat Jul 18 07:22:19 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I travelled Southeast Asia for about 8 months on maybe 15k all up- average accommodation was $6-12 a night at fairly comfortable guest houses- used buses to get around along with tuk tuks- most meals were about $7 a person but varied from $2-10 depending on if we're eating street food or western food. Beers are anywhere from 75 cents to $3. Activities can add up if you hire out a tour guide or are obsessed with doing every packaged adventure out there- but if your just into chilling it's pretty cheap. Biggest single expense was the flight in and out of Bangkok- and accommodation there can be pricey if you want something comfortable it's more like $15-18 a night. Made it through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia."

travel,3dmvlh,Scion_,4,Fri Jul 17 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, however if you aren't afraid of death (seriously) it is possible! Post depression me dropped everything and travelled Latin America for 6 months and spent less than $5k thanks to hitchhiking (this is where the not being afraid of death part comes in), couchsurfing, making friends, cheap local food and avoiding tourist traps. It was amazing and I never had a negative experience much to my own surprise. Not a dime pickpocketed, returned to the states and had my cell stolen within a month - go figure! But anyway, I am a social nightmare but had a travel buddy and managed to make friends along the way so it made things very affordable."

Edit:  I just checked this site and it shows seats available on both the flights I'm trying to take (connection in HKG). Is there a reason the lady I spoked with at Cathay would tell me it's booked? Maybe this site isn't updated?"
travel,3dthnw,AtomicBreweries,2,Sun Jul 19 09:50:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a couple of things. Often airlines will overbook planes assuming a few people will no show - so they may be selling tickets for a plane that is 'already full'. I just tried to book a flight for the dates you suggested and they have availability, albeit for on very expensive flex fares.  It sounds very unusual to me that all the flights are booked out over a 8 day period. More likely is that you have an inflexible ticket and the agent you talked to was having a hard time with english. Something you can try is to phone their US reservations line (at the right time of day). If you can dig up your original booking the conditions of carriage, rebooking fees etc should be on there.  Have you tried changing your ticket on their website. I recently had to change a Cathay booking and did it all online.  Finally 10 days in Chaing Mai wouldn't be that bad - you can have a pretty good time on ~40 USD/day, travel up to the Golden Triangle and Chiang Rai, or head down to Bangkok for a day or two on the train.  Good luck!"

travel,3dsg5k,applejuice149,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"*Best backpack?  A small one. You'll be able to hop into cars quickly and won't need to risk losing it by putting it in the car's trunk.  *Best way to hitchhike?  If you don't care about taking the scenic route, the best way is to stand at the doors of rest stops or busy gas stations with a sign explaining your situation and destination. This way you can say ""hi, howya doin"" to people instead of waving your thumb at them from the exit ramp, and people have more than three seconds to appraise you. They'll be sitting in McDonald's eating and wonder ""who is this smiling guy who's chatting with everyone that passes by? He seems friendly and polite.""  *Ride with truckers?  Since you're hopping between service stations, you might as well ask around parked trucks when you get there, since they're the best way to get long distances. Unfortunately these days a lot of truckers have insurance stipulations or cameras in the cab which make it risky for them to pick anyone up.  *How to find last minute places to sleep.   Never hitchhike without a tent and sleeping bag, or at least a tarp and blanket.  Your packing list looks perfect. Only thing I would add is a space blanket. They weigh nothing, cost nothing, and have a thousand different uses.  And don't forget to take military grade anti-perspirant.  Best of luck, brother; I'm sure you'll have an incredible time."

travel,3dqm6d,romgal,15,Sat Jul 18 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"I (F22) just traveled around the US for 6 weeks alone, living in a tent or my car so I can give you some tips that I've learned along the way:   First, remember that the probability of anyone hurting you is extremely low. Most violent crimes are perpetrated by someone you know, so logically in a place where you know no one, you're less likely to get hurt.   The converse of this is that in a place you don't know, you might accidentally put yourself at risk. The way I mitigate this risk is just by being careful, staying aware of my surroundings, and trusting my gut.   I travel with knives AND pepper spray, both of which I keep on hand, but my real defense is confidence. Don't act like a victim. Don't give anyone a chance to make you a victim. Don't even think of yourself as a victim.   Now, on to the camping stuff.   Travel only with what you can carry. Try carrying all your stuff before you leave.   The same goes for your tent. Set it up at home to practice. If it's too hard to set up on your own, get a different one. You can usually find a place to rent one, or you could get a cheap one-person tent. Perhaps even a hammock tent! They're fun and easy.   Being alone on vacation is one of my favorite things. I love not having to control myself because someone I know is watching. I just give in to all of my impulses and do exactly what I want to do, without having to take anyone else into consideration. It's very freeing!   PM me if you have specific questions - I'd be glad to help :)"

But that aside, camping is the most awesome experience, and people really keep to themselves. It's summer so likely there will be lots of people camping around, and logically, the last place a person wants to try to commit a crime is where dozens of other people are within 20 feet and earshot of someone screaming. I'm from Virginia Beach and they have awesome campgrounds right along the beach there, and the mix of camping and beach in the morning is the absolute best. Once you have that fire going and you have a dip in the waves, nothing else will matter. Also, I'd pick out a nice looking family or couple nearby and introduce yourself. Let the wife know you're camping alone and to just keep an eye on you. People love helping and they'll probably invite you to dinner."

You take a train from the Cais do Sodre train stop at the end of the green line. http://lisbon-portugal-guide.com/images/lisbon-images-2/Lisbon-metro-map.jpg Sights: A lot of the beauty of Lisbon is in getting lost walking around. So make the walk up to the castle (Castelo de Sao Jorge) starting around the Rossio square. It’s cool walking up the little streets. Check out the castle, and then check out the Alfama in that general area. In Baixa-Chiado, hop on the #28 trolley which will take you around the entire city. It’s cool. Belem is a fun half-day trip. It’s an area of Lisbon where you can get these famous bomb pastries called pastel da nata at Pasteis de Belem. It has to be from that one shop. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata You can catch the tram to Belem right near by Rua Augusta Arch  Good call on doing Sintra Another cool castle outside Lisbon. Restaurants: None come to mind specifically as they’re all kind of local, lowkey spots. But the Bacalao is their specialty fish. Definitely try that. You'll find good seafood in Lisbon. Obviously avoid tourist traps, and try to find good low key spots. Bars: just wander around Bairro Alto which is in Baixa-Chiado (pronounced Baija Sheeado). Tons of little bars there. People in Lisbon don’t usually go to the bars out until midnight and then at like 3 they’ll go to clubs."

travel,3dsibo,SpencerAssiff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"I just posted on another thread about things to do between Boston and New York:  I have driven through and around this area often. If by ""cool things"" you mean historic houses, we have a lot of those.  Just south of Boston is the John Adams National Historic Park, it's two historic homes and a visitor center.  Plymouth, MA has a re-creation of the Mayflower ship, the actual Plymouth Rock (it's just a rock), and the re-enactment of the Plimouth Plantation. This is a bit out of your way, but probably the top attraction in the whole region (along with Mystic Seaport). I've been twice.  New Bedford, MA has a really great Whaling museum that is not well-known. It has several full whale skeletons and many interesting exhibits on scrimshaw and whaling.  Fall River, MA, has a battleship you can visit.   Newport, RI, is a popular tourist stop, with several Gilded Age mansions you can visit, and a vibrant downtown with the usual tourist shops and whatnot. The White Horse Tavern is the oldest continually operated tavern in the US (or something like that).  Providence, RI, is known for its restaurants, and worth a stop for a fine meal. There are several lovely old historic houses open for visits, but the hours are very, very limited. Definitely worth an overnight on a Waterfire night ... but probably not worth a stop otherwise. If you want to stretch your legs, though, you could tour Brown University and walk around historic College Hill. There's a nice art museum at RISD. The grave of H.P. Lovecraft is in Providence, it’s not much to see, but it actually attracts tourists.  Slater Mill in Pawtucket, RI, is a great old textile mill, the tour guides  dress in period costume.  Mystic, CT has a restored seaport with costumed re-enactors, well worth a visit. Mystic also has a fine aquarium. Maybe worth an overnight.  Hartford, CT, is a bit out of the way, but you can visit Mark Twain's home.  New Haven has a fine museum of natural history at Yale. You could also take a tour of the campus. There's also an old cemetery right near campus, if you like cemeteries it's a good one to visit. Eli Whitney is buried there.  There are numerous lesser attractions along the way, including lighthouses and historic homes.  Personally, I would not recommend Foxwoods unless you are into gambling. OK, if you like gambling, it's probably great. I think there is a museum about Indian life (The Pequot Museum) at Mohegan Sun.   Hope this helps."
travel,3dsibo,kickstand,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a post I wrote a while back about things to do on the Maine coast:  Of course there are many lighthouses along the Maine coast. Among my favorites are:   Portsmouth (NH) Harbor light: YOu can climb the tower, but only on Sundays; Nubble Light: You can't visit it, only look at it; but it is worth stopping for 15 minutes to see it Portland Head Light: One of the most famous lighthouses in the world; has a museum you can visit but you can't climb the tower Pemaquid Point: One of the most beautiful lighthouses; I'm not sure if you can climb the tower, as I arrived after it closed   There are quite a few towns along the Maine coast, including Darmariscotta; Camden; Boothbay Harbor (you can take a lighthouse cruise). Portsmouth, NH is nice, as well.   The Kennebunkport Trolley Museum is great; they have historic trolleys from around the world, and you can ride some of them.  Rockland has a world-class lighthouse museum[1] that is well worth a stop  A hidden gem is the Wood Island Lighthouse. They have tours on certain days; the tour includes a boat ride from Biddeford; a short walk along a boardwalk on the island; and you can visit the lighthouse and climb the tower for a gorgeous view of the Maine coast. Here are some photos I took. It is absolutely stunning at sunset.  The true gem of the Maine Coast (and of the entire eastern seaboard, in my opinion) is Acadia National Park. You could spend a week in Acadia quite easily (and I have). There is excellent bicycling along gravel car-free carriage roads. There is wonderful paddling in scenic lakes and in the sea. There are plenty of kayak rental/tour places in Bar Harbor. And there is a variety of hiking, from easy to moderately strenuous. One of the great things about Acadia hiking is that you get to experience sub-alpine conditions with very little effort, due to the mountains being coastal. They offer splendid views of the sea from the peaks.   A recommendation I usually make is to have popovers at Jordan Pond House in Acadia. However, it is unclear to me if Jordan Pond House is open or closed. If you find out, please let me know. Anyway, the popovers are to die for, so good.  Finally, in the ""I always meant to do that"" category is Monhegan Island. You can take a ferry to Monhegan and stay overnight. Monhegan is so beautiful that it was the home of various artists including Edward Hopper and the Wyeths. I'm not sure what there is to do on Monhegan, but it has  a museum, lighthouse, hiking … the usual.  Another thing I'll mention, even though you will probably be too late for it in August, is that it is possible to see Puffins along the Maine coast. The populations were eliminated years ago, but they have come back in recent years. You can take puffin cruises out to coastal islands and take photos. I believe Puffin season is April to July, though."

Mostly it's barely an issue at all, unless you're some grumpy antisocial dick.  Problem is however is that i got a little annoyed that, as many shops are targeted towards a tourist audience, the quality of some areas lower immensly. Coffeeshops with lots of tourists give no bang for your buck or is an outright rip off, for instance. This goes for many things, such as bars and the likes. You'll learn to know which ones to avoid at some point though.  I've never came across rude behaviour yet.

travel,3dqt5h,Notmymaymay,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"This has been my backup plan so far.  This is a completely new thing to me.  I've never stayed in a hostel, never went on a long trip by myself.  My plan was to buy a one way ticket and stay in some hostels, see how it goes, and if i get bored then just come back.  So I think this is a solid option, and something I'm probably going to give it a try."
travel,3dqt5h,ugen64,3,Sat Jul 18 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"People in hostels are very down for making friends and going on adventures.   People will usually all group up and go out at night or you can hang out during the day and usually find people going on day trips to join In with.   Plus, then you can get a feel to see if you actually want to be around those people.   Just go with a friendly attitude and be willing to make friends. :)"
travel,3dqt5h,iroe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"I did a eurotrip staying at hostels for the first time in May. My advice would be that Hostelworld ratings are generally very useful. Anything 90% and up was consistently good in my experience. That's not to say you should rule out anything lower than that - you just need to read individual reviews to get a sense of what the hostel atmosphere is like. There are party hostels where everyone is getting drunk 24/7, and hostels that are extremely clean with great amenities but the atmosphere is a bit quieter. Both might have the same average rating but are completely different.  Also in terms of meeting people, try and find one that has a good hostel bar or the hostel staff organize activities (tourist attractions / pub crawls / etc.) on a daily basis."

travel,3dsorw,SirSwimmicus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"Absolute most important thing is as soon as you realize you are not going to make your flight you MUST call Southwest and cancel. If you miss it and do not cancel then you lose all the money you paid for your return ticket. This MUST be done more than 10 minutes before departure.  You will need to book a new flight - you can use the value of the ticket you had towards that flight. If the new flight costs more - and since it's ""last minute"" it most likely will - you will need to pay the difference in fare.  You will want to check other airlines and be sure that the difference in fare to the new Southwest flight is less than a new ticket on another airline.  As for your night...well, that's up to you. The airline is not going to help you at all. You can sleep in the airport or you can get a hotel - but whatever you decide, it's going to be on your dime."
travel,3dsorw,nlderek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm assuming I do the same for the connecting flight as well right? And will they allow me to sleep in the airport/is it safe to?
travel,3dsorw,nlderek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:21:10 2015 UTC,Is it all under the same reservation? If so (which it usually is) it will all happen at the same time. When you call to cancel out of Boston you'll cancel the connecting flight as well and you'll need to rebook the whole thing.  You should be able to sleep in the airport - but you won't be able to get past security. Airports in the US are exceptionally safe and I couldn't think of a better place to sleep in public. You may even want to inquire with the airport police on where they'd suggest you sleep.

travel,3ds03m,davidmx45,2,Sat Jul 18 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing much except suburbs? I disagree.   I have driven through and around this area often. If by ""cool things"" you mean historic houses, we have a lot of those.  Just south of Boston is the John Adams National Historic Park, it's two historic homes and a visitor center.  Plymouth, MA has a re-creation of the Mayflower ship, the actual Plymouth Rock (it's just a rock), and the re-enactment of the Plimouth Plantation. This is a bit out of your way, but probably the top attraction in the whole region (along with Mystic Seaport). I've been twice.  New Bedford, MA has a really great Whaling museum that is not well-known. It has several full whale skeletons and many interesting exhibits on scrimshaw and whaling.  Fall River, MA, has a battleship you can visit.   Newport, RI, is a popular tourist stop, with several Gilded Age mansions you can visit, and a vibrant downtown with the usual tourist shops and whatnot. The White Horse Tavern is the oldest continually operated tavern in the US (or something like that).  Providence, RI, is known for its restaurants, and worth a stop for a fine meal. There are several lovely old historic houses open for visits, but the hours are very, very limited. Definitely worth an overnight on a Waterfire night ... but probably not worth a stop otherwise. If you want to stretch your legs, though, you could tour Brown University and walk around historic College Hill. There's a nice art museum at RISD.  Slater Mill in Pawtucket, RI, is a great old textile mill, the tour guides  dress in period costume.  Mystic, CT has a restored seaport with costumed re-enactors, well worth a visit. Mystic also has a fine aquarium. Maybe worth an overnight.  Hartford, CT, is a bit out of the way, but you can visit Mark Twain's home.  New Haven has a fine museum of natural history at Yale. You could also take a tour of the campus. There's also an old cemetery right near campus, if you like cemeteries it's a good one to visit. Eli Whitney is buried there.  There are numerous lesser attractions along the way, including lighthouses and historic homes.  Personally, I would not recommend Foxwoods unless you are into gambling. OK, if you like gambling, it's probably great. I think there is a museum about Indian life (The Pequot Museum) at Mohegan Sun.   Hope this helps."

A ball park for estimation given the information I would say 4k per person to do it very comfortably, but you can do it for much cheaper if you are willing to forgo some luxuries, this is including round trip flights which will be on average 800-1200 depending on how early you book."

If you can bring $100/person/day I think you'll find yourself living comfortably.  That would allow you to go to a museum, take public transit, have a cheap lunch and a decent dinner nightly.  Nightlife spending will depend a lot on what you like to drink - Mixed drinks in Europe are usually stupidly expensive, beer and wine are relatively cheap. If you're planning on mixed drinks and you are a moderate drinker...you'll need more money than $100/night.

travel,3dqcpq,Oax_Mike,4,Sat Jul 18 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"While my user experience is limited to just one property in just one country, I can tell you as a business owner that I do not believe you can pay TripAdvisor to remove a poor review. If anything the issue with TripAdvisor would be that falsified reviews are too difficult to dispute.  In our case few people review us on Facebook and our TripAdvisor reviews give a much better indication of what it's like to stay with us....Yelp and Foursquare are not available in Mexico so I am not familiar with these platforms.  At the end of the day all reviews need to be read with a grain of salt. People tend to take the time to write a review only when they experience extremes. Rarely do people log in to say ""This place was fine. Clean rooms. Fair price. Decent food. Nothing special but I'd stay again for that rate."" They speak up when they love it or hate it.  An important thing to remember is the context of the customer. If you read 10 five-star reviews and then are shocked to arrive and find that it's a dump, perhaps you forgot to recognize that the reviews were written by people paying $10/night who were mostly looking to get drunk and laid.   Conversely a poor review on a $400/night room could be nitpicking because the writer is used to being fawned over.  When I travel I mostly consult TripAdvisor but less to get a definitive ""yea"" or ""nay"" based off a stranger's opinion and more to get general information about the place."
travel,3dqcpq,MryddinWilt,2,Sat Jul 18 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"This is interesting to me. I had a horrendous time with a tour company in Egypt and wrote a scathing review on TripAdvisor because I didn't want others to have a similar experience. The company responded to my review and I put it behind me. A few weeks later I was trying to show their response to a friend and discovered the review and response had disappeared. I wrote another, less detailed review and it disappeared also. At which point I got busy and moved on. I guess I assumed they paid to have it removed but it seems now that something else was at work."
travel,3dqcpq,Oax_Mike,2,Sat Jul 18 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am not saying that it definitively never happens just that from my experience with the company I don't personally believe it to be as rampant as some consumers believe.  We've had 3 or 4 customers try to leave positive reviews and for whatever reason the system fizzled out and the reviews never posted. And these were intelligent people, too, not user error....a couple contacted TripAdvisor customer service to find out what was wrong but they were never able to get it resolved.  There is one customer in particular who tried multiple times from different computers and could never get her review to post for us.  So who knows?"

I find that if I'm looking to find local gems, though, that all you'll find on TA is places that tourists thought were ""authentic"" and posted about. Several restaurants that were 4 or 5 stars on TA were incredibly lackluster in my experience.  For a quick overview of a city, I'll normally check out the WikiVoyage page. That gives me a rough understanding. Then I made a multi-reddit containing things like /r/travel, /r/solotravel, /r/earthporn, /r/hiking, etc and I'll search that for the area I'm going to. I'll also check for local subreddits like /r/london. This is where you can actually get some proper local advice that is almost always superior to TripAdvisor suggestions.   Then again, I've had great results doing the analog method of just asking people in town where they would recommend. Sometimes that's better than searching online and it starts a conversation with someone you might not have spoken to otherwise. Even better, follow your nose and ears to find a restaurant where the aroma sweeps you off your feet a block away and everyone else there is speaking the native language."

travel,3dpu9w,davidmx45,11,Sat Jul 18 07:32:51 2015 UTC,Since you're specifically in that area go to Shenandoah National Park and then follow the Blue Ridge Parkway all the way to Roanoke. If you have time go as far south as Mabry Mill.
travel,3dpu9w,zrfphoto,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:09 2015 UTC,"Are you going to be traveling between DC and Roanoke for a week or just in Roanoke for a week? If it's the latter I recommend McAfee's Knob, and the Cascade Falls in Jefferson National Forest.   McAfee's Knob is part of the Appalachian Trail and has an awesome view! Plus it's nearby a restaurant called The Home Place, it's kind of a local tradition to eat there after hiking. The trailhead is about a 30 minute drive from Roanoke. You can find more info here.  The Cascade Falls are much further, a little over an hour away from Roanoke by car. The trail is very short and easy but gorgeous the entire way. At the end you're treated to a beautiful (and cold) waterfall. If you are there in July or August go for a dip at the end, it'll probably be ice cold but still refreshing and it is another area tradition. A bright side to the Cascades is that you pass through Blacksburg (home of Virginia Tech) on your way. I recommend stopping in town to eat and maybe even take a day trip to just the town itself.  You can read more about trails in the area over at /r/VirginiaTech."

travel,3dpu9w,SparklingGenitals,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"McAfee's Knob is near Catawba, VA. There's a pretty new shelter near the road crossing if you get there late and don't want to do the whole hike right away. But plan for a full day to see it because it's not immediately off the road. Also, McAfee's Knob is one of the two or three best spots on the entire AT to see the sunrise, so get up extra early to get there on time."
travel,3dpu9w,SparklingGenitals,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:43 2015 UTC,Do you know if McAfee's Knob is just one trail leading to the end? Or are there multiple trails that branch off of it? I pretty much wanna know if I am gonna need a map of the trail for when I start hiking there. I definitely plan on going there. Looks pretty amazing.
travel,3dpu9w,SteveSharpe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's really just the one trail up and back. The AT is heavily worn, so you won't have to worry about accidentally walking off the Trail or getting lost or anything like that. You won't need any kind of map. And the Knob is the highest point and a popular spot, so you'll know when you get there and won't end up walking right past it.  It's about a 9-mile round trip, plus an 1800-foot climb to get there, so be prepared for a pretty long day--that's a lot of hiking for most people, especially with the elevation gain.  If you think you're going to camp there, stay at the second shelter and not the first. And put your valuables in your trunk.  This link will help you with directions: http://www.hikingupward.com/JNF/McAfeeKnob/"
travel,3dpu9w,kickstand,2,Tue Jul 21 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"I second the person who recommended the Shenandoah National Park.  When you start out from DC, head west on I-66 until you get to Front Royal. From there you can enter the park at the beginning of Skyline Drive, which is a really nice drive with many good hiking trails off of it. The road traverses the entire length of the national park and follows the ridge of the mountains. It heads south in the exact direction you need to go to get to Roanoke.  I don't know the Roanoke area, so I can't help you for once you get to your destination. But the city is surrounded by Appalachian mountains and the Blue Ridge Parkway runs right through. I'm sure you will find many mountain things to do around there."

travel,3dqf9h,fyreNL,2,Sat Jul 18 13:14:43 2015 UTC,Hey :) I've done this trip two times. You don't need a group for petra just take a bus or taxi to wadi mussa get a cheap hotel there and buy a one or 3 day pass. I'd go for more than a day because there is a shit ton to see. Try to hike up to the viewpoints you'll be away from the tourist masses and get a private experience :)  You can either find a tour operator in your hotel in wadi mussa or go to the visitor center of wadi rum. I've done both and I think it depends if you have your own car. As you don't I'd try to haggle a bit with the tour operators you'll meet in wadi mussa. Be certain to have transportation included.  There's one bus daily at 4pm from wadi mussa (this information is about a year old so don't just take my word for it)  For me it was an unforgettable experience. So great I came back and am certainly planning to visit Jordan again sometime :) If you have any more questions feel free to ask.

Aqaba is just another city on the Red Sea to me. Egypt apparently has the best part of the Red Sea, according to some Israelis I met You don't need a guide. Just download some audio tour guides online or guide books if you really want some information. There's lots of options for accomodation, from hostels to homestays to multi-star hotels. Not sure about buses heading directly to Amman. Take the back route into Petra one day. Completely deserted and some scrambling opportunities.  It also gets chilly at night (I was there in May)."

There a daily bus direct to Amman- it's Jet bus, but if you reserve online call to confirm. Or go pick up your ticket the day before as they're known to lose reservations. Jordan is not an easy country to do on the cheap, but if you eat lots of falafel & shwarma it's doable. In Amman just wander around downtown (your hostel will probably be there) and rainbow street. There's a bunch of adorable cafes in rainbow street with awesome views. Honestly there's not a ton to do- watch the sunset on the citadel. The cabs are totally safe, but will try all kinds of shit to rip you off. You won't be out more than 1 or 2 JD but it's pretty annoying.

The bus company is Jett schedule here it leaves Petra at 5pm and will cost 10 JOD.   It will be pretty hot so I would go for the three day pass so you have the time to really enjoy the site and not feel rushed. Get there early or stay later to avoid the larger crowds. I second hiking up to various viewpoints it's a big place and most people don't take the time to explore. Also Little Petra is fun.   You will also save money by not taking any camel or buggy rides or buying souvenirs inside Petra. Bring lots of water with you too.   It's such an amazing place!

Griffith Observatory - I suggest doing the hike, but go early because it can get too hot during the day Santa Monica 3rd street promenade and the Pier. Maybe go bike riding along the path and you can also visit Venice Beach. Hollywood Blvd, snap pictures outside the Chinese Theatres. Disneyland if you want to pay a lot for a ticket, cheaper options is Universal Studios    what are the cool places to see that tourists wouldn't necessarily know about?   Pasadena Huntington Gardens, walking along Colorado Blvd Visit UCLA if they are into colleges haha.. but I would say Westwood Village to go to Diddy Reise and get ice cream sandwiches for a 1.50. The Grove if they want to go shopping and play with the water fountain, they can also check out the farmers market there, but I usually like the Hollywood farmer's market on Sundays with good live music and a selection of prepared foods.   places to avoid?   Don't go to the mall, nothing to do in the San Fernando Valley.  Don't go to the dangerous areas like East LA, South Central, places near USC   best coffee shop?   Stumptown coffee roasters in Downtown LA Blacktop coffee in Arts District in Downtown LA Spazio Caffe in Santa Monica  Blue Bottle coffee in Venice on Abbot Kinney   I wouldnt want to end my day in Hollywood, I would definitely end it driving along Pacific Coast Highway through Malibu and watch the sunset and eating at Malibu seafood! :)  Have fun!"

The Chinese Theatre is famous and probably something they will want to see but don't plan to spend a ton of time there. I agree that Griffith Observatory is a really great place to view the city or the sunset. Additionally The Getty is a gorgeous museum with lovely views and sunsets and they have a Turner exhibit going on now.  A lot of people enjoy driving Sunset Blvd all the way to the beach and then enjoy a bit of time there.  A lot of people are disappointed in visiting LA. Spend time on the beaches and up in the hills and you have a lot more fun.

Go to the classic tourist destinations (Take a pic with the sign, chinese theaters, some stars in the walk of fame) and then just go to bars or cafes and talk to people. Everyone is very friendly and they usually have interesting stories and backgrounds. That will make you understand what LA is all about, how it was built and how it became what it is today.

travel,3dq5he,bereberebere,3,Sat Jul 18 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"Hello:  I am assuming that you want to leave from the town of Samaipata to Scure, and then travel onwards to Potosi and Uyuni. Remember, your only problem ( as I see it ) is the travel between Samaipata to Scure because it is relatively easy to take bus from either of the next two departure points.   Interestingly, in Samaipata, it is easy to board a bus going the other way from Sucre to Santa Cruz but if you want to get a bus from Samaipata to Sucre, then only locals can help you pick the right bus going to Sucre. It also means that you may end up in a crammed bus with very little option.   Therefore, I will advise to go back to Santa Cruz and take ""Flotta Bolivar"" from there. Ask locals to get a bus to Santa Cruz (as I mentioned). Anyone can help you.   At the bus station in Santa Cruz, you can get an advance ticket and probably ask the conductor to give you a good seat. As you may already know, the journey is tiring, adventurous and breath-taking all at once. Therefore, I will not advise taking a bus from Samaipata, even if the local say its OK.  Other than that, both bus terminals at Scure and particularly Postosi provide multiple options for bus. One you are at bus terminal in these towns, it is easier to select the best option instead of booking anything in advance.   If this sounds doable, then I will suggest going directly to Samaipata, if possible. Come back to Santa Cruz to visit other attractions, and depart from there to Scure.  Hope it helps. Thanks.  (Note: This info is provided by one of my friends who travelled there in 2013)"
travel,3dq5he,traveltrail,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:46:52 2015 UTC,My main question is if people think it's better to go to Cochabamba check that out and then take a bus to uyuni via oruro  or just go via sucre and potosi. It seems to be possible to catch a bus both to Cochabamba or sucre from samaipata. So the main question is: is it possible to take one night bus from Cochabamba via Oruro to uyuni without having to wait around for ages or possibly stop for a day in oruro?  From uyuni I'd like to travel onwards to La Paz.   I've got some travel experience and have been to Latin America before.
travel,3dq5he,traveltrail,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"Oruro   Certainly doable. Please double-check.   Take an early morning bus from Cochabamba to Oruru. Here are the timetables of most popular bus service on this route. Trans Azul, Naser, Danubio & Trans Copacabana are recommended.   Perhaps, the easiest from there, Uyuni, is to take the train. Espresso Sur leaves at 3:30 on Tuesday & Friday, whereas local Wala Wala leaves at 7:00 pm on Sunday and Wednesday. For bus service, I think you may have to change bus at Challapata before arriving at uyuni. THANKS"

travel,3dkxo1,StoopidCupcake,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"i recommend flying if you can afford it or get a connection, if not take the bus.  worst way is the train.  see ljubljana if you get a chance, it is a gem hidden between austria and croatia.    connections between ljubljana and zagreb are good by bus or train, but from the south it becomes harder to get north with on trains, unless you go to zagreb."

travel,3dkxo1,StoopidCupcake,2,Sat Jul 18 09:39:59 2015 UTC,"Not OP but it depends on how flexible you want it to be. Bus is probably the most flexible while being budget friendly. Flying is the most expensive but definitly the most comfortable and could save you some time.   It's a pretty long train/bus ride ~12+ hours from Prague to Zagreb. Bus rides are around 50€. Trains are about the same if you book in advance (https://www.cd.cz/eshop/). You'll likely have to connect somewhere in Austria (Graz or Vienna). If you buy the train ticket on the spot, it's going to be expensive.  SAS and Air Croatia fly direct from Zagreb and Dubrovnik to Prague, if you time it right you can find tickets from 75-150€ one way.. I would especially fly out if you are planning on going to Dubrovnik.. that will add an extra 5 hours by bus to that 12+ hours.   If I was going to do it I would do either plane or train. I think it would be worth the extra 50-100€ personally but my budget isn't entirely constrained. If I was going to do a train I would stop in Vienna for sure."
travel,3dkxo1,swollencornholio,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:35 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Dubrovnik to Ljubljana to Budapest to Vienna and ending in Prague. Or the other way around but those are the places I want to see so far. Bus ride sounds fine but Dubrovnik to Ljubljana looks like it could be a tough bus ride. We usually rent cars so I am used to travelling 6-7 hours a day.
travel,3dkxo1,StoopidCupcake,2,Sat Jul 18 00:12:42 2015 UTC,Maybe add a day in between? Like Plitvice Lakes National Park or checking out the beach and roman ruins in Split or Pula. Then again if you probably should just go all the way to Ljubljana instead of Pula

travel,3dkxo1,swollencornholio,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:12 2015 UTC,I get 3 weeks a year and usually like to split that up. I'm currently living in Canada so my main focus is seeing North America whilst I am close by. I fulfilled an urge to see Europe a couple of years ago but that feeling of fulfilment didn't last long. I'm thinking of 1.5 weeks in Eastern Europe in mid-February but I may end up spending a week in New England instead.

travel,3dkxo1,swollencornholio,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:26 2015 UTC,I went from Budapest to Zagreb on a train wasn't so bad then rented a car for dirt cheap and drove all the way down to split. Saw the lakes and all that fun stuff. On the way back from split to Zagreb I took a pretty hellish bus that wasn't too fun though. Also not sure when you're going but if you're hitting up Budapest there's a festival called zigets that looks crazy mid August. I'm flying into Florence in a couple weeks and might end there and see Budapest again just for that haha. But who knows you're right there's too much shit to see!
travel,3dkxo1,GreatWhiteOrca,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:43:42 2015 UTC,Don't get me started on Florence. I'd love to go there. I've driven past it in the highway but didn't have time to get off.   How was it renting a car? We had done that in Western Europe but picked it up and dropped it off in Paris. I don't want to do I a circle on this trip. I want to fly out of the North.
travel,3dkxo1,StoopidCupcake,2,Sat Jul 18 09:41:55 2015 UTC,Haha ya I'm excited for it haven't don't much of Western Europe and this is a spur of the moment thing I'm gonna get lost for sure. Renting a car seemed super easy if you're just doing Croatia I beleive there's a small fee for dropping it off up north coming from the south (we did the opposite) but in my experience if you don't leave the country with it the local car rental places are cheaper than the whole European drop off anywhere type ones.   So my admittedly limited advice would be check when you're there the cost of a Croatian rental company with different drop off points. You can see some cool stuff on the way the roads and drivers weren't intimidating or overly confusing like say Italy I hear about. Was thinking of doing it there but having second thoughts hah.   Also if I remember right the reason we were taking a shit bus was we already dropped the car off and there aren't really train options. Cheap for sure but the car was too maybe 20-40 a day. My memories not my strong suit though. Also check out hvar if your in Croatia it's an awesome island a ferry ride from split.

travel,3dpfwd,tastygamerx,2,Sat Jul 18 04:33:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm just finishing up 3 months of travel around the Balkans. Hope I can help.  In Montenegro, Kotor is probably the star attraction. It's a lovely, charming walled medieval town that, in my opinion, rivals nearby Dubrovnik. Make sure you walk up to the fortress behind the city for great views of the bay. Spend some time wandering around the bay and make sure you spend a few hours in Perast (I think that's the name). You could also go to Budva, if you want a more beach and party vibe. Lots of Russians go there. Sveti Stefan looks nice too!  In Montenegro, I recommend Montenegro Hostel. They have locations in Kotor, Budva and Podgorica. Note: everyone told me to avoid Podgorica, as it's meant to be very boring. Montenegro Hostel also runs a small travel agency for backpackers. I found their all day tour of Durmitor National Park and the surrounding area to be a good value at €35.   If you want to go from Montenegro to Tirana, Albania, you'll have to use a shuttle. Again, Montenegro Hostel can sort you out. Surprisingly, there are very few direct buses between Montenegro and Albania. I think you can go to Ulcin or someplace close to the border, take a bus to the border, walk across and get a cab or local bus to Shkoder, Albania. I didn't spend much time in N. Albania, but it's supposed to be very nice with the lake and the mountains. If you're into hiking and it's not too hot, it could be worth checking out.  Tirana is very much one of those cities you can see in one day, but may find yourself wanting to stay longer. You could probably find a nice AirBnB in the blocko neighborhood for less than €20/night and then enjoy €.50 and HUGE delicious meals with tons of meat and fresh salads for around €10 for two people. If you want to stay at a hostel, TripN hostel is pretty good. It has a very relaxed and chilled vibe. There's a tip-based walking tour that leaves from in font of the museum wet morning at 10 or 11. I recommend it.  In Albania, Berat is another city worth visiting. It retains much of its early Ottoman influence. The most beautiful hostel I've ever stayed at was in Berat. It was like a cozy, clean, boutique BnB. If you want, I'll find the name for you.  Sarande is in the south. You can see the Greek island Corfu and take a quick ferry over. If you can, stay at the Hairy Lemon. The guy who runs it is so nice and will go out of his way to help you in any way. They also make pancakes!  I'm sure it's a different vibe in the summer, but a few months ago, there wasn't much happening in Sarande, but you can always go party in Corfu. I was happy I went to Sarande because I visited the nearby Butrint ruins and they were very impressive.  Note:  transport in Albania is not difficult per se; it's just a little tricky because there aren't bus stations, but just asking around will put you in the right spot.  Lots of travel agencies in Sarande offer buses to various locations in Greece.  Hope this helps. Have fun!"

Best thing I can think of: She lets you take a trip with a friend for 2 weeks a year, and you let her do something she wants to do.  Maybe when the kids get older you can take them on trips without the mom. Then mom gets to enjoy having the house to herself."
travel,3do6s5,kickstand,5,Fri Jul 17 22:25:36 2015 UTC,My grandparents used to always spend two to three weeks apart every year on separate vacations. Grandfather would typically go out on his sailboat and Grandmother would often find a cruise or visit family. They loved the arrangement and told me it was one of the best things for their marriage.
travel,3do6s5,abitofsky,4,Sat Jul 18 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"I can't really advice you on the spouse or kids because I have neither, but in regards to savings you're going to have to make sacrifices. I don't really consider them to be ""sacrifices"" though, just a trade-off and most of the things we regularly spend money on don't tend to be a necessity. I still use an iPhone 4 and have had it for 5 years and have been using it for nearly a year on a basic plan (call and text). It hasn't saved me THAT much (about ~$600) but it's still something I can put toward travel.   Another thing that I'm planning to do that may or may not be an option for you depending on your degree/job availability in your field (and also if you can convince your spouse) is relocating. I have advice from a sibling, cousin and friends who have done this and they tell me it's very challenging in the beginning but if you can push through the first few months where you're adjusting, it ends up being really rewarding and worth it later. This would be even tougher for me since I'm currently dealing with a health issue that I'm hoping will be successfully overcome by the end of this year but it has been going on since last Nov and is hard to predict."
travel,3do6s5,gizemozc,2,Fri Jul 17 22:49:54 2015 UTC,"Totally agree on making different financial choices to help you have the life you want! I don't spend much money on electronic gadgets, new clothes/beauty supplies, home decorations, or other luxuries most people I know like to buy. I spend my money on taking trips and gear to allow me to safely make those trips. If my husband didn't agree on our spending habits, though, this could be super tough. That's why I hope OP can negotiate some sort of discretionary income for him/herself and spouse. They each get X amount of money each month, and OP puts it toward travel-related expenses instead of a new phone!"
travel,3do6s5,merrigoldie,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:57 2015 UTC,"My parents have the same negotiation and while I can't say it works 100% of the time as there have been fights over it, it's definitely better than having combined expenses over everything."
travel,3do6s5,gizemozc,5,Sat Jul 18 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you made the choice, knowing that you want to travel, to marry someone who doesn't want to travel and then have kids with this person...did you only recently realize you feel this way? If so, I really sympathize with you. If travel is truly important for your well-being, you should have a serious talk with your spouse. Just how unwilling to travel are they? Maybe there's a compromise that can be made. Maybe you each could get some discretionary time/money to do things that make you happy, and you could put yours toward travel. If you do it right, two weeks vacation a year could be spent very well, on one or two really memorable trips that you could save up for over the year.  The only way I've been able to live in a way that makes me happy is to make traveling and having new experiences priorities in my life, and by having a spouse with the same goals. When I was in college and grad school I couldn't do many things that made me happy and felt awful because of it. There was no ""getting past it"" for me.   I don't know whether you should ""let go of your dream"" of traveling or not, that's only something you can decide with the (hopefully) help of your spouse. For me, not being able to travel would be a dealbreaker. But I also have set up my life in a way that I don't have responsibilities keeping me from traveling. Only you can decide just how important your responsibilities vs. traveling are to you...but because you already set up your life to have many responsibilities, I wonder if you didn't always feel this way.  Edit to add: reading comprehension fail by me. You always dreamed of traveling...so I'm definitely not clear why you married and had kids with someone who is incompatible in such an important area! Did your spouse initially want to travel and then changed their mind?"
travel,3do6s5,merrigoldie,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:25 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the OP but sometimes certain priorities (or in this case ""permissions/consents"") change when kids come into the picture. My aunt was lucky in that she fell in love with a man who loved to travel as much as she did. For 10 years of their marriage they never had any children and traveled all over and despite starting to have children at a later age they now have 3 kids and still travel a large amount on only one person's income. They do have a fully paid for house so that reduces a lot of their expenses significantly. I can only hope to be that lucky because traveling is too important to me to give it up longterm."

travel,3do6s5,avl_sup,4,Sun Jul 19 10:55:42 2015 UTC,"Check out /r/personalfinance to solve the savings problem. The best advice I can give with a spouse is to start dreaming together. Start with where she would like to travel and meet her there emotionally instead of asking her to meet you at your end. I'm making a lot of assumptions given how I know next to nothing about your marriage.  Personal finance with an uncooperative spouse is a mad man's game so it's all about defining a common goal and peripheral goals as well[in this case it would include travel], that each individual wants more than the other.  I don't mean to imply that you and your spouse disagree about money. I'm only saying that an aligned mission will largely solve your problem.  I don't have kids so I don't feel confident saying anything about that part of it."
travel,3do6s5,amigo_,4,Fri Jul 17 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"I think the real question here is why is the spouse ""unwilling"":  is it finances, is it kids, is it the unknown?  Figuring this part out is the first step.  For the travel itself, what my parents started with was camping.  It was cheap, kid friendly, educational, and started out local but evolved to 8,000 mile / 6 week trips (Dad was a teacher).  FYI, I found out years later that my Dad had made a deal with Mom to get her to agree to go.  The one was that Dad would do all the cooking.  The other was a requirement for no pit toilets.  FYI, for my wife to give up a hotel room, she's added hot water showers :-)"

Buy the $200 package that includes an invite to their presentation. Once at the presentation decline everything but the sampler pack. Doing this gives you a minimum of 3 mini vacations for under $1K. I personally did it and do not regret it. Just pay with your own funding their APRs are waaaay too high. It's where they make their money. As far as the spouse goes. Tell her you would like to travel a bit and would enjoy her company. If she rejects let her cool off and bring the subject up again a few days later and discuss you going with friends instead.

travel,3do6s5,The_Stoner_Diaries,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely look into it. The $200 package gets you an immediate $50 Visa card back from the seller so it's only $150. Then you get a weekend getaway in Vegas or another resort of theirs closer to you I'm just using Vegas as an example for what we did. If you book within 30 days you get a $25 visa card on top so total of $125 now. Once at your resort you'll have a presentation to attend to the next day. It's kind of fun actually, our sales lady was young like us and hella funny. She'll give you the whole spiel and tell you all about it and it sounds fantastic I'll probably get it once I can afford it cuz the big package is pretty pricey. But keep declining and you'll get offered the sample package for $800. (Pay Cash their financing is ridiculous and it's where they make the real money I'm guessing) Take the sampler because you also get a bonus vacation called ""The Millionaires Weekend"" and it's exactly what you would expect. Yacht in Florida living like a millionaire for 2 all inclusive. Also you'll get a free Carnival cruise voucher for 2 people all inclusive, now if your husband doesn't want to go you can sell that second seat to a friend for $125 to cover the first weekend. BTW you get the cruise even if you don't buy anything at the presentation. And with that sampler package you get 9,000 points which are good for about 2 vacations at one of their luxurious resorts all over the world. I'm going to convert some points into air miles so I don't have to pay for air fare to Miami for the cruise and the millionaires weekend. So basically 3 vacations for 2 under $1K. So far I've only done the first part in Vegas because of our schedule. I plan on Miami in September to balance the weather and next April for the cruise so I can feel some sun early. Happy vacationing from your friendly neighborhood Stoner."

I had a friend that made a resolution to try something, anything, new everyday and I was so jealous of all the cool and interesting things she did without leaving home or spending a ton of money. So I say find adventure where you are meet new people, join a club, learn a new skill, do things that challenge you and that are rewarding when you conquer them. Look into courses from your local community college or just think of something you've always wanted to do and start Googling. If you want to interact with people from around the world you could sign-up with any number of those sites where you can help people with their English and in turn maybe learn a new language.  When I can't travel I also enjoy reading travel blogs and memoirs or watching documentaries about various places.

Cruises are fairly tame(and affordable!), but take you to some more interesting places.  Maybe that would spark his interest in venturing out more?  But I remember as a kid, we took weekend trips a lot.  Camping, or just to another town that had different shops and activities than what we were used to.  My mom and I would take little over night trips several times a year.  So maybe you can just grab the kids and take a road trip, take the back roads and stop at every weird little road side restaurant or shop you see.  It kind of depends on where you live though I guess, what's in driving range.  Or maybe try to find a job that requires travel?"

travel,3do6s5,hotspotbirding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"With my credentials I could theoretically work anywhere.   Here is where theory meets practice.  You don't say where you live now, but I'm going to say Peoria.  If you wanted to go from Peoria to somewhere exotic -- say Bagan, Myanmar, a very nice place -- you would have to drive three hours to O'Hare, then fly four hours to LAX, and then fly twenty more hours to Bangkok, then get on a Royal  Thai Air flight, 90 minutes to Yangon, and then a Myanmar Air puddle-jumper for an hour to Bagan and then a pony-cart from the airport to the guest-house,  And, let's be honest, you aren't doing that.  On the other hand, if you lived in Bangkok instead of Peoria, the first 27 hours of that trip (each way), and 90% of the expense would be lopped off and the trip sounds a lot more plausible.   I appreciate everyone's insight!   OK, I'm going to say the mean thing.  What you need to convey to him -- ideally without saying it in so many words but in any case clearly -- is that there are two possible outcomes, and he can chose his preference:   You are getting a job in some exotic locale -- I recommend Southeast Asia, but I always recommend Southeast Asia -- and he and the kids are coming along. You are getting a job in some exotic locale, and he is staying home with the kids, and maybe he will be able to scrape by on what you can send back, or maybe not.   I know this sounds harsh, but if he were planning to hack you to bits with a machete, you would take drastic action, wouldn't you?  Really, his current plan -- where you stay in Peoria until you fucking die -- is not much better, and unpleasantly protracted to boot.  tl;dr get out of Peoria."

I would just double check on that or just hike up there if you don't mind the walk. Besides that, I think the amount of days you have allotted are pretty good.

travel,3donhb,Shepherdless,2,Sat Jul 18 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"For a car company, just pick the cheapest of the major companies. They are all credible.   As for the trip, at least 1.5-2 weeks for a coast-to-coast. Maybe stay longer if you want extended stays in some places (like 4 days LA and 4 days NYC would be what I'd do if I were a European tourist). To save money, camp at one of our many national and state parks. The route I recommend is to start in the midatlantic (PA, MD, VA, DC, DE) and drive south to Atlanta. Go a bit further if you want to see New Orleans. Don't do Florida - too far. From either Atlanta or New Orleans, drive West. You can then hit up Texas. Keep going West till Los Angeles. Pepper in detours and stops along the way. I wouldn't try seeing the Northeast unless you really want to. And don't bother with the Midwest or Northwest - no way do you have time  Now, many Europeans don't get this, but America is fucking huge. Don't underestimate distance. Also, I recommend this ""Southern Route"" because it's more interesting. In the mid-north parts of America, you will just be seeing boring farmland. It'll make you regret everything. In the South, once you clear Missouri, the scenery is very enjoyable. Nice desert land with LONG straightaways. It's a wonder for even an American like me - 2 hours of straight road with no one around you and no cops and nothing but desert. It's somewhat amazing. Thinks Breaking Bad.  When driving, stop at small places in the middle of nowhere. Those places are cool. Also, I love San Francisco more than Los Angeles. Just a suggestion.   Hit Denver if you can. Kind of out of the way, but if you need to fill in a few days. Weeds better than Amsterdam imo, if you are into that (don't take it out of the state - state troopers have been stopping way more cars randomly since legalization).   Good luck.   AND DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DISTANCE. I've heard some cops complain that they have to go out to the desert to get Europeans who underestimated how much gas they'd need in a region where you will only find a gas station every 100 miles."

There is assessed risk, and then there is being stupid - this is the latter. There are no safety precautions available to you, a tour guide from Tunisia certainly will not offer you safety against a rebel roadblock heading into Tripoli. The chance of kidnapping as a foreigner is very high. You will stick out more so now than ever before. ISIS wouldn't be the primary concern in the proximity to Tripoli, it's the free-for-all nature of political instability and militia groups that now run the show in many areas.

The reality is that there is currently a very high risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings targeting foreign tourists in Libya at the hands of both ISIS and other armed militia. There is really nothing you can do to protect yourself against these things. You would literally be putting your life in your hands by visiting Libya given current circumstances.  That said, if you're bent on going I'd imagine you would have to take a tour from Tripoli. I would question the sanity of any Tunisian tour operator running tours into an active conflict zone. I'm also fairly sure you can't actually get to Leptis Mangna without a tour guide. This operator seems to be currently running tours from Tripoli and looks reputable."

I am personally not a fan of marathon travel. For me, everything start to blur together after a while. You also have to account for the time to get to the station, wait in line, extra check in/out of hostel.   Try to scratch 2 or 3 smaller cities out and add it to the major destination. See if you can do day trips instead of moving every 2-3 days. Slow down! There's no way to see half of Europe in just 90 days."
travel,3dokau,foggysf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:25:40 2015 UTC,Yeah thats good advice... I guess I should take it a little slower... any ideas on cities that I should exclude?
travel,3dokau,theJuCo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to all of these cities, but I can tell you that you could maybe take 1 day off of Amsterdam and Vienna (unless you have special activities planned). Amsterdam is very nice, but surprisingly small and easy to move around in, so you'll be able to see most of it in 2-3 days. Vienna, IMO, is beautiful but pretty boring. So, 4 days there will be a lot compared to other places where you have only 2 days. I would add some more time to Rome and/or Florence, because there is a LOT to see there and the queues can be very long! Personally, I would also give London a little more time (but I might be biased... I just really love it).  The other commenter has already mentioned that you shouldn't just count the actual hours of travelling, but also a few hours for getting to stations, checking in/out,... (it really does take up quite some time if you add it all up) If you have some troubles with transportation, it can quickly rob you of half a day and considering that you sometimes have only 2 days for one destination, it might get a little tight.  I would suggest you look up more specific information about every destination and make a list of things you want to see/do. That will make it a lot easier to decide where you would need to stay longer. We don't know what you're most interested in, so it's difficult to tell you where you should stay the longest. :)   I've seen many of these cities and I can assure you that you will have a great time!"

I also love connecting with locals, and experiencing nightlife - either clubs or bars - so I would really like to stay more in places that cater to this (which places do you think would be best for this).    I would be willing to spend more time in places that have particularly friendly locals.   I think I'm going to take your advice on Vienna and Amsterdam... I went to Amsterdam a few years ago and loved it, but I think I've already seen all there is to see there (but I'm traveling with a friend who still hasn't experienced it)... as for Vienna, I've heard so many different opinions on the city, but many people have said that it is pretty boring."
travel,3dovnx,thekman1964,2,Sat Jul 18 01:18:12 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about connecting flights? Or are you talking multiple flights domestic then some international on another day?  Reason I ask is a connecting business class flight where you fly business on the domestic leg is probably going to cost no more (and actually probably less) than if you booked one leg in coach and the other in business.  Also if you are only doing a connection to an international flight you might want to talk again to your corporate people. Usually they consider the destination as being ""international"" so the whole thing is international - they don't usually care about the connection, unless they are pure assholes."

If you're doing that then you might have to search for the tickets separately or go through a travel agent.   If it's just an international trip which includes domestic flights to connect to the international legs, your company should definitely consider the whole trip to be international if they're reasonable."

I think the reason we hear so much about how awful they are is people don't know what they are getting themselves into first. If you go knowing you are going to get nickle and dimed and know you're going to have shitty seats and service...then you should be just fine. Just do the math first and make sure that $150 is still cheap once they've charged you for the oxygen you breath and your bags.

Not much to recommend in Milan apart from this, but Expo is fantastic if you like that sort of thing (I really do).  Otherwise, visit Bologna, which is very walkable and a really interesting place to visit. Also don't miss Lucca, a walled city where you can spend the day just wandering.  I lived for a year in The Netherlands so I have a somewhat different view of the place than most visitors. The weather is fairly awful in October (most of the time, actually) so it's hit-or-miss. The best things to see in Amsterdams are the museums, which are truly world class. The Rijksmuseum is probably the best of them. I don't like the Van Gogh museum so much, primarily because the Van Gogh artwork displayed there is the earlier and less colorful stuff.  Everyone visits the Red Light District although I don't think it's all that interesting or exciting. There is pot and hookers. Just like every other city in the world. It's just out in the open and contained in a general area. You can drink a bunch of cheap beer, eat some bad food and barf it all in the gutter, which you'll see around 2:30am on weekends as English tourists imbibe. But if you get outside of Amsterdam a bit, you can see places that are more typically Dutch. Check out Weesp and you can enjoy a quiet beer and burger with Dutch locals next to a lovely canal for 1/2 the price you'd pay in Amsterdam, and better at that.   Prague... one of my least favorite cities in Europe. Pretty, but they'll charge you double for everything. If your sister knows how to get the local price, don't say anything and let her buy!"

They are open until 3am and sell beer and food, but it's pretty much just a normal bowling alley otherwise. Would recommend.  I don't think that's too ambitious but you need to factor in travel between places. Traveling in SE Asia is cheap but can be quite slow, sometimes having to factor in a full day and night for it. To give you some perspective, 2 years ago I spent 2 months doing:  Bangkok - 5 nights  Koh Tao - 7 nights  Bangkok - 1 night  Chiang Mai - 5 nights  Pai - 2 nights  Chiang Mai - 2 night  Chiang Rai - 3 nights  Chiang Khong - 2 nights  Pak Beng - 1 night  Luang Prabang - 7 nights  Vang Vieng - 3 nights  Vientiane - 3 nights  Pakse - 4 nights  Siem Reap - 3 nights  Bangkok - 3 nights  To me that was pretty perfect and I didn't feel rushed at all."

I have a handful of synthetic/wool clothing that I'll put to the test this trip, as well as some dual-purpose clothing (gym shorts that double as swim shorts, for example).   Regardless of length of journey, I always plan to do laundry every week. It stems from a habit here back home, where once a week I simply have to do laundry to take care of the smelly gym clothes that quickly pile up.

travel,3dni79,burrabantha,3,Fri Jul 17 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be blunt but your friend is an idiot.  I've gone on three round the world trips so far that were all about a year long. After every one, I wished I had more time to continue traveling.  I wouldn't trade those experiences for any amount of money. To address each point:  There will be times where you will be lonely but it is very easy to meet people at hostels or guesthouses ect...What tends to happen is you meet people you get along with, travel for a few days or weeks with them, and then split up and go your own way.  I forgot to ask how old you are? But if you are anywhere between 18 and 30, you will have no problem meeting people.  Especially in SE Asia.  China and Russia would be a little more difficult but you will learn that every city has a section where backpackers live and hang out.  I've made tons of friends around the world and I'm not even that outgoing.   There is some truth to the expat thing, especially in Thailand, but if those are things that you wouldn't do at home, you aren't going to suddenly start doing them while you are traveling.    Like I said, I've done a lot of traveling and I have never been robbed.  I once caught a pickpocket in Barcelona but that's as close as I've come to being robbed.  You just have to use common sense and don't do stupid things that you probably wouldn't do at home.  Even if you are robbed, it wouldn't be somebody pulling a gun on you, it would me somebody stealing something out of your backpack when you weren't looking.

I'm 30, and while I know there are plenty of folks who travel at my age it seems like the general hostel crowd will trend younger, don't know if we'll be into the same things.  My main concern is that I do plan to continue working while I'm travelling and will need to a laptop and an internet connection to do so (freelance writing), so I'd kinda need to protect that at all costs."
travel,3dni79,parasky08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the hostel crowd will tend to be a little younger but these days I've seen a lot of people around your age at hostels also.  Although, I'm a little old and don't really stay at hostels any more.  My last long trip was 4 years ago and I was gone for 14 months and I worked the entire time also.  I was working about 6 hours a day, though, so I did a different type of trip and picked a place and stayed for about a month and then moved on.  I usually just rented an apartment.  The hardest part was finding a reliable internet connection that was fast enough to work on.  I guess if I was staying at a hostel I would be more worred about leaving my laptop there."
travel,3dni79,parasky08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds like my plan, though i'll be spending less time in some places than others (Singapore I only plan to be in for a few days for example, because it's expensive). I've been looking at mainly using airbnb or couchsurfing to find residences as I feel like staying with a family or group willing to put a person up might help with the loneliness/isolation factor. Still curious what resources you used to find places though: there are apartments that does business on a short-term basis like that?"
travel,3dni79,notactuallyabus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"Good call on Singapore, it's nice but really expensive.  I used everything that I could find.  At first, mostly VRBO, Craig's List, AirBNB, ect...Sometimes I would just get to a city and walk around to real estate agencies and ask if they had anything.  I found a few really good apartments that way.  I liked being able to check out a place first before committing.  There are also housesitting sites now where you can find places for free but I've never tried that.  I was really fortunate that I was working so money wasn't as big of a deal as it could have been.  SE Asia and S. America were pretty easy to find places, Europe wasn't that hard but was expensive.  I just stayed at hotels in China as I found the language barrier was tough."

I wonder if these are why you've had such an easy time traveling long-term.  I'm planning something very similar to OP, and I've heard that just backpacking around tends to really wear on you after about 3 months.  Personally I won't be working and I'm not sure I'll stay longer than a week in any place (because I'm not sure what I would do in that case).  So I'm seriously questioning how long I can keep that up."

I'm not sure if you are talking about being lonely or just getting tired/burned out.  There are definitely times where I got really tired and sick of traveling.  I found that in those times it was good to just stay for a longer time in a place you like and just relax for a while.  I think not staying in one place for more than a week will really wear on you after some time.  It's good to stop and just rest.  I would find a cheaper place to stay, i.e. thailand, or SE Asia and stop traveling for at least a month and relax.  I think if you have to much of a schedule and move around to much, you will get tired.  At least, I know I do."

Went up to Baxter State park in Maine, at the end of the Appalachian trail and came back down the inside of Maine, very scenic.  I recommend Mt Washington just inside NH, the drive up is cool, and I think you can see the atlantic on a good day.  The wind can be crazy, though.

Your UK passport is probably biometric (look for a rectangle with an enclosed circle on the outside cover) - if so, you do not even need to talk to a person, you just go through the e-gates and scan your passport.   (2) no, UK does not care how you leave the UK  - as as a citizen you never have to leave. Same in any EU airport - CTA or Schengen or neither.   (2a) for the e-gates, no - for the regular EU line - doubt it, but maybe someone else here knows better. Anyway it's not a big deal - you go through the EU e-gates and pick up your luggage and walk through Customs, he goes through the foreigners line and meets you in the main part of the airport.

That said, since the journey falls completely inside Germany you'll be using Deutsche Bahn. As 23striples points out, DB has a super saver price that's available if you purchase the tickets about 3 months ahead of time. The closer you get to the travel date, the higher prices will get. As far as I know they don't (ever) drop."
travel,3dnd2m,segers909,3,Fri Jul 17 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"Some companies have super saver tickets that must be bought with some anticipation, I think Deutsche Bahn does that. Check if you are paying the regular price, if so, it will not raise."

I've done this for a while during a 18 month trip: copied photos to a tablet with an SD card reader, uploaded them to cloud storage (usually overnight because the speeds are not always so great) and/or made a copy from the tablet onto another SD card using the same card reader. It's viable, but very limited.  Only now for the last 6 months I've gotten a Chromebook, which makes things way easier. They are larger and heavier, but still much smaller and lighter than most laptops from years ago. As of the software, my recommendation is to wipe the ChromeOS that comes pre-installed and install a Linux distribution (e.g. Xubuntu is a easy to use and to adapt distro). On Linux you have access to video editors (Kdenlive) and a great raw/photo workflow application similar to Lightroom: Darktable. Linux is very light on resources and runs great on a Chromebook."

If you are 16 or 17, I'd recommend just saving up all your money for those combined years. Take a gap year once you graduate from high school with that money and travel around cheap. I know it's not what you're looking for, but it's hard to travel alone before 18, and it's hard finding someone to do it with you.   That being said, you could ask some extended family to accompany you or a teacher or something? But again, I'd just recommend going on a bigger trip for longer when it'll be easier.

travel,3dnpfw,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yes and no - burn out is real and serious.  I am a fast paced traveler but experience and wisdom taught me these things about city-hopping.   Always have reservations booked at least the first night of whatever city you are going to, especially in peak travel times.  You may not always have availability and some cities will run out of space. Travel days are travel days unless you have a train that takes less than a few hours.  Even for a one hour flight, you can plan eating up to 4-5 hours and pretty much either be too tired or it is too late.  No matter what, I make sure that I have a full AM-PM day without any travel. Delays/cancellations/shit happens - plan accordingly and don't be afraid to throw deposits to hold your space at hostels even if you don't use it. Always plan rest time or a night at a hotel every 7-10 days, hostels will burn you out.  A nice hotel that is quiet, provides a nice shower and relaxation is a must, I'm 34, I might be a little older but I still think this applies to anyone younger.   For Europe - travelling in a circle in either direction makes the planning much smoother, the transit times smaller and allows you to enjoy more of the trip instead of flying/training back and fourth over previous foot-steps.  Oh and 21 cities in 3 weeks is stupid and I'm one of the more extreme fast paced folks out there.  One of the most important questions to ask yourself ""Will I ever get the chance again or will I realistically be able to travel again.""  If this could be the only trip you ever take, I encourage fast pacing, if not - relax, chill and enjoy and get the other part of the experience that the longer stay types get to do."

I'm a fast paced traveler and I've even done a trip where I've traveled to 2 countries, 7 cities/towns in 15 full days. Out of that 3 were day trips. So it was 4 cities in 12 days.

Being young, friends and I cruised from Venice, down to Croatia, back to Rome. We covered I believe 7 stops with an extra day on each end.

Europe is divided in many countries because they're all insanely different. The people, the culture, the architecture, the history... A city a day won't allow you to get a feel for any of those differences! Also, Europe is very crowded at times, so depending on when you're planning to travel, queuing will be hell.  I would suggest you do your research very very thoroughly, also don't forget to add in not only the hours of the transportation itself, but also checking in/out of ho(s)tels, getting to the stations,... and check afterwards how many places you'll be able to squeeze in without it being too ridiculous.

That's probably going to include lots of standing around in the sun waiting for a bus or train, trying to sleep while hot and sweaty on a bus or train, a lot of feeling unclean, being tired and just miserable.   Even if you're young and fit, several days of sleeping poorly, being active all day seeing cities and some nightlife will quickly take a toll on you.  I wouldn't do it myself, but if you do, just be aware how the schedule will affect you. You'll definitely need lots of caffeine or other stimulants.

However many tour operators don't necessarily treat their porters well or the communities in which they operate. I did a trek with G adventures and they pay their porters the most and have a nonprofit that works with local communities to help them preserve their culture and way of live, even when all the men leave for several months to be porters on the various trails."
travel,3dmtgh,pennycaravan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"Just did the Salkantay Trek in May. Was an awesome experience. Really recommend Alpaca Expeditions. They are professional and treat their porters well, and do lots of cool things like take their employees to Machu Picchu (many porters have made the trek hundreds of times but have never actually seen Machu Picchu).  You can't just show up and get Inca trail permits. They are long sold out. That has to be planned 6+ months in advance. Salkantay or one of the others are gonna be your only option. You shouldn't have trouble finding a Salkantay trek to go on at the last minute, but it's always good to do some investigated on TripAdvisor first to make sure you get a good one.  On our Salkantay Trek, our group was only six people. Inca Trail groups can be considerable larger, and the trail is crowded, with 400 people starting it everyday. Salkantay only has 80 or so people a day on it. We never saw anyone other than our group, except at camp sites, and then only one or two other small groups like ours."

We were on three different treks while being in Sapa - the two treks through the ricefields and down to the villages (one was a red dzao and another was a black hmong) we met zero tourists, only local people and their buffalos going by their day.   The only one with tourists was the one where we walked from Ta Van in Hoang Lien Son a small drive from Sapa. Here we trekked through bamboo forests up to a waterfall and here were quite a bit of tourists taking pictures and buying refreshments.

Sapa was just really beautiful and calm in a way and I really liked the trekking that we did here. Also the climate was very mild compared to the rest of Vietnam! I would describe Hoi An with a Danish word, hygge. It is super cozy and scooters and cars are prohibited in the ancient city which is nice - no horns or anything! See the city of Sai Gon, get something tailored in Hoi An (and try their extremely cheap beer), relax on the beach in Nha Trang, take a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay and trek in Sapa.

travel,3do2ur,Raskyl7,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"'why would you want to know' is a shitty answer. Knowledge is power and aviation weather websites are open for public use.   First, int'l flights often go into international airspace where no one weather agency is responsible for weather reports. Some info is made public but the data given to int'l pilots is often more detailed that what you'd have access to.  Second, you don't know the route the flight will take for any given day. Planes plan around adverse weather seek out optimal wind conditions for fuel consumption. As a result, a flight from LA to Singapore may be a lot different from one day to the next. You can go to flightaware.com a few hours before a flight and see what path your pilots have planned for but they can change plans once in the air.  AviationWeather.org is a great source of information. While a lot of the data is US only, they do provide links to lots of int'l weather sources.   If you are concerned about weather that may cause your ride to be bumpy, look at the SIGMATs data. This is areas of severe weather for a given time period. Thunderstorms, hurricanes, volcanic ash, freezing rain, etc.   There are also a few websites out there that give some basic weather info so you know if your flight is going to be bumpy. TurbulenceForcast.com for example. These sties don't always get it right but it's fun to pay around and see what's out there.  LAST, please know that flying is just about the safest thing you ever do. Even buying soda from a vending machine has a higher risk than flying commercially. If there were a reason not to fly, the pilots would be the first ones to say screw it, this flight is cancelled.   source: I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor"

If your entire trip is just 5 nights then I would think the round trip journey to the Redwoods is too long and will really eat into your trip. There are plenty of close by activities and other forests to keep you busy.   A closer day trip to an amazing National Park would be to drive up to the Olympic National Park...this is more like 3 hours each way and hiking in the rain forest is pretty awesome and you'll see some pretty big ass trees there, too."

If you went caving or something probably need to pick a day and book it but other than that probably no biggie. Hit the spas no problem. Maybe if you wanna stay in the most popular hostels book a few days in advance to be safe you're in the tail end of the busiest season but it'll still be crazy and hot. And you're missing the zigets festival by a week I'll be there it looks nuts! So maybe plan for zombied out festival goers that still haven't left the city. You've been warned.
travel,3dn5rp,travelthroweuro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"If it is a nice day Jungfrau and the ride up to it from Interlaken is one of the most amazing things you can do here. That said it is rammed with tourists so if you can go early to try and avoid them, and take advantage of the generally clearer weather in the mornings.   Even if you don't go up all that way a walk in the Lauterbrunnen valley below (or anywhere around there really) is well worth it (and much cheaper).  For the love of god if you come to Switzerland get into the Alps rather than Zurich. Zurich is OK but nothing more (and really actually less exciting) than the other European cities you are going to."

There's a couple kilometer round trip hike you can do towards Monch from the top that was great too. I'd second travel_ali's comments with regards to Zurich - it's just another normal city.  Jungfrau is fairly weather dependent though. We were in Interlaken for several days and chose the day with the best weather to go. If it's cloudy, find a different activity for the day."

travel,3dn15f,nlderek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Are you booking directly through the rental agency site or through an online aggregator? I see the option to add a waiver as soon as I've selected a vehicle on the Hertz.co.za site, for example.  The Avis site does say that you can add the waiver at checkout -  http://www.avis.co.za/rentalguide/waiversandliabilities/aboutwaiversandliabilities.aspx?SOR=0115555G  And I can't think of a reason why this wouldn't be true but my personal preference would be to have selected it when booking online already.  Here's a fairly lengthy discussion about using your card's insurance:  http://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowTopic-g293740-i9186-k5062978-Car_rental_hire_insurance-South_Africa.html  I must be honest, as a local I haven't rented a car in years so I can't give you any 'personal tips' specifically for renting but I do drive around the country a lot (I do tourism roadtripping research) so if you have any general questions about routes, destinations etc feel free to shout :-)"

I like to wear a very lightweight waterproof shell that I can layer underneath. Also included are lightweight waterproof pants that can be worn over regular pants. If you're in the city, you can dress as you normally would and have an umbrella if it isn't too windy. I really recommend waterproof shoes as well.  What do you like to do? Bergen is a pretty nice city with easily accessible nature. You can start walking and get into the mountains in a jiffy. Especially if you take fløybanen to the top of fløyen.

Have a friend in Oslo who will host me. Thought about staying longer (3 to 5) to see the west coast of Norway, but the weather is pointing me towards eastern and central europe. Not sure about even going to Bergen, if I can enjoy 2 solid days in the south of Norway, and simply head southeast from there."
travel,3dmaex,meatsalad_yumiyumi,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"The museums in Norway are relatively small.  If you have just 2 or 3 days I'd spend all of them in Oslo.  Just go to Bygdøy and check out the viking ships which are pretty cool or the polar museum.  There is also a palace you can tour but book ahead since they sell out.  I wasn't able to see it personally.  There is also a small fortress called Akerhus which has a nice view of the harbor in Oslo.    The train to Bergen is supposed to be beautiful so if you decide to spend more time in Norway, the view from the train may make it worth it.  I can't speak for the weather but when I was there it was always a little rainy but I never felt hindered by it because it was light and moderate.  Also remember it stays light very late there so you can go out later if the weather isn't great.  I also recommend the mountains around Bergen.  We hiked up Mount Ulriken then hiked back to Fløyen and down to the city.  I wouldn't recommend the hike without waterproof boots though since it is very long and can be muddy.  It is a pretty intense hike so if you prefer you can just take a cable car to Fløyen and just walk around at the top."

Also, if you get caught playing fast and loose with immigration rules with multiple entries into Morocco they are going to assume you are smuggling drugs or doing something else nefarious.   I did something similar (though on one passport) and received 2 90 day Schengen visas that realistically shouldn't have been given to me. (""The Polish loophole""). The whole process was very, very stressful as I was never 100% sure I would be able to get back into Schengen where (by that point) my home and cat and fiancee were. I distinctly remember sobbing through a Ryanair flight from Ireland to Poland two days before Christmas because I was SURE I would be discovered and turned back at Schengen immigration. I felt like a criminal and it sucked. (I guess I was a criminal!)   If I could do it again I would have arranged a proper long term visa in advance instead of constantly racing against the clock to get temporary residence permit paperwork submitted as my 90 day clock ticked down. (The application requires a current copy of the passport with all stamps, so if you get a new stamp you need to update the application...etc.)  Furthermore, as a foreigner you will often use your passport number as your legal ID number, so having two of those could cause all sorts of problems.

I went to Tokyo simply because I got an email advertising $400 return flights.   I live in Australia - so airline prices unfortunately have to factor in a fair bit.

Second-generation immigrants kinda fuse their parent's traditional cooking with Millenial culture.   This style isn't popular in other countries yet (although I read Paris is shifting from high French cuisine to this type of restaurant).  In that sense, American's have pride in an innovative process to food, not to tradition.

So I find a certain type of food I would really like to try, compare it with travel distance, cost and sights along the way.  So far it has brought me to various provinces in China, Maine and down to Texas, lots of European countries (I live there). Israel, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, India, northern Iran, Mongolia, Tajikistan and the most eastern part of Pakistan.  So for me, (and the wife), it's always been the food from a specific region that lures us into it."

travel,3dkgsv,dannyr,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of knowing what you want from your vacation - what kind of living conditions (backpacker, midrange, etc.), how much you are willing to spend to pay for those conditions, what kind of things you want to see (history, nature, nightlife, beaches, etc.), how convenient you want the transportation to be, how independent you want to be (i.e. group tours or no?), etc.   Then you spend you free time fucking around on places like /r/travel and pick up on what kind of places fit what you want to do. The tricky thing is, you may not be sure what you want until you try it, and that's fine. If you're not interested in anything in particular, just pick a reasonably cheap place with flight options that aren't a nightmare - if I need help narrowing down choices, I just go for whatever is available via a direct flight."

travel,3dkwll,rastaspark,4,Fri Jul 17 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"If you are 35>, I wouldn't stay in Midtown. Midtown is a cliche, and it's boring. It is expensive, filled with mainly business buildings and high-end shopping. I imagine when most people come to NYC, they want to see interesting hip places. Maybe a cool independent shop, or an up-and-coming restaurant. Some nice bars. For that, I would recommend staying somewhere in either the East or West Village. The cool thing about NYC is walking around and discovering things, and it's easier to do that in the south of Manhattan (Between Chinatown and Central Park). That's not to say Midtown doesn't have neighborhoods like that - like Koreatown.   The thing is, NYC is really neighborhood-driven. I somewhat cringe when people say the city is isolating. No, the city is personal. Unlike the suburbs, where you drive miles to a grocery store, most people live and shop in the same 4 block radius, so you get to know people. As such, picking a good neighborhood in NYC is important, especially for a 10 day trip. Before I moved to NYC, my romanticization of the city changed a lot depending on where I stayed."

We like to see a few different neighbourhoods in a city and try all the local spots. I love pubs but hate nightclubs late 20's. The only reason I picked Midtown is because it was as the name suggests Central, though being from West Australia a few hours of travelling is nothing"
travel,3dkwll,blueberry_crepe,2,Fri Jul 17 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think that's a common mistake in travelling to urban areas: going to the central region. in some cities, it works, but usually it just puts you in the CBD (Central Business District), which generally is very ""manicured"" for tourists or heavily-business oriented. Many cities are exceptions of course, like San Francisco. Also, the most you will need to travel within Manhattan is 40 minutes. But there's a frame-of-mind, you know? Like it may seem like a short ride to places, but when you are tired at the end of the day, you may just settle for some touristy midtown restaurant instead of some cool place. As someone who lived 15 minutes out of a city thinking ""it's only 15 minutes, I'll go to the city all the time,"" but ending up only visiting the city 3 times a year, I'm all too familiar with this frame-of-mind."

travel,3dkwll,5ft11flip,2,Sat Jul 18 11:37:43 2015 UTC,"San Francisco is one of my favorite cities on the planet, but I'd suggest only staying three or four nights in the city and dedicating a couple to either heading up to the redwoods, or two nights in Napa and wine tastings.  I'd personally do the wine tours since it's a honeymoon.  If you do that look for an apartment or cottage in a vineyard, or stay at one of the resorts.  And there are services where a person drives you around to wineries using your rental car. It's great.  If you choose this, go to Napa first and then ditch the car as soon as you get into San Francisco. Having a car there is an expensive PITA.  Also, you have to ride the streetcars and cable cars, but avoid BART and busses late at night. Everyone with a smartphone and credit card seems to use Uber or Lyft in San Francisco.   And 10 nights in NYC is a lot.  You won't run out of things to do, but have you considered cutting that back and seeing D.C., Philly, Boston, or getting out to the countryside.  As for seeing a football game, most college conferences are finished with their seasons by Dec. 5.  Maybe you can catch and NFL game while in New York? The Giants are hosting Carolina on the 20th.  And there are pro-teams in Phily, Baltimore, Boston and DC that may be at home while you're in the region.   Have a fantastic trip!"

travel,3dhx42,pdevito3,19,Thu Jul 16 12:23:04 2015 UTC,"The fact that AT&T charges $30 for 120 MB of data is an embarrassment... don't let them prey on the fact that you don't travel much.  It's so little data that you'll probably be afraid to use it up and not even take full advantage of it... either that, or it'll be gone within a day.  The cell phone situation in most other countries is far simpler than here in the US, and most people just use pre-paid.  The best option would be to just stop into a store of one of the Swiss mobile carriers and pick up a pre-paid SIM card once you arrive.  It'll have a few gigs worth of data allowance based on what you select.  Don't know what the pricing would be exactly, but for example in Slovakia I paid $8/month to have a gigabyte of data... I'd estimate that Switzerland pricing would probably be be 3-4 times that, but you'll get an amount of data that will actually be useful, probably for cheaper than what you'll pay AT&T.  Just make sure to call AT&T and make sure your phone is unlocked before you travel."

Call your provider in the USA, tell them you're traveling overseas and want your phone unlocked. Find a place that sells SIM cards when you land. They're everywhere, and if you can away from the airport - you'll get them even cheaper.   Common European providers are TIM, Vodafone, and Wind, but many corner shops sell them as well. They'll usually have a sign in the window.   As a sidenote, we spent 10 days using it as GPS, maps, email, Facebook, etc. and we didn't even come close to using a gigabyte. We were completely shocked at how little data we used, even when using it all the time."

This doesn't seem like such a big deal, because you can always go get a SIM card, but it's amazing in practice. When the plane lands, you're getting your emails. If you're somewhere for a day or two, where it's not really practical to get a SIM, you still have internet.  Sure, it's slow, but it's fast enough for email, maps, and looking stuff up online.

If you need to text or call, you can just use whatsapp/viber/google voice... or any similar apps.  I haven't looked into this for a while since I switched to Tmobile, which has free international data, so I can't comment on the price of a hotspot compared to a Sim card. Still, it may be worth looking into.

Searching the dates you've provided, I get this flight on Google Flights. I'm then given the option to book on United's website, which produces this page. Theoretically, you should also be able to go to United's website and put in the same information (origin, destination, number of passengers) and get the same set of flights.

travel,3djcyt,revolution_meow,11,Thu Jul 16 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"Every pro Melbourne post has been downvoted in this thread. I think that is bizarre. I find it really really strange that guidebooks and the like recommend skipping Melbourne. I am from Brisbane but I have been to Melbourne twice and I think it's a fantastic city. Many people consider it the cultural capital of Australia and it has a lot of charm. In fact many of my friends that are in the performing arts have moved to Melbourne. It has plenty of great cafes, live music venues, shopping districts and things to do. It's a great place and if you can fit it in you wont be disappointed. I recommend people go to Melbourne if they are coming to Australia but of the people that I have recommended to go there it has gotten a bit of a mixed review. A PhD student in the lab I am in from Bangladesh says that he really disliked Melbourne (that being said he went down to see Bangladesh play and they got smashed so maybe that informed his decision), another Pakistani student in my lab says he really loved Melbourne and wishes he did his PhD there, a girl I was seeing from the UK thought Melbourne was a little overrated (and a little expensive). That being said if you are looking for adventure Melbourne may not be your place, it's a bit rustic and hip (street art everywhere and quite a young demographic) but if proto-bohemian cities ain't your bag then you may not be your thing. Sorry that there wasn't a clear yes or no answer to this post.   Pros: Culture, coffee, shopping, nightlife  Cons: Expensive, very busy, plenty of tourists, many different districts, may be overwhelming shrugs"
travel,3djcyt,John_the_Baptiste,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don't think there is really a clear answer either because it truly depends on the type of person. I wouldn't say that guidebooks recommend SKIPPING Melbourne, but they certainly don't highlight it or make it easy if you're following their itineraries. I found it very odd that I wasn't seeing Melbourne in a lot of my researching and thought I'd come to the experts :)  This thread gave me my answer, I think. I've had my share of artsy/foodie trips, and I think that deep down my soul is looking for an adventure. Might skip over Melbourne this round and include it in my plans the next time I go."

But Australia is vast and many visitors have limited time. Thus Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Gold Coast, the Barrier Reef, Kakadu, Uluru, the Kimberleys and so many other attractions tend to shuffle Melbourne down the list.  A lot depends on your interests. For example if you enjoy sporting spectacles Melbourne has it all: the Australian Open Tennis, many major golf tournaments; the Melbourne Cup horse-racing carnival, cricket at the MCG on Boxing Day, Australian Rules football, rugby, surfing at Bells Beach, the list goes on."

Our cities are more homogenous (samey) than cities in the States. The accent/attitude/food doesn't change that much. But remote and Northern Australia (ie Darwin, Townsville, Cairns) have a VERY different vibe and lifestyle.

travel,3djcyt,freshmoves91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"If that’s the case then yeah, explore Northern Australia  Sounds like you already have that covered by going to see the QLD rainforest, but if you’re keen to see Uluru then it may make sense to travel on to Darwin as well. Just be aware, I mean it sounds stupid but you’ll need to recalibrate yourself to the distances involved. These towns are a long, long (long) way apart. It does limit the amount of places you can visit because you’ll usually be flying and the fares aren’t cheap. Also be aware that Nov-Dec is summer here so it’s usually hot. Darwin/Townsville/Cairns are in the tropics and it gets like a sauna. It’s also monsoon in those areas! Pretty awesome, but if you have designs on going to any national parks or remote areas, do your research to make sure they’re accessible during Nov-Dec. For eg last I checked (years ago) most of Kakadu is cut off during monsoon. I’m not trying to discourage you, just want you to know up front of any limiting factors I can think of!"

travel,3ddljv,neurad1,3,Wed Jul 15 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"Do you think 10 days is too long for Croatia?   Not OP, but hopefully I can answer some questions. I spent two weeks in Croatia last September. Two weeks was perfect, though we moved around a bit. Spent a little time in Split, 3 days in Dubrovnik, then about a week in Istria. It kind of depends on the type of vacation you want to have, but you can absolutely find 10 days worth of things to do in the country. It's an amazing place."

I am going to use it as a starting off point for my research, probably next week. http://www.seat61.com/"
travel,3dkxux,WhereverYouRoam,2,Fri Jul 17 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"Even though I've traveled extensively by rail in Europe I don't have any experience with rail passes other than to know they tend to be far more expensive than just...buying a ticket on each leg.   A great website to use as a resource for getting prices and times is bahn.de. If you want to do prices for travel between multiple countries just beware that it only will show prices if no more than 2 countries are included, so sometimes you have to get creative. You can also buy tickets on that website."
travel,3dkxux,nlderek,2,Fri Jul 17 03:02:58 2015 UTC,I agree that the rail pass is probably too expensive (unless you're under 26? it might be better then) since you won't really be traveling that much. Hop on some place like raileurope.com or that seat61 and compare prices.
travel,3dkxux,K_State,2,Fri Jul 17 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"For the best prices on rail tickets use the website of the national train service. They are much cheaper than rail Europe. They have non premium trains too . If you are buying a discounted train ticket, you can often print them at home. For France, sncf.fr, for Germany dbb.de, for Italy, tren Italia ( don't remember the site)   Most of these sites have the option to browse in English. The French site will try to redirect you to rail Europe but you should decline.   I really like your itinerary, but much preferred Salzburg to Innsbruck.   Train travel can be a real pleasure enjoy your honeymoon!"
travel,3dkxux,Jmcglade,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"Ticket prices work like airlines for longer trips, so basically if you buy a ticket in advance it will be cheaper than waiting until the day of travel. But you may be restricted to the specific train you have bought a ticket for.  For trains between Munich and Innsbruck, check the German railways website www.bahn.de/en and for Innsbruck - Venice www.oebb.at/en  if your planned dates for travel are longer than 90 days in advance, choose a date a few weeks ahead of now and then you will see the trains available and the difference in price.

Luckily I've been very fortunate to be able to do a lot of it over the last couple years. Here are some recent favorites:  This kebab in Istanbul. We went back 4 times. In four days. We also had a pretty wonderful breakfast.  This brothless miso soup from 3 Michelin-star Nakamura kaiseki in Kyoto. Just miso, water, wasabi. And a grilled mochi. So fucking good! Their sashimi platter was quite tasty, as well.   Afuri ramen. Of all the ramen I've had, they're my favorite. Get extra of the deliciously grilled pork.   I LOVE katsu. Have you had katsu? Fried pork cutlet, usually. Sometimes chicken. Sometimes with curry (even Thai curry!. I like it all ways. But the best? Motherfucking beef! So damn good! Tiny little 8 seat underground place. So perfectly Tokyo.   That beef katsu was our huge, late lunch right before maybe the best meal of that trip... dinner at Sushi Yasuda. Holy hell it was good. And, uh... a lot. By my count 24 pieces of nigiri, a 4 piece roll (with uni and toro!), a hand roll (with toro!), and a miso soup. Plus sake, of course. Lots of fucking food. Go here and click left if you want photos of it!  Of the several incredible sashimi platters we had at various nice restaurants, the best was in Osaka at 3-star Koryu. It was INCREDIBLE. Note the egg yoke the break on the tuna... amazing. Another course? The weirdest thing I've ever eaten... cod sperm! It was actually really tasty.  Best scallop I've ever eaten. Smokey seafood bbq bar/restaurant in Hiroshima where they grill it right in the bar. Fantastic!  Spiciest thing I've ever (attempted) to eat? The incredible papaya salad from this lady at the Chiang Rai night market in Thailand. Also loved this spicy Thai sausage spaghetti in Chiang Rai and this Thai feast in Chaing Mai.  Best Chinese food I've ever had was probably this wonderful, spicy deliciousness in from a Sichuan place in Singapore. Singapore's famous shicken rice is quite good despite the seeming simplicity.   ...okay, that was a lot more than one. And doesn't even touch on the awesome food I've eaten in Europe (like cacio e pepe in Rome)! But maybe the best thing, ever, anywhere? The beef on a stick from a little grill outside a butcher shop. Right by Fuji-inari shrine in Kyoto. Bought one, started to walk away (to the train to go back to my hotel)... got to the station and decided to walk back and get another. Came back a year later. Still unbelievably tender and delicious. And for like $3!"

No tap water at most restaurants. Be prepared to pay ""cover"" at most touristic restaurants too. Refilling water bottles is possible.

We went down there right after Tiger leaping gorge, and it's quite fantastic going from around 10 -15 degrees weather and the foot of the Yangtze river to +40 degrees at the Mekong. And the whole natural garden is a definite must see! It's not like in the west - It more like a rainforrest with a really small semi-intact trail.

If you arrive early in the morning, you should be able to go past the 28 bends - If not, have a layover at the Naxi village.  Two days will get you up once, and down once.

You might want to spend a little more time in Kunming if you plan on also visiting the stone forest. I also highly recommend climbing to the top of Xi Shan. The locals advised us against going to Shangrila as much of burned down and hasn't been rebuilt. Tiger Leaping Gorge is in Shangrila county, so you can still see some of the Tibetan culture. Be sure to book your train and bus tickets well in advance or be ready to find a private driver. I've lived in China for several years, so feel free to ask any other questions you might have."

I've been on my own to places like india laos and cambodia before. but in my head china seems like it will be more difficult because of the language barrier.
travel,3dhrfp,cest-bon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"I've also lives in China for a couple of years.  Yes, the language barrier can be a problem, although most Chinese are more then willing to go out their way to help you. (At least when you are not at the east coast.)  Overall traveling in China is cheap and easy. When you got 1.3 BN people in your country who likes to travel from one side of the country to the other every few times a year, you just sort of get a hold of the whole logistics thing.  DON'T book all your travels beforehand - No need, more expensive, and when traveling in China, you must ALWAYS be able the change your plans on a short notice. And hotels are cheaper when you just show up compared to booking the beforehand.    I couldn't agree more with U/cest-bon - Don't go farther north then the gorge itself, from there if just get's more chinese touristy, and that is not a thing you want to see."
travel,3dhrfp,orthodoxican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"You can use ctrip or a Chinese travel agent to book your travel. As you'll be traveling to some major tourist destinations during a major holiday, I'd book as much in advance as possible. Do not expect to just walk up to the ticket counter and hop on the next train. Hotel prices will also be more expensive during the holiday, so if that's a concern, maybe look now for deals.   If you've traveled around south and southeast Asia, then I don't think China is going to be that difficult. It's true that fewer people speak English, especially where you'll be going, but I don't think it's anything you can't overcome with a translation app (get Plecco) and some patience. People are really friendly and will generally try to help you if they can."

But for lower-middle to budget, I don't think they get better deals. For example, since you live in the US, imagine a German travel agent. He can probably get a better deal for his clients who want to stay at the Embassy Suites or Hilton, but I doubt he can get a better deal at the random Red Roof Inn that's 30 miles outside Austin, Texas. If agents get better deals, then all these new college graduates who backpack Southeast Asia would be using them.

If you want to do star gazing without having to fly, go to Vicuña from Santiago and when you get to the observatory request a tour in English. When we were there the Spanish tour had like 30 people and the English tour just us.

It's often compared to Buenos Aires and yes, in that direct showdown Santiago loses in a landslide...but that doesn't mean the city is without merit. That being said, I love wandering big cities, just looking at buildings, checking stuff out. There are a lot of cool old neighborhoods in Santiago, just worth exploring with no particular site in mind.  Valparaiso is a really cool place and we drove out there every time we had visitors...but you can see/experience it in a day so depending on your route I'd probably just stay in Santiago, particularly if you want to party on NYE...we found Viña del Mar to just be OK. I mean Viña is good if you live in Santiago and want to get out of the city for a day but it's nothing spectacular in my opinion from a travel perspective.  If budget is no issue in terms of adding extra flights, the area around Puerto Montt sounds amazing but we never made it there.  At the end of the day, compared to the other great cities of the world, Santiago is ""just OK"" but I'd schedule more than 1-2 days there...every Chilean city outside of the capital is truly ""meh"" and the real beauty in that country is the nature."

In Valpo they say you have to try three things: An earthquake [terremoto?] (a drink - something about sweet wine and pineapple ice cream), chorrillana (french fries with steak and cheese and deliciousness on them), and un supremo (a hot dog with guac and other stuff on it). It's a good place. There's also some wine-tasting in the area. It wasn't as good as Argentina's, but still good.  Give a lot of time to get to/from Atacama. I'm assuming you're flying, but the nearest airport is in Antofagasta, which is a few hours away. Also, if you want to do any of the really good star-gazing tours, they need to be booked well in advance.  Edit to add: I saw you asked about Santiago.

travel,3dipif,ThisWasMySistersIdea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"I flew to India from SFO. The options are not that great, but I think it would be the easiest way to Nepal. You are so far away from the destination, that you can take a flight East or West and it'll be roughly the same travel time. From SFO, I would suggest flying Virgin Atlantic to London then on to Delhi. You can spend a few days here in Delhi then take a 1.5 hour flight to Kathmandu, flights are very cheap. The only other options would be China Southern, China Eastern or Cathay Pacific. The last option is pretty nice and you would have a layover in Hong Kong."

Also touring the desert of Wadi Rum was also incredible and will make you feel like you're in Lawrence of Arabia.   Morocco is also incredible. Going to Marrakech felt like being transported into an Indiana Jones movie and I'll never forget the main market square.

A little off topic, but how did you feel about the treatment of the camels?

This was before it came to light (at least for me) how badly some of these animals can be treated.  That being said, I'm sure there are responsible companies that you can go with to ride happy camels.  Camels are like horses over there and used for a lot of different things and have been domesticated for thousands of years so its not quite like elephants -- but I'm sure some camels are treated way better than others."

Weligama is not too far away and equally beautiful if you would like it too be less touristy.   India is also unbelievable and can be done easily before/after Sri Lanka.

Ciudad vieja i havent heard of, but you should really do Antigua instead or in addition to. Copan, Atitlan, Antigua, Tikal, Utila all require 2 days at least, probably 3, pus travelling between them. I will say that Tikal and Utila are pretty far from the rest of these sites, and will take multiple days just to get there (unless you fly). Both are excellent and well worth it, though it may make more sense doing a circuit and addinf in some other sites, maybe belize. Utila is not really worth going to unless you are scuba diving - and its te cheapest place in the world to get certified - so definitely do that if you can. Roatan is equally as nice, and worth going to even if you dont dive.  Lago de isabela and livingstone are worth seeing if youre passing that way.  Other sites you might want to check out if you have time, Lago yojoa and pulapanzak waterfalls are pretty cool off the beating track in honduras. La ceiba also has access to some good river rapids and jungle treks. There are tons of ruins around tikal that are equally as beautiful, without the crowds.

Use their credit card and book directly with the airline (in my opinion).   As for the timeline to book...usually Tuesday or Wednesdays are the best days to book and the wee hours of the morning - after 3am, but before 9am. This is when there is the best availability and after the new sales have kicked in. You'll probably start to learn a pattern with whichever airline you pick.   Right now American Airlines has the best bang for your buck frequent flier program among the major airlines. Both Delta and United have greatly devalued their programs.

travel,3df99i,cannonballrunner,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Just came back from a great hiking trip to Chamonix with my gf. We had 3 full days there, so we bought a valley pass (€84 for 3 consecutive days) to all the lifts, which turned out to be a great idea. Had we been there longer we would probably not have taken a single lift, but as we only had three days, we wanted to make the most out of them. A lot of the locals didn't speak a word of english, so I got good use out of my, admittedly, very limited french.   We had just spent a few days in Rudolstadt for the festival, so we got to Chamonix by train. Travelling by train that long (14-16 hours) was an experience, but ultimately quite the hassle, with transfers (6 of them...) delayed trains, night trains, etc. I'd rather fly to Geneva and take the train from there another time. Public transport is great in the valley, and relatively cheap. The whole trip cost about $1,500, but could easily be done for less (we traveled by train, bought lift passes, stayed at a hotel, etc.).

travel,3disp0,THATS_THE_BADGER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that Verizon doesn't use sim cards. If it does have a sim card slot though, your phone will obviously work just fine on overseas networks if it is network unlocked."
travel,3disp0,zacdenver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"Depending on your U.S. provider (I have Sprint), they must actually grant their permission to unlock your phone for use overseas, although you only need to do this once for the lifetime of the phone. The only way they might not do this for you is if you just got it and owe them a big balance -- it's allegedly to prevent people from selling their iPhone for big bucks offshore and then collecting on insurance by claiming it got stolen. If you own it free & clear, no problem.  I have a 5c and bought a cheap SIM card in Jerusalem from a cell phone store in one of the malls. They changed the card for me, tested it to make sure everything worked OK before I left the counter (incoming and outgoing voice & text, WiFi, etc.) and even sealed up my U.S. SIM card in the Israeli packaging so I wouldn't misplace it for when I returned home."
travel,3disp0,janinelauren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:38:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on the carrier. If your phone is carrier unlocked, swap out the new sim with your own and you should be fine. If you're on Verizon or Sprint, contact the carrier to be sure that your phone is unlocked for use abroad. iPhones used to come with a sim card ejector tool but it's the same size as a paper clip so that works fine to pop it out. Any iPhone will have a hole on the side where the sim card tray is and if you insert the paperclip into the hole it will pop out."

It is almost always cheaper for any moderation duration of time to use a local sim card than to roam.     Basically anywhere but the US is cheaper for cell phones. Actually I pay 8 euro a month for my cellphone in germany.     There is a sidebar link with tons of info about sim cards. How you remove the sim depends on your phone, androids are usually a lot easier than the iphone."
travel,3disp0,blueberry_crepe,0,Thu Jul 16 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"I imagine you are from the US. In the US, for a long time iPhones were not unlocked. However, the Supreme Court said that was illegal and that Apple must allow consumers to switch out SIM cards. So starting with the iPhone 5, you are allowed to take out the SIM card. On the side of your iPhone, there is a small hole. You just push in a paperclip, and the SIM card will pop out. Then you just swap it. Easy as that. If there is no hole on the side of your iPhone, then it was made before SCOTUS mandated that Apple unlock their phones.   Also, you're in luck because cellphones are always cheaper outside the US. In France, you can get unlimited monthly data for 8 Euros. In many SEA nations, it's about 10$ for unlimited monthly data. America is really fucking us over."

Also, if you are considering the Amalfi Coast when you write ""Naples"", then make sure you go somewhere things will still be open in October/November. Much of that area is resort, so it shuts down in late October for the season. It will still be lovely I'm sure, but stuff will probably be closed, so check that out before you book. Or just do Rome, Florence, Venice. Also check out the weather in Venice that time of year. It can get pretty cold (might not be a problem... maybe you like cold), but also look up the Acqua Alta because with a kid, you probably don't want to deal with that. I don't know what the stats are for floods in Oct/Nov, but it's worth looking into... at least figure out where you could stay that would have less of a chance of flooding if that should happen.   If you wanted a smaller town to visit, you could check out Modena that is near Bologna. It's lovely and has a great indoor market. Bologna is wonderful too.   Have an awesome time!"

I would most definitely not classify Zurich as a lively city. Zurich HB was filled with a lot of people in suits - far more than I've ever seen in the downtown hub of the city I live in (and it's pretty business-y here). I'm not that fond of Geneva either, but it has the Palais of Nations and the CERN. We visited both as they are arrival and departure points but they paled in comparison to the rest of Switzerland, particularly the Bernese Oberland. Basically in short - Zurich is a business city and Geneva is focused on the UN/IR. They're nice, liveable cities but not worth your time and money when there are better options for a good Swiss experience. If you are going to Zurich though I can give you a nice restaurant suggestion for fondue as well as a good treat place."

There are great museums, restaurants, and historical stuff. While you certainly spend a long time in Boston, I think you could spent three days there and be happy with it.  DC is also a great place to visit and roughly the same distance in the other direction. There is lots to do there as well, and a lot of it free.  I haven't been there since I was a kid, but there is always Philadelphia as well. Doing New York, Philadelphia, and DC  has a certain logic to it, with no back tracking.

travel,3dgheb,walkalong,2,Thu Jul 16 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"A couple of suggestions: consider oldtown Alexandria and Georgetown, in DC.  I like the monument section of DC but I assume that you either already saw this or aren't interested in the touristy stuff. I know you can get there by train quite easily from NYC.  I would suggest getting a hotel room at Dupont Circle, there being good transportation and many interesting things to see there.  Hotel rooms can be 150ish per night and up, though. Nearby DC is Harper's Ferry WV and the Antietem battlefield. If you are the biking type, the C&O canal runs right through Harper's Ferry, and you could probably rent bikes and/or camp along the Potomac. Very scenic, very nice. There is some concentrated history in this part of the US.  From here I would suggest getting a rental car, as public transportation in this part of the world is lacking.  Second destination suggestion: drive from DC across the Delmar peninsula, and stop off in either Tilghman Island (a bit out of the way, but nice) for crabs, or head to Ocean City and see the beach.  The beach at Assateague Island is also nearby, and is less touristy, should you be the loaf at the beach type- but don't  plan to take any alcohol onto the sand.  Restaurants are not very nice around the national shore though- pack a lunch.  From there I would drive down to Virginia Beach/Norfolk or back up to Baltimore.  Maybe see the inner harbor, fortress, or enjoy the nightlife at Fells Point.  Anyway, I could be a lot more specific, but don't really know exactly what kind of things you are interested in seeing.

Spend a couple of days in Washington DC (monuments, museums, etc.) Drive down to the Outer Banks, NC. Spend a couple of days relaxing on the beach. Eat seafood. Keep going south to Charleston, SC. Spend a couple of days taking in civil war history, enjoy fine dining. Finish in Orlando, FL with a couple of days at Universal Studios. Stay on site at a Universal Studios hotel so you get all day express passes. The per day hotel rate is expensive, but the time you save with an all day express pass makes it worthwhile. (And gives you extra time to lounge by the pool in the afternoon.) Take a cheap flight back to NY to catch your flight home.   If you can, catch a college football game somewhere along the way. I'd recommend catching a game at UVa (Charlottesville, VA), UNC (Chapel Hill, NC), or Clemson (Clemson, SC). I chose those schools mostly for ambiance of the stadium and college towns.

travel,3dgqnu,TowelieMcTowel07,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"First off, just so you know, Ottawa is not on the way from Toronto to Vancouver. By all means go see it, but it will be a diversion from the route you're thinking of. If you're starting in Toronto you can take Hwy 1 east to Ottawa and then hop on 17 to go west to where it links back up with 1 in Sudbury.   From around Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay Hwy 1 follows the north shore of Lake Superior and the scenery is spectacular. This is sportsmen's territory, so if any of you are into fishing, boating, or hunting you'll enjoy it even more.   Once you leave Ontario the Canadian Shield and its many lakes give way to the flat, open prairie of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Hwy 1 is honestly pretty boring for that very long stretch; you need to take side-trips to see more interesting scenery such as national and provincial parks. By all means visit the main cities (Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary), each one has something to offer if you do your research. Unfortunately you'll be missing events like the Calgary Stampede (already over and done with for this year). (BTW, when you reach Alberta don't bother with a diversion north to Edmonton. I grew up there and trust me, you're not missing anything.)   As you look west from Calgary the scenery gets noticeably spectacular again. The Rockies loom on the horizon like a jagged wall of rock. Don't be surprised to see elk or bears from the highway. You might want to consider heading north off Hwy 1, along Hwy 93, from Banff to Jasper to really enjoy the Rockies, then head down through BC via the Yellowhead. From Kamloops, the Coquihalla Highway (5) is faster, but the older Trans-Canada is much more scenic. And who wouldn't want to be able to say they've been to a place called Spuzzum?  Pretty soon you'll find you're beyond Hope (ha ha) in Vancouver, my home town. I recommend visiting the /r/Vancouver subreddit for ideas about what to see and do here--there's a lot, but it depends on your interests. The two must-sees I recommend to all visitors are Stanley Park and Granville Island."

travel,3dgqnu,lexxylee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"Winnipeg there is nothing here.  Good parties. Human rights museum. The forks . We have the most restaurants per capita in Canada, so food is great. OSBORNE Village was named one of the top neighborhoods in Canada (many bars and pubs). Since we are smack dab middle of Canada it makes a pass through point though"
travel,3dgqnu,Bigfred12,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:07:31 2015 UTC,"Man, do some research on your own on this one. You know what you like and the Internet is easy if you put in some effort.  Banff is not a main city in Canada."
travel,3dgqnu,RawRnR,0,Thu Jul 16 05:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure what you and your friends are in to but in Calgary 17th Ave is the hot spot for clubs and bars. Check out Banff for a few days for sure. There's many things to do in the mountains. There are cave tours, hiking, canoeing and other outdoor activities. I can't forget the Banff hot springs either,  probably the best way to end a day of hiking. Sulphur mountain is a good hike just outside Banff. You will get a 360 degree view of the mountain range and a great look at Banff from above. If you're too tired to hike back down, there's a gondola to take you down. Further in to the mountains there's Golden and Revelstoke. In Golden (and other locations in the Rockies) there's white water rafting. I'm not 100% sure if white water rafting is open in October but I'd look in to it. Revelstoke there is a hydro dam that you can get in to for pretty cheap. If you've never seen a dam it might be worth stopping by. Shuswap Lake is paradise in the Spring/Summer but in the Fall it will probably be a bit chilly. Again, I'm not sure what you're friends are in to but Vancouver has Marc Emery. Enough said. Hope this helps and if you have any questions about Calgary/Alberta and west of that send me a message."

The Osprey Farpoint 55 is leading the race for me  Also, how is all that cotton going in the heat? trying to source cheap merino wool tops in aus is hard!  Where are you planning on going?"
travel,3deiak,WillMTB,2,Thu Jul 16 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not struggling to fit everything in, but there isn't much free space for anything else. I would say it fits the amount of gear I have perfectly. My original plan was to wear the jeans indefinitely and the cotton pants between washes, but it's been too hot for that, so the jeans are also taking up a fair bit of space I didn't intend on at the moment. Also I'm tempted to swap my old sneakers for a trendier pair and ditch the Converse - they haven't been worn once yet. That would free up some more space.  Cotton socks are the weak point - they get pretty bad after 2 days. If I was going to get merino anything, it would be the socks, but I couldn't bring myself to spend $100 on just a few pairs. And light socks take up so little space and weight that it's not really an issue to carry around a few extra pairs. Merino tops are overrated though I think - I can get 3-4 days out of a single cotton tee.  Europe until 2016, then across to the Americas is our general plan."

There is a subreddit dedicated to this, r/churning, but it's more focused on offers available in America. There are frequently cards that offer 20-40k points as a signup bonus.  My favourite card combo was the David Jones American Express card, which gives you 3 points per dollar at Woolworths (Safeway if you're in Vic) & Coles (supermarkets and petrol stations). Combine this with the (free) Woolworths Everyday Rewards card, which gives 1 point per dollar spent over $30. Woolworths also frequently has offers like, spend $120 on groceries and get 500 bonus points. With that offer, if you spent $120 on groceries (which is easy to do in Australia), use the DJ Amex card and swipe your Everyday Rewards card, you would get 950 points for that transaction alone. Pretty easy to accumulate another 20,000 points or so in a year just from your weekly groceries."

I do California road trips a LOT (I go out there for work a few times a year, and always add on vacation days to explore). If you're flying into SF, cut out the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas -- they're just too far to go for only a 10 day trip.   Fly into SF, stay there a few days. Then do your PCH trip to LA. (I would even say skip LA, but that's just me...IDK what your interest/priorities are). After LA, hit up Yosemite. I'm guessing you don't have lodging lined up..keep an eye out on the park's lodging page, as people do cancel all the time. You will want to stay in the park if at all possible because most hotel options ""near"" Yosemite are AT LEAST an hour away from the valley."
travel,3dhh3l,swissmissys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. California is huge in and of itself, getting out to the Grand Canyon and Vegas adds an exhausting 5+ hour drive (depending where you're going from) and takes time away from all the greatness that CA has to offer! If you can, definitely stay in Yosemite for a couple days, I hope you brought some comfortable shoes to hike around a bit. By the way, Yosemite is a closer drive to SF then it is to LA.  Going up Highway 1 (also called the Pacific Coast Highway/PCH) adds a bunch of time to the drive but it's gorgeous. Make sure to take advantage and check out Big Sur, Carmel, and Monterey or Santa Cruz if you have time. I'm with /u/swissmissys, LA is overrated and huge so if you go then make sure you have an idea of what you want to check out. (Full disclosure: I live in SF and am very clearly biased)   Enjoy your trip, if you need any recommendations in the Bay Area feel free to ask!"

Also checking visa and other requirements for the target country on the state department website. Next once you know you are legally able to go start checking prices on flights. Not sure why you want to go to St Thomas but you can always check similar alternatives. Since you are a few months out there's no need to rush and buy airfare. You can also check deals on fare deal alert and the flight deal. At this point you also want to be checking accommodations pricing as well of that of any other activities you plan on doing like scuba diving or even just taxis or shuttles or what have you. Those can get expensive. Googling is your best bet on this. Now decide whether you need a new suitcase or any new clothing or gear, because that'll cost money too. Then set aside a budget for food; for this you may want to check things like the backpackers price index or just the prices of restaurants in your destination place if that's where you'll be eating. Then think of any other expenditures you may have and add those in. Once you have all your expected expenditures add in some margin for error and there you go, that's a budget/how much money you should have.   A lot of planning and travelling on your own is simply feeling it out for yourself. If there's a specific aspect of planning you get stuck on then go to other people, but for the general things you sort of have to feel that out yourself."

For example, you can get a 3 day card for 180 kuna (online) and, if you only wish to visit, for example, the city walls (great for the views!) and the Rectors Palace, you'll spend 170 kuna. For more 10 kuna, you also have bus rides, a brochure-guide and discounts. Or you can get a 1 day card for 135 kuna (online), with both atractions (and more) and also the bus rides, the brochure-guide and discounts (but only for a day).  =)  Hope I helped a bit and nice travel!"

The food there is very unique and the people are incredibly friendly. We rented a car and drove around the peninsula. The beaches are alright in Yucatan State, nothing like Cancun, but they are very relaxed and quite and the water is pleasant. From Merida, you can take a bus or drive to Chichen Itza and check out all the cenotes around it. Yucatan is also the safest state in the country, you won't have to worry about any violence whatsoever.   PS-I lived in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and Torreon, Coahuila for a year which were incredibly dangerous. Mexico is going through a very violent time, but if you are not involved, you will be left alone for the most part. Just take normal precautions and you'll have a great time no matter where you go."

Close to lots of interesting things and is truly real Mexico without all the fear. There is a beach close by to the north (progresso) and cancun is 4 hours by bus if you wanna get real touristy. There are plenty of American luxuries around as well. It's really great. Talk to se locals and find their favorite cenotes.

Yes, Vienna is one of the nicest places on your list, but it is also pretty small, so i guess you want to see really everything? (I live in Vienna) Also i think 6 nights for Prague is too much. lets say 3 nights for Prague, then you could make an extra stop in Salzburg for example.  Regarding Iceland. I personally would take more time for iceland, the south coast is full of amazing places. (Vatnjajökull nation park, Skogafoss, seljalandsfoss, landmannalaugar, jökulsarlon etc)   You could also drive up to Myvatn."

travel,3dfomg,yoinkmasta107,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:31:37 2015 UTC,Well we were originally going to do 2 nights in Brugge and 2 nights in Brussels but Brugge is kind of expensive and a friend told me you can 'do it in a day'. Then another friend said Brussels is a bit bland and very business-y. So we came up with Ghent because I wanted to see the altar piece and my boyfriend creamed himself when he realised it is the birthplace of Charles V (he's a big history nerd). And he loves Napoleon hence Waterloo the last night.  I'm afraid to ask but do you think we will be missing out if we skip Brussels?
travel,3dfomg,yoinkmasta107,2,Thu Jul 16 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"I agree about Bruges.  Make sure you explore that city at night.  Once the tourist buses leave, Bruges is pretty amazing.    I really enjoyed Brussels.  In terms of attractions, it's lacking.  However, I really liked the vibe of the city.  I stayed in an airbnb on Avenue de Stalingrad which was largely a Muslim area.  In the morning, all the men would be on the sidewalks at cafes drinking amazing Turkish coffee and at night, they'd be drinking this sweet mint tea.  Also, awesome Moroccan bakeries were everywhere.   I'd reconsider Brussels and take a day away from Ghent to see it."

travel,3dfomg,2wicky,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"This is the official Belgian Rail Site.  You can either purchase individual tickets at the stations or get one of the passes. The passes will depend on your age.  GO PASS ONE  If you are under 26, you can get the Go Pass One. It is a single ticket and costs 6 euros for a trip between any two Belgian train stations.  GO PASS TEN  Then there is the Go Pass Ten. It cost 51 Euros and allows for ten trips between any two Belgian train stations. You can travel with several people on the same pass. Before boarding the train, you need to write the date, starting point and destination for each trip on your pass. So if you are traveling with two, you will need to fill in two lines per trip together. Each trip works out to 5.10 euros per person. And if you both use it, you will be able to do 5 trips on one pass together.  RAIL PASS TEN  If you are 26 or over, you can use the Rail Pass. It is the same as the Go Pass Ten, but costs 76 euros for 10 trips or 7.60 per trip. However, in your case, the rail pass may not work out to be cheaper compared to just purchasing single full fare tickets. The shorter trips like between Ghent and Bruges should cost less than 7.60 euro.  DIABLO TAX  To complicate things even further: If you use the Go-Pass or Rail-Pass to or from Brussels Zaventem Airport, you will need to purchase an extra Diablo ticket. It's basically an extra tax. If you purchase a single ticket, this Diablo tax will already be included in the price.  MISC  The Go-Pass and Rail-Pass are valid for one year. So if you don't use up all 10 trips, you can always sell it on to someone else for the worth of the remaining trips.  Also keep in mind: Full fare to-and-from tickets in the weekends are almost half price compared to during the work week.  Getting to Charleroi Airport  As for getting to Charleroi Airport. There is no direct train connection. So either take the train to Brussels Midi and take a coach to the Airport. Likely faster, but more expensive. Or take the train to Charleroi Train station, and from there take the public bus to the airport. This is likely cheaper but might take you a bit longer.

travel,3dgep1,azuled,4,Thu Jul 16 18:02:18 2015 UTC,"Here is my thought on using vs. not using:  You aren't adding privacy by not doing it as those passport records are readily available to any agency that wants to actually track you; and it is a generally good practice to have your local embassy aware that you are around.  The protection isn't from expected high risk situations, but from unexpected ones.  Examples:  Paris is a very safe place to be, but earlier this year they had a pretty violent few days.  The American Embassy benefits from knowing you are in the country / city and can offer you assistance if you need it.  Another Example:  You become very ill, or are involved in a crime while in another country.  The Embassy is your main point of contact for any assistance that the American Government can offer you in these situations.  Here is a real world one that happened to me:  When traveling to Budapest I was enrolled in STEP and there was a bit of civil unrest reported in one area of the city.  It was widely reported in the news where I was staying prior to traveling into Budapest, but the US Embassy there sent out a STEP note to everyone registered as being in the country in the coming weeks and told us exactly what the situation was and essentially told us what to expect.  It's helpful information."

Also, if passport photos are usually date-stamped, I've never noticed.  But for $8 (like from CVS with a coupon), or even cheaper if you have AAA membership or if you're willing to do it yourself, you might as well put your mind at ease and get them redone.

Few people dive into a Master's in ESL or Linguistics before testing the waters a little bit...we were able to get University jobs without even having an MA, just with a CELTA and experience. It wasn't the best uni job ever but we were offered a promotion to a decent school after 2 years (we turned it down, though.)"

I think that nowadays almost every university (at least in Korea) is requiring an MA..but yes, it can be in anything. Only top unis require that your MA be in ESL or Linguistics.  Many universities in Korea prefer older teachers, so that helped. We basically had 5 years teaching experience, CELTAs and were in our 30s and capable of at least posing temporarily as professionals. That was good enough at the time but as Korea becomes more foreigner-friendly and more people stick around the jobs are becoming more competitive."

You get essentially the same standby travel benefits, but since you're not spending your whole workday staring at the inside of planes and hotel rooms, you'll actually enjoy the traveling that you get to do on weekends/vacations.  Nothing like showing up at work on a Friday with a backpack and no plan for the weekend, and making a decision at 4 pm to head into the terminal and hop on a business class flight to go spend your Saturday in Europe."

It's just a series of interstate highways now, not different than any other.  Its mostly through open, empty areas with nothing to see/do. Of course if you're simply driving from Chicago to LA, the current path loosely follows what would have 50 years ago the Route 66 path, but it's not like there are all the cool roadside stops anymore, it's fast food and Walmarts just like any interstate freeways.  The drive takes about 2.5 days - 3 days, and it's quite uninteresting, again because you travel for stretches of hundreds of miles where there is just nothing.   The use of the highways is just to get from one place to another, if you want to go from Chicago to LA use google maps.   Side note, if you're making a vacation, you wouldn't even want to take the old Route 66-type route, it's better to take the northern one LA-Vegas-Utah-Denver-KC-Chicago.

Some people can travel for a year very frugally and some want to spend a bit more.     I'm 22 and I work at a warehouse and I'm also a football columnist. From those two jobs I pay rent, bills, groceries and other bits and bobs but I still manage to save up. Travel is my priority in life, and therefore I save every penny I possibly can. Every month I put $500 into my savings as a minimum.   In January I'm going to India for six months and I am planning around August/September of 2017 to head off on a year long London-Melbourne overland/oversea trip.     If it's something you really want to do than you just have to discipline yourself to save up for it. Other options you could also look into would be various volunteer programs, study abroad or teach english abroad etc.    The first step however is getting a job, for which i would suggest other subreddits would be more helpful.

Winter is definitely the nicest time to go to WA, but its peak tourist season there.   we did a roadtrip from Perth to Broome smack bang in the middle of summer, and whilst it was unbearably hot at times, we had the whole fucking coast to ourself. literally.  We had Ningaloo reef all to ourself. You really can't say that about many places these days. Some people in queensland pay thousands of dollars to boat out for 2 hours to see bleached coral in strong currents, but we camped 20m from the reef, swam among turtles and caught small sharks for dinner. We camped at the most westerly point of the mainland, again all alone, looking down from the cliff to see what was essentially and aquarium.   And then once you hit the Pilbara, the amazing red earth and green grass/shrubs create the most amazing contrasts as you drive along the highway.  ahh man brings back so many memories, thanks for posting!"

travel,3d9fmr,unboundly,2,Wed Jul 15 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"It depends how far away from the highway you're willing to stray.   We rented a 4wd in Perth that had been kitted out for a little offroading. Nothing too fancy, but yeah, spare jerry cans for fuel, compressors, generator, beacon, etc. Fuel wasn't an issue. There are plenty of roadhouses spaced along the route, and the highways are essentially brand new and in good shade thanks to all the mining in the region.   It gets tricky when you stray off the highway, which is how you see the best areas. There are plenty of areas along the coast where retirees have formed little caravan communities, and there are cattle stations and such, but its very easy to get lost on dusty trails and such without a gps.   So, I guess, its possible to do in a normal car with a few supplies in the boot along the highway (and avoiding unsealed roads), but if you want to make it worth your time take a 4WD with a bit of experience. This is basically for anything south of Broome and north of Geraldton.   We did it in 2 weeks, which was roughly 1 day driving, 1 day sightseeing. Its a really amazing place. Many people tend to ignore it because it looks like a desert on the map but there is a surprising amount of life. Just look at random panoramio photos on google earth.  Off the top of my head, must see places include Exmouth, Shark Bay, Dampier (The town), python pool in the Pilbara. Although be ready for bushfires and cyclones which may close the highway (which happened to us)."

I ended up with a recently remodeled studio apartment all to myself in a gentrified neighborhood and just four city blocks from a Brown Line station. Total cost (including all fees) = $388 for four nights.

I might give it a try next time I'm in town. Honestly, though, I'm spoiled by the fact my in-laws used to live in a very spacious two-bedroom apartment in an East Randolph high-rise across the street from the very northern edge of Grant Park and, of course, my wife and I stayed there for free.

We were able to cook our own food and it was a flat in a typical Parisian building. I miss it all the time. It was like living in Paris for a week. Amsterdam we had our own room but this lady had a huge house with a beautiful backyard. Access to kitchen and we had our own fridge. It was really cool living with a local because you get a more local experience. We paid about $60CAN a night for 4 nights. It honestly just depends on what you want for your accommodation. We definitely wanted a more local perspective and experience an for it to feel like we were living in that city and airbnb was perfect for this.

In Europe I used Venere which was similar accommodations and cheaper than hotels in Rome and Venice.   In very high metro areas, an airBnB can be on pace with hotels, but rarely are they as expensive or more expensive, and if they were, you can look outside the city limits. For example, hotels in Boston next weekend were going for $400/night whereas most AirBnBs were ~$250, and cheaper if you moved out to Cambridge/Brookline, just a 5-10 minute drive away.   It has changed my travel because I always search AirBnB first for anything more than a 1 night stay, as well as HomeAdvisor, FlipKey and VRBO."

The reason the one-stop flight is so expensive is because:   it's probably within 2 weeks to departure it is LFT-ATL-AVP, however with a 4h2m ""connection"" in ATL domestic connections in the US must be 4h or less it is pricing the two legs separately as non-stop one-ways, which is quite expensive on Delta here's the same itinerary but with a 3h50 connection in September - for $356"

Sure, the route is longer but that is not the only factor involved in airfare pricing.

travel,3df9jv,crisisking98,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:12 2015 UTC,Just keep it simple. Start in Orlando and hit up a few parks. After that you could go one of 2 ways. Either head west to Tampa and chill on the beach the rest of the time and maybe check out Busch Gardens. Or head east and south to Key West. If your kids are into space stuff you can hit up Cape Canaveral and do NASA stuff for a day. Then continue south till you hit the Keys. You can stop off in Miami on the way if you'd like. Key west has great beaches with plenty to do for kids and adults. Personally I'd go with option 2 but the beauty of Florida is that you're never more than 90min away from a beach so no matter where you decide to stay you're pretty much set.

travel,3dg2h4,BubbaMetzia,3,Thu Jul 16 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"Just did a trip through 10 cities in Italy from Naples through to Milan. Don't miss the world's fair if you haven't done much traveling before, if you are a seasoned traveler it will seem like nothing more than a weak imitation of reality, though to a novice traveler it can be terrifically exciting. The Brera area in Milan is kind of like M Street of Washington DC, or Portland of the US. Extremely young and hip (DJ every other shop window, believe it or not). Go there around 6 or at dinner time for the happy hour specials at local bars. Visit teatro alla scala, though I love opera so I may be slightly biased in this suggestion, la scalla is possibly the most famous opera house in Europe and their summer productions are as lavish and stunning as they are expensive (I paid 120 euros for a reasonably good ticket). If you are spending a few days in Milan I also high suggest you take a train up to lake como and take the ferry around the lake, the views are unparalleled. Beware of mosquitos, bring repellent.   For Florence, as cliche as it is, visit piazzale michelangelo around sunset for one of the most gorgeous views in the world. Stay till it's  dark and enjoy the night time markets. Don't visit Pisa unless you have plenty of time. Climbing the leaning tower is pretty much the only thing you can do (18 euros) and it's a 5-6 hour trip from Florence. There's also forte di belvedere in Florence that offers a good view of the city (I may have mispelled it), good to go in daytime. As with Milan, Mosquitos are absolutely killer in Florence, they appear in clouds. Bring repellent, especially if you have sensitive skin.   Rome seems massive but it is certainly walkable, I was able to do a walking tour from the Colosseum to the Vatican then back to Roma Termini within a day, though I must admit I am in better physical shape than most. Most of the major sights will be very crowded at this time of the year and it will be unbearably hot, bring lots of water and drink it. People suggest the Roma pass for getting about but frankly I found it to be a poor deal and a waste of money as I mostly walked. Book tickets in advance for Gallery Borghese and the Vatican, if you don't book a week in advance at least you may not be able to get tickets at this time of the year.   Frankly food wise the larger cities will offer disappointing options closer to tourist destinations, but that goes without saying. Any restaurant will do a passable pasta, though, some restaurants are an absolute disgrace to their Italian heritage, serving carbonara that's pretty much scrambled eggs. The further North in Italy you get, the more shit the Pizza is. The best pizza you are likely to get will be in Rome. If you are, like me, a food aficionado with a bit of money to spend, go on the Michelin guide, they're a useful heuristic for finding good restaurants, but be prepared to pay premium prices.   As for your fights look into transportation from the airport to the city centre, likely it will be ten pounds extra, and you may have to book a coach.   At train stations, apart from the normal advice of validating your tickets, try not to accept help from strangers. If you absolutely must accept help, be prepared to pay for help, though it is always better to find the trenitalia representatives.   In all cities, beware pickpockets and beggars. In rome my friend and I had a beggar put his hand in our food while asking to have some of it.   It will be an exciting journey and I am sure you will have lots of fun. Relax, take it easy, but don't forget how great it is to be traveling through the place that much of western society originated from."

Try not to go to the touristy places because while they have great food, they also have stupid prices.  Go off the beaten track and find some little cafe or restaurant and you will get a great meal for a very reasonable price.  My friends and I were on our way back from Piazza del Michelangelo (or however you spell it) and we found a nice little place in a side street that had everything you could want and the prices were great.

I like the weather there (and in the rest of the Southwest desert) in December and January 'cause it's much easier to throw on a jacket and hike around the parks, beats dealing with 40C+. Swimming in a pool there is unreasonable at that time. Also, if you get lucky and see the parks (Grand Canyon for instance) with light snowfall... It looks amazing.

It might be inconvenient - as far as I'm aware there is a max of €60 you can take out from an ATM daily (people are unsure how long this will go on or if it will go lower) , but you can still pay for whatever you want on credit or debit cards. If you're folks are from the UK there are a couple of banks that have free overseas cash withdrawals. I'm not aware of any violence against travellers and tourists in Greece."

Don't keep it all in the same place, have a credit card back up (call the bank to let them know, as usual) and, though it makes me feel gross saying it, a money belt might not be the worst idea. Protests are very unlikely to be a problem on the islands, but supplies might be running low due to the issues with importing goods. Safety is very unlikely to be an issue on the islands, but they might not have the best meals of their lives on this trip."

You would be close to the Grand Canyon with that route however there are also plenty of national parks in Utah.  The only one I have been to myself is Zion, which is pretty fantastic.  Moab and Arches are two of the others I am aware of off the top of my head.   In Denver I would stay downtown, explore the area including the 16th street mall.  Stop in at Peaks Lounge for a drink or a bite to eat and to watch a sunset and get some incredible views.  http://denverregency.hyatt.com/en/hotel/dining/PeaksLounge.html See if there are any concerts at Red Rocks while you are there.

travel,3ddv54,Oleksandr_G,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"I second lexxylee's recommendation to avoid driving. Not only Rome, but most Italian towns & cities have ZTLs (""Zona di Traffico Limitato""--do I really need to translate?)--you can wind up in one without being aware of it and get fined or, if you park there, get towed. Also, Italian driving culture is very different from North American and takes some getting used to. Finally, gasoline in Europe is very expensive.   The areas you're visiting are all extremely well served by trains. You really only need to consider driving in Italy if you go further south than Napoli."
travel,3ddv54,Oleksandr_G,3,Wed Jul 15 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"Guys, cannot agree with you about driving. I had really great experience a year ago in Florence and Piza, about 300 km in total.  Parking and driving style: No problems with parking, despite the fact that streets are really tiny. I could even find free parking areas. The way how Italians drive cars is nothing special:) I wouldn't say they don't follow the rules at all, maybe sometimes.  Troubles:  1. Navigation issues: I got lost a couple of times, I was happy to :) Make sure you have a map/GPS/navigator. 2. Also you may need to have a map of gasoline stations. It's not so easy to find ones in the downtown.  Cars: since the street are tiny and not so many places to park your car I'd recommend you to rent a small hatchback. Since it Italy the choice should be obvious: Fiat 500 or similar size Lancia. I always prefer renting cars which are made in the country I visit:)  Good luck,  Hope you enjoy Italy and it's great landscapes"

travel,3ddv54,sandark,3,Wed Jul 15 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"We rented a car in Florence just for one day. There are many providers in the touristic area, we choosed Avis since they had Fiat 500. As I mentioned before we always try to rent local made car. It was so fun to drive such a little car, I get used to drive much bigger ones. It price was aroung 45-50 Euro without any insurances. It's taken about an hour to wait in the line and fill all needed documents. Also bear in mind Italians don't like automatic transmission, be ready for this:)  Right after this we've started the journey. Florence is quite small, just 20 minutes and we're out of the city. Our destination was Piza and the seaside. We wife found it's romantic to go to the beach at winter, so, no problem, it's not so far:)  In Piza there is not too much to see, a half of the day migth be enough if you don't have plenty of time. By the way that's was the only place we paid for parking. They have parkomats, you may need to have some cash to pay, I'm not sure about cards.  For our trip we used cached map in the phone(OsmAnd android app) and my wife was the navigator.

There are 'fully flexible' tickets which are much more expensive but offer the flexibility of free date changes (on outbound or return), no-fee refunds or cancellations.  It's up to you - as you get closer to the return date, changing the return leg can get very costly since it's change fee + fare difference and with 2-3 weeks to the return date, fare difference is going to be expensive."

Long story short, if the French treat student visas similarly to the U.S. (and I have no idea if this is the case), going without the visa in hand would probably be a bad idea.  I'd probably follow up with your study abroad advisor, who should have contacts at the other school who can find this out for you.  You might also see if the French university has a website for an international student office; either one of them should be a reliable resource.  Also, there's this from NAFSA's website that has a suggestion: http://www.nafsa.org/Find_Resources/Supporting_Study_Abroad/EA_Visas/France_Visas/France_Visa_FAQs/  NAFSA knows their stuff.

When I read this:  Can a student obtain a student visa once overseas? Students with legal residency in another country may apply for their visa through a Consulate in that country, however, as students at a U.S.-based university, they still must complete the on-line Campus France application  I got hopeful -- does this mean I should make an appointment at a french consulate, or does this only apply to persons outside of france? I gotta make some phone calls.  Would you recommend just refreshing the consulate page 5 times a day to check to see if an earlier appointment has opened up?"
travel,3df0n5,my_1st_rodeo,2,Thu Jul 16 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"My sense reading that section is that you could only apply for the visa outside the U.S. If you did so in a country where you already have permission to be.  Like applying in, oh, let's say Switzerland, but because you're already studying there with a Swiss visa.  So without that, you're kinda stuck it seems.  Make a phone call or two tomorrow, but do try to check appointments often.  Be aware that consulates could. not. possibly. care. less. about you, your program, or school, so don't expect any stringpulling whatsoever.  Check for cancellations often, and relax.  Often this kind of thing ends up working out."

travel,3derxy,lexxylee,0,Wed Jul 15 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is an interesting one. I'm going to say no - foreign exchange rates are dynamic and change over time.  If the policy was to refund you at the original charge rate, then it can be gamed/exploited like so:  Suppose you had a friend who owned a ""business"" in Europe (charges in EUR) and your card was denominated in USD.  You ""buy"" something from him for 900 EUR = 1000 USD, for simplicity (sample rate, as an exercise).  Several days or weeks pass and you/your friend initiate a refund for the full 900 EUR.   If the CC company took it at the old rate, you'll get back 900 EUR = 1000 USD. If they took it at the current rate, and USD strengthened against the EUR, say 900 EUR = 900 USD, which is a 100 USD loss to you. If they took it at the current rate, and USD weakened against the EUR, say 900 EUR = 1100 USD, which is a 100 USD gain to you.   This means that you could place this fake purchase order to your friend as a gamble that the EUR strengthens. That is what you're doing: you're using your USD to buy EUR (which is accepted by your friend).  If the credit card company allowed you to refund at the original purchase rate (900 EUR = 1000 USD):   and the EUR does not strengthen, you request a refund at the original rate, meaning you have just placed a free bet on the EUR strengthening. There is no loss to you or your friend. Your friend gives up the 900 EUR and the CC company gives you back 1000 USD. and the EUR does strengthen (sufficiently enough, beyond the 2% cut that the CC company takes from your friend), then you do not request a refund. You paid 1000 USD for 900 EUR. Suppose 900 EUR is now worth 1100 USD. Okay, your friend loses 2% for the credit card transaction, so he only received 882 EUR which he takes out of his bank account, changes it for 1078 USD and you guys split the $78 risk-free profit."

So you are saying that I lose $100 because the hotel mistakenly charged me 10 times the amount they said they would?  I didn't give them permission to charge me 4,000Euros.

travel,3dfgtg,Wearenotacodfish,9,Wed Jul 15 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"I think some of the other comments here are bit obnoxious. I don't think this question is ridiculous or flame-worthy at all. So here's my take on it:  This prohibition is a massive loss for Islam and Muslims.  I remember the first time I went to the Western Wall. It was truly moving to see people so intently worshipping at the threshold of Judaism's holiest site. I might be, and have been, mistaken as an Ethiopian Jew, but the most I was ever asked upon entering the vicinity was to put my bag on a conveyor belt.  I also remember going to St. Peter's Basilica and being speechless at the grandeur of it all. I was allowed to climb onto the roof of the building and into the dome of the basilica... and never was I asked if I was Catholic.  I likewise remember standing at awe around the lake of the Golden Temple, admiring the impressive, intricate architecture and serenity of the atmosphere. The sea of people didn't care that I was obviously not Sikh and I was offered, as was every other visitor, food regardless of religion, nationality, or creed.  I'm not Jewish, Catholic, or Sikh, and yet those experiences left me in great awe of those respective faiths. But people won't experience that with Islam. At the entrance to the city with Islam's holiest site, outside eyesight, you're turned away because you're not Muslim. And that's a true shame, particularly at a time when Muslims and Islam are viewed poorly, including with suggestions that they, and it, are exclusionary and unwilling to integrate with other cultures. The unwelcoming attitude in Mecca (to say nothing of Saudi Arabia in general) adds credence to this notion.  Indeed, I recall when I attempted to enter the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which had been (and I believe, still is) closed to non-Muslims. I had converted to Islam three years prior (so had no obvious Muslim name in my passport), and was surprised when I was asked a particular question by an individual guarding the entrance to the mosque. His response to his to my hesitation still resonates with me to this day:   Come back when you're a real Muslim, not one of those American Muslims.   I never did visit the al-Aqsa Mosque, and only mustered up the courage to go into the Dome of the Rock months later, where my notarized certificate confirming my conversion was not enough to avoid five passport checks and an escort to a police outpost. Out of all the places of worship I have ever visited, I had never felt more unwelcome than when I tried to visit my faiths' holy sites. Ironically, after both trips, I returned to the Western Wall with openness.  Unfortunately, the Mecca prohibition is a just another stone in the wall Muslims have erected to having people open to their faith and cultures. A massive loss, and a true shame."
travel,3dfgtg,tariqabjotu,0,Wed Jul 15 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you had such a bad experience - a lot of Muslims, especially Palestinian men are not allowed in there by the israeli authorities. So in this case it's a problem with the political control of the site.  Your point about non-Muslims experiencing Islam is good, but they can go anywhere from the Taj Mahal to the little neighborhood mosque next door to do that. I don't see why it has to be Mecca.  Most Muslims themselves have never been to Mecca either and they are doing fine."
travel,3dfgtg,zvrk158,3,Wed Jul 15 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the Temple Mount is administered by a waqf/Islamic trust. So while Israeli authorities would given access from the outside (indeed one of those passport checks was with an Israeli guard), the restrictions from the inside (like with that guard who made that rude statement) are done by Palestinian Muslims.  Yes, it doesn't have to be Mecca, just as one doesn't have to go to the Vatican to understand or appreciate Catholicism. I'm sure the OP can learn about Islam and the Masjid al-Haram without traveling. The issue is perception, not to mention, this being /r/travel, we understand the power of experience."

In India, if you are not a practicing Hindu, there are some temples, and inner sanctums in many temples, where you cannot go. Full stop. Mormons do not permit non-Mormons into their temples, either.  There is something in and of itself sacred about the city, and I honestly cannot blame the decision-makers: it is a holy site to them, and they cannot be assured that visitors will not conduct themselves inappropriately in that sacred place. The minute they opened Mecca, I can almost guarantee you would have people going to try to film covert porn, take risque photos, sneaking in bacon and footballs, and using Islam's list of ""we don't do X"" as a checklist of things to do in their holy site.

I actually came back the next year just to see Interlaken. It was really worth it.

I can't remember what the little place was called, but it was a little wine bar, I think? Siena is laid out sort of like rings, in a circle. Hard to explain, but just look at a map or something. Anyway, this wine bar was on an outer ring a little. I stopped by for a glass of wine, which was 1 Euro!! It was their house wine. SOOOO good. I ended up sitting on the VERY small patio (Could only seat one, maybe 2 people) for about 4 hours into the evening. Needless to say, I got pretty drunk haha. But, I think I was good advertising or something, because people were looking at me and seeing how chill I was, just sittin there with my wine glass having a great time, and they would decide to come in. The (owner?) noticed this and kept bringing me some free dishes. Some amazing bread and oil and other small appetizers. Had some good conversations with her and stumbled back to my little hotel. I tried to find it the next day, but I couldn't find it! I walked around for a few hours before I gave up :( Wish I could tell you what it was called!!"

By January, it'll likely be ancient history, although, of course, we really don't know. MERS wasn't even on people's radars in Korea six months ago.  But, really, at no point during the ""outbreak"" was Incheon Airport closed, and for good reason, as nearly all (and possibly all?) cases of MERS in Korea were contracted in hospitals and health-care settings, which the airport is not. This question is another sign of the power of hysteria, which seemed to be rampant with the MERS coverage, as it's not logical that flights would be allowed in and out of Seoul and passengers be stopped by Korean authorities or authorities in the destinations of those flights merely for taking one of them. And yet, this is a legitimate concern for a number of travelers."

Until you know how you are driving for long distances, you should stop at least every two hours, even if just for 5 minutes to walk around. Some people will start to zone out even without realizing it or even start to get sleepy.    Books on tape and some good music to listen to.   17 hours in one shot is going to kill you by the way, that is ridiculous, and hopefully you have at least 2-3 drivers to change between. I semi-frequently do a 11-12 hour trip, and by the end of that drive (usually split with two drivers) I am totally done."

I've done 14 hours in my car before, I was pretty much done after that.  With 4 days off, you're going to be pushing it. Why not pick somewhere closer so you can spend some time at your destination? Pick somewhere 8 hours away, you can leave home early (on my long beach trip I leave at 4am), then get there in time to enjoy some of your day.  How close are your tires to the wear bars? You might want to consider changing them before too much longer, depending on how much you drive. Def before winter."

Generally speaking, you're OK on your tires until about 2/32's - or roughly the ""Lincoln's head/penny trick"" (put a penny in the tread, and it should go at least to Lincolns head or further, if it doesn't, replace them)  Pack a cooler for the driver, that's less that you'll have to stop.

The statehouse is really pretty and open to the public - a must see if that is your sort of thing. Austin seems to have perfected the food truck scene. They are everywhere, some good, some just okay.

Auschwitz is only an hour from Krakow so you can stay in Krakow, do it as a day trip, and be back in Krakow for dinner, nightlife, etc.  Ljubljana is super cute and worth seeing and Lake Bled is an easy half day trip from Ljubljana.  So, base yourself in Ljubljana, do Bled in the morning, and then walk around old town Ljubljana in evening.  Basically, take u/thisisrogue2's advice and save time by staying longer in one place and doing day trips rather than packing up and changing hotels every day.  The cities will also provide better dinner and drinking options.  In Central Europe, sites are close together and public transport is good, so day trips are easy.  If you have an extra day at the end, go down to Dubrovnik.  If you have a few extra days, go to Dubrovnik, Mostar and Sarajevo (one day each is plenty)."

But it's really high altitude (3700m) while Chengdu is I think 200? So you'll need to take acetazolamide (thanks /u/polygraphy  for the correction!) to handle the drastic change in elevation and to avoid getting altitude sickness. It's called Diamox in China and is widely and cheaply available. 1 tablet twice daily before the day of the travel and onwards.   From Chengdu assuming you don't plan on renting your own transport, you'd need to go to Kangding first and then private transport (shared cars) will be available from there.

If you're in Merida you should see the ruins of Uxmal, perhaps the best ruins I visited, and I visited Chichen Itza, Palenque, Tulum, Yaxchilan and Teotihuacan."

I would then say 1 and a half days for Valladolid itself would be good. It's a small colonial town, but you can spend time walking past the colourful colonial buildings, trying the street food, buying local produce/crafts, seeing the Convent, the many cenotes, art museum, checking out traditional music and dancing in the day and night in the main square, and probably other stuff as well :)"
travel,3dcv08,Oax_Mike,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:51 2015 UTC,I would be a bit weary about driving myself around there.  When I was returning to Cancun for my flight it was on a bus in the evening after sunset.  At seemingly random places and without any signs there would be huge speed bumps on the highway.  I can only assume the bus driver knew about them from experience.  Top places from my visit were Palenque and the surrounding waterfalls.  Also a group of cenotes that you reach by a horse drawn carriage along old railway tracks.  When I went we were literally the only ones there.  I believe this link is what I am talking about: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2042191-d2203365-Reviews-Cenotes-Cuzama_Yucatan_Peninsula.html#REVIEWS

The detail, and dynamic range, in my gf's pics (5d mk2, 35 1.4) were so much better. I was quite jealous of that.  But no, because I had to carry a small and lightweight camera and didn't have to lug around lenses and such. The fixed lens also forces me to get creative, which I love. It is so easy to flick on a wide-angle and make the scene 'look better' by getting more in there. in the end, getting creative always wins in getting better pics!   So, yes, go and order it now. Or get the Leica Q ;) Btw, there are rumours on a new GR. But the rumours are that the sensor and lens are the same and that you will only get wifi as an option. If that matters to you, wait!"

travel,3d5a2k,jippiejee,12,Mon Jul 13 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"Most companies will give a few days more (25 seems pretty standard), but what really helps is time-for-time overtime.  I work in Japan now, so it's different, but back in The Netherlands my company would pay out a maximum of 50% of overtime and would compensate the other 50% (or 100%, if you wanted) in hours off.  Since I value my time highly and don't like the tax man, I often chose to take everything paid out in time.  Overtime was paid well.  Working at night during a weekend would be scaled at 250%, so you can imagine time off could add up quickly.  (For example, working 8 hours during Saturday night = 8 * 250% = 20 hours compensation.  That's then either 20 hour off, or 10 hours pay (max) and 10 hours off."

travel,3d5a2k,M_C_K,4,Tue Jul 14 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Guessing here, but a variety of reasons:   There isn't a widespread 'travel' culture here like some other places in the western world - travel here is often limited to visiting family and some very specific types of trips that many people take (going to Disney World, etc. - which limits the amount of places people think to go, like many people in Europe may visit specific countries and do specific things - eg the beach in Spain - more commonly). The priority for saving money isn't placed on taking trips necessarily and there isn't the culture of ""you graduated college, now see the world (or other states)."" Very few people comparatively have passports here. Limited vacation time compared other western countries. This is changing and varies from region to region, but traditionally many Americans get married, buy a house and start having children before the age of 30 - you lose out on a lot of the early years of financial independence when you have mouths to feed and a mortgage to think about. Travel just becomes much more expensive with more plane tickets to buy and with the culture is more about visiting family, you spend the time you have off to do that."

It's not as humdrum and defeatist as most of these sorts of replies seem to make it."
travel,3d5a2k,flyingdhruv,3,Tue Jul 14 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"Most workers don’t know how much money they’re losing by failing to give themselves a break. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington, D.C. nonprofit, though the law doesn’t require employers to give non-governmental employees any paid vacation time, most American workers get at least 10 paid vacation days a year and six federal holidays. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out yesterday, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ current stats on average weekly earnings, Americans are passing up the equivalent of $1,300 a year. The Center for Economic Policy Research lays out how much better European Union workers have it than Americans: The EU sets a floor of at least 20 paid vacation days and many countries require more. France mandates 30 days and the U.K., 28."

The best deal I got for paid time off was: 1 week (40 hours) after 1 year's employment, 2 weeks after 2 years, and 3 weeks after 5. So the most paid time off you could get was 15 days a year, and you had to work for 5 years to get it.  The first year, I worked 52 weeks. The second, I worked 51 weeks. The third, fourth, and fifth, I worked 50 weeks. From the sixth on, I worked 49 weeks.  Again, this was the best deal I ever had."

In India for example I stayed over in hotel rooms rented by male friends, but when my female fried and I tried to sneak guys into our room it was suddenly not allowed. That was 10 years ago and obviously influenced by local culture, but there aren't hard and fast rules about these things."

I rented a car through Blue Car Rentals last fall and they were fantastic. Picked me up right at the airport and had the car heated and waiting for me at their office (it's a super quick drive from the airport).  Alternatively, you might want to consider renting a Happy Camper. Saw a lot of these driving/parked around - it's just a little camper van that comes with everything you need to camp out on the side of the road or wherever. You can rent a sleeping bag from them as well if you need to.  Hope that helps! Enjoy! Iceland is a beautiful country!"

If you go after hours to pick up or drop off, it is really incredible to see how much trust they are putting into people (this is true for Iceland in general) to not do anything with all of the other equipment. Anyway its super easy to pick up or drop off, but they only take cash. The location is also very good, its just off the main road in the historic center of Reykjavik.    Cant say for renting a car though."

travel,3da1vs,ErikTheRedditor,11,Tue Jul 14 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"Wife and I are both 64 (married 20-plus years). She caught the travel bug from her parents, who over their near-60 years together visited more than 100 countries. I was also interested in travel at a young age despite having parents who never even owned passports. I ended up in international business, thanks to a degree in European history (believe it or not), and despite some bouts of unemployment over the past decades due to the vagaries of the economy, we've been able to travel overseas together at least once every couple of years.  Part of that involves living very frugally and paying off our bills in full every month. Also, none of our three kids went into debt for college and now have fairly lucrative careers. We even took them on a couple of our European vacations (each child was also treated to one overseas trip with their grandparents upon achieving their tenth birthday), so now all three travel extensively as well. We're not wealthy (at least by U.S. standards) but clinging solidly to the middle class, or what's left of it.  Our advice: Pay your bills on time, don't waste money on smoke, drink or drugs, and set aside money each month in a special travel account that's untouchable for anything but that. We realize that, as baby boomers, we came along at just the right time to take advantage of many elements that no longer apply or exist (cheap college educations, low-priced housing), but we also struggled to raise families during two Reagan and one G.H.W. Bush administration, which were anything but middle-class friendly."

travel,3da1vs,RockLikeWar,8,Tue Jul 14 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"So the key isn't money, and you're at a good age to prepare for this now because you don't have credit cards yet.   The key is to not have any debt and no responsibilities.   Don't buy a new car. Dont sign a two year contract to get a ''free' smart phone.  Don't charge an Xbox. Don't get a bunch of college debt. If you really want to travel convince your parents that spending a year working and saving money so you can travel for a few months before going to college is a good use of your time (it is). Then really save the money and actually go.   If you don't have bills to pay its very easy to just pick up and go somewhere with very little money. You can find places to work on farms or in hostels or teaching English or whatever."
travel,3da1vs,patssle,4,Tue Jul 14 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's not as hard as you might think. I'm 23 and from the US. I graduated from university last December and worked a basic burger and fries job from January til the start of June. During that time, I saved every penny I could and picked up overtime whenever anybody needed a shift covered. I usually worked 50 hours a week, but did over 70 a couple times. Knowing that it was funding a dream vacation made it easy.   Now I'm 4 weeks into my trip and chilling in Italy. I'm staying in hostels and I'm definitely on a budget, but there hasn't been a single point in the trip where I've wanted to do something but haven't been able to because of money.   Travel isn't nearly as expensive as a lot of people will make it out to be. Without breaking the bank I spent most of last week on the French Riviera at a place with ocean views and a pool. The barriers of entry are low and it's an incredible time to travel."
travel,3da1vs,that90sguys,3,Tue Jul 14 20:24:22 2015 UTC,Travel isn't nearly as expensive as a lot of people will make it out to be.   It just depends on your style. Longer term travel can actually be cheaper if you're slowly going from location to location using mass transit. Taking the bus on a 2 week travel trip is terribly inefficient.  Plane ticket and car rental and you're looking at $2000 to start off to go overseas for a couple weeks from the U.S.
travel,3da1vs,RockLikeWar,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:30 2015 UTC,2000?   Just did a month in the Philippines with flight for 1600 from Reno.   Plane tickets aren't so much if you go the right time and don't have your heart set on west Europe.
travel,3da1vs,Holidaze21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"At least for traveling in Europe (surely not the case everywhere), I can't see a rental car making much sense. Public transit is phenomenal and cheap here. And my round trip ticket from the US was only around $850.  I definitely agree that short trips are comparatively more expensive, though. Every additional day of the trip, the more that cost of the flight gets divided out."

My husband and I were 5 years out of college before we both had enough time off our jobs (engineering and accounting positions) and enough money to travel the way we wanted to. We've been overseas twice and will definitely go again. We've also seen a lot of US cities on our list.  Travel is probably the most expensive thing (other than paying the mortgage) that we do. We don't have a big house because we don't need/want one. We don't have expensive cars/boats/campers or other possessions or hobbies that we sink a lot of money into.

travel,3da1vs,mem0ri,4,Tue Jul 14 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 23 and save about 60% of my income for travel. I purposely took paths in life that wouldn't put me into debt. I don't own a car, I live at home with my parents (paying board to them) cause it's cheaper than living out of home, I didn't go to uni and chose to go to TAFE instead (I guess it's the aussie version of community college?), I don't drink, I rarely go out for dinner, I rarely buy clothes or make up, I plan out my meals according to my budget and prep them a week in advance and I try to do free things or cheap things when I do go out... this helps that I live near lots of beaches and places with nice outdoorsy activities lol. Two years ago I had never left Australia now I've been to 12 countries and will be going to another at the end of this year. Oh and this part is incredibly important: Don't put ALL your money toward travel. If you're going to be going on a holiday once a year, don't spend the rest of the entire year doing nothing but waiting to travel. Make sure you put a little amount aside for yourself or find outdoorsy things to do. Go out with your friends, you don't have to spend a lot of money to have a good time! Just make sure you're not wasting the rest of your life waiting for one small portion of it where you'll be overseas. I definitely did that when I first got the travel bug, but it was silly. While I enjoyed my overseas trip, I want to live every day like it's an adventure. If traveling has taught me anything that is the most valuable it's that I live in a pretty amazing part of the world and I want to appreciate that every day! :)"
travel,3da1vs,valeyard89,7,Wed Jul 15 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to see the world for one reason, and one reason only: because you want to so badly.  When I was a college sophomore, I starved myself for 6 months and did whatever extra work I could in order to save enough money to spend 4 days in Italy. I brought my girlfriend at the time and we had a blast ( also, my parents still don't know about the trip ). We ate cheap, had bought a heavily discounted flight 3 months in advance, and just showed up at hotels at 9-10pm asking if they had rooms left ( they did and would let them cheap because an occupied room is better than an empty room ).  I've also done road trips where I slept in my car and ate at soup kitchens.  Now that I've got a bit more money, my travel is different and less difficult ... but my prior experiences inform me on what to bring, what to do, etc.   The point is ... your travel circumstances will be your own. Some people will travel very cheap, others with more luxury. My best advice for making it happen is to pick a destination and a date ... buy a ticket to lock yourself into it ... and then spend from now until then scraping together whatever you can to make the trip happen. You'll be able to get by on what you have ... but the more you have, the more you'll be able to experience ( like good food, entry fees into places, activities that cost money, nice places to sleep, etc )."

You may save 10k in airfare, but you can easily make up that much in better salary and credit card points and have confirmed tickets to top it off.  I have flight benefits but I can't use them because I work and my job requires I be there.

All student loans  Year 2 - Some money. Mostly student loans  Year 3 - Lot's of money. Time to travel

travel,3da1vs,gee_ohm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:03 2015 UTC,"I hovered around a 2.7-2.8 and I was by no means a model student. Probably middle of the pack.   3.25 is certianly doable if you test well. A good barometer will be your first 2 years. If you are making A's in Calc 2/3, Organic Chem, and your pre-engineering classes then you should be ok.  The key is to develop good study habits and know how much time you truly need to grasp the material.  You will know who the 3.75-4.0 students are though. They'll be the ones in the study halls every night till 10 and on Saturdays at noon. If you want to be safe...find those guys/girls and tag along"

We got married young but didn't want to settle down - he had connections in Pakistan (much like yours, missionaries in the family), but it was 2008 and Pakistan wasn't so hot so we bought one-way tickets to India and ended up staying for 6 months (plus a one-month trip into Pakistan). I wouldn't travel that way again (open ended and long), but I'm glad we did it. It was a great experience and pretty much convinced us we could do anything if we had enough determination. :)  This year we took our first international trip with our 1-year-old: visited Pakistan, Oman, Sweden and Norway. She won't remember it, but we needed to know we could do it, and it will make it harder to make excuses in the future. The bottom line is that if it's a priority for you, make it happen.

In the beginning it was very budget travel, now I'm starting to look at entry-luxury type trips. Something that is not bare bones, but not something that is $$$$$ on the budget either.

I have lots of friends who in Canada worked in a bar / retail if you don't have the write qualifications. There are also loads of schemes where you work a little bit and get free accommodation. The most successful ones I know of are working in a hostel a few hours a week and getting a free room, or working in a farm, getting completely involved in the farm lifestyle and getting free rent & food. You can do this for a few weeks or a few months depending on how much you want to move around. The other way to do it is to get a job somewhere that is really easy to live and near a lot of places you want to go. I have friends teaching English in Vietnam and in China, it is relatively easy to get the TEFL qualification (just an online course) and to get a job.

travel,3da1vs,SWBoards,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"27, first started travelling at 21 but have been long-term travelling and living abroad for the past 2.5 years.  That aside, just want to propose some questions for your situation: - Will going into debt (and university) FIRST make it any easier for you to travel later? Or give you more strings? - Is it worth it going into debt (I really think not), and why not study abroad instead? To me that is much more worth going into debt for. I studied abroad in Australia for a year (Masters), fell in love, and am not immigrating there. Consider doing something like that it will slightly scratch your wanderlust itch and probably cost the same as an American degree!  But back to my first point... have you considered just working then taking a gap year? This is quite common in Europe and Australia and in my opinion, makes way more sense (wish I'd done it) than going straight to college where the pressure afterwards is HUGE to jumpstart your career and not travel till you retire.  To answer your question, my own circumstances are 1. Saving up money and selling all our possessions 2. Working while we travel 3. Keeping our accommodation costs minimal (e..g housesitting, also recommend couchsurfing). Hope that helps - if you really want to travel, my gut is to say don't tie yourself down in debts and plans... follow your instinct. You have no idea how travel can guide your life - you may discover a whole new career path - I did :)"
travel,3da1vs,that90sguys,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with all of those college plans (gap year, study abroad) is the fact that I need to go to college right out of high school to get a full tuition scholarship I qualify for.

My husband's sister (your age) started doing freelance work on Fiver - https://www.fiverr.com/ . In a nutshell, it's a site where literally anyone can make money doing just about anything. She has been setting up people's Facebook pages. People charge $5+ (most people want a custom order), and it's been a great side income for her, she makes a few hundred per order (WAY higher hourly rate). Put simply, look at lots of options, live minimally, it can totally be done. My husband and I travel on money we saved and earned from working since we were 16. Simple living and a bit of work go a long way, most people just don't know how to live frugally these days. All the best!"

I usually have a big trip every 2-3 years or so, and my small extended family will kick in some money towards it in addition to what I've saved.

travel,3da1vs,turtleshellmagic,2,Wed Jul 15 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"I'm 22 and I caught the travel bug after I saved up from tutoring jobs to pay for a study abroad program (to Spain through a community college/JC) and then stayed a month after in Italy to travel alone. It's a pretty affordable way to be able to travel abroad while still being able to earn some credit for school. It was my first time outside of North America (Live in CA, USA.. been to Mexico) and it was AMAZING.   I think that at your age, you can pick up multiple side jobs/part time jobs while you're studying. You can tutor elementary school kids like I did (easy money) or pick up a retail or food service job. Set a goal of how much you think you're going to spend abroad (transportation, food, hotels/hostels) and then keep that number in mind. Every month, set aside a set amount of money (e.g. $100 of your paycheck every month).   I asked my parents to help me with my study abroad tuition. We had a deal that they would match the amount that I saved up. I saved up $2500 for the study abroad costs and my parents paid the other $2500.   A couple people posted that you probably don't have debt and to use that to your advantage. I completely agree with this. Don't use money on unnecessary things. When I was in the process of earning money and setting it aside, I would literally ask myself if what I wanted to buy (an iPhone, clothes, etc.) was what I needed and worth putting it towards that item and not the travel fund. You have to really want to travel and be frugal/pragmatic about how you spend money. If you make it a priority to save up, you'll end up having a pretty good lump sum in no time.   For high school/college students, there are SO MANY scholarships for school... even some that don't specify EXACTLY what you have to spend money on. Make use of those scholarship opportunities to save up money for your travels."

travel,3dctha,uReallyShouldTrustMe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:55:32 2015 UTC,"There really isn't a whole lot to do in Seoul, particularly in comparison to those other cities. So don't feel compelled to spend all your time in Korea in Seoul. You could also take a day or two from Seoul or put them toward Hong Kong or Tokyo, but accommodation prices are certainly higher in those two cities. For an experience, and a cheap bed, consider staying in a jimjilbang one night. I don't think you'd have to resign yourself to simple rice dishes on a $100/day budget, esp. in Seoul, but even in Tokyo and Hong Kong.  There are lots of free places to go in Hong Kong (I don't even remember anywhere where I paid an entrance fee; I was seeing a lot viewpoints and temples). And seemingly all of the paid sites (e.g. palaces – what's it? $9 for a combined ticket to see all four major palaces?) in Seoul are cheap; the Korean government still hasn't fine-tuned the art of milking tourists for every last won."
travel,3dctha,tariqabjotu,2,Wed Jul 15 07:57:50 2015 UTC,"Not a whole lot to do in Seoul?! I spent 9 days there last spring and felt it wasn't enough. That being being said, HK and Tokyo are great cities aswell. Tokyo might be the most interesting but also the most expensive."
travel,3dctha,poerre,2,Wed Jul 15 09:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly anti-Korea after living there ""just a little too long"" but there's plenty of good stuff to do in Seoul for a week if you've never been before."
travel,3dctha,Oax_Mike,2,Wed Jul 15 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm obviously in the minority here. Sure, you could spend a week in virtually any city in the world – you could easily shop or eat to your heart's delight, or explore different neighborhoods in Seoul forever – but I think it'd be faster to go through the main sites in Seoul than in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Of course, for every person who says X days was too long to visit a place, there's always someone who says it was nowhere near enough."
travel,3dctha,tariqabjotu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"I just came back from a 17 day trip in Tokyo and I was in the same boat as you, not caring if I ate cheaply, but just wanted to experience the country... until you realize you're only in this country for a limited amount of time, and you'd like to really enjoy what it has to offer... not simple rice dishes, even though some of them are pretty good. I had rice balls from 7&I on a good majority of the days for breakfast and was satisfied as they were tasty (sour plum mmm...). In Japan you can stay in those tube hotels (blanking on the name, hi jetlag) for I think around ~$35/3500¥ a night. I also just noticed you are returning to the UK. Right now 1 GBP equals to 193¥. That's basically $1.93, so if you're talking about bringing I don't know, 800 GBP into Tokyo, you'd currently get 154,650¥. That's veeeeery good. I got about 120 yen for every USD."

EG you have 10 people reporting a theft of $10 and 1 guy reporting a loss of camera equipment worth $600.  I'd just disregard the number. Also consider that the exchange rate for EUR USD has changed so that will affect your calculations too.  It's generally a little hard to do budgeting since everyone's consumption patterns are different. Probably the best route is to find out your daily budget for your most expensive country, then multiply it by different % for different countries to get a ballpark figure."

travel,3damvq,coldflame563,4,Tue Jul 14 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"26/Female - I absolutely adored Dubai!! I went with a travel group because I was a little nervous to go alone, but having gone now I would have had absolutely no problem going by myself. It's very easy to get around by taxi and the metro, and you'll find tons to do around there whether it's checking out the malls (the indoor skiing is cool and overall they are just so big it's amazing to see). The beaches are absolutely gorgeous, and alone you'll have plenty to see just walking around some of the hotels, going to clubs at night, and you can even do stuff like skydiving. While I was there we did a day trip to Abu Dhabi, which you can probably find a tour to take you, and also look into a Desert Safari - that was one of my favorite parts of the trip.   Dubai is one of the safest places to be alone, no matter what part of town you're in. Make sure to also hit up the old part of town and check out the spices souk and gold souk to see something other than huge buildings.  You will honestly be fine without much of a plan, maybe take a city tour one day and ask for some suggestions but just Googling or asking hotel concierge for tips should be enough.  As far as ""dirt cheap,"" be prepared to spend a good of money. Everything there is pretty pricy. I'm not sure where you are, but in some bars even a beer can go for around $20. Drinking was one of the more expensive things to do there, though."

travel,3damvq,kaleicious,2,Thu Jul 16 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"I had an ex who worked and lived in Dubai, so I spent about a month there.   I found the malls to be a bit boring - theyre just malls (but extra fancy and extra large and extra expensive.) Its interesting to check out though, because it really does feel like Vegas (or vice-versa). The Gold Souk is the ""original"" Dubai and has more of what one would consider an ""original"" feel. Check it out. For expats, Dubai is all about nightlife. When I was there years ago, the Buddha Bar (below the Grosvenor House) was the place to go. Not sure what's popular now, though. My two most delicious meals were fancypants sushi and Pakistani street food. I'll try to remember the names of the places and will update asap. In my opinion, the biggest shock was going to dinner and watching Emirati couples eat. Amongst the more ""traditional"" couples, the men would eat and the women would watch them, in silence, without eating any food themselves. Great example of cultural differences."

The Dubai Mall.  The Gold and Spice souks and old town.  There's crazy resorts and hotels that are fun to hang out at.  The food is great.  And since you'll be there for a week, you'll have time to head on down to Abu Dhabi. In Dubai, there's a metro that's nice and works well.

travel,3dbww6,HikrGrl,3,Wed Jul 15 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"As a travel consultant, I understand that booking a safari can be hectic. I also understand that you will do your research before embarking on this fascinating journey. Therefore, let me suggest something different and unique.   Actually, safari bookings are mostly done by buying a packaged tour where the tour operator takes all the responsibility. However, international travellers seldom think about hiring 4x4 and a driver/guide. In South Africa and Kenya, it's common for locals to self-drive or hire a guide/driver. This helps them explore several options that a packaged tour cannot offer. In fact, it is the most cost effective and fascinating way to explore everything that these National Parks have to offer. I will suggest that you hire 4x4 safari equipped vehicle for your husband and yourself driven by a knowledgeable guide who is in constant contact with other operators in the area; ready to take you near all the action. A very reputable company is Sun Wold Safaris (also see tripadvisor reviews). The company only hires Silver, Bronze guide accredited by Kenya Safari Guide Association. The website lists of all these guides and their experience. I have sent two clients and both of these had amazing things to say about the tour company and its guides.   Now, a 4x4 will cost you around $200 inclusive of VAT park fees and other. It means that you and your husband can travel to Masai Mara for less than $100 a day per person (that too in your fully equipped private vehicle tailor-made for Safari).   ACCOMODATION  The next step is to find a golden spot in Masai Mara where you can experience great migration, first-hand. I will suggest three breath-taking sites. First is the Mara Explorer Tented Camp (see reviews on Tripadvisor). Its tents are on Talek river with amazing views from every tent. The food is better than most five star lodges and you can book a twin standard room for only $75 per night ($37 p/p) at hostelbookers.com. The price include all three meals. The camp is available for your dates in Sep.   Another slightly expansive but comparable lodge is Keekorok Lodge in Masai Mara. It will cost you ($110 p/p per night). Read tripadvisor reviews. it is available in Sept and includes all three meals. Bookable at Hotels.com or Veneres.com. A third option is the amazing BaseCamp Masa Marai where you can get a tent for ($80 p/p per night) inclusive of breakfast. Bookable at Javago.com  Just think what you can do with these options. It's very inexpensive, and it should offer options for flexible game drives whenever you want.   I Hope this helps. Thanks"
travel,3dbww6,traveltrail,2,Wed Jul 15 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Haha, I totally get you on 'choice'. I do media/research for a company that does luxury safaris (usually around $2000 - $4000 a week) and it is literally my full time job to figure out who we can trust and who we cant - we're the bookings middleman. Quick Q - did you mean $2000 per person for the entire trip, or is that what's left after you've paid for your flights?  Let me know and I'll ask our East Africa guy who he recommends.   Just a thought - you might be able to squeeze a few nights in a nice lodge / tented camp into that budget, so don't try to 'rough it' all the way :) It is still supposed to be a holiday right ;)"

Though it did look pretty awesome. Maybe another time, but for now, while we are still young and can sleep on the ground comfortably, we're roughing it! Hopefully we will find something!"
travel,3dbww6,exptl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, I hear you - I also feel I'm too young to need full-on pampering! The biggest differentiators between a budget safari and a more expensive lodge is usually the equipment - so for example, a cheaper game viewing vehicle with windows, as opposed to a full-on open deck safari 4x4, and then tents with a shared bucket shower as opposed to perhaps private bathrooms, etc. The upmarket guys also usually have access to more secluded sections of the parks. Having said all that, the major parks all still allow public access, and with an operator who knows the park, the wildlife experience will still be just as good. And quite frankly, that's all that really matters. My advice to friends is always; if you can afford it, do the bush lodge experience, it's totally magical - but if it's out of budget, don't worry about it - you're not missing any of the important stuff.  Our safari guy recommended http://www.africanbudgetsafaris.com/ http://www.africanbudgetsafaris.com/tours-by-location/serengeti/ http://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Attraction_Review-g312659-d2140491-Reviews-African_Budget_Safari_Day_Tours-Cape_Town_Central_Western_Cape.html  They have a variety of tours on offer that I think will meet your budget. Just remember that budget tours leave out a lot to make the price, so factor in all the meals you'll still have to pay for, and extra activities. Most of the tours will list what's included and what's not. Lastly, I'd look for the tour that offers the most campsites rather than budget lodges / budget hotels when it comes to the wilderness parts of the tour - no point getting all the way out into the bush and then sharing the experience with a hundred other people :-)  I won't try to talk you out of the Serengeti, but please add South Africa to your list at some stage :-D  (especially while our currency is still weak, we offer a lot of bang for your buck at the moment!)"
travel,3dcm7t,geo_xue,2,Wed Jul 15 05:39:54 2015 UTC,"Day 1: Walking around Queenstown is an activity on its own! Grab an inexpensive beer at one of the bars downtown.  Day 2: I don't have a recommended tour but be prepared to adjust this one - weather regularly shuts down the Milford highway.  Day 3: Do the Glenorchy tour, it's better than the Queenstown LOTR tour - the spots they show you are way more interesting!  Day 4: Consider hitting up the ""Antarctic Center"" right next to the airport in Christchurch. It's a little expensive but it's one of the best museum-type attractions I've ever been to. The Hagglund ride is unreal!  Day 5: Edoras is my favourite place in the world. Enjoy.   Day 6: No offense to Christchurch, but maybe head to Kaikoura a day early. Check out the Earthquake information center downtown, or hit up the Re:START mall (little shops built in shipping containers, very cool vibe). They're right next to eachother but will only take an hour or two, then head over to Kaikoura - that's my suggestion.  Day 7-8: Whale watching sounds good, consider hiking the Peninsula walkway, or if you're energetic get yourself to Mount Fyffe - great trek and phenomenal views of the Kaikoura Seaward range. Maybe spend a day just chilling to catch your breaths and take it all in.  Day 9-10: Hit a winery in Blenheim or Nelson. Two days is a lot for Picton by traditional itinerary reckoning.  Day 11: You'll have time to take in some Wellington nightlife. Have some craft beers and go visit the bucket fountain on Cuba street!  Day 12: Hit up Te Papa after Weta Studios. If you feel like having a crammed day, find your way up Mount Victoria - this is where they filmed the Hobbits hiding from the ringwraith at the beginning of FoTR (Shortcut to mushrooms, ""Get off the road!"")  Day 13: Look out your plane for a view of the central plateau mountains - that conic volcano is Mount Doom!  Day 14: Consider booking a Hobbiton tour with Bush and Beach. They can get you to Hobbiton from Auckland and then might be able to get you on a bus to Rotorua afterwards, just call their office - they deal with stuff like this all the time. You get a hobbit banquet feast for lunch and it's usually a small group with a good guide. Tell them Jon the Canadian sent you (I'm just about to finish eight months working there)  Day 14-15: THE LUGE! Take the gondola and get some cool views of Rotorua while piloting tiny gravity powered go-karts down a mountain. Awesome. Take in some geothermal activity at one of the parks or walks around the city. Check out the night market if it's running.  Just a few of my suggestions. Itinerary looks good overall.

Berlin is probably the hippest city in Europe at the moment, along with Amsterdam. (My cousin is an artist and lives in Berlin.) Munich is beautiful (My sister went there last year.) and will be a contrast to Berlin, as Bavaria is more similar to Austria than to the rest of Germany. Paris is known for the Eiffel tower, it's patisseries and it's boulevards. A warning is that Paris is having a problem with pickpockets at the moment (It's on the European news a lot.) who particularly target Asian and American tourists. European cities are a lot safer than American cities but use common sense. Use trains, buses and planes (Particularly with Easyjet, Ryanair, Wizz Air and other budget airlines.) to get around Europe.

Airline and booking systems (assuming you're booked through and the layover is an official layover, not just you being on two separate tickets) are smart enough to calculate minimum connection time.  If you miss your connection because of a late or delayed flight, the airline will look after you and get you to your destination the next available option.  I love booking tickets where the connection is 5 minutes more than the minimum allowed at that airport and hoping to either be delayed (often you'll get a free meal or a lounge pass), really delayed (free night's accommodation in an airport hotel) or confusingly delayed (where the airline will re-route you two or three different flights to get you to your destination).  If you're heading home and have a few days up your sleeve, try to book one of those flights - you might get a story to tell.  If you have somewhere to be, leave as much time as you can and never go within about 90 minutes of the minimum connection time recommended for the airport."

I can't comment on flights, but there'll be buses running daily between the two places. You might have more luck finding times for these?"

travel,3db8bo,CantLookUp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"I've just heard Plitvice is overrun with asian tourists in swarms and swarms, while Krka isn't as much so.   While true, it's this way around for a reason, the one is (in my opinion) much better than the other. It's possible to dodge a lot of the crowds at Plitvice by getting there early - most tour groups won't get there until 10/11am - and doing the route in reverse, meaning take the landtrain right up to the far end first and make your way back down from there. Most people walk up first and then take the train back at the end, so you'll have a couple of hours without any crowds around before you start meeting any tour groups coming the other way.  I'm not sure how long you have planned for Split or Dubrovnik, but that could be doable as they're both fairly compact. It depends how fast/slow you like to travel, really.  I skipped Kornati as it appeared to be overrated. I met a couple of people who'd done the trip and said it was okay, but nothing special, and another who'd said it seemed like the kind of place that looks fantastic from the air, but not so good when you were on the boat/ground level. At the same time though, there were reviews online saying it was great, so it all comes down to personal preference really."
travel,3db8bo,CantLookUp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:21 2015 UTC,Hmmm. Good idea about Plitvice. Does the train cost anything?
travel,3db8bo,CantLookUp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's included in the price of admission to Plitvice. You get one train ride and one ferry ride attached to each ticket."
travel,3dcdco,weeman8,2,Wed Jul 15 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"The topdeck tour looks like it covers all of the popular areas of the rockies but IMO is a little overpriced. You could probably do it cheaper by using the greyhound, then booking day tours out of the local hostels. And @ a more relaxed pace too. Those tours can be like mini army camps at times. Or worse you might get 1 or 2 morons on your trip. Ugh.  Don't worry about safety. Gun crime is very rare. It's Canada and even if you get lost, everyone speaks English.  $250 a day is VERY healthy and I daresay you could get by on $80 a day (all-in)...assuming you don't drink.  For stuff to see or do, & how to get around, etc do a search on /r/vancouver. Huge abundance of things to see/do/eat - whatever floats your boat. Make sure to book everything before mid September though - it starts to rain after that and it's not so fun.  Debit/credit cards will work fine but notify your bank before you go so they don't lock it down. Check with Verizon regarding roaming charges."
travel,3dcdco,wnose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:07:15 2015 UTC,"Looking at other tours for google, the topdeck tour seems to be the cheapest.  I forgot to add that I only have 9-10 business days off, so roughly two weeks. I can't get a rental car due to my age(23), and I wouldn't trust myself driving in the mountains all by myself even if I did have a rental car, not trying to take any risks.   I'll make  sure to do everything else you said, though! Thanks!"
travel,3dcdco,inspiratron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:30:27 2015 UTC,"In summer, there's basically no reason to worry about driving in the mountains, in the southern part of the province.  If you have the patience to drive on two-lane roads, you'll be just fine!  Also, if you're looking into the Trans-Canada Highway, it's a first-rate highway.  Mountain driving, in this season, is just like any other kind of driving, assuming you're diligent and watching for wildlife.  In Canada, most rental car companies will rent to the 21-24 age group but with an added surcharge.  I'd be surprised if no companies let you do this stateside.  Have a great trip!"
travel,3dcdco,surfninjad,2,Thu Jul 16 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"I just did this trip with a rental car and hotels at each stop so obviously you can do it cheaper but I would suggest not doing the tour and going at your own pace. If you get to Banff and realize that you absolutely love it, you have the option to just stay there for the week rather than having to stick to the tours itinerary.  As for the traveling alone, you don't know these people on the bus why do you care to share this experience with them? Get out on your own and talk to other travelers or meet some locals. Get on tinder and find a local to show you around.   Call Verizon before you go and buy a international plan...AT&T was going to charge be $20 per MB! in canada."
travel,3dcdco,Katolo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"The problem with the rental car is I'm not of age, and also because I don't want to worry about driving around on the trip(I don't really trust myself driving in the mountains alone). I only have a 2 week vacation, so I thought having 10 days traveling around the Rockies and a few days in Vancouver was a good start to my first solo trip."
travel,3dcdco,surfninjad,3,Wed Jul 15 06:32:20 2015 UTC,"FYI, you can still rent a car but it'll cost you a bit more due to your age.  Also, driving through the mountains is super easy. Roads are paved, you won't run out of gas unless you're a bonehead, and it's fairly busy so you won't be stranded if something does happen."
travel,3dcdco,bomberblonde,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:38 2015 UTC,Point taken on the age (though most rental companies will rent to you for a higher cost). The roads however are not bad at all (assuming this trip is during the summer months)  One positive point to the tour bus would be that you get a good taste of each area so you know which place you would like to go back and spend more time in.

travel,3dcbf8,CrypticCube,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"Are you just looking for directions from the airport to the church?  The church provides the following:   Walk to bus stop 5A or 11B to take an airport limousine bus to Yoido in Seoul. [...] Tell the bus driver you want to get off at the Lexington Hotel (opposite Yoido Full Gospel Church.)   Alternatively, you can take the all-stop Airport Railroad train to Gongdeok, then take subway Line 5 to Yeouinaru. The church is walking distance from there.  Both options will take about an hour. The train/subway option may be a bit cheaper. I don't know how long you'll be spending at the church, but you have plenty of time to do something else in Seoul if you'd like.  In terms of apps, the best app for directions in Korea is without a doubt Naver. It's only in Korean though. That being said, you would be fine using Google Maps to do the walk from the subway to the church. It's also passable for subway routing and some buses."

travel,3dc8n8,toozler,2,Wed Jul 15 11:28:31 2015 UTC,"Korea seems to be like the US, where thousands of different cultures meet in one place.   No, no, definitely not. You will see some non-Asian foreigners in Seoul, primarily at tourist sites, and in major cities across Korea (including Seoul, of course) at bars and neighborhoods blatantly tailored to foreigners or around major universities, but it is still the homogenous country you've heard of. That being said, Seoul is a large, modern city, and you'd be wrong to think the entire country looked like that.  Especially if an ""exotic experience"" is what you're looking for, you'd be wise to spend some time outside Seoul. Two weeks is plenty of time to do that and, at the risk of offending people who feel Seoul has tons to do, is far too long to spend in the city anyway if tourism is the main purpose of the trip (which it may not be) – you'd be hard-pressed to find a two-week Korea itinerary that allocates more than four or five days to Seoul.

Hm? The seats in Row 16 are color-coded as premium seats on the diagram since they're still in Economy Plus too.  It sounds like you have enough information already from the reviews and the diagram. You get additional legroom in Row 16, but immovable armrests, no underseat storage space, and tables in armrests, because it's the bulkhead. If you're in an aisle seat you'll likely be subjected to occasional bumps by flight attendants. The remaining E+ rows are very similar to each other, with the standard E+ legroom, underseat storage, and seatback tray, and no bumping from FAs. It's a matter of preference what trade-offs you're willing to make."

But I thought row 16 would be best because of the extra space in the area?  But I read how narrow the seats are and I'm thinking that might be bad to have immoveable armrests too. I almost upgraded to row 16, but right before I was paying, I noticed it said ""limited recline"" as well! So immoveable armrests and limited recline, which is not noted on seatguru, but United had it noted on the page where I input my credit card info.   So I think I'll just get a ""normal"" economy plus seat in a different row. Maybe not as much legroom, but I'll be able to shift my body around more since I can move the armrests."

travel,3dc4uv,maxg900,5,Wed Jul 15 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think you have got a great list here. Most of those cities are really amazing and it is hard for me to pick ones to NOT go too. I have been to most of these cities and the only ones that I didnt LOVE were Bratislava and Zagreb. I only spent 1 day in Bratislava so I didnt really get to experience the city as much as I would have liked. And Zagreb is nice, but not as great as Zadar or Hvar. I would add Split into the mix since it is close to Mostar which is great.  Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Belgrade, Vienna, Krakow, and Prague are must see. I have never been to Cesky Krumlov but it has been on my radar for awhile. The town looks straight out of a fairy tale. Also, Iv never been to Romania so I have no advice, but you have a great list so far"
travel,3dc4uv,LeftHandMonkeyWrench,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:16 2015 UTC,"Ok thats great advice... and I've actually read the same thing about Bratislava - the consensus I've found is that there are so many other great places in region that Bratislava is skippable.    Since you've been to that area before could you tell me a little more about the culture in Croatia/Bosnia/Slovenia/Serbia?  I don't have a lot of solid information on these places yet, and don't know anyone that has been there, so I really have no idea what it will be like except for what I've read... will they have like bustling cities with great nightlife, or will it be difficult to find things to do at these places? How are the people? etc."

travel,3dc4uv,LeftHandMonkeyWrench,3,Wed Jul 15 05:50:40 2015 UTC,"Most of these cities have great night life. Especially if youll be traveling during the summer months. Ljubljana is a smaller city but it has a bustling night life with more pubs and bars that I can count lining the canal with a few late night clubs I cant really remember. Zadar has a great nightlife right in the historic part of the Island, everything is pretty close, A cool club/pub is called the garden and it is on top of the city walls. Same with Hvar and Split... Anywhere on the coast you will find people having a good time. While your in the Balkans make sure you try some Burek and Rakia. Rakia is a type of liquor that tastes.... interesting! but it is a national drink of Croatia and most of the Balkans. The people of the Balkans are great, I never once had a problem. Only in Serbia did I feel like I had to hold back a little bit because I am an American and im sure some people are upset about the NATO bombings led by the US 25 years ago. Check out the city Split as well.... it is similar to Zadar but has a few cool historical aspects. Like Diocletions place that was built 1700 years ago and people still live inside the walls. Mostar nightlife is pretty non existant, a few bars and pubs. In budapest look for Ruin Pubs. they are basically pubs that were set up in abandoned buildings. There are tons of them and some are really cool and fun.  Prague is well known for its night life. cant go wrong there."

I think Sarajevo has much more impact)  Budapest has an amazing night scene, full of younger people.  (Google Ruin pubs).  I have heard that Bratislava is where a lot of English Bachelor parties happen due to cheap beer.  I did not go out at night when I was there, so I can't really confirm if it has a 'fun' nightlife.   It was a nice place to pass through, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay there.  Zagreb is also an amazing city with a vibrant nightlife.  (I was very surprised by how much I liked it). They have many great hostels as well, geared towards younger travelers."

Belgrade and Vienna are not everyone's cup of tea. Personally I like both, but they aren't as instantly lovable as Sarajevo, Krakow or Budapest.   You didn't specify the length of your trip but unless you want to do cityhopping and see nothing along the way, you'd better use all of those two months to do this trip. Do a rough itinerary and see how many days you end up with when you include every city. If it's too much, I'd cut Romania first then Serbia second. Not because they aren't great, simply because of logistics."

I'll be in Europe for 90 days, but I am spending a large part of the last part of the trip in Germany.  That's interesting about Vienna - my brother went there and said it wasn't really that great - party wise (I know the architecture is amazing).  As for Budapest, he had the opposite opinion and named it as one of the most boring cities that he visited, which is opposite of what I've read online so far."

Are you an employee with tons of experience and know how that will be difficult to replace?  Do you perform tasks at your job that take a lot of knowledge of the company and its history, etc. which no one else is qualified or able to perform?    I would probably tell them immediately and give them two months to find a replacement.  The more time you give them the better you will look and should you return and want a job they might be more willing to rehire you.    The flip side is they could ask you to leave sooner.  If you have a good relationship with your boss and work in a small company I would consider this far less likely though."

travel,3da7d1,cool_hand_legolas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"My SO and I are also curious about the best way to go about purchasing ferry tickets. We're going from Santorini to Milos, and then back to Athens in about a month and a half. Might post about this in /r/Greece too if this thread doesn't get any helpful responses. :P  Also to give you a little insight on some of the islands.. Santorini and Mykonos are probably the two most well known Greek islands. Santorini is popular for the caldera formed there and the views that you can get almost anywhere on the island. While Santorini is also known for its nightlife (as it is a popular tourist area amongst the islands), Mykonos might be even more well-known for it as it is a bit more popular for specific artists to play at. For example, popular DJ Paul van Dyk is playing at Cavo Paradiso Club in Mykonos tonight! So if the popular nightlife type islands are up your alley, then those two are definitely islands to check out.  Milos is a bit more known for having a lot of different beaches (which is one of the main reasons we decided to visit there instead of Mykonos). There are around 80 beaches, with some only accessible by boat, with the main draw being the variety in beaches on the island. ""Some have white sand, some black, some are rocky, others offer the satisfying sensation of crushed shells underfoot, with water ranging from emerald to aquamarine to cobalt blue."" Personally we wanted to see as many of these beaches as we could, and to also get away from the touristy nightlife of some of the more popular islands.   If someone could chime in about the ferries and distances between islands, as well as some information on some of the other islands, that would be great! I'll probably do a little bit more research myself on the ferries and edit this if I found out anything helpful."
travel,3da7d1,ItsDJ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"Hey - the /r/Greece community typically responds to these quickly.  In my experience for the couple of time I went to Greece, you just drive to the harbor, buy a ticket (cash) from a bored-out-of-their-mind employee, then wait in a long line of cars who are preparing to board. This was mostly for small ferry trips - kefalonia, zakynthos, aegina, etc. Not sure about the longer journeys like santorini (went by plane there).   In the mainland, visit Athens (Acropolis), Sounio, Corinth, Epidavros and Nafplio. Nafplio is the most beautiful place I've ever seen - make sure to climb to the top of the castle on the hill as well.  Islands: zakynthos is pretty close by and has giant sea turtles and beautiful beaches, kephalonia is zakynthos' slightly less pretty but still gorgeous sister. The prettiest one I saw is Santorini but that one's pretty far - make sure you swim near the volcano where the water is super warm.  And beware of gypsies. They're rare but I think all of them are out to beg or steal from you."
travel,3da7d1,theadmiral1985,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"I went on a solo trip in Greece in March during the offseason. Since you're going during high season booking ferry tickets might be a good idea. Or at least taking a look at the ferry schedules and thinking out several itineraries and checking availability of tickets a few days ahead of time.   Mainland vs. Island depends on your personal preference, I wish I spent 80% of my time in islands. The islands seemed safer and way  more relaxed and each islands has something special to offer. You could do all the tourist stuff in Athens in two days. I would've loved to see Meteora up north but it's a bit out of the way. Going west to see Nafplio and Corinth would be nice if you have the time too.   Ios and Mykonos has the parties, most people go to Santorini cause they've got the whole tourism thing down and have plenty of sights and things to do.   My favorite island was Naxos. There's the main town off the port and towns up in the mountains and beaches to see too, it's a bit cheaper than the other islands, and it'd be nice for bumming time/ nature exploring/ history. It's a lot more laid back  Read about it and see if it's interesting!  Crete is great too. Next time I go to Greece I'm definitely spending a few days there."

A friend of mine recently did YYC-SLC-SAN on delta with 55 minutes gap in SLC..granted she had to go through immigration, but she didn't make the flight on time."
travel,3dbaz5,foggysf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:20:01 2015 UTC,"I had an international flight return through SLC once with only like 45 min between flights.  The airport is tiny.  I was easily able to do the whole get my bags, go through immigration, check bags in and get to the gate in time.  Airlines know how long it takes before selling you the ticket, but you can check transfer times online."

One girl was afraid she would miss it so the flight attendants offered her a front seat before take-off so she can get off first, but they also said that the next flight will wait for us. We ended up waiting an hour more because there was some mixup but we would have made it in time without the delay too."

travel,3d8fj3,dswphoto,2,Tue Jul 14 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"I've never done public transport for large overland trips outside S.A. so I won't comment on that but I'm happy to give advice for S.A.   If you come in from Moz, it would be awesome to come in via the Kruger National Park - there is an official border crossing inside the park. Just note that border crossings on public transport take time as often the entire bus will have their luggage checked.   Side thought - there are companies that do organised itineraries where they pretty much pack a truck and camp / explore over large distances, I'm quite convinced that Dar - CPT is a done route. You might simply have to add the Zanzibar leg yourself. These guys will take you to more interesting places than public transport would.  Your ""wont drop these"" choices are top notch, BTW. Don't be dissuaded! I personally would do the beaches in Moz and wildlife in Zimbabwe because the recent political instability in Moz has lead to reduced control over poaching - Zim's parks offer better wildlife viewing at the moment. But then again, I personally prefer wildlife to the beach so the choice to skip Zim for Moz depends fully on what you're interested in seeing.  Ok, back to S.A. There is a lot to explore on the inland route, as well as the northern border + west coast combo, and for anyone else reading, I'm not slighting these options at all. I've done both and they're beautiful. But, the eastern coastline down to Cape Town would Absolutely be my first choice.  Now, by ""Side trip"" to Lesotho, yes, the Drakensberg area is definitely worth seeing - I would consider doing the KZN Battlefields with a day on the battlefields with a guide as well if you're going to do this (as you'd be cutting through here anyway) – but it might not be worth the effort of getting into Lesotho itself. Yes, the culture is very different, much more rural, once you cross the border, and the mountains are much more intense, but they're still spectacular from the South African side. If you're tight for time, or if you need to prearrange the visa (unlikely, but worth checking) I would skip Lesotho but I would do the Drakensberg from the S.A. side.  You can definitely do the S.A. portion using public transport, but I would strongly recommend renting a car for a few specific sections - this will allow you to see places that you simply wouldn't on a bus.  Feel free to ask me specific questions as you progress in your planning!"
travel,3d8fj3,exptl,2,Tue Jul 14 12:37:05 2015 UTC,"To add to the Lesotho thing, when I was there I was pressed for time and did a day trip up the Sani Pass to Lesotho.  Helluva view of the Drakensberg!  You incidentally also get to have a few hours in Lesotho and enjoy a beer at the highest pub in Africa when there- ie one of those ""I've technically been there when I was short on time"" type junkets.  It was really about seeing the Drakensberg though more than Lesotho as a day trip, and was amazing."

Also for the banks you need official mail from government (PPSN letter is sufficient) to the permanent address. See this site CitizensInfo it has answers to most questions about life in Ireland. Once you have the PPSN then you can go to a bank and try to open the account. It is by appointment or loooong wait (avoid Fridays). They have different requirements so make sure you read their website beforehand or call their call centre. AIB.ie is one of the better banks as far as customer support goes.

Ljubljana/Maribor - those outside Europe tend to forget that Slovenia exists. It's a wonderful country, and very affordable on any budget. They don't like being referred to as Eastern Europe, though.  Warsaw - Most recommend Krakow or Poznan, but the capital of Poland still has a lot of charm, history, and beautiful sights to see. Again, super cheap.  Istanbul - a little further afield, but Istanbul is a hell of a town. There's so much to see and do, you'll never have enough time to get around it and see everything.

You know that's excessive and I assure you it'll feel more rushed than your last trip. Just pick one area, either Peru, Chile/Easter Island, or Argentina and really get into the place. I know you want to get the most bang for your buck, but this is travel and sometimes efficiency really takes away from the experience."

travel,3d9xnk,kevinjh87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"No, but starting this trip, we decided we wanted to definitely see Macchu PIcchu and Easter Island, and that puts us closer to Patagonia."
travel,3d9xnk,agusohyeah,2,Wed Jul 15 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, all of that for 17 days seems insane. I have no idea on how long it takes to see all of macchu picchu, and I imagine you should layover in Santiago for Eastern Island. If you came to Argentina you would be Flying out of BA, unless you do something like Santiago - Bariloche (don't know if there are any flights, I think there might), 2 days there, go to Calafate and back, and not come to BA at all. If you don't have time for anything else, I'd recommend Calafate above all (1 1/2 days is enough, as long as you hike on the glacier). BA is good for however many days, I'd say 2 1/2 3 should be the minimum though."
travel,3d9xnk,agusohyeah,2,Tue Jul 14 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking 2-3 days at Macchu Picchu, 2 days at Titicaca, 3 days on Easter Island. I hate missing things, but I know I'm going to have to. Is BA a must-see? I haven't found any flights to Calafate or Bariloche from Santiago, I actually was thinking of flying into Montevideo and take the ferry across to BA, seeing BA a couple of days then flying to el calafate and back. to Santiago and home. I'm not sure what to do!"
travel,3d9xnk,chriswish,2,Tue Jul 14 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Don't try Patagonia unless you're willing to commit at least 5 days. That's the absolute minimum, I'd recommend more like 2-4 weeks. El Calafate is a three hour flight from BA and then you have to travel within Patagonia, where everything is pretty spread out."
travel,3d9xnk,alan_s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"well, I'm biased cause I've been living here for 9 years, but yeah I definitely think it's a must. BA and the Glacier. That's actually not a bad idea, the flight will be just a few minutes longer and you'll get to see another city, plus you can cover it in just one day. If you can afford flying from BA to Calafate, do 2 days there and fly back I think that's a good option. If you can spare an extra day or so, I'd suggest one day flying to Calafate, spend one full day there but make sure you do the ice hike this day, go to El Chaltén at night, spend one whole day in Chaltén, and the remaining day go back to Calafate and fly to BA. It'll be rushed but Chaltén is my favorite city in Patagonia, even if you're only there for one day you'll be glad you went. It's a tiny mountain town with probably the most stunning views in Patagonia."

Isla Del Sol was stunning but the islands accessible from Puno (Taquile and Uros) are nothing special.   Cusco and Machu Picchu were wonderful, I did the jungle trek and loved it. Id also highly recommend the salt flats trip but it would probably be too much to add in if you're also doing Easter island. Save it for another trip!   Happy travel planning :)"

For general travel history, I use a timeline plugin to make a timeline of my travels. I also like UNESCO sites, and I track that with an app called World Heritage Passport. The reason I ask about money is that the first choice is a paid plugin for wordpress, and it needs to be self hosted so you would need to pay yearly for that too. An alternative would be to just make albums on facebook after every trip, which is what I used to do too. Edit: If anyone is interested, the timeline plugin can be found here and I guess it is $15 now. The same company has also launched a wordpress theme with the same timeline idea, found here. I thought it was an interesting theme, but I was happy just with the plugin."

You say you prefer adventurous activities...so IMO, it's worth it to have an overnight at the Blue Mountains to properly experience the Jenolan Caves. Sydney is nice and all but I found it to just be a run-off-the-mill city, so have a bit of a leisure time visiting the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Darling Harbour and Bondi but once you recoup from jet lag head over to Blue Mountains. Then from there you can directly take a ~2hr train to Sydney airport and catch a flight to the Gold Coast. Take a day off Melb and add it here to make this work, IMO."

travel,3d9hf6,thriftynomads,2,Wed Jul 15 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a Canadian but lived in Aus for a year (& just got residency, moving there next yr!). Have travelled a lot around the country so will try my best to answer some of your questions:   Re: Sydney (my new home!), I'd recommend a stroll along the harbourfront (Circular Quay), walk towards the Opera House. Next to is the Botanical Gardens (free), they're quite pretty, good for a picnic or just resting your legs! I lived in Manly Beach, so I'm biased here, but it is a fantastic beach ""area"" just 18 minute fast ferry (30 min ""slow"") ride from Circular Quay. Walk to Shelly Beach (just walk down the ""Corso"" of Manly, you'll end up at big Manly Beach. turn right you'll see the big path to Shelly beach 10 min walk, beautiful!). Right time of yr you'll see whales maybe :) The ferry to/from Manly has been called one of the most scenic ferry rides in the world - and I agree (it was my daily commute!). It offers PERFECT views of the Opera house & harbour bridge too. Other cool areas to see in Sydney: ""The Rocks"" - older area near the harbourfront, if your legs are up for it keep walking to Darling Harbour (free fireworks on Sat nights). Chinatown is small but fun and good for cheap eats (just up from Darling harbour). Bondi Beach is the rival of Manly (trickier to get to, involves a bus with transfer) but gorgeous coastline. Eek! Re: best beach in Australia - that'll always be a hot debate. Gold Coast is stunning just for its unique layout... dozens upon dozens of high-rises and indeed a completely flawless beach. But it's not the typical beach of Aus that is empty and perfect. In my opinion for this reason it's definitely not the best. It's kind of tacky touristy (think Niagara FAlls or Las Vegas) with tourist restaurants and casinos. Very very different from most of beachy Aus that is low-scale (not many beaches with condos at all). Re: Brisbane, there's some excellent modern art museums there, some of my favs in Australia, I really enjoyed the GOMA. Yes Port Douglas is a great spot to start driving from and do visit Daintree! We did a croc tour which is fun – all of that area is just gorgeous for driving... watch out for cassowaries.. we did see a wild one and two babies!

I've only had my kit lens on my Sony a6000 for some time and I really want a prime (probably either 35 or 50). I'm in Tokyo in September for 10 days and Singapore for 3 and wanted to get your opinion.  I imagine 35 would work well, but that's just based on hearing that it's most tight quarters."
travel,3d33la,Aloumun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Before somebody jumps on this and tears me a new one, please just keep in mind that this is all personal opinion :P  (As you have an a6000, I won't bother converting focal lengths to full frame equivalents because your camera has the same crop factor as mine.) I guess a lot of it will come down to the types of shots you mainly take. Can't comment on Singapore, but like you said, Tokyo is in very tight quarters. I found that I had to ditch my favourite 18-35mm for something wider, i.e. the Tokina 12-24 I have. I did bring a 35mm 1.8G DX as well, but it didn't get used much, mainly because it is covered by the 18-35mm zoom, which actually outperforms the 35mm prime. Even so, I didn't find myself using the telephoto end of the 18-35 much, as Tokyo is just really too damn compact.  If you want better quality images by getting a prime, out of the two you've listed, 35mm will be better imo. Maybe that's just because of my bias towards 35mm primes on a crop sensor haha (I shot with a 35mm prime + 18-55mm kit lens combo during my semester in USA, but obvious different country, so different story). For me, 50mm on a crop is such an awkward focal length, as it is 75mm, which means it's a bit too tight for normal landscapes. Although, 50mm will be a pretty good option if you like taking portraits.  So basically what I'm recommending is: get an ultra-wide angle zoom, or if money is an issue, get a 35mm prime. Either one should complement your kit lens (16-50 for sony, is it?) nicely. Since I hate recommending lenses in general because it might not suit the person I'm recommending to (:P), feel free to pick out photos from the album you like, and ask me what focal length I used for those photos, so you can make your own mind up from there :)"

travel,3d8goj,Queervegosupremo666,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:19:31 2015 UTC,Bangkok has currency desks all over the city. I would get a couple hundred baht and little else to get you to your hotel from the airport. Lots of banks have currency exchange desks. ATMs are also everywhere if you don't want to carry that much cash. Be sure to have your passport at the money changing desks as they will need it.
travel,3d8goj,LupineChemist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:46:06 2015 UTC,"This gets asked a lot so I will try to be thorough. There is no ""perfect way to exchange money"" and it really depends on a number of factors. 1 - Safety - A lot of people are big on safety and would rather not carry too much cash. They will either use credit cards, eat the ATM fees, or will use a bank that does not charge fees to withdraw abroad. 2 - Convenience - Personally, I am a cash guy and freak out about having to rely on ATMs only for even the most basic of withdrawls. I also don't live in the US and haven't got one of those fee-free banks, so I USUALLY take cash and exchange on location... but it depends on... 3 - Location - This is a big one. Different places take different cuts when it comes to currency exchange. As a rule of thumb, I have found that western countries (Europe, US, Canada, NZ, Aus are my experiences) take a bigger percentage per dollar than Asia OR latin America. It also depends on what currency you are changing from. The US dollar usually gets a great deal. For example, in Myanmar, they will give you 969 kyat per USD in the airport and is pretty much the same anywhere in town. At the time, they will also give you 969 kyat per Euro, despite that the Euro is 10% more expensive and was far more than that when I went. Ditto on GPB and SGD. However, places like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, the XC profit is 1% or less (gotten as low as .2% in Korea), so to me, it is worth it just taking cash. 4 - Airport or outside? - Usually, the rate at the airport is poorer than the rater in town. With that said, most people know this but don't bother to do the actual math to see that sometimes this is insignificant. For example, the exchange dudes in the Bali airport were taking a cut of .8% for my USD. Even if ideally, they took 0% in town, I would only be saving .8%. If I exchange $1000, that means at the very best, I save $8 and I have to go through the trouble of looking for an exchange place in a much less safe environment. To me, I'll eat a $8 loss (really like $4) for the convenience and safety. My advice OP, for Thailand, know the exact rate before you go (type to google ""1 usd in baht"" and you get the current rate. Then, do ""(current - exchange offered)/current to know the profit margin of the company. If that is low, say under 2%, I'd take it. If it is a rip off deal, just make sure you have a couple of baht (say $40 you exchange from your home country for emergencies) and try your luck in town. I usually bring ~$40 emergency local money just in case and it can be done in any exchange house in your home country (malls have them). Shitty rate, but peace of mind if you need it. TL;DR - My advice is to take around $40 USD worth of baht, and get the rest within Thailand, be it in cash or through ATM withdrawls. Just make sure your bank knows you will do this as a heads up so they don't block your account"
travel,3d8goj,uReallyShouldTrustMe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:47:20 2015 UTC,"NEVER change money in airports! carry American and as advised previously, have enough to get you from the airport to hotel. or if you don't have cash for that country contact the hotel and tell them and get them to change your cash when you take the taxi to hotel..."
travel,3d8goj,donkey-horse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"Generally, you'll get the worst rates in the airport. But you'll get ripped off even more if you don't have the local currency when you're trying to get to your hostel/hotel. Therefore, get enough to get to your place and then ask them where to safely exchange money."
travel,3d8goj,trabller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"Use ATMs on arrival. Every major airport in the region has ATMs available as soon as you are in the terminal. Withdraw sufficient for a few days at a time, topping up as necessary. I believe even Myanmar now has ATMs, but if not use the government exchange in the airport and major banks; never the exchangers in the street.  I go into mere detail here: Travel, Money, Cards and Cheques in Foreign Lands."

travel,3d77u2,PureMichiganChip,2,Wed Jul 15 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"I recommend a tour around Lake Michigan. You can get Chicago > Milwaukee and/or Madison > Green Bay > Munising (Pictured Rocks) > Mackinac Bridge > Traverse City > Sleeping Bear Dunes > Grand Rapids > Detroit > then either go into Canada or down to Ohio.   I highly recommend Sleeping Bear Dunes and the Pierce Stocking Scenic drive there. Detroit obviously gets a bad rap and some of that is warranted, but there's also a lot of resurgence and good things going on. If it's something that interests you, I suggest seeing it for yourself. If you don't think it's your thing, you can just pass through. It's a good gateway to Canada and you could continue on to Toronto and/or Niagara and Buffalo.   Edit: I mapped a good route. I recommend the scenic M22 in Michigan. Stick to the water as much as possible. You'll hate it if you drive through the middle of the state."

This is basically tourism on rails - enter country, visit tourist mecha(s), exit country.  Is this what you want? If it is, and you want to see a huge variation of tourist attractions, it's doable but you'll be very tired and it may put you off travelling as you haven't left enough time for enjoyment.   You need to enjoy yourself, and experience some of the country; not just get flanked by souvenir touts and whisk onto the next location.

In my opinion, given those locations I would drop Liverpool, Manchester, Luxembourg and potentially Brussels. That's not to say these aren't all great places just comparatively have less to offer. Additionally, lose of Geneva and Zurich. Switzerland is an indescribably beautiful place but there is less variation across those cities so I would optimise to spend more time in one. Personally my pick would be to swap for Lucerne, but this subjective.   I highly recommend finding opportunities to travel at night via train. It's safe and simple and in many cases you can even just leave later afternoon and get into the next city the same night.   As far as Italy goes, consider less time in Venice - maybe only two nights. It's a wonderful place but in some ways you will likely have gotten what you want from it within a day or two."

Keep the cities ""close"" and you're better off.

Looks like it's cheaper for some US people to connect in Toronto (AC prices this way). A while back, LGA-YYZ-HKG round-trip was ~20% cheaper than YYZ-HKG round-trip on the same flight numbers (for the YYZ-HKG legs).  In fact, one of my flights to Europe (from YYZ) was only cheaper upon touching NYC.  My itinerary was YYZ-JFK-YYZ-MXP-... with same-day turnaround at JFK on AC. In fact the plane entering JFK and leaving JFK was the same aircraft. This is technically an invalid itinerary, but there are some ways around it to get it booked.  Another cheap one was YYZ-EWR-YUL-LHR-... with same-day connection at EWR. Also, again, technically not a valid itinerary (cannot go from Canada and connect in US to go back to Canada)."

travel,3d805w,AudioCinematic,3,Tue Jul 14 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on the city but as you haven't had a reply yet I'll give it a go. Accommodation costs in Amsterdam tend to be very expensive, especially over a weekend and during busy periods. I also find the hotels to be of a really poor standard, especially those along Damrak (the main road from the train station) and around the Red Light District. Hostels are always an option but in my experience they tend to be fully booked up well in advance and I don't recall there being that many in the centre.  To give you a really rough answer to your question, I think that a hotel in the central area of Amsterdam will run you about €250 - €300, a gram of weed €8-€10. Your best bet will probably be looking for a hotel located a little out of the centre. So I think it's doable, if a little tight but it will exclude you from visiting many paid attractions. Hopefully someone with more accurate information and knowledge can help you more."
travel,3d805w,ShufflingMole,2,Tue Jul 14 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, stay out of the city centre to save money. Most of the popular hostels will be booked up. Check airbnb.   Depending on what strain you buy will change how much it cost. I'd say 9-13€ is the average price I was paying when there 2 weeks ago.   I visited most of the coffee shops on the wiki and they were all great.   Paradox (for the edibles) The Grey Area Cafe Degraal"

Can't say for other hostels, but try out Hostel World, they have a massive selection that you can choose from in any city. (http://www.hostelworld.com)  I did four days and spent around 400 euros, ate cheap fast food and had a great time."

Weed is relatively cheap over there, and we found great accommodation on the Singel for €30 a night (google the Singel), I spent just over €450 there but that's because I got drunk both nights and thought the red light district was a good idea. Funny, but not necessarily a good idea. Long story short, you can very comfortably stay there on that budget.

As for fees it depends on the sort of account you have. Generally there are no fees for withdrawing from an ATMs that belong to your bank but you pay $2 if you go to a different banks ATM but I guess that could change depending on your account details.

Alternatively Zestos has great wings. Art: the High Museum is good, but any event at the Goat Farm is infinitely cooler. There's tons of small places that do more indie exhibitions so check Creative Loafing and see what's on. Bars: el Myr bar is fun. Star bar is grungy fun. The Brick store pub is cozy and has a fantastic craft beer menu. Sister Louisa's Church of PingPong is just awesome and the Sound Table is right next to it if that's your thing. Edgewood Market (it has some other name too but it's a covered market in Edgewood and there's a fantastic Arepas street food place) Belt line: rent bikes and checkout the street art. Then either cycle through piedmont park and eat at flying biscuit or go up to Virginia highlands and eat at Yeah Burger. At yeah burger get literally anything with the word bacon in it. Bacon jam? Yes. Bacon milkshake? YES. Also near Piedmont park- go to the original Krispy Kreme. I just really love donuts &amp;amp; there's a little conveyer belt thing. Idk don't judge me.  Craft beer: go to a few of the taprooms. The nicest ones to hang out at are in Decatur or midtown, but there's a few good ones in Westside as well. If you go do Decatur, eat at either Farm Burger, chai Pani (possibly spelled wrong but it's an Indian food place right next to farm burger) or Taqueria del Sol.  Best barbecue: Fox Brothers. Anybody who says differently is lying. Movies: go to the Starlight Drive in. It looks a little sketchy but it's totally awesome.   My phone dropped the hostel wifi right as I was posting this comment &amp;amp; I feel like I forgot something this time around. Oops. Also, disclaimer: I haven't been in the US or Atlanta for a year so hopefully most of these places still exist (:  EDIT: If you're into museums check out the Carlos. It's quite small but is got a cool collection &amp; usually a pretty high profile temporary exhibit. It's between Emory Law School and the traffic circle behind Gelnn Church.

A few years back I was flying Calgary -> Bangkok with a layover in Beijing. For some reason they couldn't check my bags all the way to BKK and I would have to pick them up in Beijing and recheck them.  No biggie as I had a fairly long layover... So I thought.  In order to get to where you get your bags (or where I got to recheck them... I honestly forget which) you have to go through immigration. Of course I didn't have a Chinese visa.  I get in line and when it's my turn the guy says ""No visa."". I patiently try to explain I am not staying and just need to get my bag to recheck it. The guy just doesn't understand me. I show him my itinerary and tickets but still nothing.  He calls over someone else and I get the same ""No visa"".. again I patiently explain my situation. They just aren't understanding me.  They point to one end of the area and say to go there. There wasn't an office or anything ... so I finally had to flag down someone in a uniform. They gestured to get in line again.  Different person .. same response.  I was starting to get a bit worried/upset but I remained calm. I asked if there was someone who speaks English that I could talk to.  They called over a lady who spoke very good English and I explained things to her. She said ""Oh ok, no problem. You need to go through this line up."" at the other end of the area....  I got some sort of temporary stamp .. made it through and got my bag rechecked.  I am not some ""Hurr durr .. speak ENGLISH!"" kind of traveller but I expected more in an international airport!"

So if you go up to them and ask something, they'll shake their heads but if you either give them time or write it down they'll get it.

I stayed for about a month far into the Asian side (between Atasehir and Bostanci), and English was incredibly rare compared to the more tourist-centric neighborhoods on the European side. The Golden Horn, Galata and Besiktas is pretty easy but the rest of Istanbul can be a total toss up in my experience. Izmir is very European-centric and young so English is very common.   I spent time in Kayseri in central Turkey and English was totally nonexistent. Adana and Gaziantep were pretty Anglophone unfriendly as well.   Greece is incredibly easy for an Anglophone. It's a tourism-centric country so English is the primary secondary language by default. Even the older folks will speak fairly good English."

Here's an example:  Fly to LA, rent a car, spend a week in LA visiting hollywood, hit the beach at Malibu, catch a show at the hollywood bowl, go to disneyland, then do a weekend in vegas/grand canyon.. then spend two or three days driving up the pacific coast highway to San Francisco, spend a 3-4 days there, then head out to Yosemite and go camping there for a few days.  I can't emphasize enough how great the drive up the coast is.  I rented a mustang convertible, and I'd say that drive was one of the highlights of my life.  Also, the drive to Yosemite is pretty great, too.  It'll surprise you how varied the landscape is in California.. you go from urban San Francisco, through the suburbs, through farmland and vineyards all the way out to the wild wild west and mountains.  If you have time left, maybe go west again and check out Seattle or Portland and then fly home from there.  An itinerary like that will save you money and you'll be spending a hell of a lot less time in the car, which, let me tell you, is fucking boring.  A lot of the middle of america is a wasteland with nothing to see.    California is basically a country worth of stuff to visit all by itself.    If you're going to do the east coast, the drive from boston to florida down 95 isn't very scenic, but there's a lot of stuff to see on the way, and you can take detours to the mountains or the beach all along the way."

DC and NYC will also be able to offer enough public transit to make a car unnecessary.  The Southwest is amazingly beautiful and should be driven through to be appreciated.  So like some other folks have mentioned, renting a car here and hitting up Southern California/Grand Canyon/Vegas would be totally doable in a week~10 days.  You could also do a little less time on the East Coast and take your west coast drive farther and get up into Colorado/Wyoming for some of the National Parks there.  I think your best bet is to really prioritize what it is you want to see of America.  Like most countries, there is an immense amount of variety.  If you want to see large cities and major urban tourist attractions, pick the ones that are most important.  If you want beautiful landscapes, or beaches, or wildlife - prioritize those.  I think once you decide how much time you are willing to dedicate to seeing certain things, it will be much easier to plan, and then find the most cost efficient way to get to them."

I would even go so far as to say it's easily doable, but it depends on the extras (like theme parks) you'll be doing. (I bought a used car to go on my trip and sold it at a loss afterwards and included this in the $6k. I'm a US citizen though, so I don't think that would be an easy option for you.)    There are some car rental companies that supposedly don't charge fees: https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/specialoffers/index.jsp?targetPage=USoneway.xml&Category=BB    Look into RV relocation / repositioning which is a one way RV rental (often at a discount because they need to relocate an RV to a different city):  http://www.apollorv.com/reloc.aspx https://www.transfercarus.com/    Hotels: use betterbidding.com to bid on hotels using Priceline.com. I've stayed in $250/night hotels for $60/night, often bidding only a few days or a week in advance of my stay. Since the US does not have an extensive hostel network like Australia (and let's face it, a lot of the rest of the world) this will probably be your biggest expense. AirBNB.com is also nice, but I rarely (read: never for 1-2 night stays) find it to be cheaper than Priceline. Watch out for parkings fees if you're going to be road tripping. Hotel parking is almost always more expensive than nearby garages. Although in smaller cities many hotels have free parking.    I visited Australia (including Adelaide, took the Ghan up to Alice Springs) a few years ago for 70 days and also didn't want to miss out. But, well, it was impossible!

I had to carefully study the public transportation system to get to various neighborhoods and I did not venture outside the city.

travel,3d4b6a,wayshegoesboys,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:02:02 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how long you would like to stay in each place. If it were me here is what I would do:  Fly into LA and rent a car. Don't waste too much time in LA as you will be disappointed (2-3 days). Do a day at Disneyland and a day on the beach. A trip to the Channel Islands is a nice way to spend a day near LA as well. It's pretty easy to get a fairy out there. I went cave kayaking and had an awesome experience.  From there, drive to Las Vegas. Las Vegas is a really fun place, but only for about 2 days. It's also expensive, so be smart about your budget. I suggest you stay on the main strip but at a lower priced place (Planet Hollywood or Flamingo). You can walk to most places from there. Also take the time to go downtown, which is different than the strip. After 2 days in Las Vegas, go to the Grand Canyon. If you are in shape, hike down to the bottom. Keep in mind, the hike down is easy, but the hike out is VERY difficult. Stay in that area for the night and then drive back to drop off your car and catch your flight.  San Francisco is the next stop (my favorite city in the US). Use a budget airline for one way fares. Kayak.com does a good job in the US. You will not need a car here. The BART can take you anywhere you need to go. Spend 3-4 days in San Francisco. It is also a very expensive place, so mind your budget and ask for suggestions on how to do it cheaper. Things do to include: Alcatraz tour (one of the coolest I've ever done), Exploratorium, Golden Gate Bridge and Park, wonderful food, and many other things that are easy to find online.  From San Francisco you have a couple of options. I would go to Denver if you want to see mountains and nature. I would go to Chicago is you want to see another big city that is gorgeous (as long as it isn't winter). PM me if you want details on either of these cities.   After some time in either of those (Denver you'll need a car, Chicago you won't), it's time to get to the east coast. Washington DC, New York, and Boston. All of those are accessible by train once you get to that side of the country. I can't even start to explain the number of things you can do, but spend 2 weeks on the East Coast.

Drive to Vegas and spend a couple nights on the strip.  Fly over to Austin and spend a couple nights on 6th Street and hunting down awesome BBQ. Float the Guadalupe river and visit some bars for live music  Drive to New Orleans and spend some time on Bourbon, Frenchmen St and the Casino.  From here you're probably 2 weeks into your trip and it's up to personal preference. Do you want sandy beaches(Florida, South Carolina) or historic city stuff(northeast)  Personally I would fly up to New York and spend a week in NYC, Boston, Philly, D.C etc.  Getting back to the west coast I would probaly drive to Chicago; maybe stop in Pittburgh for a night depending on how long you can drive straight.  Spend a few nights in Chicago and then take your flight back to LA.  Also depending on the time of year I would recommend a couple sporting events.  Septemebr-Novemeber - College football game in the SEC(LSU, Alabama, Auburn, Texas A&M)  April-October - Baseball game at Fenway(Boston), Chicago(Wrigley) or Yankees Stadium(NYC)"

The grand canyon is incredible especially if you see it at sun rise or sunset. I took a guided tour in which a tour leader drove us along the route 66 towards the grand cayon and we stopped at a few famous sites along the way. However there is also the option to take a helicopter ride over the canyon or just drive there yourself :) Vegas is pretty fun, even if your not into gambling its fun to just watch in awe of everything around you! if youre there you have to do on the new york new york rollar coster on the side of one of the buildings!! I visited Washington DC last summer as saw pretty much everything in one day! I got bikes out and rode around visiting all the sites- its a pretty cheap day out! If  i am honest LA is nothing special but I think its a good place to say you have seen and been to!

Top 5 cities (in my admittedly East Coast bias opinion)   West Coast- San Francisco (food, great neighborhoods, great walkability, the coast) South- New Orleans (southern food, music, great walkability) Midwest- Chicago (very different from the first 2, great neighborhoods, on a Great Lake, PIZZA) Northeast - NYC (and I'm leaving out Boston, and I'm a native, but if you do 1 Northeast city, it would be NYC) Midatlantic- Washington DC (free museums, monuments, gobs of history, good public transport and smaller neighborhoods)   Honorable mentions: Boston, Portland/Seattle, Santa Fe, Austin, Savannah, Las Vegas (because it's Vegas).  Must skips- Florida. ALL OF IT. Though I'm assuming you're headed here in the summer. If fall or spring, well maybe.  But you can't come to America without also getting outside, so some top National Parks/Monuments   West- Grand Canyon, and if you go to San Francsico, Redwoods. If you go to Las Vegas, Zion is a good diversion as well Southwest - Carlsbad Caverns and then White Sands (both very unusual) Northeast- Acadia National Park (stunning views, tons of hiking, seafood) Midwest but really North- Glacier National Park and Yellowstone   If pressed, I would say focus in 3 areas -LA/Vegas/National Parks, NYC/DC (easy to commute between the two on bus/train) though for major outdoor space... hmmm... could drive to Boston from NYC, then go up to Maine to Acadia, and then pick a city in the South or Southwest.

If you decide to fly, check connecting cities, if you're prepared to waste a couple more hours/a day traveling time you can save a lot of money by going for example BOSTON -> WASH DC -> NYC instead of BOSTON -> NYC. That being said, there are plenty of trains and buses, just be aware that a lot of the bus stations seem to always be in the shady area of town. Try not to arrive at night.  One day I'd like to rent/buy a car and do the whole roadtrip thing. If you can get your hands on a camper or van, I'd suggest buying some tents and sleeping at campsites on the way and doing the national park roads. Though it will be harder to see the big cities this way. It depends on what you want to see and do.  If you want to do a month trip I would suggest start in LA (Disneyland and Universal Studios), travel to San Francisco and Las Vegas (Grand Canyon), head up to Wyoming and/or Colorado where you can do Yellowstone National Park and/or the Rocky Mountains, go back down to New Orleans, up to Washington DC, Boston and finish in NYC. Optional cities on the way would be Austin, Portland, Memphis, and Orlando (where Disneyworld is, which while amazing will cost you a lot more)."

I went to a pagoda in Ninh Binh Vietnam, after i took the stairs to the top (perfectly clean), i decided to go down again to take some photos of the lovely cave altar, meanwhile i saw some chinese tourists going up and coming down again after 10 minutes, i went up again, and couldnt believe my eyes, cola cans everywhere, plastic bottles and food wrap thrown on the ground. Thats the reality, people dont give a shit."

It absolutely doesn't.  To the people that are opening their country to visitors, bad tourist behavior 20 years ago is still exactly as offensive to them, their country and their culture as bad tourist behavior is now.  I also don't think this notion that, ""gap year, and teens,"" is an excuse either.  Don't get me wrong, I think the great majority of tourists are very well behaved, very mindful of cultural sensitivities, and truly do want to experience a place with as much respect as possible.  The issue is that it's the lowest hanging fruit that always is where comparisons begin, and where automatic presumptions tend to sway.  Those presumptions are what leads to less respect overall for not just tourists, but expats, and anyone that's deemed foreign.    I always encourage anyone that goes anywhere to remember that they are representing their countries, as much as they are enjoying another.  But more than just that, they are representing their fellow travelers and foreign residents as well.  It may not affect everyone to a huge degree, but, there is some trickle down for every bit of bad press and every moment of bad behavior.  The news of this stuff has always happened in the places where stupid shit goes down...the only difference now is that it's also broadcast globally."

Every generation before us has done everything they could to give their children the easiest lives possible and with that comes the sub concious mentality of a lack of respect. Me personally I grew up in a home where yes sir, no sir, yes ma'am, no ma'am was the end all be all. Maybe it's just me but as I've gotten older I've seen more disrespect than I have respect for others when it comes to property, authority, and difference of opinion. For example police officers. When I was a child and even as an adult police were to be respected. Same with the POTUS. It's hard to grasp that mentality of ""F**k the police"" as an entirety just because a few of them are ignorant A holes but I think it's not just one issue it's the issue as a whole. When your parents teach you respect for others as in ""Don't act like a moron in a public setting"" such as a hotel in another country or a historic monument you carry that with you as an adult. But when you have a society that goes from ""I WILL SMACK THE CRAP OUT OF YOU IF YOU DON'T GET DOWN OFF OF THAT RIGHT NOW"" to ""Ok Jeffrey that's a no no"" with no understanding of punishment for your actions then you see how society shifts as more and more people being entitled to doing or saying whatever they want without understanding of any repercussions comes into play.

There is a misconception that negative reinforcement works, because the punished starts to behave again after punishment, but this is actually due to a statistical, probabilistic process called ""regression to the mean."" In actual fact positive reinforcement is much more effective in producing desired behavior.  As to the police, the disrespect you see for them today comes from a recognition that they are essentially a corrupt gang that represent rule of arms rather than a genuine, just, and democratic rule of law. The government whose will they carry out through force of arms is corrupt, undemocratic, and illegitimate; and so of course their foot soldiers' so-called authority is called illegitimate and they themselves are considered corrupt.

Haarlem - wonderful street shopping, and a huge old windmill, plus it's close to the beach; there's a bar west of the town center inside an old church! (Jopenkerk--great beer there)  The Hague - definitely visit the Mauritshuis museum if you enjoy the Rijksmuseum/Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, there are several famous Vermeers and Rembrants there; the most imposing buildings are all governmental and not really accessible; usually there is not much to do in the city center at night, not even that much in terms of food  Delft - street shopping and historic streetcapes to rival Haarlem but with its added history as a Dutch craft center; university town so there's lots of unexpected night fun, if you can find it; it might actually be better to stay in Delft and commute to The Hague (rather than the other way around) since Delft has more to see by foot and the two cities are connected by the same streetcar network  Rotterdam - the most urban Dutch city; expect great architecture and nightlife in the city center but little to no pre-WWII historical relics  Antwerp - wonderful city to walk around, almost looks like a Belgian version of Paris; its best assets are its shopping, modern art museums, and the fashion district; has its own vice district, which is bound to have great clubs & bars  Ghent - unexpectedly wonderful food, a great canal promenade, and an impressive castle (the Gravensteen) which I recommend visiting if you want to dip into Flanders' medieval history  Bruges - spend at least 1 day, if you can; Bruges has the best town squares, ancient canals, church towers, and museums of Flemish art; the town center has more cheese, chocolate, bread, and antique stores than you can count, plus a chocolate museum; I believe if you visit on the right day you can tour the farmer's market in Markt square and hear morning carillon concerts underneath the tower there  I never saw Utrecht or Leiden in person, but I hear they are just as wonderful as Delft and Haarlem. Utrecht is the oldest large city in the Netherlands and has worthwhile, truly ancient medieval buildings. If you're American, Leiden might uniquely interest you since the Plymouth Pilgrims actually originated from this town before they sailed from England.  The best nightlife in the whole region is probably in Amsterdam. Don't feel ashamed to visit the red light district when you visit, some of the best food and bars are actually there.

Iceland Air should check your bag through to Amsterdam unless you take the opportunity for a stopover inj Reykjavik. Ask about that when checking your bag at Seattle.  Check both airlines carry-on rules; they may be different."

travel,3d6yc3,WhiteFrankBlack,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"Africa in general isn't very budget friendly... with few exceptions (Ethiopia, Tunisia) and there's not much backpacking culture other than South Africa.     The 'coolest' areas require permits and guides because of uprisings by Tuaregs and various al-Qaida groups controlling large parts of the Sahara.  It's also a huge desert and you're likely to get lost without a guide.  Tourists getting kidnapped is bad press.  What little tourism there was in the Sahara has collapsed in the last few years.  So that makes arranging anything very expensive.  Niger is no different... the 'interesting' parts Air Mountains and Tenere have been off limits for several years, even Agadez is difficult to visit.  You can visit around Niamey with no problems generally.  I was in Chad and Niger a few months ago and  I didn't need a LOI for the visa for either country.  Burkina Faso is probably the easiest one to visit, but it's more Sahel than true Sahara."

travel,3d6sio,tariqabjotu,3,Tue Jul 14 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"Oakland has a bad reputation, but it's really not that bad in the downtown areas or by Lake Merritt. Just putting in a random September weekend, I see a Marriott in downtown Oakland for about $150/night. Nice hotel and right next to BART, just two stops (<10 minutes) into San Francisco."
travel,3d6sio,CharlieKillsRats,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"The Marriott there is actually pretty nice.  It still takes bit to get into the city, you have to get to from the bart, buy tickets, wait for a train, etc. and it costs $7rt per person. AND then that just takes you to Embarcadero, Powell St. or Civic Center, THEN you need to get around to wherever in the city  so if the price of staying in the  city is only $200 USD or so then its better to stay in the city. Take everything into account.    ALSO the bart stops at 1230AM -- so if you're out and drunk, which you will be, you need to cab from the bar, to the bart station around midnight, just to make sure you don't get left in the city and have an expensive ass cab ride back  Whatever you choose is fine, just understand to include all aspects, not just cash, in your decision."
travel,3d6sio,tariqabjotu,3,Tue Jul 14 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, ten minutes is just travel time. And I agree that if the difference is something like that, it would be worth it to stay in the city. Really, if $160 is the budget the OP is going for, I think they can find something close to that in the city. When the word ""hostels"" popped up, I was worried they were going for <$80 or something, in which case, it's a definite no dice.  Really, in this situation, Airbnb is probably the best option. I would never go on a trip and stay outside the desired city unless I was on a serious budget, and $160/night doesn't strike me as a serious budget, even in San Francisco."

Granted, from a quick glance at reviews, they're gonna be rather basic, dated, and/or not that nice, though a lot of it depends on your desired comfort levels.  Avoid staying in the Tenderloin and the area a bit south of there; Mission and 6th St. is kind of sketchy central.  Granted, not all of the area is sketchy, and there are some good bars/restaurants in the area, but visiting for a meal/evening is different from staying there for a week (or whatever).  A block's distance can make a difference.  Rates in general are on the high side, but when there is a big conference in town (which happens periodically - the biggest are when various tech companies hold their world wide conferences here), rooms can really fill up and rates can jump quite a bit.  If your dates are flexible, you may want to check other weeks/days in case there's a conference."

travel,3d4q4d,jamafam,5,Mon Jul 13 14:40:57 2015 UTC,One thing to note is that in early January it will be quite dark in Lapland. Depending on the latitude you might get 2-4 hours of daylight per day or even none at all. Then again that can be quite pretty as well.  In Svalbard the sun sets in early October and won't rise again until March. So I guess it would be pitch black all the time in early January.  I've been to Finnish Lapland quite a few times for downhill & cross-country skiing but it's mostly been in late February/early March since it's a bit warmer and a lot brighter then. The Ylläs region has more than 300km of well maintained cross-country skiing tracks and it's just 50km from the Kittilä airport.

In the next few days, try to do things in the morning that are like what you would normally do at home to start your day. Like if you usually wake up and have a cup of coffee at home, research a cute local cafe with a great view of the city you're in to do the same thing you would do at home, but with a new (and relaxing) atmosphere. I usually run in the mornings, so even on vacation, that is how I'll start my day. It helps the day feel normalized, even if I'm in a new place. My other advice would be to don't push yourself too much, if your friend is go-go-go and you'd rather relax for some of the day, let him/her do their own thing and take some me time. Don't feel like you have to do everything. You have a whole month after all! Research is key too, to make sure you know where you want to go and what you want to see the most.

Let your friend know that you need a few days to adjust.  It is possible that even after you adjust, you and your travel companion will still have a conflicting idea of traveling.  It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you.  He/she might have a more high energy travel style while yours is lower.  This wouldn't be ideal, but you will both need to compromise.  You will need to push yourself a little, and they will need to add in a little more resting time.    I remember being very overwhelmed several times on my first major trip.

travel,3d66dh,valeyard89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"No ferries to Greenland, and you'll have to get to Denmark to catch the ferry.  It will take 5-6 days total from the UK if you go that route, and not particularly cheap.   The ferry alone is 260 Euro in high season, one-way, and that doesn't include meals."

Rome is very tourist friendly, if not a super confused/hectic city, but you will have fun.    In Italy you usually do not tip, or just round up. Places used to tourists though have learned to start expecting tips from customers who do not know any different."
travel,3d478o,PoptartsRShit,2,Mon Jul 13 11:50:29 2015 UTC,"Bring good walking shoes.   At the Vatican I thought paying 5 euros to climb to the top was well worth it for the great view.   For the Colosseum and the Roman Forums I would download Rick Steve's podcast that gives you a guided tour and great information about the sites. Also, since you are going alone this will be really nice and gives you some direction instead of walking around not knowing what you're looking at.  For the Vatican museum I just tried to blend in with other tour groups and listen in.   Definitely hang out at Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps at night.   Trevi Fountain is another popular destination.   For tipping just round up. Learn how to say Hello, Please, Thank you, Excuse me, and Goodbye.   Please, please go to Pizzarium. It was featured on one of Anthony Bourdain's shows and it is incredible. Really incredible pizza with so many different types.   I also went a saw Lazio play, if you are into football. It was fairly cheap and a cool experience.   Edit: Also, hate to be that guy but please just search Rome in the subreddit before asking. Super popular destination with tons of recommendations on here. I don't want to diminish discussion, but there is a wealth knowledge already on here."

When you encounter vendors on the street and at popular tourist destinations, just ignore them but they are very persistent. If you do see a souvenir you like, you can bargain.   I was in Rome last month and the Trevi fountain was under construction. Not sure if this is still the case. Good call for getting the tickets to the major spots in advance. Saved us hours of time as well. I assume you will go to the Colosseum during the day - but make sure you return at night (even for just walking around, not going inside). There will be much less people, and they light it up so it's nice and pretty for photos. At the Vatican make sure you dress relatively conservatively (covered shoulders, no low-cut shirts, shorts/skirts past your knees) or you may be turned away.   Make sure you try the gelato!"

Ostia Antiqua - Rome's old port city - easy access via a commuter train  Hadrian's Villa - Palace complex of Emperor Hadrian - just outside the city in Tivoli - you will take a bus for this one.

Expect Chinese or Western meal options offered during meal time (hint get the Chinese meal it's way better). Movies etc on the headrest, power plug and such.  Wine/beer/coffee/tea is offered almost non-stop the whole flight. Leg room is the same as any other major airline in economy.   I've always been able to select my seats online at their website, you can always do it at check in as well though, it won't matter much which seat you're in at your size.   Almost every long haul transpacific flight I've taken with them had had tons of open seats as well.   Note: you can book stopovers in Taiwan for a nominal  fee.

After another trip, I realized I was happiest living abroad. Again, not that my homeland was depressing me per se - although there are many things I dislike about that part of the world - it's that the stimulation from living in a new place makes me happy.

So I'd say that was the first seed, thinking travel was normal, but I don't think I ever would have been as adventurous.

Loved it, and met some people on their RTW trips, which I was rather jealous of and sounded awesome.

I think you should do no more than 4 cities, which will leave you time to actually get a feel for the place and have more leisurely travel times in between.

My understanding is it is a little like booking through a hotel website, but you will be staying in a privately-owned home. You coordinate with the host about arrival/departure times, and none of the money physically passes between anyone. The website handles the transactions and any complaints. I'd recommend reading up on the airbnb help center as they can explain much more in depth than I could."
travel,3d5u93,jamethiel,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"I've used AirBnB in three different countries now.  It seems too good to be true, but frankly, it works.  We got a home to ourselves within a mile of the Vatican for $100/night.  I know it seems scary the first time you book (I was a bit leery), but generally the hosts are pretty good about sending you a confirmation email and letting you know how/when they'll get you access to the apartment.  They're friendly and will answer questions.  It's really a great service if you're traveling in a group."
travel,3d5u93,jamethiel,2,Mon Jul 13 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of destinations.  I'd suggest cutting at least one, although it's going to depend on what you're looking to get out of the trip.  My PERSONAL opinion...cut Venice.  It looks like you're flying out of there, not sure if it's too late to change that.  Venice is kind of like an adult theme park in my mind.  Not much of it felt authentic. It's tiny streets are filled with chain stores and all of the businesses seem to be geared towards serving the tourist industry.  I just didn't get much out of it.  But that's just my take on Venice.  I also notice you have 3 days in Prague, versus two everywhere else.  Virtually all of these cities could be 3 day destinations, just curious about the decision to spend the extra night in Prague.  It's a wonderful city, but you also only have one day in London, which is definitely worthy of much longer than a single day. The cost of London may be the limiting factor there, however.  And finally, I'm not sure if you've looked up transit times on some of these train rides, but they could be quite long. It doesn't necessarily look like you've budgeted extra transit time between cities, so I'm assuming the travel time will be coming out of your vacation time.  Showing up for the train a little early, then riding the rail and getting to and from your hotel/hostel is going to eat up 4-8 hours at least.  That's a pretty hefty chunk of change to take out of your day when you're only planning 2 days in a city.  Yet another reason to consider cutting a city...or two.  EDIT: Also...that's not really a lot of train trips.  You might want to look into the point-to-point pricing before simply settling on a pass.  It could be cheaper to simply buy 5 train tickets.  Second EDIT: I'm bored and was curious.  A quick google maps search confirms it.  At least four of your train trips are coming in around 8 hours...and that's just time on the train.  Again, add an hour on either end for getting to and from the station. Add another hour on either end to get situated in your hotel (packed/unpacked, checked in/checked out) and you're looking at 12 hours of transit time for each leg.  You just lost an entire day for each of those train trips (assuming we add 8 hours for sleep)."
travel,3d5u93,jamethiel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! This is just the preliminary kind of plan I have written up. I didn't even think about the travel times affecting the vacation time as a whole. You were spot on with London though. I just hear horror stories of how expensive that city is especially with how the exchange rate is right now with the British pound (I'm American). Honestly, the extra day in Prague was because I've heard that its gorgeous and the information says that its pretty cheap. I work at a job with a lot of foreign staff from Europe and a lot of people recommend Prague because it is such a beautiful city. Would a visit to Amsterdam be worth it? Cost is the main limiting factor but a few extra days in Europe would be worth it. On the Venice thing, I've always wanted to visit Italy and it just seemed the logical destination based on the route we would be taking. Thank you so much!"
travel,3d5u93,jamethiel,2,Mon Jul 13 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Not a problem.  This definitely looks preliminary, hopefully we can help you with some of this.  I'm also an American, but I lived in Europe for a while and have taken a lot of trips back there.   The first thing I think you need to ask yourself is what you want out of the trip. Are you there to party? See history? See art? Soak up the local culture?  I know that it's tempting to simply say ""YES!"" to all of these, but you're going to have to settle on something as your main goal here.  Two weeks sounds like a lot of time, but when you're traveling, it's going to fly.  Decide on what you're going to accomplish, that will help with which cities you should add/subtract.  As for cost.  You said that there will be 4-5 of you.  My recommendation is to use AirBnB.  Hostels will be cheap...BUT, with Airbnb you can potentially rent a place for $100-200 and split the cost among the group.  I did this on a trip through Italy and it was awesome.  I loved the places I stayed. The locations were WAY better than hotels that I could afford. ALSO, you (potentially, depending on the place you rent) will have access to a washer/dryer and kitchen.  This means you can pack/carry less clothes. It also means you can buy some groceries and cook for yourself to cut down on meals."
travel,3d5u93,jamethiel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"I think I need to sit down with my friends and really get a feel for what we are thinking of doing. This is kinda like a ""graduating college last hurrah"" kinda thing but I know several of us aren't going to want to party all the time. I'd say its like a see history/party kinda thing. I've never left the US and literally almost everything here isn't older than 200 years old. Going to Europe I'll be able to see loads of historical sites that you really don't get a chance to here. I'll definitely look into AirBnB, that sounds like a lot of fun and cost effective. I know I would love to have a washer and dryer."
travel,3d5u93,TreefingerX,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely get back with your friends. =)  Sounds like you have some work to do, but planning can sometimes be half the fun of any trip.  One thing you can do that my friends and I did is split up the trip.  Maybe pick one city per person and each person becomes the official/unofficial group ""host"" for that city.  It becomes their responsibility to research the city, choose a place to stay, and pick the sights to see.  This can break up the research and lets each of you play ""guest"" and ""host"" in a city that you feel particularly connected to.  If you're going as a historical tour with some partying (and taking into account that it's your first trip so you probably aren't going to be able to talk yourselves out of the ""must see"" destinations), I like Berlin. I really don't like Venice (particularly if you're on a budget).  Rome would seem like an obvious choice.  You can't necessarily go wrong with London and Paris.  Prague is good.  I'd consider Amsterdam heavily.  Just don't try to do them all.  Europe will be there for another trip back.  Don't try to squeeze so much into one trip that you get nothing out of it because you spend all of your time on trains and running around from point A to B.  I personally love London, but if you're only staying for a day, it hardly seems worth it.  That said, it is the cheapest entry point to Europe.  Still, consider flying into Paris or Frankfurt. It'll cost just a bit more, but you'll save time.  And when you're in Europe, time is definitely money.  And also, trains may not be your best bet.  For a multi-city trip in two weeks, consider flights.  Easyjet and Ryanair are pretty cheap. In some cases, it's cheaper to fly than it is to ride the train.  And it can certainly be faster.  One last thing to consider...lines.  If you're going at the end of spring/start of summer, the lines will be long.  VERY long.  We're talking hours to get into the Louvre. Literally more than a mile of humanity just to get into the Vatican. Plan ahead and schedule reserved tours when possible.  Look into travel cards like that you can buy from the local tourist boards that give you access to ""reservation only"" lines, which are generally shorter. These cards will also give you discounted or free access to lots of destinations.  They cost money, but are very worth it."
travel,3d5u93,williemorris,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"I still have a ton of planning to do :/ I like the idea of multiple hosts and splitting up the planning though. London does sound like a blast, and if we can find a nice place on AirBnB that'll keep costs down too. Flying into London cheap sounds pretty nice as well. There is just so much to see in so little time, also coordination everyone's schedules is annoying as well. One last thing, will lines be as bad in Mid to late May as they are during the summer? I'm hoping we could beat the lines but perhaps there is no way around that."

What is it about your iPhone (what model do you have?) that makes you want better quality?  The best answer as to a replacement will hinge on this.  The current iPhone's 8 MP camera will give you excellent prints all the way up to about 20"" x 30"" inches.  A high-end point and shoot like the Sony RX100 # series can get you excellent prints up to 30"" x 40"" or so.  If you're an average traveler you're likely putting photos on facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc and perhaps printing out some 5x7s.  The iPhone is entirely sufficient for this, and you can't beat the form factor.  If you ""need"" something else, please explain where specifically your iPhone falls short if you want a recommendation."

travel,3d3mkb,maverique,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"I moved from a D80 with a 18-200 lens to using a prime 50mm lens.  That was the big shift for me.  Might be a good way to test drive using a prime lens for less of an initial investment since you already have a body. Moving from a prime lens to a X100 (not S. now they even have a T version) was a great transition.  I miss the versatility of the big lens sometimes but have just adapted my ""eye"" instead.  I dream of a M9 with an arsenal of lenses but this Fuji does the trick for now."
travel,3d3mkb,kickstand,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"The only one I can really think of is that you're locked into using a prime lens, for me its not a huge deal since I prefer prime but to some people it may be an issue.   X100 series also doesn't have the best battery life its a good idea to have two for longer days."
travel,3d3mkb,rounded_figure,2,Mon Jul 13 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"I use a Pentax K3 DSLR with two lenses (18-135mm and 10-20mm). I think their bodies are pretty small compared to Canon/Nikon  I have a pretty good daypack which my camera fits into well and has easy side access without having to take the bag off. I also have a couple of camera handbags which also carries them quite easily as well my purse, phone etc.  I think a lot of comes down how are you going to carry your camera around. If it's going to take you 5 minutes to get your camera out because you have to take your bag off, undo a million straps and rifle through it then it won't matter what size or type of camera you've got - it will be far too much effort to get it out and use it.  This was my camera bag when I went to Tokyo - carried my DSLR, 3 lenses, wallet, phone, water bottle, chapstick. I used my camera so much, simply because it was super easy to access it as well as change lenses as needed.

If you're only publishing your photos on digital media, you won't need RAWs -- which require a helluva lot of storage space btw. If you don't need RAWs, then leave the DSLR at home -- it's bulky and you can get very good quality shots with lighter cameras.

They don't have the 180-day ""Stay gone"" limitation, and other Schengen countries must honor the stamp they give you. This is known as ""The Polish Loophole"". Poland wants to have Americans come and visit or do business in Poland. As of last year, it was still an option. If this has somehow changed and restrictions are tighter now, it's news to me (I got a long-term Visa so I no longer need to do it this way).   Edit: See the summary I found here. There is an outstanding bilateral agreement between Poland and the U.S. from 1991 which predates the Schengen Area travel rules. Poland is a sovereign nation and it can have its own Schengen Rules, which is why entering or exiting Schengen through a Polish airport will refresh your tourist visa. They have an exemption for Americans. Granted you don't need to listen to me.

I didn't get an actual work permit/long stay visa until I'd lived in Europe for over a year. I left every 90 days for a weekend trip outside Schengen and always returned without a hiccup. The only time I was denied re-entry was when I had a connection on my return flight through Vienna and Austrian Immigration said I wasn't allowed back in Schengen (this was in Istanbul). So I re-booked through Frankfurt and they gave me a stamp with no problem. It was expensive, sure, but if it was illegal, I highly doubt the Germans of all people would've given me a stamp.

travel,3d3x25,theadamvine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:09:23 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. U.S. citizens can stay for 90 days at a time in Poland. There is no 180 day rule - you can exit for one day and come back for another 90 days.   But that is a Polish rule, not a Schengen one. As Poland is part of the Schengen area, other Schengen countries will count time spent in Poland for their application of the rule. And they will apply the 180 day part. So you can't spend more than 90 out of 180 days in Schengen if you want to visit countries other than Poland. The only slight loophole is that if you've already spent 90 days in Schengen you can exit and reenter Poland straight away. But you can only stay in Poland.   The part about other countries must ""honour the stamp"" from Poland is wrong. Schengen countries don't honour each other's visas like that. The stamp will show the date you entered Poland and therefore the date you entered the Schengen area. Practically you won't get caught because there are no routine passport checks within Schengen but that doesn't make it legal."

I have found that travelers are overly invested in what they do or have done.  As a result they rate things as either an amazing 10 out of 10 or a miserable 1 out of 10.  All I ever hear from travelers is that a place was the greatest, or it was the worst place ever.  No one seems willing to admit that they went to a place that was just alright, 3-8 out of 10.  Too often I hear people talking about, or suggesting on a site like this, that others visit a certain place because it was so amazing when my personal experience tells me there are better options nearby.  I believe people leave reviews, or suggest locations, mostly to validate their own trip there.  They don't want to admit to themselves that they went somewhere that was just ok, but love having a story about hell on earth.  As a result I think guide books, for the same reasons you listed, are better at guiding you towards a location.  It is best though to set them aside after arrival and find what you want though."

But also before I go I like to look at things online too as I find the guide book doesn't have activities that usually interest me. I like the top ten places to see, and hotels and such, but my personal interests are never covered in the book (are anyone's?) so I like to look up places to visit online as well. I do overall prefer the guide book however.

travel,3d496i,exptl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"So as one of the founders of a guidebook (well its online only currently but still) for South Africa, thought I'd chip in :)  First things first, I use online review sites ALL the time myself as a way to keep up to date on what's buzzing where, and to keep an eye on whether things I've deemed ""worthy"" in the past have taken a turn for the worst, or (rarely, unfortunately) whether a bum venue has gone golden. So, for someone who has driven 30,000km around South Africa over the pats 3 years, the 'opinion of the masses' sites do have genuine value, despite all the spam / crud / fakes you have to wade through.  However, your gut feel is spot on. Here's another example - trying to see the Big 5 if you're based in Cape Town. There are a few experiences available that are within reasonable driving distance, and they all put huge efforts into their marketing so the game photos that you will see online are beautiful... some of them also have great customer service... but the pure geography of the Western Cape doesn't make for a great safari experience. Most importantly, the bush is largely ankle height shrubbery, as opposed to the beautifully lush head-height thickets that you typically see on documentaries, so you have lower game numbers, and they kind of look like they've just been glued onto the earth instead of roaming their natural habitat. This is very roughly phrased; game used to be here naturally 100 years ago, etc. etc., but my point is that if you're coming to South Africa as a first timer you'll be told that you have to see Cape Town and do a safari, and it is easy to find good reviews of 'safari experiences' based out of Cape Town but this would definitely not be the right thing to do!  I am not saying that guidebooks are the only way to go, much as I want to because I'd like to think that I'm simply amazing at recommending things to people :-P Unfortunately, mass review sites and aggregators have taken a huge slice out of the market, and there simply isn't enough revenue to go around for hands on guide services to truly get in depth info on the lay of the land anymore. For example, my experience comes from 20 years of exploring S.A. with my family using every spare cent my dad made in his finance job. If we'd tried to fund our 'research' out of the business, we'd have gone bust in year 1 (also, we'd be 20 years behind)!  As a rough metric, we use about 500 recommended venues to cover all of South Africa - in order to ensure those venues are still up to standard a year later, we'd have to have 2 people spending every working day of their year sleeping in a different venue! And then we have 2, 500 recommended activities... Having 12 people on the road every working day of the year would add up Very quickly! :-)  So your best info sources are guys who really got familiar with a place during the glory days when guidebooks still made all the money, and unfortunately their knowledge is quickly becoming outdated, or it's hybrid services. For example, having launched our business just as the aggregators ploughed into the South African market, we had to immediately pivot our model, and we now have volumes amounts of hands-on research on the site, but for granular info like ""How good is xnx Bed and Breakfast at the moment"", we read masses of online reviews to stay current.  I personally think the biggest value that guide services can add are to cut through the clutter for you as a  traveller  - yes, there isn't enough revenue available for us to review every place worth seeing regularly enough to really be the 'ultimate authority' but with all our experience, we have a far better 'gut feel' of the landscape than your average internet traveller, and given that we're in the industry, we're usually checking reviews often anyway. So a guidebook can entertain, inspire, and guide, but will never be fully functional in isolation of review services and automated aggregators."

You could consider wearing longer socks under looser jeans to keep more of your legs covered.

Thankfully the only expense was the 10% fee for sorting out a postal order, so it cost me a tenner just to send them the money in a valid format.   Seems kinda pointless, they should just do what they do in the states and take your fingerprints on your first entry into the country at the airport, then it's stored on the database and it's convenient for everyone involved.

I ran to it and put my hand in between the doors to trigger them to open back up.  Turns out that older buildings in Singapore don't have elevators with sensors like I'm used to in the states.  The doors closed, luckily, on my watch.  They started squealing, pressing in.  I was totally stuck and couldn't yank my arm free no matter how hard I pulled, but have a big watch face that held the doors open enough to not crush my wrist.  I was too embarrassed to call out for help and didn't think it was a big deal at all at the time.  I had steel-toe shoes on and put the toe of my shoe between the doors and stood up, putting my weight on the foot and twisting it.  This opened the door a millimeter or so, but it was enough to free me and I fell backwards onto my butt.  The next day, I was telling people about my ""funny embarrassing story"" and found out that just a couple weeks earlier, a similar thing happened to a dude from India, only he didn't have my lucky watch.

Then we see a police checkpoint. They pull us over, ask for papers. I was with a a polish guy at the time. He sees my Mexican passport and tells me to step outside. Polish guy gets a pass. I get off. He asks me why I'm in Honduras, ""just transiting to El Salvador"", I say. He studies me. ""You're Mexican, right? I hear they kill cops there. Didn't they just kill a few?"", he asks. ""I really don't know. I stopped watching the news."", I tried to sound apologetic. ""How much you got on you?"" he asked with a very threatening tone. I quickly reply with only what I had on my wallet, ""$10 US and $20 lempiras"". He laughed. It figured he wanted a bribe. I have my iPhone 5 in my pocket. That would surely buy my way out, right? ""That's it? Hopefully you can get more once you cross the boarder. Enjoy your trip, stay safe."" He said. I was about to shit my pants. I'd heard terrible things about Honduras and we were on the road to Tegucigalpa, so I figured all of the police/army had some sort of corruption going on.  Again in Honduras, on my way to Copan Ruinas. I totally fucked up, didn't read how often buses ran to Santa Rosa and I'm stuck in some small town. The chicken bus/van empties and I try to ask the driver for alternatives. He picks up my accent and says ""I was there once, on my way to the US. Fuckers deported me, but I wanna go back. I rode the train, you know? Mexicans were assholes to all of us. But I still want to go back. You know how I could get there? I heard it's tough."" I really have no idea how immigration works into my country and I told him so. He then picks up 2 friends. He tells them where I'm from and share a laugh. Then he strikes with the most frightening thing I've heard, sounded right out of a movie. ""You know, I've heard that if you get a passport from a Mexican, there's people on San Pedro Sula who can change their picture to yours. Maybe that's how I can get in."" Then looks at me through the rear view mirror. Maybe he was fucking with me. Maybe he was serious. I'm not sure. I really thought about throwing my passport out the window. He then dropped me off at a ""safe hotel"" in that town. I got up the stairs, waited for him to leave and went to a different hotel. I didn't want him knowing where I was gonna stay."

There were a few harrowing moments but I could handle it.   However at one section they were doing road construction on one side of the freeway, and directed traffic to share the other side. Except there wasn't any notice or sign for the other side that there would suddenly be a whole freeway coming at them on their side from the other direction.

On the Fimmvorduhals Hike from Skogar to Thorsmork.  25 km over a 1050 mtr high mountain, between two glaciers. Most of the time a beautiful hike without much difficulties.   But there is one problem: Snow. At some points 6 meters of Snow. This year Iceland had the most snow in over 30 years and one of the coldest Springs/June.  I did the hike with two guys (Father and Son) from Canada.   The first day was a bit rainy but we had good clothing so no real problem. We stayed in one of the huts on the top and planed to continue down the next day. In the evening a young brit came into the hut and after some talks we agreed that he should join us on our way down. The morning comes and weather is just terrible. Maybe 10 meter visibility, rain and very strong wind. After we waited a few hours to let it clear up a bit and a group of people came into the hut who started the hike in Thorsmork we went outside the first time. Followed the first three markers....and couldn't see/find the fourth. Went back inside and waited a few more hours.   Visibility was good and the first 15-20 minutes went well. Then things got bad.Weather changed again and somehow the brit got lost. First the son went to search for him and I continued with the father. After some time the son catched up to us, without the brit.  While we waited some more my feet started to get really cold and I needed to get of the mountain. Father and son stayed a bit longer to look for the brit and I went ahead alone. Meanwhile visibility changed from this to this The footsteps I was following slowly got fewer and fewer up to the point that there were no more and I was walking about 30 minutes through the snow witouth seeing any footprints or markers.  Over narrow passages like this one till I finally came across a marker again and not much later was rewarded with this beautiful view .  In the end the brit somehow got in front of the two canadins looking for him and they found each other shortly befor the end of the hike.

travel,3d2qxl,AzorAhey,3,Mon Jul 13 01:36:32 2015 UTC,"If you want a purely Southeast Asian experience, why don't you skip HK* and go to Bangkok? It's a fantastic city. Thailand was never colonized so the culture is very intact and it's great to see a real Southeast Asian modern city. From there you can check out the country's amazing beaches or visit Cambodia/Vietnam. Also think about Indonesia, which has beautiful beaches. Flights around the region are cheap so you can visit a lot of countries.  And if you want very cheap and beautiful beaches, why not the Philippines? If you visit the Philippines, skip the capital and go to amazing places like Coron, Palawan, or any of the other 7000 islands. You can easily rent a boat and go island-hopping. English is a second language, the locals are friendly, and the food is great. (I may be biased here as I'm Filipino but I love our beaches!)  *I'm not a huge fan of HK because the locals are so rude, the city is polluted, and there's not really much to do besides shopping. The food is good but you'll easily find Chinese food in Western countries; I think it's harder to find an authentic SE Asian restaurant outside of SE Asia. So in my humble opinion, I think you're better off skipping HK."

After submitting this we looked into flights more as those do need to be booked sooner rather than later and going back and forth to Hong Kong just doesn't seem to make much sense. Still may spend a day or so as there are not many non stop flights from the states but who knows Maybe we will skip it as there are great places like the Philippines that keep getting added to the list.  So I absolutely hate to be that guy but what are you must see/do places?
travel,3d2qxl,NetworkMeter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:34:38 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to do is pick an island/cluster of islands you want to visit. At these towns, you can arrange for a bangka ride. These can be private or with a couple other tourists. Sometimes there's an itinerary and you'll visit specific islands with little activities in each (a lake in one, a hill with an amazing view in another, waterfalls at another island, caves, etc). Other times, the captain asks you what you want to do and he'll take it from there. This is pretty affordable and it's a lovely way to explore different islands. I recommend Coron or El Nido. I know these pics look photoshopped but if you go on a typical sunny day, that's what it actually looks like. In Coron, you can snorkel around shipwrecks that sank in shallow water, you can go scuba diving, you can go island-hopping, and you can swim in this amazingly clear lake. El Nido has a lot of beautiful little islands and lagoons and you can visit like 5 in one day.  My other favorite thing to do in the Philippines is to swim with butanding or whale sharks. There is nothing as breathtaking as swimming with a huge whale in the middle of the ocean. You feel so small next to them! You can do this in Oslob or Donsol (check their migration patterns though).  PS: Skip Manila. It's dirty, polluted, and confusing."
travel,3d2qrx,comeatmebreau,2,Mon Jul 13 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"I was only in Argentina for a few days, but it was definitely an interesting phenomenon to see their strong preference for the US dollars everywhere we went.  Even at non-tourist restaurants they were eager to accept US dollars and usually lowered the bill a bit if we paid with dollars instead of pesos... after all, they've dropped off 13 zeros from their currency just since 1970, so who knows what the peso will be tomorrow.  Interesting dilemma you have with wanting to continue to convert 'cash' through the unofficial system, but being there for too long to just bring enough cash with you.  If nothing else, you could just use XOOM in smaller increments and hope for the best... even if you lose a payment sometimes, it would still be made up for by the fact that you're converting at better than the official rate."

travel,3d3iel,jippiejee,2,Mon Jul 13 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that the easiest and least stressful route would be via Italy.   But if you are determined to go via the Balkan region, there are other options. IIRC there is a ferry from Rhodes to Turkey, which would then allow you to travel north to Istanbul. From Istanbul to Germany should then be pretty straightforward.   For basic info see http://www.seat61.com/Turkey.htm and http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de  Sadly the train line from Istanbul to Sophia is disconnected, there is bus service that covers the route, but information is hard to find and travel times are unpredictable. So no guarantee that you will be able to catch connecting trains out of Bulgaria.   Alternatively you could take the ferry to Athens and then go north from Athens. This would avoid the trouble with the train out of Istanbul. http://www.seat61.com/Greece.htm  There is also a direct bus service from Istanbul to Germany in the summer, see the eurolines.de website. The next bigger city to Gmünd is Köln (Cologne), tickets from Istanbul to Cologne cost 174 EUR.

It's a really beautiful city with so much incredible history. Your itinerary already looks pretty tight though! You really don't want to be so rushed that you can't enjoy anything and end up spending half your time on a bus.   Not sure if this would work for you or not, but something to consider is cutting down on time in Split. It's just honestly not that great. It's nice, but it's not nearly as beautiful as Dubrovnik and the beaches aren't even close to Hvar's. It's doesn't really do anything as fantastically as the other places on your itinerary.

They're designed for solo travellers or groups of two and are so, so social. Activities planned every day and night that a lot of guests get involved with. It's part of a group of other hostels like Retox and Grandio, and in the evenings all the guests from the four or five hostels in the group all go out together to a club/fancy dress/ river cruise etc night out. If you don't want to go out then you can stay and chill/chat/read - everyone heads out at about 10pm so there won't be anyone keeping you awake. Its the best hostel I've ever stayed at - do yourself a favour and go there rather than a big chain hostel like Wombats.

But you'll also want to weigh how much you pull out at the ATM on how long you are going to be in a particular country.

travel,3d3dve,Beccasinthehall,2,Tue Jul 14 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"I spent the full two weeks in Porto for three reasons.  First, there was a heat wave on (90-95F during the day), and all the other cities I thought about going to were running even warmer (95-105F). Being stuck on a sweltering train was also not appealing.  Second, I was having a great time at Tattva Design Hostel and the electic crowd there. Their staff is really friendly, especially Thiago. One Monday night we got loaded on the terrace from the local 1.80 euro red wine we found at the store around the corner. After grilling burgers on the 4th of July, a couple other Americans and I taught girls from NZ and South Africa about beer pong. The hostel is also hooked up with some pretty solid walking tours and pub crawls.  Third, Porto is a beautiful city with tons of character and things to do. The beach in Matoshinos is very wide and sandy, and it's a nice bike ride or quick tram ride out there. There is good, cheap food and wine everywhere. Shopping can be had at the large El Cortes Ingles and some high streets.  If you want culture, there are plenty of churches and museums packed with art and artifacts. If you want to stay outside you can just wander around marveling at the architecture and bridges. The old city centre is a UNESCO site.  The restaurants and cafes are quite reasonably priced. If you want to save more money, shop at the nearest Dia and cook at the hostel. I got all my 4th of July grilling supplies + beer at Dia for about 20 euro. There are plenty of city parks around for picnicking. If you ride the cable car they give you a ticket for a free port wine tasting.  Afterwards you can wander around the river and the bridges. You could go on an afternoon boat cruise under the bridges or day-long boat cruise to the vinyards with the money you saved on food. Or you could tour some of the port wine lodges and get a bit tipsy. If you really want to get wasted there are pubs along the river open until 3 or 4 in the morning, and the club We Love Porto won't put you out until the sun comes up.  There were also concerts going on at Casa da Musica and a couple other sites. There was a World Touring Car race and auto exposition near the main city park during one weekend. We tried to go to a massive beach party. The ride on the tram was exciting with drunk and high Portuguese rocking the tram car back and forth. It turned out we left too late and couldn't get in so we took ripoff taxis back to the city to go clubbing.   Finally, JK Rowling slummed it there for a couple years pre-Harry Potter and found herself inspired by the elaborate woodwork one of Porto's bookstores.  Like I said, two weeks, never bored!"

travel,3d3dve,thethirdcoast,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"I went to Portugal and Croatia on the same trip, consecutively. It is definitely doable to go to both in 10 days, I did 3 days in Lisbon and 4 in Zadar. So I only have information on those two cities but for a comparison - Croatia's beaches are pretty much unbeatable. You'll have to go to an island at some point because the beaches are not only beautiful but also not many people (depends on the island). The beach near Lisbon was windy and chilly.  Lisbon as a city is one of my favorite cities I've ever been to. So much culture and food and partying. I don't see how you couldn't love it! Zadar is an up and coming tourist destination and if you go you don't need many days but it is a nice place. I went to Zadar because it is a Ryanair airport making it cheap :) and there is access to islands and national parks from there.  I traveled with myself and my friend, both females, and we had no trouble whatsoever."

Nicaragua, has a lot more to offer younger solo travelers, and is wildly cheap by comparison.  Leon, Ometeppe, San Juan del Sur are the 3 main destinations (next would be Corn Islands, Granada, and Esteli). San Juan del Sur is basically for surf,hard partying, and beach. Leon is a Nicarguan city, a cool place, with the beach pretty close. Ometeppe is a great spot for hiking and more adventure type stuff.

travel,3d0m45,HuGiEnormous,4,Sun Jul 12 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"When I was in Japan I found that the most expensive things were: hotel and transportation.

Other than those things it wasn't ""that"" expensive and there were plenty of nice places to eat for the same you'd spend in the US...drinking out was expensive but beer/liquor at the store was fine.  I want to say we paid about $60/night for a tiny, basic hotel room...but one place we added a night and it bumped to $80. They said the lower rate was only for pre-bookings."

travel,3d0m45,uReallyShouldTrustMe,6,Mon Jul 13 11:51:10 2015 UTC,"You can't do it on a tight budget. Transportation and accommodation are the most expensive things.  First - transport. Buy a Japan Rail (JR) Pass. You can get it online, and you need to order this before you land in Japan, then you will be sent a voucher which you exchange for the pass itself once in Japan. You can get them in 1-week, 2-week, or 3-week validities. I haven't bought one for two years or so now so can't remember the price but it is worth it if you're going to be travelling around the country. Shinkansen (bullet trains) and very fast, prompt and generally very enjoyable to use, but they are expensive. With the JR Pass, you can ride almost any Shinkansen (only the 'Nozomi' - the very fastest one is excluded), free of charge. A return Shinkansen trip from Tokyo-Kyoto will almost cover the cost of the pass alone. It is valid to use on any JR train (except for the aforementioned Nozomi), including local slow trains and the JR metro. Also, if you head down to Hiroshima, you can use the JR pass to travel for free between the city and Miyajima island.  Flights in general are quite expensive, though you can find deals if you book early enough. If you want to go to Hokkaido/Sapporo I believe a flight is the only realistic option, though I think they are building a JR line from Tokyo to run there. Willer Express is a bus company which runs between big cities, iirc Tokyo to Kyoto one way was around $35. But honestly, I think the best option is using trains. Japan has maybe the most efficient rail network in the world.  Accommodation - unfortunately, in my experience Japanese accommodation is generally pretty poor. Prices are high, and quite often the hostels/guesthouses are very basic and small. It is possible to find accommodation is most places, whether is be a hostel, hotel or guesthouse. I've only ever really stayed in hostels as well as the odd guesthouse in Japan, but don't expect anything too nice.  Language barrier isn't so much of an issue as many would have you believe. in Tokyo, English is generally quite well spoken. Not on the same level as Bangkok, but far better than Beijing for example. In tourist spots like Kawaguchiko and Nikko there is also a reasonable amount of locals who can converse in English. Japanese people will also generally continue to try and help you even if they don't understand a word of what you're saying, and eventually you can always figure each other out. Locals appreciate it if you attempt to speak Japanese, but they can struggle to understand even if your pronunciation is slightly off. Don't fret about it, I was a naive 23-year old the first time I went and despite some initial struggles reading the subway map I never found myself in a desperate situation - they're incredibly accommodating and understanding people. I wouldn't worry about the language barrier at all.  Food - extremely good, Japan has the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world. Local dishes like katsu curry and yakitori are must-tries. For cheap stuff, get it from 7/11 or Family Mart, or use fast-food noodle bars like Yoshinori. In farther-out areas like Nikko, you can find small and generally unassuming independent eateries that serve delicious food for much cheaper prices than in Tokyo or Osaka. It be be tough to find these places - houses and businesses in Japan tend to be built atop one another - so if the look or menu of someplace piques your interest, just take the plunge and head in. You will very rarely have a bad meal in Japan, no matter what the price is.  If you get a JR pass, you can plan your itinerary so that you start in Tokyo, then make your way down the country for three weeks before zooming back up to Tokyo on a Shinkansen and your flight home. On my first trip there I started in Tokyo and planned to get a ferry from Fukuoka to Busan in South Korea, but changed my plans and ended up getting on a Shinkansen from Hiroshima all the way back up to Tokyo. Which took me a matter of hours. Alternatively, you could see if you can fly into Tokyo and out of Osaka. But if your JR pass is still valid I'd take advantage of it and just enter and exit both from Tokyo.  Cities to see (and possible day trips):  Tokyo (Kamakura, Yokohama, Yokosuka, Kawaguchiko) Nikko (can technically be done as a day trip from Tokyo but you'd be rushed) Shizuoka (Mt. Fuji) Kyoto Osaka (Nara, Kobe) Hiroshima (Miyajima Island)  Skip Nagoya, it's very dull and you wouldn't be missing anything. Maybe try to go up to Sapporo if you have time, though you'll have to really figure out a decent itinerary if you're going to go up there. Kawaguchiko and Kamakura especially are good day trips, and I enjoyed Yokohama by night. Kobe is worth a day trip but I wouldn't bother spending a night there, personally. I haven't been to Nagasaki, Niigata, Nagano, Okinawa or Fukuoka but I've heard from different people that there's are all cool places too. Maybe Nagano could be a good alternative if you can't get up to Sapporo?  General tips;  If you want a viewpoint of Tokyo, go up the Tokyo Tower rather than the Skytree - the Skytree is crazy expensive, whereas iirc the Tokyo Tower is very cheap - possibly even free - and the view is almost as good.  If you like technology, check out Akihabara in Tokyo, it's a nerd paradise.  If you want to see absolute (but methodical) madness, go to Shinjuku station at rush hour. A true sight to behold.  Don't tip.  Get used to bowing. There are many different types of bows depeninding on your social staturs, the social status of the person you are interacting with, and the general situation. For a foreigner however, any bow will suffice (usually I just did a small one, lowering my head and back slightly), and is appreciated. Everyone bows. From car valets to train attendants, to McDonalds workers. Everyone bows, you should too.  Lastly, don't get angry. As with the rest of the region, the people don't like confrontation. Japan is generally quite an efficient place and the people are extremely polite, almost to the point where it can be unsettling. You should have no reason to lose your temper, but even if you feel like doing so, try to restrain yourself and deal with any situation calmly."

I wouldnt mind spending around 100$ a night on a room, maybe more for something special, obviously less would be better if possible, I hate to be tied down if I dont like a city as much, or feel like Ive experienced enough, but also always having to look for a room can be stressful  Also, Ive also always really wanted to see Seoul, any thoughts on that?"
travel,3d0m45,zitpop,4,Sun Jul 12 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't wing it in Japan when it comes to lodging. It's the only place where I would give that advice. Outside of major cities it can be hard to locate a decent place to stay that isn't a complete rip off. It is much better to plan your stays, then wing your daily itinerary, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and large cities like that where you can just wander around all day with your Suica card and find neat shit. You also need to get rid of the idea that you are going to discover cool, non-tourist things. People flock to the cool shit for a reason and Japan is very densely populated.   I kind of liked Tokyo more than any other city in Japan. I never got tired of exploring it even after 3 years of living there, so I would spend the most time there. Definitely try and explore Fuji and Nagano. I think having a car is key to explore those two places though. Trains and buses won't allow you to see the cool stuff, but car rental is expensive and even driving on the expressways is expensive.   Hokkaido is one of my favorite areas, but I wouldn't include it with only a 2-3 week itinerary unless it was for a ski trip."

Alternatively there're lots of travelling-businessman kind of hotels in Japan that are inexpensive/basic relative to chain hotels. But forget about socializing/pub crawls though.  Get the JR rail pass if you plan on visiting 3 or more cities. It works for most subways in Tokyo and all other interconnecting trains. Really a no-brainer buy.  Don't worry about English - I don't speak a lick of Japanese but got along fine. Was there for 3 weeks.   90L for a 3 week trip seems a bit much to be honest.

There's probably lots of off-the-path sites (Japan is great for exploring) but just stick to the normal tourist trail as it'd provide enough.  Lastly - just go have fun. Japan is a safe, colorful and fascinating destination. Take it day by day."
travel,3d0m45,nintendosixtyfour,2,Sun Jul 12 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with wnose. The standard of Japanese hostels is a lot higher than European hostels. Even at cheap hostels, you won't find blood stain or weird things on the sheet. Japan in general have very high standard for cleanliness and efficiency. Bring a notepad, kids can read better than they can speak. Just make sure you venture out of the cities and see their beautiful countryside."

travel,3d0m45,jenniferamber,4,Sun Jul 12 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"Just went to Japan this summer!  Super highly recommend it.  As far as the rail pass goes:  If you are going to be traveling a lot then look into the JR week pass (or two week pass, depending on your plans for the trip).  This allows you to travel on all JR trains just by showing the ticket.  This includes both bullet trains (you still need to visit the JR desk and get a ticket, however you just show them your pass and they set everything up) and local trains just to get from one end of Tokyo to the next.    I would also get a PASMO or Suica card.  They are prepaid cards that you use to travel on lines for instances when you are unable to take a JR line to your destination.  There are many rail companies in Japan and chances are that you'll end up using a bunch of different ones.  You preload it with money so that you don't have to worry about buying specific tickets to each location you plan on visiting.  You just scan your card in and scan it out.  When it runs out you just add more money on it and go on your way with a lot more convenience.  You can even use these on many buses and if you have money left over on it before you leave you can buy food and small items with it as well."

I'd really suggest Patagonia, either the glacier region or the lake region, although I feel the glacier is a must see if you're gonna be in this part of the world. Buenos Aires will definitely not be shut down, at all, and it's a city where you should stay some 3 days or so. The lake region is the Bariloche area, I usually spend christmases in Villa la Angostura, an hour away from Bariloche.  What are you interested in the most? what type of trip would you want it to be? and how are you budget wise? You could do 4 days in bariloche, 2 in calafate and 4 in BA or something like that, but you'd need to fly between those 3 places. if you give me some more details i'd be glad to help you out."

travel,3d1rax,selib,4,Sun Jul 12 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Technically you only really need your passport. Your flight itinerary and the ESTA (the E is for electronic after all) are looked up electronically by your airline and the immigration officer. In general, it definitely isn't a bad idea to carry a copy of your flight itinerary/e-ticket receipt, and for your piece of mind, the ESTA confirmation."
travel,3d2f5b,BKNYC23,2,Sun Jul 12 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"This is a lot to do in two weeks. You can spend two weeks in Japan alone. I would recommend nixing Taiwan and just have a few days in Hong Kong and the rest of the time in Japan, so you have time to go to Kyoto. Not sure why ""trip feasibility"" just consists of 'beer landscape' (or why that figures at all).  Yes, Hong Kong is a stopover for Cathay Pacific, but it makes no sense to stop in Hong Kong on the way to Tokyo. Each city is a hub for airlines – Tokyo for JAL and ANA, Taipei for China Airlines and EVA. Getting rid of Taipei would make the trip considerably cheaper as you wouldn't, for example, have to find a separate flight from Hong Kong to Taipei and you won't have to pay the cost of an open-jaw.  My suggestion would be to either go to Hong Kong first and stop in Tokyo on the way back, or stop in Tokyo on the way to Hong Kong. You can do this with JAL or ANA, although a bit of research suggests this is considerably more expensive than just round-trip flights to either Tokyo or Hong Kong. If you're intent on going to all three, you should stop in Tokyo on the way to Hong Kong, book a separate ticket to Taipei, then fly back from there. Or alternatively, go to Hong Kong, fly separately to Taipei, and stop in Tokyo on the return.  Consider flying time and time zone difference in your time period. Again, you could spend two weeks in Japan alone. But devoting three or four days to Hong Kong and the remainder to Japan is okay if you insist."
travel,3d2f5b,tariqabjotu,2,Mon Jul 13 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"I think you have too much planned and doing both Taipei and HK is redundant. As much as I love Taiwan, Taipei is just another concrete jungle. Go to the east coast of Taiwan, towns like Yi-Lan and Taroko has so much more to offer and better for your wallet.   Airline wise- check out ANA, United, and EVA."
travel,3d2f5b,foggysf,2,Mon Jul 13 06:03:19 2015 UTC,"Tips for the flights: it's always more expensive if your destination is Japan. So in your case, it's better to fly ANA or JAL to Hong Kong or Taipei with Tokyo as the stopover point. It saves you time and money (because you will fly over Japan on your way to Hong Kong anyway). For example, NYC-NRT-TPE-(NRT)-NYC is $1182 for JAL, but NYC-NRT-NYC alone with JAL is $1469.  Between TPE-HKG there are many options so if you really want to visit both, it should not be a problem.  For Taiwan, I will recommend exploring area outside of Taipei as 4 days should be enough to do that. For brewery, Puli Brewery should be the primary one in Taiwan, but it's in central Taiwan (3+ hours from Taipei) and it's state owned. Usually that's a stop if you're going to Nantou. Another famous private brand is lebledor. You can find their website by Google. They have a few stores in Taipei, but I don't know where the brewery is."

I'd recommend starting from Lauterbrunnen and taking a short cable car to Grütschalp then hiking the Mountain View trail over to Mürren. It has some stellar vistas of the Jungfrau, Mönch and Eiger and some beautiful wildflowers. If you're smelling the roses like I did it may take you 3 hours. But its rated at 1.5 hours. Easy hike. I wouldn't worry about hiking boots, but I'd have some shoes with good traction. That's a pretty low elevation hike (~3k ft) so it will be hot, but you shouldn't be out of breath. Enjoy!"

I will say DC is much different than when I moved down here in 2004. What I miss from Boston are good neighborhoods, great music, the walkability of the town, and the ""culture"". Coming down here and living in Silver Spring, going to school in NW, Dupont and Georgetown were the only good walking neighborhoods I knew about, and Georgetown isn't Metro accessible. For music, yes, there was the 9:30 and Black Cat, but there weren't many other alternative venues. Boston and Cambridge have too many to remember.   My opinion might've been slightly different had I ever lived in DC proper. Due to the expense and my unwillingness to have roommates and the 2 dogs I have, 'burbs it is.

Also the music scene in DC is pretty solid depending on what type of music you're into.   also georgetown is less than a mile walk from rosslyn (and it's a pretty walk across the key bridge)  i'm just throwing out suggestions, but DC does have good neighborhoods, great music, and decent walkability (i'm living in LA now so DC spoiled me in those regards) if you know where to look."

I'm never going to live in DC (and have no interest is doing so, cost being the big factor), so I spend my time getting to know the neighborhoods around me, and that's good enough. Most of my friends  don't live in the District (though many once did) think the same way, and interestingly enough, feel the same way about DC - ""like it, don't love it"" and we come from all over.

But the violent crime, political corruption, complete lack of accessible nature, horrible winter and summer climate, and unhealthy lifestyles push it down the list of most livable enjoyable US cities. And yes the fact that downtown from Grant Park to the West Loop smells like raw sewage for the better part of the summer hurts it too.   It just doesn't compare to SF, NYC, Seattle, Miami, LA, Austin, SD, Charleston, Portland, Houston or Tampa among others.

That said, downtown and near north side feel much safer than the downtown or pico/union areas of LA.    Also, LA is kinda skewed because they have significantly more people, and areas like compton aren't included in their crime rate statistics.

The vast majority of shops are regular high street chains which almost all have stores elsewhere in London, usually not even very far away. The architecture on Oxford Street isn't even good. Regent Street is nice though, and Great Marlborough Street just off it has Liberty which is good.  The only shop on Oxford Street you can't go to elsewhere in London is Selfridges.  I'd sack off Oxford Street and spend day two in South Ken since you're there anyway. Besides the V&A (nice garden in the middle, go to that) there's the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Royal Albert Hall, Albert Memorial, Exhibition Road and the walk to Harrods.  The National Gallery is pretty huge and if you're into art you can easily spend all day in there, so you might want to plan ahead to know what rooms you want to go into and so on.

travel,3cymfp,bawss,3,Sun Jul 12 08:57:15 2015 UTC,"Hello! First of all, I would highly recommend Croatia! I've been to a handful of places in Europe and this has been one of my top favorite trips so far. My SO and I stayed in Croatia from May 1-15, with a short side trip to Budapest (another HIGHLY recommended location). We were fortunate in that my parents rented an apartment in Dubrovnik for a month (April 18-May 18), and that's where we stayed. The apartment was booked through www.hedera-estate.com and we stayed in apartment A36. Looks like it cost 180 euro a night, but it also looks like they have tons of other cheaper places you can stay. If you do choose to rent an apartment, I would recommend getting something outside of the old city walls of Dubrovnik - this way you are more likely to have a nice view. If you stay within the walls, it will likely be loud, crowded, and you will only see rooftops or another wall from your windows. You can see the view we had from the first picture in my album.   Dubrovnik is very touristy, especially May-Sept, So the prices are comparable to other places in Europe. Not exactly cheap but I never felt like I was spending too much. As said before, I was there the beginning of May and every day was more crowded than the last. Several cruise ships were docked there and the streets of old city Dubrovnik fill with cruise ship tourists during the day, and they all go back to their boat in the evening. It was getting pretty crowded by the time we left, I have no idea how much worse it can get later in the summer. I would recommend going end of April, beginning of May. My parents has some cloudy/chilly days at the end of April, and I had nothing but sunshine and 75 degrees (F) the whole time I was there.   Things to see/do: walk the old city walls of Dubrovnik - you get some fantastic views of old Dubrovnik and the surrounding sea. Go to Lokrum Island - just a 10min ferry ride that leaves from Dubrovnik every hour (?I think). This island has a fort at the top built by Napolean, and the island is riddled with peacocks, and there is an old monastery. Some cafes/restaurants on the island. You can also kayak there - I think they leave from Pile Gate (in Dubrovnik). Take the cable car the top of the hill (don't remember it's name, but you can't miss the cable car). You can also walk to the top on a trail. At the top there is another old fort turned into museum (I personally didn't think it was worth the price - the information was pretty basic), but you can go to the top of the fort and get some amazing views of all of Dubrovnik, which is where I took the panorama I included in the album. The museum is about the war between the Serbians from the 1990's. If you can find it, go to Bozu Bar - it's on the outside of the city walls, built into the rocky cliffside of Dubrovnik. You see nothing but Adriatic Sea and Lokrum Island. No food, just drinks, cash only - but great views.  Also, if you can, take some time to drive to Montenegro. Absolutely beautiful country (similar to Croatia). We took a private tour (don't know the name, but my parents might still have the contact info). I think it was 1500 kuna ($220) for 6 people, which ended up being $37 per person. The benefit was not being on big bus with lots of strangers, and the guide gave us lots of information and tailored it to what we wanted to see. My parents went twice and it was different both times. They ended up taking us back through Bosnia, where we stopped at this small wine vineyard and tasted wine. I think the guy that owned the place was a friend or something because they called him while we were driving through Montenegro and set it up on the spot.  Sorry for the long post, if you want more info please feel free to ask. I hope I gave you what you were looking for."
travel,3cymfp,bawss,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Tex, thanks so much for your write up! I'm going to print out what you wrote and expand on my research a little bit but it sounds like something I'm VERY interested in doing! My current plans are; flying into Amsterdam on 22nd, train to Belgium 24-27 for Tomorrowland(a big music festival) and fly to Madrid 27-29 to meet with friends for a couple days and maybe Barcelona after that. And then I'm not sure where to after that. I'm thinking about 21 days-ish in Europe is enough time for my first trip and although I'm not on a limited budget, I'm hoping to stay within $100 (100 Euros) per day for accommodations, food, drink, activities etc..   Are there great beaches in Dubrovnik to swim and snorkel? I love pretty much any sort of water activity..  Budapest is also on my list..can you expand on that? Thanks again for taking your time out to write a very informative post!!!"
travel,3cymfp,bawss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yes there are lots of beaches, however, the majority of them are pretty rocky. Many have rocks instead of sand. There was a beach (Banje Beach) in Dubrovnik (outside the city walls on the Ploce Gate side) that was all sand and was a good place to swim. We didn't do much swimming so I'm not sure of the beach situation in other cities, but I saw a good amount of sandy-looking beaches here and there. Snorkeling would be a great idea because the water is VERY clear, you can see straight to the bottom in some places. There are lots of places you can kayak, snorkel, dive, etc. there are glass bottom boat tours. You can jump off the rocks into the sea at Buza Bar.   Budapest was AMAAAAAAZING. We only had 2 full days here but I wish we would have done 3 or 4. I plan on going back some day. The people are nice, everyone spoke good English and the food was good. The thing that I loved the most about it was how affordable it was. You can definitely do $100 per day here. We stayed in a hotel about a block away from the Chain Bridge and Danube River for $100 a night (but there are cheaper places). We went to a bar (Szimpla Kert, one of the ruin pubs) and got a huge glass of wine and beer for $3 total. We never spent over $30 on dinner (and dinner always included several alcoholic beverages). Everything is cheap it seems. They have their own currency, the forint (~280 forint is $1 USD) We were having a hard time spending all of what we took out before returning to Croatia.   Things to do in Budapest: thermal baths, ruin pubs, St. Stephen's Basilica, Chain Bridge, Parliament building, Hero's Square, Royal Palace (museum, but go to the top for great views of the river), Fishermans Bastillon (also amazing views of the river and free). We didn't go, but apparently one of the worlds largest synagogues is there.   Hope this helps! Your trip sounds awesome!! Amsterdam is fantastic, I hope you're staying there for a day or so. Great people and fabulous city!"

travel,3cymfp,cavedweller21,3,Tue Jul 14 09:39:19 2015 UTC,Never been to Europe.  Looking at visiting anywhere outside of US in Sept.  Would you recommend Croatia as  top of that list??
travel,3cymfp,_amnesiac,2,Sun Jul 12 08:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would definitely recommend Croatia! I have been to a couple of places in Europe and Croatia is definitely near, or at the top. The Adriatic Sea is just gorgeous. Lots of clear blue/turquoise blue water. The people are very friendly and speak good English. Pretty much everything is translated into English and/or German. Lots of tourists. I think Sept would be a good time to go because the water will probably still be warm, but the air temps will probably be cooler, but still warm enough. I would also think a lot of cruise ships and tourists will start dwindling. As I said in another post, I was there May 1-15 and every day was more crowded than the last. Cruise ships start coming in early to mid-May which brings thousands of tourists. It wasn't too bad while we were there, but by the time we left, it was definitely noticeable. I would imagine June/July is worse. The prices are reasonable. They have their own currency (Kuna). Since it is a tourist location, it's not exactly cheap, but it's not overly expensive either.  I really, really enjoyed Croatia! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! We spent majority of our time in Dubrovnik (southern Croatia) and a few days in Split."

Mostar is incredible, but I would suggest an overnight trip from Dubrovnik as opposed to a day trip.  While it looks like only a two hour drive, the buses are routinely delayed and the border crossing can take a long time.  If you're driving on your own, the border crossing will take even longer as the buses are allowed to cut ahead of the individual motorists.    I'd estimate that it took us closer to four hours each way when all was said and done."

travel,3cymfp,VTsoul555,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"My parents went to Mostar by rental car, and had no problems with border control or long wait times. I think this may have to do with the fact that they went end of April, before tourist season kicks in. I was were there early May and never dealt with long lines at the borders, and I crossed through Bosnia 3 times (by rental car, bus, and private tour van). If you are going soon, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a long line at the border crossing because it's high season right now - but I'm just guessing. My parents went to Mostar for the day and didn't need to stay the night.  You can take a bus, but they are usually late and take longer. They are cheap and there are plenty of buses running continuously.  Your itinerary looks good! Split was nice. I've heard Hvar is fun - lots of partying. We drove through Krka by bus, but my parents actually went to it and said it was gorgeous! I think you'll have fun! If you are worried about ""eating well"" trust me, there are plenty of cafes and restaurants everywhere. Lots of fresh seafood and good Italian food.

travel,3d2o5f,ohtimorousme,4,Mon Jul 13 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"You can make the reservation online, but you should call the hotel to request that the two rooms (probably should just book them under one name...) are adjacent. They only have a handful of connecting rooms and they are, as you said, a one-king next to a two-queen. They cannot guarantee the rooms will be connected, so they suggest that you stay in constant contact with the hotel, maybe at the point of reservation, a week beforehand to reconfirm, and even on the day of arrival to maximize the chance that they can accommodate your request.  You know how I know this? I called the hotel. I could call them from Korea, so I'm sure you could have called them from wherever you are. With 370+ DoubleTree hotels around the world, they likely have different policies and configurations and this is something best answered by the hotel rather than Redditors."

Vancouver Island or a lot of the smaller surrounding islands (Galiano Island, Salt Spring Island) are great for relaxing getaways. If you stay in Victoria, you can always take a drive out to Tofino and enjoy some great views and surf. The drive is about 4 hours though, so not sure if you want to spend that much time of your 4 days in a car.  Similar to Banff, there are also places in BC like Whistler (mountains & spas) or Kelowna (wineries & lakes) that offer the kind of things you're looking for.

I would reverse the Montreal and QC proportions, personally. You could spend a week in Toronto without difficulty. And like I said: if you're using them as locations for day trips, that be different.

They do not want legal fees to build up and they do not want to send someone to a small claims trial.  That would cost them a lot more than the $993.  I can't tell you what they will do, but I think the legal department will take a much more realistic view of the situation.  Oh, and if they still tell you no, then simply tell them to explain it to the judge.  Take it to trial and tell your story.  Bring all relevant paperwork.

However, if there was no receipt sent, or the receipt showed a $0 fare difference, you may have some sort of legal recourse, but honestly I don't know where you'd go from there. Maybe you'd be able to take them to small claims court?"

travel,3cxxjs,taktyx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:17:34 2015 UTC,"I just flew U.S. Airways/American Airlines. My flight was originally at 10:00 pm from O'hare but was delayed to 11:05 pm. I was at the airport early so I strolled around the terminal and saw another flight going to the same destination that was also delayed from its original take-off time, but it was boarding 15 mins from when I arrived in the terminal. I walked up to the gate and asked if i could get on that flight. The gate agent changed my ticket to the earlier flight free of charge! I was expecting a $75 change fee from what I was googling.  I know this is not a helpful story. But, not all airlines are evil. I think."
travel,3cxxjs,eldeeder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:21:23 2015 UTC,"Gate agents have more reservation power than pretty much everyone in the airline.  Also, that situation benefits the airline as there is basically no additional marginal cost at that point since the seat would be flying empty anyway. It also frees up a seat on a later flight for anyone who may need a rebooking or is less risk in the case of a longer delay."
travel,3cxxjs,MattRichardson,2,Sun Jul 12 08:24:01 2015 UTC,"That logic doesn't work with Alaska Airlines.  Plenty of spaces left on the exact same but earlier flight and no checked baggage, but they absolutely refused to let me change without exorbitant fees.  So I just had to sit around the gate for an extra hour and a half just because the agent didn't feel going through a few extra mouse clicks.  Way to piss off your customers for absolutely zero gain, Alaska!"

They are great for hostels or honestly, ""don't forget your towel!""  A couple of bandanas can come in handy, too.  A good book, I prefer to shove a nice paperback into my sack; I love that kind of fits the atmosphere of travel or something I can get lost in a bit.  Clothes: pack minimally. Bring nice walking sneakers. Bring a change of clothes for a night out on the town, but can also be utilized as everyday wear (e.g. Button down, polo, comfy/good looking khakis/jeans.  Earplugs.  Stuff sacks for dirty clothes and to pack more efficiently (Google : stuff sack)- REI has them.  Travel tube of sunscreen.   Aleve or headache meds.   Mini flash light - I guess your phone will do too  Good music   Portal battery pack/quick charger for your phone. I listen to a lot of music while wandering around or in transit, but you don't want to be somewhere with a dead phone.  Get some euros before you go.   Oh, your credit cards - check if there is a fee for using it abroad. I specifically picked capital one because there are no international transaction fees. If you can use your card at the hotels/hostels/restaurants, use it. Of course, factor this into your budget.  ** T-mobile has free international data and texting (it's 3G I think), but that's a huge bonus- check if your account applies.  Have fun!!!"

Oh well :)  Live and learn and we will do better next time."
travel,3cwu0c,-hh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"FWIW, a good general rule of thumb for any city is to ask at the hotel front desk if they have a city map.  Plus I generally like to have a printout that I brought from home ahead of time, especially of the mass transit system."
travel,3cwu0c,-hh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"Whoa whoa whoa. This map is wicked, maybe you could give me some pointers on future stops i'm heading towards too! ;)"
travel,3cwu0c,dtwhitecp,2,Sun Jul 12 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"Sure.     In a nutshell for Brussels, one of the main things to remember is that it is a big business traveller town, which is why all of the choices around Grand Place.   The main 'alleyway' up off the square is full of pretty aggressive hawkers to try to get visitors into their establishment.  They're pretty much all okay (to the extent that I've tried them), but they do generally operate under the strategy of having a cheap introductory price to get you in the door...they'll make it up in drinks, etc.  Similarly, businessmen on travel have a budget allotment for their meals, so they're less likely to be highly price sensitive and stingy.    My understanding is that the Fish Market is one of the regions which cater a bit more to locals than the visitors ... and I suspect that that ""Area to Explore"" (southeast of Manneken Pis) may be a similar neighborhood.   Overall, a good general rule of thumb is to find where the locals go ... they know quality & value.   A good example of this in Brussels is the ""End of the Century"" (Brasserie) at rue des Chartreux, 9:  you'll find plain, long wooden tables where you'll be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger, but good beers & good food at a good price.      For beers, the Delirium is the famous place and will be crowded at peak hours.   They're not too busy at, say, 10AM, right after you've arrived in the city after a trans-Atlantic flight ;-)      EDIT:  one thing I forgot to mention:   for chocolates, the ""Second Best"" is what the Belgians generally buy for themselves ... which is Gallier.   Its on the map.   I've also found that Neuhause is good, as is also Carne.   I skip Godiva, because I can get it in the USA.   The most decadent I've ever been on this front was a few years ago when I was flying home and straight on to my wife's college reunion weekend...I was carrying something like 9kg of chocolates (and all my wife's girlfriends were thrilled with their hand-outs).   Fortunately, she & her friends had a ton of fun at the reunion, as that wasn't cheap (around $500 in total).    For future city stops, I probably don't have a map like this, but I can hopefully remember a few of the places that we liked/disliked, etc.  Just drop me a line.  -hh"

It's about 22 miles round trip. We took off at 6am and got back at 7:30pm. The last mile is the hardest. A lot of people ran out of water and the nearest spot to refill was maybe 4-5 miles down the mountain (take a water purifier of some sort). You can always break it up as a 2 day hike and camp out at about half way. If you do end up doing it, definitely take some heavy duty gloves or the chains may rip up your hands."

Being in an apartment with your SO won't teach you much about the local culture and you will likely gravitate toward buying food and things you are familiar with. In a Workaway you live with a family, get to experience what they eat and how they cook it, you see what they do for fun, what TV shows they like. Plus you learn a lot more of the language. It's a completely different experience. Most people on Workaway are friendly and open to new people and experiences and can easily become life-long friends."

If you really want to see the country in any detail aren't you going to have to spend the night in places that you want to visit? Thereby negating the savings from renting a place long-term? Alternatively think about spending two to three weeks in each of the major parts of the country: North, north east, middle (sukhothai and ayuthaya and Bangkok), southern islands. Though from our experience the best places where you'll want to spend time are the far north and the southern islands. Maybe do a month in each?

It's safe to say that not too many people in r/travel have gotten to know it very well. It's a challenging city, but with the right approach, you can have a good time there. I'm doing fine, and my expat friends really like the place. But if its vibe isn't for you, then there are other options: Subic, Lipa City, Davao, Bacolod, GenSan. It depends on what you want out of city life in the tropics. If you have specific considerations, let me know, I might be able to help you with your choice.  I do have a few contacts in local real estate, once you make up your mind which city, we can look into your leasing options (if relevant). Your budget sounds feasible. Good luck!"
travel,3cyja5,alanism,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:36:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your post! To give you some background, we are more interested in food and culture rather than shopping or clubbing.

travel,3cyja5,alanism,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"I see, then I would recommend Bacolod City. It's my favorite city around here, maybe one day I'll live there. It's developed, but not too congested, and it has yet to be taken over by countless high rises. It's got an active contemporary art scene, one of the best in the country. You'll get a fun dose of culture during its festivals, esp. Masskara Festival. There are some cultural heritage spots in adjoining towns Silay and Talisay. And the food there is so damn good.  If a smaller town is okay... well, Miagao is one of my favorite places on the planet. It's a quiet town in Iloilo province, but it's also a university town and a center for marine biology, so it's got its progressive and intellectual side. Some art and culture, too. In any case, Iloilo City isn't far away. There's good seafood here -- much fresher than what you can get in Manila.  General Santos City is another option. It's not the most exciting city, but at least it's not terribly congested. You can breathe here! Not much culture, either, but there's a lot to explore nearby -- Lake Sebu is a couple of hours away, for example. And it's close to beautiful beaches along Sarangani Bay. There's good seafood and the tropical fruits in this region are to die for.  Subic, Lipa City, and Baguio City have their attractions as well, but I'm less familiar with them. Davao City is good, but a bit more congested than the other picks. Its food scene is all right, I guess, but not really unique, except for the amazing tropical fruits. Not a bad place, but for me there are better options. Might be for you if you want a highly developed city that's not as crazy as Manila."

And while I have never been, I heard really good things about Bologna. At the same time many say that they found Milan to be unimpressive. If you are there for the fashion, add that day to Florence because all the designer outlets are in Florence.   Pisa is similar, nothing to see there apart from the leaning tower. IMO the main reason to go there is the Ryanair airport.   If you do go to Mailand, consider going north into Switzerland. Como, Lugano, Bellinzona. I know that this is one of the most scenic routes in Switzerland. The route from Lugano to Luzern is called ""Wilhelm-Tell-Express"". You could also go from Locarno to Lausanne with the Simplon Express.   http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/highlights-en/panorama-journeys.html  Very popular destinations in Switzerland are Lauterbrunn and Interlaken as well as the Jungfraujoch.   Alternatively you could go north from Venice to Innsbruck, Salzburg and Munich.   I would use skyscanner.net to look for cheap flights to Barcelona or Madrid and then pick your departure point based upon this. Flights to Spain often become booked completely solid during the summer months and so that should be your main concern at the moment."

The Red Fort, the Jama Masjid, all that stuff IS NOT WORTH IT. Trust me, it's crowded, incredibly hot, polluted, and the crowds around you are peppered with pickpockets. Even if you go by car and get whisked right to the entrance, it's still not worth it.  2) Make the less-urban sites the ones you spend your time in. Nobody seems to go to Humayun's Tomb which is idiotic if you're planning on seeing the Taj Mahal, too, since they're sister buildings. I also recommend the Bahai Lotus Temple, and the Qutub Minar complex is juuuust barely worth it to me (be sure to look up the significance of the iron pillar to the lower right in that picture, it will make you appreciate it that much more).  3) Find neighborhoods that are nice instead of attractions that are stuck in shitty neighborhoods. Hauz Khas Village is an awesome little Indian hipster neighborhood filled with fantastic restaurants, pop art galleries, indie designer clothing shops, and the like literally right behind the ruins in the picture.

travel,3cx1c3,michiness,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"Ohio's my home state and I love it! I know what you mean about Columbus, but the thing is that its a relatively ""new"" and up and coming city trying to find its identity. I actually got the same vibe from Indianapolis. The city is based around Ohio State, but there are some cool neighborhoods such as the Short North and German Village that have nice shops and great restaurants. I'd also recommend going to the Columbus Zoo since its one of the nicest zoos in the country. About an hour away is Hocking Hills State Park, which is probably the nicest natural area in the state (probably even better than Cuyahoga Valley National Park).  As for other cities, Cleveland (my home city) is more established than Columbus and is getting better and better. In Cleveland I would recommend going to neighborhoods like Little Italy, Tremont, and Ohio City for food as well as Lakewood which is a suburb of the city. We also have a very nice metro park system throughout northeast Ohio that makes it very easy to find a running trail, hiking trail, and even a castle. We're also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame (actually in nearby Canton), which are both worth a visit if you've never been. Like another commenter mentioned, Cedar Point is a little over an hour away in Sandusky, and is one of the premier attractions in Ohio. During peak season, you could easily spend 2 days in the park without riding the same ride twice. Also on the Cedar Point peninsula is the beach and Soak City waterpark, and if you drive 5-10 minutes down the road you will find Castaway Bay, Kalahari, and the Great Wolf Lodge waterparks along with other touristy attractions. Down near Cincinnati you can find Kings Island amusement park, which is also one of the premier amusement parks in the country and worth going to. I'm not as familiar with the Cincinnati area, but I always have a good time when I'm there.  If you really want to get an Ohio vibe though, I would go to a sporting event. Our state loves sports, and theres nothing quite like a football Saturday at Ohio State. If college sports aren't your thing, go to any of our professional sports games and you'll get a good feel for Ohio culture!   EDIT: I almost forgot, but we also have Amish country if you're interested in that. I haven't been in years so I hardly remember it, but everyone that goes seems to enjoy it so it might be worth checking out!"

I avoided that, and everywhere else in the central touristy bit seemed fine.

travel,3cx1c3,fiver_saves,22,Sun Jul 12 08:45:17 2015 UTC,"Goma, D.R. Congo  Last year I was visiting a friend of mine who was doing humanitarian work in Uganda. At some point his work ended and we were able to travel to several stunning places in Eastern Africa like Zansibar, Serengheti National Park or climbing up the Magherita peak a >4000m mountain in the tropical forest.  In the 4th weak of our trip we landed in Gisenyi in Rwanda. A small city at the boarder to D.R. Congo in a beautiful region with some of the biggest vulcanoes in the world and the Last mountain gorillas on this planet.  To understand what happened after that you have to know that wie both quite like taking risks. We both do a lot of stuff to get that special kick. So after a couple of beers in a local bar er decided to somehow get over the boarder to D.R. Congo.  To understand why this is quite risky is the fact that this region is possibly the poorest and dangerous place in the world. After the genocide against the Tutsi minority in Rwanda in the 90s, many Hutu genociders came with the refugees from Rwanda to Congo, forming several rebell groups which brought the country the 3 Congo wars which killed the most people since World war 2. These rebel groups and others found by Congolese people to fight the foreigners still operate in the region. Despite UN soldiers there the rebel groups control a big part of the Eastern Congo and the city of Goma is somehow the epicentre. As if the fact that this place is one of the poorest places in the world where war is seen everyday wasnt enough in 2002 one of the volcanoes erupted and destroyed big parts of the city making it possibly the worst place on earth.  So we were trying to get over the boarder what was as we knew nearly impossible, because the least thing the government of that country needs is 2 white Europeans drauf in their country. So we tried several boarder control posts. And two days, one hour of very persuasive talking, a couple of lies and 100$ bribes we finally got in.  As we encountered the city every aspect we already knew about cities in that region got more extreme. The poverty, Lack of infrastructure, the desperate people and UN soldiers everywhere. What was new was the hate towards foreign people wie experienced. We somehow found a hotel which was quite good. After a night we looked around the next day and several people shoved us on a market. Also our Ugandan friends who we met in the hotel were insulted a lot of time. Also two Drink guys who seemed to be especially racist scared us to death, because they followed us for some time having knifes in their hand. As they were trying to get us we ran behind the next houses and gladly they did not find us. That was the final signal that er had to leave the D.R. Congo. We straightly went to our boarder post but they would not let us leave. They told us we should go to our embassy. The Problem was there only was one in Kinshasa., about 2000km alway from where we where. He told us to try a boarder post outside the city, because they would not allow it inside. In out desparation wie asked every person we reached where the post is. Finally we got an answer and approached with two guys with motorcycles who er paid to get there. We rode for one hour when we were stopped by some guys wearing guns. These guys did bot look like soldiers aus they were wearing old football Shirts. They talked with our drivers for over one hour. We were thinking that er got in serious trouble here, but After a lot of time and I think some bribes we were free to go. We just had 20min more to go. Then er reached the boarder and surprisingly one of our drivers turned out to be a Congolese journalist why reports about the Situation in Eastern Congo. He explaned us the situation. He Said that the guys that stopped us were FRDC rebels from Rwanda who are known for their brutality. Our luck was the presence of this man. He told us that he looks around in the region for touristst and their savety to prevent more negative media Reports of the region. So in the end er luckily got safe out of this place.  I think on that day this man saved my life. Whatever he said back then he prevented us from getting hurt or maybe worst. I hope someday I can return and I can pay him back.  This should also be an appeal to all of those who search for that special kick. Do bungee jumping or something else. Do not risk stupidly your life. If your life is not worthy for you, it is for your beloved ones and they will suffer if you get hurt or even die."

Try growing up as a progressive liberal in kKingsport - it's fucking awful. Spat on for having a Kerry sticker on my car in high school.  The blatant racism. The fact when I was there 2 weeks ago no one understood. The swastika argument for why the Tennesseean Confederate battle flag is not an ok thing - they didn't think it meant anything that said flag was raised alongside burning crosses. The shit smell. The allergies. The fat people and rampant obesity. The accents. The idiocy of the general populace - christ many servers are naive and awful. The fact that blackhole of a town sucks people in for life. Lack of decent pedestrian infrastructure or any public transport. Oh, you made bike lanes on center? Would be nice if your senior citizens actually paid attention to them.   I could go on and on and on for reasons why Kingsport is a terrible fucking place. But honestly, if you need convincing, you probably shouldn't be posting in /r/travel because you clearly haven't seen anywhere worthwhile in this country of ours. For example, Asheville. Or Boone. Or a myriad of other regional cities that are quaint and awesome and nothing like the shithole that is Kingsport.   Edit: we'll go on. No major airports within 4 hours - Asheville and Knox hardly count. Shit radio stations. No consistently decent concert stopover cities within 4 hours - orange peel is great but their shoe lineups are inconsistent at best, and don't even think of wanting any renowned edm artists within 6 hours. The new trying-to-hard breweries that have been cropping up the past few years all kind of suck,  Holston river notwithstanding (423 blonde was damned good). Local music is almost always some bluegrass or Americana variant and just no.

Then fill in the gaps with predominantly trashy shops selling tourist trinkets, even more so than your average European city.

Both are very worthwhile visiting. Westport is a lovely little town surrounded by pure rugged beauty, though once there, you will need a car to explore the surrounding area. Galway is (in my opinion) the most fun city in Ireland, with loads of great pubs, food, music and completely walkable. Its also spitting distance of Connemara (more of that rugged beauty) and there are also tours down to Cliffs of Moher in Clare (probably our most impressive (easily accessible) natural wonder. Though November, will be pretty wet and cold in the west, so pack water proof jacket etc. I love the mist covered western landscape, but its not for everyone in that weather."

The information signs were hilarious; they know it's a tourist trap and embrace it. It wasn't crowded when I was there (this was August so I don't know how we lucked out). Watching people get lowered to kiss it was pretty hilarious and doing it yourself just as funny. The castle is a decent ruin to wander through and the house is really interesting.

travel,3cy07r,neurad1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think his best advice is at the end   A major mistake many travelers make is putting sights into their itineraries simply because these places are famous from a song, a part of a relative’s big-bus-tour memory, or advertised everywhere.    I think it's important when you travel to ask yourself why you want to see a particular place. If you can't write up more than two sentences you can probably strike it off your list. Because your desire to go there likely stems from marketing or other people's advice. Not that good places can't have marketing or that strangers can't give good advice but those things often lead to a shallow reason for seeing a place and that generally leads to bad experiences."

For the most part I think the people scared off of coming to Mexico don't have passports and wouldn't be coming anyhow.  I mean, I am sure there's a certain corner of the travel market that's misinformed and avoiding the country for silly reasons but all up I don't think anti-Mexico sentiment has an enormous effect on tourism here as a whole."

US media loves talking about the drug cartel problems definitely doesn't help either. Everyone I know still only goes to Tijuana, Cabo, and Cancun/PDC/Tulum while there's so much more to it than just those areas. IMO Mexico is shorter/cheaper flight from most airport and offers just as much as the rest of the Central/South America.

I recommend it over the Grand Canyon unless you're considering backpacking in the GC. Relative to most parks, it's hard to find a last-minute campsite at Zion. Watch the sunrise at Bryce for an hour or so, then try to get to Zion early to get a spot.        I'd spend a little less time on the California coast and more time in the mountains. It's a lot easier/cheaper to camp there. Even in a severe drought year, I think backpacking in the Sierra is better than Rocky Mountain NP."

According to the website of the metro company, the fine can only be paid either by going to a bank or post office or via bank transfer (http://intl.m.dk/#!/customer+service?68555965). If you made some friends in Denmark, maybe you can transfer money to them via paypal and have them pay the ticket for you via netbank, that way you at least won't have to pay the 20$ transfer fee."

For some reason the Metro police is particularly strict about their rules, and there is no reasoning with them. They say it is to prevent misuse, but I suspect them to just consider it extra income. Complaining will lead nowhere, as you did break the rules.   I don't believe they can force the money of you (they are definitely not allowed to use your credit card). For danes, they can ask tax authorities to withhold your pay, but I don't think they can do anything to tourists.  If you wish to pay, I could do it for you, and we'll figure a cheaper way to settle the payment (Paypal, send me a package from somewhere fun, etc.). Pm for details."

I honestly was trying to buy the correct ticket and it never occured to me to look for a bike option, and like I said, I was willing to pay the fine right then and there and I couldn't.   It's not their job to teach every rule but it's also not their job to pull someone off an empty metro at 4am and call them a liar and spend 30 minutes harassing them for a physical ID when they said they don't have it the first time.

travel,3cyotf,grshirley,5,Sun Jul 12 00:22:13 2015 UTC,I think it also depends on the price point of the rental. If it's $250-$300/night then this is pretty shitty customer service for a high-end place.

That or, pick up a regular shipping envelope at the store while you're grocery shopping and slap 5 or 6 stamps on it and put it in your own mailbox for your mailman to pick up.  My mom do this all the time to send shit to each other since we live in different states.  Landlord is being kind of a dick.  Even if that shit happens all the time.

I order things from a girl who makes jewelry and she doesn't go to the post office all the time to ship shit.  She waits until she has a bunch of orders ready to ship.

Open the door, let someone go first, return a lost purse / wallet at the airport, etc. We do those things because its the decent thing to do and we'd like somebody to do the same for us.  Can you imagine after opening the door for somebody saying, ""that'll be $1"". Technically, it took just a few minutes of my time but they spent their time on you, a perfect stranger. Assuming an hour of my time is worth $25 than that's only fair right?  This hypothetical even omits a pretty critical angle to this situation that other posters have pointed out. They are in the hospitality industry. Some customer service activity should be built into the price of the rental. Dropping keys, prepping it for the next guests, etc.  At the end of the day, they have all the power here. If we want it back, well have to pay.

But I'm going to use my detective skills and assume a) You're from the U.S. b) You don't actually have a visa, but are in Germany on a 90 day Schengen visa waiver.  If you have overstayed the 90 days when you attempt to leave for Croatia in September, it is likely you'll be fined by German officials. Worst case scenario would be a ban on re-entering Schengen countries for a specified period of time (up to 5 years). If you do get caught having overstayed when you leave, you'll have serious trouble getting back into Germany (or any other Schengen country) after the festival too.

travel,3czinu,Atlasrel,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"Did you hit Laos at all?  It'll be a long bus ride to Si Phan Don in southern Laos, and a long bus ride to somewhere with an airport so you can get back to Bangkok, but totally worth it.  Other than that try catching a flight to Luang Prabang in northern Laos.  There's not a whole lot to actually do in either destinations (Luang Prabang does have some nice temples and waterfalls), but they are extremely laid back, relaxing places.  I ended up spending a lot more time in both than I had originally planned, and I even did the dreaded 24-hour Hanoi -> Luang Prabang bus ride just to get another few days in before I had to leave South East Asia.  EDIT: Another option if you wanted to stay in Cambodia is Ko Rong Island.  It'll be a long bus ride to get to Sihanoukville and an hour or so boat ride to the island, but it was one of the most relaxing places I've ever been.  Treehouse Bungalows have a couple, well, treehouse bungalows right on the beach you can rent and they're a bit of a trek away from the small village so it's very quiet.  A trail just off the property leads to about a mile or so of untouched beach.  The water around the island has phosphorescent algae so it glows if you wade in it after dark.

While I don't have experience in Norway, my biggest piece of advice about the lights overall is that it's all about luck during the whole aurora season. The lights can be full-on dancing, but if it's cloudy, you won't see it (and trust me, that's one of the biggest frustrations for those of us who love the lights, and go hunting for them). Also, how many days are you planning to be in Norway? The more nights you spend there, the better shot you have of seeing the lights. Here in Alaska, statistically the best time to see the lights is around the equinoxes (Spring and Fall). If you are aiming to see the lights more so than to see Norway, I'd suggest you focus around late September or March and definitely look into the winter months with the least cloud cover. From my experience, the best and strongest shows i've seen in Alaska have been in March and April, if that helps. Also, while the new moon adds darkness which can enable you to see the lights a little better, if the display is strong enough, the new moon doesn't exactly help or hurt the aurora viewing. I've actually talked to several photographers that prefer a half moon or quarter moon during an aurora because it adds light to the foreground of aurora photos. So, I don't think the moon phase really matters much."

Drive a kilometer out of the village and you will see a starry sky like nowhere else. No light pollution at all. You see the Milkyway easily and you can spot the Andromeda galaxy and the double cluster by eyesight. Take plane to Alta or Lakselv. Drive by bus to Karasjohka.

My suggestion is to spend a day and try every combination you can think of. I know this will be time consuming, but try using a few airline's ""multi city"" trip option. Since you are flying out of NY I would suggest trying airlines which are ran in Asia, for instance Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, and JAL. Delta has pretty good penetration in that market so they'd be worth your while to check also.  After you try booking it all on one reservation try booking the first and last legs as a multi city and then try the rest as individual flights, or multi cities within themselves.  One more option to try - you are essentially going to the other side of the world. Who said you have to return the same way you came? Some airlines have Around-The-World tickets that allow you a certain number of stops/miles and that might be your best way to go. Many many years ago I took an around the world trip and stopped in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia for just over $2000. I normally don't recommend travel agents - but this type of trip might be one time where you visit a local agent to see what they can help you do."

travel,3cz0u4,MryddinWilt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:55:39 2015 UTC,It will be busy and good hostels will be booked solid (maybe already). It's the sad consequence of the digital age! It's getting a lot harder to just show up and find something available. You could use a site like booking.com to book a place just so you know you have a bed and then cancel if you decide to change plans. However you might run into the issue of not having a bed at the place you are currently staying.
travel,3cz0u4,MryddinWilt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:24:58 2015 UTC,"Do you think this will be true everywhere or just the big cities like Paris?    And I'm not too terribly picky about hostel quality.  What would you say is the likelihood of everything in a city being booked up?  I don't necessarily need the best hostels, as long as I have some sort of place to stay."

travel,3cxhw2,hoshkwon,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:43 2015 UTC,FYI going from LA to Big Sur is a 7 hour drive with no stops. That's if you don't go up highway 1. I think a good way to do it would be breaking it up in 2 nights and stay 1 night in SLO and 1 night in Monterrey/Carmel/Seaside.  Day 1:  -Leave LA in morning   Stop in SB for Lunch (should be there noon/1 oclock. drive 2 hours and end up in SLO. I recommend staying along the beach at either Shell (Cliffs is a good spot and it can be relatively affordable) or Morro Have dinner either downtown SLO or explore Pismo. Finish the day   Day 2:   Drive up highway 1 to big Sur Can stop at Hearst Castle or maybe check out some Elephant Seals in San Simeon Should be a 3 hour scenic drive down highway 1 to Big Sur area Hike around for a few hours and end up go to Monterrey or Carmel for the rest of the evening   If you don't want to stop an extra evening you could drive from Big Sur to SF that evening (it's another ~3 hour drive) but if you have the time I highly recommend staying in Carmel or Monterrey. It's an amazing stop and you would have far less travel that day.
travel,3cxhw2,swollencornholio,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:31 2015 UTC,How slow do you drive? LA to Big Sur is about 5 hours along US 1. LA to San Luis Obispo is about three hours.
travel,3cxhw2,cherokeesix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:01:29 2015 UTC,I included the stop in Santa Barbara. OP said he wanted to make a couple stops including an overnight on the coast.
travel,3cxhw2,swollencornholio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"So what if I left in the morning like 8am, stopped in Santa Barbara for maybe an hour or so to check it out, went to SLO and hung out there for another hour, and then to big sur with a couple hours (2-3) of hiking, could I make it to Monterey to stay the night before it gets too late?  I do like the idea of staying in SLO for a night and then Monterey again for a night. I'm traveling alone however. Will I get bored if I turn in early at SLO? Also  spending two nights on the road will only give me 1.5 days in SF as opposed to the 2.5 I had planned before."
travel,3cxhw2,cherokeesix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:15:26 2015 UTC,I think that's possible. Especially if you do it on a weekday and can avoid the Big Sur crowds.   Where in LA will you be? Be mindful of morning rush hour getting out of the city.

travel,3cxhw2,swollencornholio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:56:56 2015 UTC,Hey thanks so much for taking the time to type all that out! One question: is there enough for me to do in Santa Barbara and SLO (and anywhere along the way) to justify turning in at SLO? I don't want to waste too much time or get bored.
travel,3cxhw2,swollencornholio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:55:30 2015 UTC,"Depends what you like to do. If you are a go-go-go type of person who likes to look at a site and move on there's not too much in either location to site see. They are more beach communities that you'd want to relax at.   That being said there is some cool hiking in the SLO area and cool beaches like Shell, Avila, Montana De Oro, etc. If you like big cities then SLO and Santa Barbara might be boring, but both are quaint college towns with tons of bars and restaurants. SB is a little more up scale as it's a destination for people in LA to go to for the weekend while SLO is really in the middle of nowhere. If you are with a SO staying on the beach for the day could be a cool thing to do in those locations otherwise it may not be your cup of tea from the sounds of it."

I'm pretty laid back so hanging out in these towns probably won't be a bad time. But spending two nights on the road cuts down on my time in SF to 1.5 days as opposed to the 2.5 days I had previously.   I was maybe thinking of staying in Cambria for the first night, maybe going to see Hearst castle that night because it's close as well as San Simeon. Then the next morning doing some hiking in Big Sur, maybe stopping by Monterey/Carmel for 2-3 hours and getting into SF in the evening. Does that sound about right? Or am I misjudging the timing? I've never done this drive before. Thanks again!"
travel,3cxhw2,ozuri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yea I think that will work. It's probably worth the trade off in that case. SF there's a lot more to do than Central Coast and SLO especially if your solo-ing.  You could even gut out the drive and camp in Big Sur night 1 if you wanted to. I think SLO would be a more fun place to stay the night than San Simeon/Cambria though. Pretty lively downtown with bars and college students, even during the summer."
travel,3cxhw2,cuthysmalz2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah maybe I will spend the night in SLO then! It sounds like fun.

travel,3cz37s,houseofwinsor,2,Sun Jul 12 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe it varies elsewhere, as I've always bought policies from Australian insurers, but they are based around regions and you can get a whole-world policy.  Medical costs are the driver of insurance costs, so adding the USA leads to the highest cost, adding Europe is the next-highest, but the all-Asia policy is about the cheapest (and it includes the more expensive Asian countries).  Some of the ones I've used (like 1Cover) had options for medical-only cover, however, they're often not much cheaper since medical costs are the biggest potential payout.  Last time I got insurance, I got a standard policy (from AAMI) because it was cheaper than a medical-only policy with other providers.  Just check a few of the major providers' websites and see what they offer."

But after I panicked for a minute everything was alright.   The trip ended up being one I'll remember and talk about forever.

We became enthralled with each other for the rest of the trip and we ended up keeping in touch for about 8 months after.

travel,3cs2vy,paulirby,5,Fri Jul 10 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"I was in Peru. Everyone who was drinking at the hostel decided to go out to a club. I don’t remember seeing her at the hostel- my memory kicks in with us walking side by side and her leaning in like she wants a kiss and retracting every time I lean towards her. In my drunken state, I remember telling her if she doesn’t want to kiss me fine!  We walk up to the club and they want to charge us 25USD each, to which we obviously laughed at. I turn around and she comes up and she kisses me. We end up going to back to the hostel and fooling around. As we are lying in bed, she says stay with me, so I do.  The next morning it like we are 16 (I was 25 she was 23 and we didn’t even have sex the night before), holding hands and embracing each other the whole day as if we were madly in love. We spend the day going around Lima, checking out the downtown area and coast. Eventually later in the day I ask her if she wants to go to Huacachina (desert oasis town in Peru) & Pisco. We have a repeat of the first day and at the end of it, we decide to spend the rest of our vacation together.  Everything is great! Then we get to Cusco and she starts acting very moody and distant. I attribute it to getting used to the very high altitude, which was making me feel sick as well. Another day goes by and she starts getting snippier with me and on Christmas Eve, she makes me snap. I say I’m over the way she is treating me and I’m going back to the hotel room. I wasn’t only upset that someone I fell in love with so quickly became so negative towards me, but I had also given up the deposit and experience of going on the hike to the Machu Picchu trail to be with her (the main attraction of my visit).   Upon returning to the room, I sit in the room on the opposite side watching some tiny TV you can barely see in Spanish, trying to ignore her. She eventually talks to me telling me she is on birth control and forgets to take her pills some days, causing her to have hormonal swings.  I bring up how she made me feel and the things I gave up to go on the trip with her. We have a really good talk that made me feel like she was truly sorry and understood how I felt. We then had sex that night. I think a combination of the sex and us talking through a problem made us even more in love.  We end up having an amazing time at lake Titicaca and Lima. She was only there for a week, I was supposed to be there for two. But at the end of the week I had managed to lose my debit card, 2 credit cards, and my phone. Combine that with feeling heart broken, I decided to leave early and meet some friends in Denver for a NYE party.  The last day was really sad and I wrote her a sappy little note telling her I’d remember the trip forever. We texted every day for 6 months until I was able to go visit her in Colombia. She eventually one day told me to stop texting her, mid text conversation. I was confused and obviously hurt. She then a month later tried to get me talking regularly but I was over it.  Now fast forward another 6 months or so and she is in the states doing an Au Pair thing (she was a chemical engineer, but she hated the job and wanted to travel). She sent me a text, letting me know about this and that she would have time to travel at the end of her stay. So if all goes well, we will be doing a road trip on the Pacific Coast Highway in about 9 months. :)  That trip is something I'll remember forever and I talk about it any chance I get.

Those parts where I went out and did things on my own are some of my favorite travel experiences.  Also, after graduating high school, I decided to attend college in a town 4 hours away where I knew no one.  It was terrifying.  But I am sooo glad I did it.

I am still grateful that I had the opportunity to go there, and may go back when I move to Scandinavia, but it wasn't particularly impactful to visit. For me I went in the deep wintertime and stayed only about 2.5 days. It has the feeling of a very new city even though it isn't - though most of the major architecture was built in the 19th century (palace, national theater etc).   I just didn't find there to be a pull to the place. People were nice but very stereotypically Scandinavian and in their own private space. I even have a hilarious picture from a bus stop with everyone waiting, but standing spaced out from each other up to 20m down the side of the highway so as not to have to make contact.  The major points of interest that I was recommended to visit after the opera house etc was Frogner Park, the germanic-style sculpture park and the tiny Oslo City Museum. Both are interesting in their own way I suppose but these were supposedly the principal things I ""had to"" see. My favorite parts of being there were getting to know my distant cousins and hiking up into the hills surrounding the city.

If you want the midnight sun (during summer) or northern lights (during winter), northern Norway is the only place where that is. But you know, Oslo could be cool for a short stop, there are some nice buildings, old or modern, some good nightlife, Norwegian women (or men if you want that), but not much else.

Expensive, but everyone is incredibly nice and it's arguably the most walkable city I've ever visited outside of Amsterdam (which I also wouldn't place as MORE walkable...just the same).   In almost every city, I recommend walking tours to start the trip unless you already 100% know what you want to see. Highly recommend taking tours from this group to start your visit: http://www.copenhagenfreewalkingtours.dk/  I did both the Grand Tour of Copenhagen and the Christianshavn Tour. Both very very good and will give you an idea of what you want to see otherwise.  I think this is a pretty solid set up as well, though I didn't have 3 days and only had 2. I also was quite worn out from a week in two previous cities and walking an average of approx 25,000 steps per day (according to my phone). http://www.tripadvisor.com/Guide-g189541-k79-Copenhagen_Zealand.html   Rundetaarn is very interesting with a great view of the city. I also think Vor Frelsers Kirke is worth the cost of admission at least to see the view of the city from there as well. Carlsberg Brewery Tour was a bit pricey and small compared to other brewery tours I've been to.  Enjoy!"

travel,3cwnry,foggysf,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think your first step would be decide which island(s) you want to visit.   They are all very different...IMO Maui is the most tourist oriented, Big Island has everything all spread out and cheapest lodgings, kauai the most expensive, and Oahu the most crowded.   Use google map and it would give you an estimated travel time with buses. Most buses don't run that frequent and you will likely have to transfer to get to your destination. Many buses won't even allow luggages. I honestly don't think you will be able to get around with just public transit except Oahu and without a car, most likely you will end up paying for tours and excursions to take you around. If you can rent a car, that definitely changes things, even if only for part of the time. You could do 2 or even 3 islands in 1 month, but allocate at 10-14 days for the big island.

travel,3cxcmz,mybrotherisgay,3,Sat Jul 11 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"quote from www.seat61.com    If you'll excuse me for saying so, many overseas visitors seem brainwashed into thinking that European train travel has to mean buying a railpass.  Of course it doesn't, you can buy the same cheap A to B tickets that we Europeans use.  And they often seem brainwashed into thinking that a 'railpass always saves money'.  These days, a railpass is usually the gold-plated option, more flexible but more expensive than simply buying a cheap advance-purchase ticket.  Obviously, if you're only making a few short local trips, such as Florence to Pisa (€7.90) or Bruges to Brussels (€14), you shouldn't buy an $800 railpass!  Just buy tickets at the station ad hop on the next train.  But even if you're travelling long-distance, whilst the cost of full-price full-flex fares bought on the day might make it worth buying a pass, if you know your dates and can commit to a specific train 2-3 months ahead, cheap advance-purchase fares can blow railpasses out of the water price-wise.  Budget train fares are here!  Many European trains are now priced airline-style, with budget train fares if you pre-book, just like budget airline fares.  There's no longer one fixed price between (say) Paris and Amsterdam, but a sliding scale of prices from €35 to €130 depending on how far ahead you book and how popular the train and date are, just as with air fares.  If you are willing to pre-book 1 to 3 months in advance on a no refunds, no-changes-to-travel-plans basis, you'll easily find some unbeatable train fares such as Paris to Amsterdam from €35, Rome to Venice from €29, Paris to Geneva from €25, Milan to Zurich from €22, Amsterdam to Berlin from €39. See which websites to book which journeys here.  These prices blow railpasses out of the water, IF you are willing to commit to a specific train and date."
travel,3cxcmz,TreefingerX,2,Sat Jul 11 19:45:52 2015 UTC,This is a great write up. Just add one thing that you partially combed over. Booking tickets from point to point within a country are typically much cheaper than going from country to country. Even day of tickets. It cost me 40€ to travel from Florence to Rome (in July) day of on a high speed train. When a low end rail pass is around $240 for 3 days of travel... I you'll likely save money buying as you go especially because most of the trains will require you to pay for reservations.

travel,3cxcmz,PoptartsRShit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:51:54 2015 UTC,You can literally buy the tickets moments before in most cases (Speaking from my experience in Switzerland and Germany).  Most if not all Western European train lines connect together and you can usually buy your full ticket for a multi-country trip from one website.  See for yourself how easy it is!  http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/ - German trains http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html - Swiss trains  Also be on the look out for area tickets or deals. For example you can get a Baden-Wurtemburg ticket for the Black Forest area of Germany which will allow you to travel on any trains or buses for an entire day in that area for about 24 Euros.

travel,3cxcmz,musicben,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend buying tickets in advance, if you know your travelling dates, for Germany, Austria, France and Italy. Don't know about Sweden and Spain, Switzerland is ridiculously expensive either way (and not very comfortable, you may want to use the occasional German trains on the main lines).   Buying international tickets may be a little bit of a problem, many connections are not bookable through the companies' websites.  You might want to check out capitainetrain.com for that.   Also it may be smart, if you don't get a rail pass, to buy a discount card with TEE RailAlliance status.  Bahncard25 from Deutsche Bahn may be an option, they usually have some kind of discounted version for unter 25€ valid for a few months. It'll give you a 25% discount on all German trains (even the non-flexible fares) and 25% on international travel. You may want to look into the many regional service day passes (usually around 30€ throughout the country or at least a part of it, regional service only, usually).   Two more Germany-specific side notes: for the summer months there is a national rail pass called the Deutschland-Pass (2nd class, 269€ for under 26, 349€ for all adults, valid for any 30 days up to 9/13).  And do get a seat reservation for 4.50€, particularly if you're going through the major cities on the main lines. Believe me, it's not fun sitting on the floor for three hours in a crammed ICE."

travel,3cxzdy,jajasali,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"it works on any regional train and high speed trains. You can check your pass for specifics. It will not work on trains that require reservations unless you make that reservation.  Use bahn.de to check routes. Many of the trains such as the ICE in germany need reservations.  Reservations are around 10€. If you are going to do a long trip you'll want to set up a reservation for an ICE trip. Take Munich to Berlin for instance. An ICE train will do that trip in ~5-6 hours where as regional trains would take 12-15 hours with multiple exchanges. You can make reservations 90 days in advance. If you have a set route I would do it as soon as you have an idea. Otherwise you could make them all at the main train station at your first arrival and pray that there are seats available. Summer and weekends are high travel times and many reservations are taken.   For travel within a city your pass won't work (buses, underground, etc) It won't work on suburban trains either (think subways). Buying a day unlimited travel pass would be good and is usually cheap ~5-10€. You can buy it when you get to the city. It depends what you are planning to do. You could go on a bike tour in Munich and rent the bike the rest of the day so you wouldn't have to worry about getting around too much. But you'd want to buy a pass to get to BMW factory, Olympic stadium, etc.  Germany also has state passes hat are super cheap and can get you to some cool locations. For instance if you're in Munich you can buy this 22€ Bayern ticket and get to Salzburg or Neuschwanstein"

travel,3cxuhd,Steelfyre,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how any young fit person would prefer rolling such a clumsy thing around, but ok. :) Problem with SE Asia is that sidewalks are often rather small, lacking completely, broken or high up from the roads. This makes you having to look out to not stumble even when just walking or having to walk through heavy traffic or other stuff. Even if the sidewalks are fine, you'll find that a lot of locals (shop owners for example) use the sidewalks for whatever they want, for example as a cafe's terrace, relegating you back onto the roads.  If you plan to walk around a lot or travel between many different places/cities, I don't see why you'd want a wheeled bag in SE Asia. Especially if you only want a carry-on; can't be that heavy eh?"
travel,3cxuhd,upsidedownbat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I think the giant wheeled suitcases that have to be checked would definitely be a problem-heaving it onto a speedboat or ferry, trying to cram it into a tuktuk, dragging it through muddy streets. When I moved to Thailand to teach I took one of those on buses and taxis and it was a pain. A small carry-on is less of a pain, but still not as easy to carry as a backpack of the same size (plus the wheels and handle add some weight.) I think you'll be fine either way, it depends on what you prefer."

The best example I have of why I will never use wheeled luggage in SE Asia is the boat ride I took in Laos from Nong Khiaw to Luang Prabang.  To get to the boat you have to go down a giant hill of stairs and hill.  Then to get off the boat, another giant hill of uneven stairs.  I was with another couple who had roller bags, and I could just put my backpack on.  A roller bag is definitely doable, but not ideal."

I went with a 46L Osprey Porter (carry-on sized) and am very glad I did. (Like you, I also wasn't really roughing it -- mostly flew AirAsia between cities, and within cities, cabs/tuktuks.)"
travel,3cxuhd,cogitoergognome,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:28:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!  Quick question: the 46L seems far too big to be a carry-on.  Did you ever have any problems on flights using it as a carry on?

There were a couple flights where the bag, while carry-on sized, was over the 7kg weight limit for AirAsia, but luckily I was never stopped and asked to weigh it."

You were very lucky it only cost you 20 euros and your bags also followed you.  One of the automatic checks I do when investigating connecting flights is which airports are involved. There are too many multi-airport cities these days, Paris also has Beauvais (btw it is Orly, not Ory) and CDG, Milan has two, London has at least four, New York at least three, Bangkok two, Kuala Lumpur two, the list goes on.  Once you've checked the airport connections you also need to check the Terminal distances. It can take a long time to get between terminals at the majors.   When making the booking (via a site called Travel2Be) nowhere was it actually indicated that a change of airports was necessary   This is yet another reason why I might find the best flights on a multi booker but I always make the booking direct with the airline."
travel,3cxsb9,41244124,5,Sat Jul 11 19:03:43 2015 UTC,Within reason I enjoy the excitement of figuring it all out. The world is becoming standardized enough as it is without the assistance of propositions to expressly do so.
travel,3cxsb9,Oax_Mike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"If you look up most of the frustrations people have about travelling it's lack of communication and getting stuck in annoying situations. Often things aren't ""logical"", and usability is something a lot of places don't give a toss about - though thankfully fire safety for example at least has come a long way. Some countries are making a lot of their public places universally friendly but all using their own symbols. It's no different to USB etc, standardising it.  I don't see how clearer signage could negatively effect an experience? For me immigration, being able to use the transit network etc aren't the highlights of the trip. Having an emergency exit sign that's green with some form of man running/escaping/door opening is subtle and nice. Car pedals and dashboard symbols are relatively the same, that doesn't take away effect from the total difference of left vs right side driving, the different road signs and marking, rules, driver behaviour. A business having a standardised opening hours sticker (any opening hours would be nice!) suddenly makes the place 'same as everyone else'? I don't get that leap. So we're totally ignoring the food ordering, the meal itself, the dining experience etc - it's all ""exactly the same"" because you could see they close Mondays, accept credit card and have free wifi? Hmm.  The stickers are literally conveying things that are everywhere anyway, it's just encouraging a standardised platform. Is there an example situation where you would have had a positive experience, but a sticker you understood then ruined you finding out the same info the long way? As I'm not really understanding."
travel,3cxsb9,Oax_Mike,4,Sat Jul 11 20:14:44 2015 UTC,It appears as though you're not a fan of my opinion :) Seems strange to ask what others think if you're only going to be offended if they don't like your idea.  My guess is that statistically less restaurants across the globe follow set opening hours than those that do...rendering your sign useless when it says Open Monday-Friday 4-12 and it's 6pm Tuesday evening and the doors are locked.   90% of the world is not wheel-chair accessible.  I've never had trouble finding the immigration line at an airport. You can't get out of the airport without going through.  Many of these differences are cultural in nature and have little to do with language....anywhere outside of Western Europe and a handful of other countries you'd have most businesses and tourist sites throwing their stickers in the bin.
travel,3cxsb9,Oax_Mike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the correlation between having clearer signage and it ruining the authenticity of a place, an example would be good. Per the restaurant example seeing the toilets yes/no, card yes/no, wifi yes/no, currencies sign in the window changes little of the whole experience? Of course whether they actually follow the hrs, actually accept card or have working wifi is another story :)  I'm not offended though the first guy was less than helpful.  People who travel frequently aren't exactly the ""target market"" anyway!"
travel,3cxsb9,Steelfyre,5,Sat Jul 11 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"""Ruined"" would be an exaggeration, of course...I just think that the vast majority of the people who would be looking for this standardized signage are probably eating at the hotel, McDonald's or the Hard Rock Cafe already."
travel,3cxsb9,ThisIsNotMyTrueForm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:21 2015 UTC,"Probably. I've thought of more convincing ideas (perhaps!) given ""it'll ruin authenticity"" wasn't on my con-list and I hadn't thought of it. It's in the comment below (edit: now above. The one in reply to Steelfyre!)  Ultimately on the most part these signs already exist, the idea was to standardise them so they're easily understood for everyone. Lots of governments/councils/tourism boards are implementing this sort of stuff just they're all making their own up.  Perhaps I'm thinking about it all wrong. Perhaps it would be better to instead come up with something more concrete then present it to some tourism committees and get their feedback. After all it'd be pretty much reliant on them telling businesses in the area to register their info and get the relevant stickers or file formats for those incorporating it into physical signs."

In most cases true travelers choose to give up a portion of their piece of the machine in order to find a way to travel first and make money second...foregoing the corporate ladder for a combination of lower earnings and freedom.  It seems to me the smart move would be to travel for 2 months...this way you can use your contacts to line up a job and just set your availability date for 2 months after your internship winds down.  2 months is long enough to properly experience the freedom of the road and short enough to have close to zero impact on your career at this point."

We just know that there is an unknown window, occurring around 5 to 18 weeks prior to departure of cheaper airfare. And that it is almost the most expensive the 2 weeks before departure (last minute deals rarely exist).  However, the general rule is that if you're comfortable with the price, you buy it.    Anyways, I'm just wondering if I should give up and purchase? or if I should wait, and the prices might go back down?   We don't know. You can wait, hope the deal comes back, but ultimately if it doesn't, you'll have to live with the fact that you're going to have to spend more."

travel,3cwlh8,notagain909,3,Sat Jul 11 11:56:16 2015 UTC,It'll  be fine.  Copenhagen arrivals are dumped into the departure lounge and it's not a huge airport. If everything is on time it'll be an easy connection. There's no need to go landside or go through security again or go through any long pathways or anything like that.  You're arriving on a flight from schengen so you'll be let out into the big departure hall in the main bit without passport queues. Then you just need to go into the C/D gate area to pass passport control for going to Ireland.  If they're selling you the ticket then they consider it fine.

travel,3cwhwl,Stevvo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"Marseille has a 2500 years of history, it predates Paris. Being the busiest port in France it has always attracted wealth, and with it those seeking wealth, including those who do not have the skills to obtain it.  France went through decolonization after WWII, with this came waves of migrants from the colonies in North Africa, many settled in Marseille, it being their port of entry to France. To accommodate these new arrivals the government built large amounts of social housing in the North of the city(like ""projects"" in the USA). Unfortunately most of the new arrivals where unskilled, so had trouble finding work, and thus they fell into poverty. Just like in America, when people have no other option they turn to crime and selling drugs to make a living."

Go see Mesa Verde and maybe Silverton and Durango. Stop by and take a picture at Four Corners. Drop back into New Mexico and go see the ruins at Chaco Canyon and the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest and maybe the big crater. Then swing over into Arizona and go north to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Next head towards Vegas and stop at the Hoover Dam. Cruise down the strip in Vegas. See the Fountains at Bellagio at night and go down to Fremont Street and see the Fremont Street Experience. (Catch a cheap room in Vegas if you are there midweek.  You can get GREAT rooms midweek for less than $50). Next head to California. Hit Hollywood and Venice Beach. Dip those toes in the Pacific. Head north up the coast hwy to San Fran. Boom

travel,3cvrg0,kdunks,2,Sat Jul 11 06:39:29 2015 UTC,"A little to add on to what /u/shag66 said:  If you're going to do the Fremont street experience, start at the east end beyond all the lights and bling. Heading east, there'll be a giant metal praying mantis at container park, its worth it to stop for a few minutes and catch a little of the drum show, and if you're hungry, there's a burrito place inside container park that's decent and not exorbitant pricewise. The park itself is kinda cool, its a little shopping center built from old metal storage containers, you can look while you eat if you're so inclined. Do the Fremont street thing, and when you're walking back if youre not too drunk you can stop at a bar called atomic. Its more of a casual local bar, but its kinda cool because it was built in the 50's and people used to watch the nuclear tests from its roof.   Last thing: from my own personal experience driving on  PCH (highway 1) from Santa Monica to San Francisco takes a fucking long time, and if you really want to relax and enjoy it I'd recommend taking two days to do it and stopping at pismo beach or slo for the night. We tried to do it in a day and it kinda ruined the end part for us, since we were rushing by the end to get to where we were going and couldn't enjoy the scenery. The second time with my family was spread over two days, and was much much better. :)"

Took about 20 minutes. Apparently it may take a little longer if you don't have an approval number beforehand. Very small chance you will be denied though (hence recommended to get the approval number beforehand). If you do opt to just get the visa on arrival (without pre-approval) have some kind of itinerary to show them your plans for your visit to allay any of their concerns."
travel,3cuwws,dswphoto,2,Sat Jul 11 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"Okay so i'm currently living in Australia and on the Australian Iranian Embassys website it states you need:   Reserved itinerary (would this mean just flights or do i need to book accommodation too? How can accommodation be booked given the hotels i want to stay at don't have online booking?) Proof of an adequate medical travel insurance coverage from Iranian or Foreign Insurance Agents to allow smooth processing of their application (is there a specific ""Foreign Insurance Agent"" that should be used, or will any travel insurance do?) Tourist and pilgrimage visa applicants who are not eligible for Airport Visa are required to apply to get a Visa Reference Number before lodging their visa application to Iranian Embassy in Canberra. To obtain a Visa Reference Number you should send a copy of your passport to your invitee (sponsor) in Iran. Your invitee (sponsor) can go to a travel agent in Iran and fill invitation form. After processing and approval of form by Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs you will receive a Visa Reference Number. (I don't understand this point.  I am eligible for a Airport Visa but online advice recommends getting a Visa Reference Number.  Also what is this about requiring a sponsor?)   So I can either get a Airport Visa (without pre approval) or I can apply for a tourist visa at an Iranian embassy (which is really just applying for a Visa Reference Number)?  EDIT: Its really confusing reading online about visas, reading about the Airport Visa on the NZ embassys website makes it look like you can just show up, pay your fees and thats it.  The embassy in Australias website says for the Airport Visa you need the address and contact numbers of where your staying, invitation letter and hotel booking confirmation for the duration of your stay.  I have applied for tourist and long term visas before for various countries, but damn Iran is confusing and there is so much uncertainty."

I am not saying the city is not nice, but you need to consider this in your choice.   Among the other three I would choose Paris or Rome, there is more to see in those two if you haven't been there already. Rome if you like history more, Paris if you like art more. Both are nice and there is more than enough to do in 3 days in each. Venice is nice, but I would not make that my primary destination if I had to choose only one."

travel,3cx2mr,blake22222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Reykjavik will likely be the cheapest option upfront considering the airfare will be about half that of the others. Having said that, you will have to pay to do any excursions (Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, etc). 3 days would be a great amount of time to see the basics that Iceland has, and it will likely make you want to return again.   Paris can not be done in 3 days, in my opinion. It deserves more time and respect than a quick long weekend trip. Truly one of the most magnificent places on Earth. Very similar situation with Rome, it will likely need more than 3 days to be satisfied. August is also an extremely hot time to visit.   Venice would be my second choice behind Iceland. 3 days is a good amount of time to visit around, though it is possible it is too long. There's not a ton to do and if one were so inclined, you could do it all in a day. Though still a wonderful place to relax and take in the scenery.   Tl;dr: If you want a more exciting trip with more nature oriented things, pick Iceland. If you want relaxing and European, take Venice."

travel,3cwbi4,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:24:05 2015 UTC,"Can you post where in the US you are coming from (which airports you can easily fly out of) and where in England you're going? Options and cost will vary a lot depending on the route.   Also, how flexible are your dates? If you need specific dates it will likely cost more and make sense to book far ahead. The week between Christmas and New Year tends to be high (as more people are travelling) - if you can wait to start your trip after New Year's weekend you may find more bargains.   In general - check out the guide to airfare search engines, linked on the sidebar of this sub under ""Departures"".   If you're looking for the cheapest flight, I rec skyscanner.com, since it will show flights for budget airlines that are not picked up by a lot of search engines. Just be careful to check any added costs - some of the budget airlines charge extra for a checked bag, a meal, etc., while some of the mainstream airlines include that in the ticket price.   For transport - depends on where you want to go and what you want to do there. You can rent a car, but be aware that gas is probably about 3-4x the cost you're used to in the US and parking is often expensive as well. There's generally decent and affordable public transit (bus and train), but if you are doing a fast-paced trip and want to see more rural areas, the extra cost of a private car may make sense."

What is the best airline to ride for a trip overseas? (I am in the US.)   Doesn't really matter for transatlantic. If you're going for a cheaper price, then you can fly Norwegian (budget airline). Some legacy airlines offer decent fares."
travel,3cwagq,onsuchafullsea,3,Sat Jul 11 08:49:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say, but IMO some of those days will be impossible. You're trying to fit in too many things that are too far apart, and you won't do justice to any of them if you try to keep this schedule.  First, keep in mind that at that time of year the days are pretty short, i.e. <9 hours of daylight, with the sun setting at 4-4:30pm.  It's probably a typo, but on Monday 11/23 you have Dun Aengus, which is on Inishmore. Even if you move that to the Galway part of the trip, the ferry schedule is very limited at that time of year, and you'd have to devote a full day to it.  On Tuesday, if you went to Blarney Castle first thing in the morning, and spent just an hour, it's at least a 2 hour drive to Glengarriff for Garnish Island. Again, the ferry schedule will probably be limited, and you need at least an hour on the island. By the time you get to the Ring of Kerry it will probably be dark. Personally, I would skip Blarney Castle.   Wednesday, again I think you have too many stops, and unless you only spend 10 minutes at each, I'd consider skipping at least half of them.  Thursday I'd focus on Newgrange and skip the rest. It will take you 3 hours to get there, and it's worth taking your time once you get there. Go to the other sites if you still have some daylight left.  Rental cars in Ireland do not come with GPS, and it's an expensive add-on. I'm renting a car when I go in September and plan on just using Google maps. My carrier is T-Mobile so, in theory, I should have data service there, even if it's slow. I'll also have a paper map.  Having lived in Ireland for several years, my best advice is this: Driving times are always longer than you expect. My rule of thumb is 1 min/km, or double whatever a local tells you."

travel,3cwagq,justaskosh,2,Sat Jul 11 08:49:19 2015 UTC,"Your Sunday schedule in Dublin, in particular, seems a bit overly ambitious.   To begin with, Chester Beatty opens on Sundays at 1p (I think you can do Dublin Castle at noon, though). I spent probably about 2 hours in Chester Beatty and maybe an hour in Dublin Castle. I highly recommend stopping by the Queen of Tarts either before or after you stop off at Chester Beatty/Dublin Castle (excellent food and cakes that I still crave), so figure that's four hours right there. It'll be another 30 minutes or so in travel to Christ Church Cathedral, depending on how you travel and, what, maybe an hour in the cathedral? So you're up to 5.5 hours. From the cathedral to the Guinness Storehouse is at least another 30 minutes or so if you're walking, and I believe I spent about 90 minutes to two hours in the Storehouse (that's depending on how long you spend at the sky bar with your free pint of Guinness as well as if you buy your tickets in advance). I have no clue how long it will take you to get from the Storehouse to Kilmainham Gaol, but let's say 30 minutes for the sake of argument. Kilmainham Gaol also has a timed entry--I believe we had to find a way to kill 45 minutes between buying our tickets and actually getting inside the prison. So considering the tour is about hour-ish long, you're looking about 2 hours needed for a gaol visit. You're up to about 10 hours at that point with only one stop-off for food (although you can probably kill some of your 45 minutes-ish after buying your timed ticket for Kilmainham getting setting to eat--there's a tea shop at the prison as well as a variety of restaurants within a block of two. Note that most of them are mediocre, at best). You'll need another 30 minutes to get to The Custom House, and I have no idea how long you might spend inside. Then again, it probably doesn't matter since I think it's closed on the weekends. And Kilmainham closes at 6p, so given your schedule I'd be surprised if you made it to the prison before it closes. The only way I could see you doing everything on your list is if you plan take a cab from place to place, and stand outside each location and stare at it for ten minutes before moving on."

You've got quite a busy schedule, nothing that seems outright implausible, but just to say I hope you are aware that you're looking at some busy days, as opposed to taking things a little slowly.   Also, you could probably spend the best part of a day in Glendalough, but again that's just a matter of outlook, ie whether you want to take things slowly or not. You'll also see Grafton Street as you make your way around Dublin in your first two days, it doesn't take long to walk the city at all.  As for food and nightlife, in Dublin you'll definitely want to head to PantiBar, and one of my favourite restaurants is Brasserie 66, highly recommended."

It's an interesting city, it's worth spending some time there, but the rest of the country has too much to offer for you to ignore it completely.  You could spend almost your entire time trekking Aconcagua, if you're in excellent shape already.  The landscape varies considerably. Do you want to see glaciers or salt flats or jungle? In 30d I'd say you have time to explore all those biomes, or you could take a more relaxed pace and enjoy just a couple of regions.  Maybe avoid Mendoza. That was my favorite part of Argentina because it combined the kind of landscape I prefer with good food and great wine, but as you will not enjoy the gastronomy I think you would not appreciate Mendoza nearly as much as most other people."

Are you going around the country by bus or plane? I think the most interesting areas are Buenos Aires, Iguazu Falls, Salta, Mendoza, Puerto Madryn and the Perito Moreno Glaciar. But I'm not sure if you can do all of them in a month if you take the bus.  I would also include Uruguay (Montevideo, Colonia) and Paraguay (Jesuit Missions).   And a good idea is to bring enough dollars because if you change them there the unofficial rate (dolár blue) will be much higher.

There's a big problem with counterfeiting and apparently new hundreds are the hardest to fake. It sounds super shady, but it is extremely common and ordinary throughout the country and especially on Florida Street in BA. The police mostly pretend not to notice, while the cambio dealers do their thing just steps away. You might be able to get an introduction to a cueva with better rates and more discretion and security through a friend or your hotel. Just don't change it all with one guy on the same day.

People in other countries have a very skewed view of life in Africa and its portrayal is pretty unfair. There are a lot of relatively poor people living pretty decent lives in Africa. I'm sure some people think it's all just mud huts or crappy block houses and used cars, but Africa is more modern than most people think.   Some migrants face political violence and racial discrimination in their home country, so it's not only about ""better and easier living"" in Europe and elsewhere.   But, yes, most of them are simply looking for a better life. However, the African migrants on the boats are NOT starving villagers escaping famine and death. They are mostly ambitious, urban, and educated.   They are very poor by European standards, but often comfortable by African ones. That's understandable when you think that it costs over $2,000 to board a boat to Europe (and you need money leftover to make a start). That’s easily a year’s income in many African countries.   Also migrants tend to be well-connected in Europe: They already know people from their home country living and working in Europe. And they tend to choose their European destinations not according to culture, language or history, but according to the number of people they know who are already living there.  But there are plenty of migrants to Europe from other places as well and inter-european migration is also very high - everyone wants a better life, not just Africans. People move all the time from one country to another just for a better job opportunity. It's human nature, it's not because Africa is so god-awful so of course they want to leave... For many living there it's their home and they are proud of it."

To a country that needs the roads/railways but is not necessarily dependent on the resources (yet), it's a great deal because there's almost no cost.  For the Chinese, they get all these resources, and the infrastructure is just another part of getting those things back to China.

These days, it's my favourite 'quick 'n easy' trip, simply because the mountain pretty firmly dictates your route; you don't really have to think. Just hop in the car and go. The town is called Betty's Bay, but (oh the cliché) the journey is just as special as the destination. The mountain in the background is called the Kogelberg, and is a section of the Overberg region. These mountains lie south east of Cape Town,and extend right down to the coastline. As a result, the road that winds along them has some of the most spectacular views of any of the drives in South Africa, almost rivalling the famous Chapman's Peak route closer to the city. Chapman's Peak is the route that most tour operators try to take you along on a Cape Point + Penguins tour (I say try because it is often closed after rain)... and, in an odd twist of fate, the trip to Betty's Bay also features the Cape's other penguin colony!  The colony in Betty's gets far less tourist traffic than Boulders Beach near CT, largely due to proximity, and is currently flourishing (fewer people = less stress on the birds). This is great to see because when I was a kid, a leopard nearly wiped the colony out! These birds are very entertaining to watch but be warned, they're kinda smelly!  Besides the scenic drive, and the penguins, there is also a sand dune in Betty's Bay that makes for a fun climb, is often used for sandboarding, and just offers generally cool views of the sea... and there's the Harold Porter Botanical Gardens, which puts in a great effort despite being quite small. There are two kloofs (gorges) to hike up [Disa is currently closed due to flood damage though] and these lead you into cool dark indigenous forests with amber streams running through them.  The streams taken on this colour due to tannins and phenols leaching out of the roots of the indigenous fynbos, and the water thus tastes delicious! Well, like delicious water anyway. Fun fact, similar chemicals are present in wine.  After the botanical gardens, you have to head for the Kleinmond Harbour (a small sign just as you enter the town, 20 minutes drive from the gardens). This is probably the most popular lunch spot within 40km in either direction, and has gorgeous views and paths that lead down to the ocean.  So, route? From Cape Town, get on the N2 and turn into Gordon's Bay just after Somerset West (the last big intersection before Sir Lowry's Pass). From Gordon's Bay, take Clarence Drive to Rooi Els. This is the ""Wow"" part of the road where it gets right down next to the sea. Stick on Clarence Drive to Betty's Bay, where you will do your exploring while working up an appetite. After Betty's, you guessed it, Clarence Drive takes you to Kleinmond.  From Kleinmond, you can continue in the same direction; eventually you'll find signs taking you back to the N2 and you can head for CT via Sir Lowry's Pass (epic views from the top). I personally prefer to go back the way I came and try to time it so that the sunset gets all up in my business as I'm heading back towards the ocean road... but to each his own. Or do the trip twice :-)"

We sometimes stayed in a rented beach house by the water and sometimes in a hotel on the main strip in town.  It's been years since I have been there, but by August the water should be less frigid.    My brother and his wife went to Provincetown a couple of years ago and had a fabulous time.  They took the ferry from Boston, so they didn't have a car at all and it wasn't a problem.  They stayed in a B&B and thought it was great.    I have been Newport a couple of times as well.  It has a really cute downtown and if you like history, the mansions are interesting to tour.  There are some museums as well, and the oldest synagogue in the US.

However, if you choose not to go, then we will continue to pay for all of your basic living expenses.""  Your friend is an adult and free to make her own decisions.  As an adult she also has to live with the consequences of her actions.  If she is unable to cover basic living expenses, then she probably should not be traveling internationally for pleasure.  The trip is even less likely to be some kind of educational or enlightening experience since it is an organized tour of college students.  I really don't understand how this opportunity can be seen as ""too good to pass up"".  That attitude, combined with being unable to support herself leads me to believe her parents are right."

She's would be traveling with an organized educational tour group.  She has been saving up to move out and has enough money to do all the things. Has no student loans and has paid off the car she bought herself. There is otherwise no pressure to move out but does respect her parents opinions and isn't looking to rock the boat.

travel,3cvizb,6YearsRoundTheWorld,4,Sat Jul 11 04:39:14 2015 UTC,"I still don't see how/why ""the time is right"".  To me, with the very limited information you have supplied, it sounds like she wants to go because friends of hers are going and doesn't want to be left out.  It is a fine and valid reason, but not one where I would risk my financial stability for though.  I believe a trip outside of an organized tour would be more educational or enlightening, even if taken with the same people.  There is a lot more to appreciate when you are not being led around, place to place, without ever having had to put any effort into planning or understanding.  Information sticks with you a lot longer if you have to get it yourself rather than having some guide tell you a story.  If she wanted to move out anyways then let this be the catalyst that initiates that process.  IF she has the means to do the things she wants, then her parents punishment will have no effect. She needs to sit down and have an adult conversation with her parents.    ""I appreciate your concerns and value your opinions.  However as an adult it is time for me to behave as an independent individual.  I would prefer to have your support in this decision, but I will proceed even without your blessing.  I have the income necessary to support myself and my hobbies and have been planning on taking this trip and moving out ..."" blah blah, etc.   How do we convince my friends parents to let her go to Costa Rica with a college tour group?   To answer your original question, you don't need to and may not be able to.

It's tempting to just walk away from this, but perhaps I can help you see why everyone on here is agreeing with her parents.  So to begin with, she's not financially independent.  Sure, she's paying a couple of her bills, but she's not paying for the roof over her head, the electricity, cable, etc.  It's not clear that she's paying for food, and I'm going to guess that if she's still living with her parents, they are in fact paying for the groceries.   Travel is a luxury.  It's a luxury that people on r/travel enjoy. We save money. We scour the internet for cheap flights and hotel rooms. We pay for all this stuff, and we do it on top of our living expenses.  Now sure, yes.  Some people on here live with their parents still; they're young, they're in college, they're still finding their way through the world.  That's fine.  This kind of thing is to be expected.  Your friend, however, is 24. She has her degree. At some point, she needs to take charge of her life and be responsible for herself.  Now this is where r/travel and her parents have intersected.  By this point in time, your friend's parents have supported her for approximately 1/3 of her anticipated lifespan.  I'm sure they want the world for her, but they know she's not going to achieve that by living at home with them.  At some point, we all have to become responsible for ourselves, personally and financially. A 24 year old, particularly one with a good education, should be living on their own and learning to budget, pay their bills, and just generally coming to terms with what it means to be fully in control of their own life.  And if they aren't, that needs to be a priority, not Costa Rica.  Your friend's parents are trying to push her out of the nest because it's time for her to learn to fly and make a nest of her own. She can fly all the way to Costa Rica if she wants.  But, she needs to start making her own nest."

They're obviously irrational if they want to restrict a 24 year old woman from going to Costa Rica, one of the safest countries in the Americas, and are threatening her by making her pay the rent. It's time to decide whether she'll continue to let her parents dominate her life or she will live it herself.

Highlight in Panama City was seeing the Canal and staying in Casco Viejo. Best rooftop bar was at Tantalo.   In Bocas del Toro, we went zip-lining at Red Frog Beach, and hired a boat to take us to Dolphin Bay (didn't see any) and to Coral Cay for snorkeling (great experience). Honestly I would have loved to stay in Bocas for a few more days because there's a lot to do — chocolate farm tours, ATV-ing around Isla Colon, going through the cave on Isla Bastimientos, etc. However everything is weather-dependent, e.g. if it's been raining, the water will not be as clear for snorkeling and if it's raining really heavy, the sailing tours won't go out. Be sure to check the weather forecast! We recommend El Ultimo Refugio for dinner and Aqua Lounge for drinks.   Went rock climbing and hiking in Boquete. Would have loved to do whitewater rafting however they said the water was not high enough (?) — apparently the river is controlled by a dam, or something like that. We did the Lost Waterfalls Hike, but not the hike to Volcan Beru due to time.  BTW getting to Bocas is easy. From Boquete, there is a 4-hr daily shuttle + quick boat ride that is $30/pp total. From Panama City, there is 1-hr flight from the Panama Albrook airport straight to Bocas Town Airport."

travel,3ctye9,PM_ME_YOUR_FAT_PUSSY,3,Fri Jul 10 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"I loved OZ. It's one of the best things I've ever done. I especially liked going to small towns off the beaten path. Even back then people would talk shit on St. Kilda, Surfer's Paradise, Bondi Beach, Ayers Rock, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, or whatever. But I saw those too! All worth it in their own ways.  I feel like NZ was so close that not going when I had the chance was a mistake. Just the airfare from the east coast of the U.S. to that side of the world is so expensive, I should have gone."

So if you actually want to use the ticket, it will be very expensive.  But, yes, refundable tickets are available from virtually every airline, and the vast majority of those don't charge a fee to cancel. I booked a refundable ticket from Seoul to Tokyo on United back in January, and cancelled it a couple weeks after purchase with no fee charged. I also could do the cancellation online. So, assuming you have no plans of actually using this expensive fully refundable ticket, from personal experience I'd suggest going with United. Ease of cancellation, confident there are no fees, no problem with international flights, etc."

travel,3cvg6t,LupineChemist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but, to clarify, only with unrestricted fares. Also did this with Delta back in April 2011. Airlines sell special refundable tickets, but, as I said, they're really expensive. But, what's the purpose of doing this? Do you need the ticket for a visa application, or do you just want to book now to reserve a seat just in case your visa is accepted?  Especially if it's the latter, you're better off just waiting until after the visa process is completed before buying a ticket. Just doing an arbitrary search, an unrestricted fare from New York to Stockholm in September cost more than $4,000 round-trip."

You'll go through Hamburg on the way to Berlin from Copenhagen. Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia and less than an hour from Vienna. Consider a stop in Slovenia or Croatia on the way to Venice.  Overall, you will probably have to cut some cities or have a really good idea of how each travel connection will work if you want to hit all of those in a month and still have time to enjoy the cities."

For transport, I would be using ryanair to fly from Dublin to London then to fly to stockholm. From Stockholm it would be buses and trains until I hit Amsterdam to fly home.

We did take a small detour north to visit Milan too!  I would take the same road trip in a heartbeat.  Driving along the coast is like nothing else!  Also, you're able to stop whenever you want, which is much needed for meals because the restaurants in some of the smaller towns close up shop pretty early.  Having a car in the cities wasn't an issue for us -- we left the car where ever our hotels suggested to park.  There may have been an extra charge in some cases but it was pretty minimal compared to the parking rates we're used to in Los Angeles.  I am so excited for you!

Typically you don't need to buy the rental insurance but you need to do your own research for that.   Can you drive a stick?

Some people would probably say you're crazy and that running away won't solve your problems, but I think when you get out of a long-term relationship, you may need to hit the reset button and get away for awhile. You'll figure out who you are on your own (instead of being part of a couple). The hardships you face while trying to make this all work could also be a nice distraction from the breakup as well. You just gotta do what's right for you. Maybe a week in Paris is all you need."

I'm not expecting my life to be forever changed or that I'll achieve nirvana by backpacking, but I definitely need to hit the reset button.

It doesn't seem like you are running away, but rather that you are starting the next chapter. You might consider the idea of working for a couple months and traveling for a few in a rotating basis. Some of the best times I've had while out and about have been while working. Picked almonds in Australia, worked at a dive shop in Thailand... It wasn't ever real hard to find work.  Seasonal type work is easier to find, so knowing what the ""season"" is where you are (or where you want to go) helps. The crew I worked with in AUS was from all over the world, and great fun.  My plan was always to travel until I had a certain amount of money left (a reasonable cushion, and always enough to get ""home"" if I needed to quickly), and to have a job or something lined up by then. Sometimes I worked for a month, sometimes a week. I found that working for ""trade"" (room and board, etc) is a worse deal financially. Don't look for a ""job"", look for ""work"". I was able to travel for almost 2 years, left home with about $10k (USD) and got home with about 5k. I probably worked 1/4 of my time at most, and never more than a month at a time. Looking back on it, most of my best memories of that time were at the jobs I had, rather than the ""tourist/travel"" stuff. Now I have a job that pays me to travel to work, to amazing places that people don't get to be tourists. If I hadn't done that previous working/traveling, I never would have gotten this job.  (humblebrag, but I get to move to India this fall with my Swedish girlfriend, who I met in Africa.)  Follow the dream!"

I learnt a lot about myself and came back home with a better outlook on life. I think you'll find that at a certain point, you may get homesick. But as soon as you get back home all you're going to be able to think about is life on the road. It's honestly addicting to live day to day.

travel,3ctgf3,nickriel,5,Fri Jul 10 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry that happened to you. Glad you have the insurance. Here are a few tips from my experience: 1) Get detailed bills for everything, translated into English, if possible. 2) Start the claim process with the insurance company as soon as you can... it's not a huge rush, but it's nice to get it going. You might want to call them so they can walk you through what you will need to do. 3) Your insurance is probably (but you should check) secondary to your primary normal insurance at home, so you may have to submit a claim through your primary insurance first and then send the travel insurance people the EOB.  4) if you can pay via credit card, I would do that because you'll have more of a paper trail of what you paid than you would with cash... but sometimes they don't take credit cards, so you do what you can.  hope you feel better soon and the claim is resolved quickly and easily."
travel,3ctgf3,theechoofyourname,3,Fri Jul 10 17:21:57 2015 UTC,I second this.  I was grateful for travel insurance when I ended up in the ER with my son on an international trip. Call the insurance company as you are waiting in the ER to let them know you are there and confirm everything you will need to get from the doctor.  My primary insurance at the time did not cover anything other than life threatening emergencies.  I submitted my claim directly to the travel insurance company.  It was an easy process and I received a check within a few weeks.

travel,3ctgf3,Leonichol,3,Fri Jul 10 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"And not only have travel insurance but monitor your health and skin. Get treatment asap if you notice anything going on unusual, doing this will prevent complications if you wait for treatment thinking it'll get better by itself. Perhaps an OTC antibiotic cream could have prevented you from getting cellulitis had you treated the condition at first symptoms.  Yup I'm a nurse. I saw a guy in a hostel with bad cellulitis and an oozing sore. When I asked him what happened he said he'd been surfing and hit his foot and legs on the coral about a month ago.

If you can get your bags checked all the way through to Paris London, and can obtain your boarding pass either at departure or at a transfer desk in Paris (I don't know CDG's layout), you will go through immigration in Reykjavík, immigration (or rather emigration) again in Paris, and then customs and immigration again in London.  More likely, you will go through immigration in Reykjavík and customs in Paris. You will then have to check-in again at Air France, then go through emigration in Paris and then customs and immigration again in London.  On the way back to Paris, you'll go through French immigration and customs in London prior to getting on the train at St. Pancras. This is part of an agreement between the UK and France so that when you arrive in Paris, you'll just step off and go about your day without any further checkpoints."

With that said, I would say HCMC feels more foreign from a western perspective because it doesn't attract as many tourists and therefore the city doesn't conform as much to western tastes.  The downside I've felt personally was that it is a little harder to live there because English isn't nearly as well spoken there compared to Thailand.  Because of that, I got ripped off a lot from taking taxis and ordering food from restaurants consisted of pointing at food.  But to end it off on a good note, I still enjoyed the time I spent in Vietnam and the language barrier just forces you to adapt to a new language."

Its markets are different, there aren't massage places on every corner, and you can read (if not understand) the signage. Advertising seems more discreet. Saigon's a little less fashionable than Bangkok, in various ways, and probably more conservative, too. Bangkok certainly has the better contemporary art scene, though you can find cool stuff going on in Saigon as well. There feels like a bit more of a police presence in Saigon. Though both cities are huge, Saigon feels more walkable -- crossing the street ain't that bad, you'll quickly get used to it.  It's a cool city and I wouldn't mind spending a lot of time there. Its food culture rivals Bangkok's - I might rate Saigon a bit higher, in fact. I love banh mi, it's a revelation!"

No offense but as a single man walking around there trying to pick up women you are going to come off as a little bit of a creeper being there by yourself. Maybe you loved it on your honeymoon because you got to go back to your room and have sex with your wife every night but unless you are extremely goodlooking, all the women are going to be running around the nightclubs at night trying to infiltrate the business guys with bottle service and will not be in your bed.

They tell you what hotel it is right after you book. Usually the rooms are the base level, but I have had good luck tipping the concierge for a better room. Look up ""$20 trick"" and they will show you how people do it. They upgraded me from the standard Venetian room to one on the 44th floor of Palazzo facing the strip earlier this year.

Remember, Boston is the hub of Wow Airlines (Iceland). It can take you to the capital of Iceland for around $310 - $330 R/T.

If you cant find Air Berlin stats in Google Flights, try their official website that should have these airfares.   For flights to Florence from Iceland, it may cost you $550 or more therefore I will skip flying directly to the Florence Airport. However, landing at Rome or Milan, you will need to take a train to Poggibonsi, which has a direct bus connection to San Gimignano. The bus leaves hourly.

If you want to do the Inka Trail to Machu Picchu you have to go with a tour operator (G Adventures were great) and permits usually sell out months in advance. But you can (at least with G) also do the Lares Trek, which doesn't arrive at Machu Picchu, but is one of the best treks around and doesn't require a permit. Foodwise, yes, Lima has great food (go for Ceviche, which is their famous sea food). But otherwise Lima the Grey is imo not the greatest city (I say that though as someone who really doesn't like cities at all). Also I would recommend trying cuy (guinea pig). 1 day is usually enough to acclimatise although altitude sickness can still hit you (it hit me on the highest point on the Inka Trail, when I'd already been around Cusco for almost a week).   In Peru I would really try and see loads of the archaeological sites and have a guide tell you about them, because they're really interesting!

travel,3ct3bq,showtime8-24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"Who is selling the vacation package you're looking into, an airline or a third-party supplier? I ask because hotel and airline yield management works differently. Hotel prices have much more volatility before the date and time of departure arrives; it's much more likely to snag a good last-minute hotel rate than a good last-minute flight price. Airlines, on the other hand, tend to change slowly over time before increasing sharply in the weeks right before your vacation.   Also, domestic vs. international airfare pricing works differently, and Canadian airfares vs. U.S. airfares are also quite different. U.S. airlines have more pricing volatility than Canadian ones, for instance. International flight booking tends to be cheaper on weekends; domestic flight booking tends to be cheaper in the middle of the week.  Basically, what I'm saying is, there are too many unknowns (including date, destination, and origin) to know when the cheapest day to book your specific flight or vacation package is. :D"

If you take the travel time into consideration, plus you will also want time to relax, you will end up with less than a day to see each destination.  You get so much more out of your holidays if you spend at least 3 days in a place. I would recommend to visit 6-7 places.  How are you travelling? All by train?

Small place, and a bit of a walk to the city center, but I enjoyed it. Hungout with the hostel staff one night doing shots of Slovene honey brandy.   The free walking tour is a must. They meet daily at Preseren Square. Make sure you go to Metelkova, which is an ex-Yugoslav military base turned art squat. Very interesting. I spent a decent portion of my first day at a cafe by the river just people watching.   Bled: Stay at Jazz Hostel! Janez, the owner, is a terrific guy--super enthusiastic about Bled. He will give you a bunch of things to do, and may join you for drinks at the adjacent bar in the evening. Best suggestion: get a few bottles of wine from the corner market and rent a rowboat. Drink said wine and row out to the castle in the middle of the lake. Try to be sober enough to row back.   Never made it to Piran, but I've been told great things. Have fun!"

I only bought this specific ticket because it was over $100 cheaper than others at the time (I was only flying to ATL, planned to get off at the layover).  I figured I could put aside my hate for Delta for one flight since the price was so different. But I was wrong.  I usually avoid Delta alltogether for many reasons. I have paid more to not fly them before. I was just seeing dollar bills this time I guess. Plus it was a nonstop to ATL, so double bonus. Except not now.  Also, I'm not flying again any time in the near future, and I'm not sure when those credits expire.   tl;dr Delta sucks and I'm dumb but if your name is Kris and you want to go for free, have at it.  EDIT: Yes I hate Delta, but despite that I still can't use the ticket. There's nothing I can change the flight to that would match what I need, and the credit would expire before I would fly again. I already rebooked another ticket with a different carrier, so no matter what the ticket I'm offering here on Reddit will not be used. I should not have said I hate Delta, because even if I loved the carrier, that would not change the current situation with this ticket.

Since most of my trips are 7+ hours long, after one particularly painful 10hr ride I decided ""Fuck it.""

Check out the Queen Victoria markets. I spend ages there every time I'm in Melbourne. It's got everything from clothes to toys to pets to electronics. The National gallery of Victoria is cool too.   As for Brisbane, I'm kinda meh about it. Nice place, but I wouldn't call it Australia's Las Vegas. I'd definitely check out the Gold Coast, just south of Brisbane, though.

I really liked Darling Harbour, especially at night and loved Bondi. I really liked The Ivy and Rockpool.  2) We spent a few days at the Blue Mountains. Rent a cabin and spend your time hiking and taking a tour of the Jenolan caves. It's feasible to do a day trip, but you'll be missing out on a lot and it might not be worth your time. Try to spend at least 1 night there.  3) You're definitely not going to be able to do Melb and Cairns. I'd recommend heading straight from Sydney to Cairns and spending a few days there OR going to Melb and the Great Ocean Road.  4) Brisbane is a hole...skip that and go to the Gold Coast. From there you can make day trips to Byron Bay, Nimbin and Australia Zoo in Beerwah."
travel,3ct368,alan_s,2,Fri Jul 10 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"On your Victorian section.   Friday/Saturday/Sunday - Great Ocean Road. I want to drive from Sydney to Melbourne (I like road trips) and see the Great Ocean Road. Where is there a good place to stop and camp along the way? Also, I want to go past Melbourne and see the 12 Apostles. Any ideas for timing all of this?   Sunday night I believe will be spent in a hotel in Melbourne. What's good in Melbourne? I heard it was rated one of the best places to live in the world. Should we spend more time there?    The GOR is past Melbourne and the Apostles are near the Port Campbell end of it. That is going to be a lot of driving in a short time. I like road trips too (I did 5000km from the Tweed Coast to Melbourne via South Australia and back over Christmas - but I took a month to do it) but I suggest that is far too much in just three or four days. Either spend much longer and enjoy the trip to Melbourne, dropping in on Canberra and some of the smaller towns such as Gundagai or Wagga Wagga along the way, or fly cheaply to Melbourne and rent a car there. Pick it up at Tullamarine Airport and return it on departure; much cheaper than a one way rental.    Brisbane - Buddy who recommended the Blue Mountains studied abroad for a semester in Wollongong and said Brisbane was like Australia's Las Vegas. Should we try to spend some time there?    Your friend has a sense of humour. Some call it Brisvegas but it bears as much relationship to Vegas as San Francisco does :)   However, it is worth dropping in if you have time, but as a stop en-route to the Gold Coast, the Tweed Coast and Byron Bay. Google them for more info on attractions.  I really think you are trying to fit in too much in that short period. Consider dropping at least one of Brisbane, Melbourne or Cairns."

travel,3ct368,meoworawr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"I posted this on the weekly topic noted in the automoderator's post. I suggest you read the rest of that weekly topic too.  Planning for jet-lag is important because we are a long way from anywhere. Set your watch to Sydney time as soon as you settle in your seat on the plane. Think in that time from then on. That will help with jet-lag on arrival. Do the same in reverse going home. Wear slip-on shoes; much easier if you need to remove them in security and also easy to take off on board because your feet will swell on the long flights. Wear thick socks for walking the aisles every few hours to avoid DVT but watch where you step in the restrooms or you'll have damp feet.  Get an aisle seat. Yes, you'll be disturbed occasionally when those beside you need to get out, but it's far better to have the freedom to move any time you wish. It is also much easier to get access to the overhead lockers when you need something. I get to know the people beside me well enough to remind them politely to use the restrooms before going to sleep. Not always possible, but that can reduce the number of times they disturb you after that.  Do not plan anything important on arrival day or evening. Just relax, look around the place, and stay awake until after dinner before going to sleep.  Apart from your planned activities try to do some day or half-day trips. Search on the following for more details:       Manly (take the Ferry and go outy on deck for spectacular Harbour shots)     Watsons Bay and the Gap (also take the Ferry but note that the last ferry back leaves in the early afternon; I enjoyed taking the bus from the Gap to Bondi after the ferry left).

travel,3cucai,I_RAPE_ARMPITS,3,Fri Jul 10 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"For a few of the questions:   Can I use my visa card over there?   Yes, but you should notify your bank(s) of your travel beforehand so their fraud protection systems don't block your card.   Will it simply do the currency exchange at restaurants and other things?   Yes, it will do it automatically. Note, however, that some credit card companies will charge a fee, up to 3%, on charges in foreign currencies. Ask your bank about that. There are many no-fee cards, like CapitalOne cards (some free), the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 fee, waived first year), and the Citi Premier ($95 annual fee, waived first year), that might interest you.   How's the public transportation in the cities I'm visiting?   Aside from New York City, the public transportation in virtually any European city, including those you mentioned, will be better than what you'd get in the U.S.   I'll be gone two weeks so are laundry mats somewhat easy to find?   Note that some hostels will even have laundry facilities.   I only speak English so how hard is it to communicate in those countries?   Not everyone speaks English obviously, but you can survive on English just fine in most parts of Europe (although Eastern Europe is a bit harder) and, in fact, much of the world.

Apparently the light to dark brown roaches are attracted to light...and are hard to kill. Hit the roach twice with a shoe, bug juices were on the wall and the thing was still moving towards me! I don't know how I wasn't screaming through all of this because it felt like I was having a stroke. I finally sprayed the sucker with hair spray and put a heavy ceramic bowl over it.

travel,3cn5cx,gingavida,20,Fri Jul 10 04:34:23 2015 UTC,"Holy cow! I posted this before I went to bed, just woke up to these responses.   Alright I hope this answers everyones questions.   First things first I researched THE HELL out of the entire area, I went on online Haiti travel threads to see what people said and where to go stay.   I landed at Cap-Haitien airport (I chose that because it was closer to the Citadelle and Palace that I wanted to see), as soon as I landed there was a Haitian band at the airport playing music, I read in Conde Naste and Nat Geo Traveler that Haiti wants to be the next ""hot"" tourist destination, so the island seems really friendly and welcoming to tourists. I took the first cab I saw in front of the airport and asked him to take me to my hotel, then my entire life changed....  The drive from the airport to my hotel (Hotel Mont Joli) is...overwhelming to say the least, I always saw pictures of poverty in Haiti but NOTHING can prepare you for when you see it right in front of you. 9-10 year old kids walking around alone, piles of garbage, and small fires. My cab driver asked me if I came with a missionary, I said no, he asked me if I was going to Labadee (the private resort to the north), I said no, I told him I wanted to see the country, the citadelle and eat Haitian food. My cab drivers tone immediately changed, he seemed surprised someone just wanted to see Haiti. He said he could take me to the Citadelle in the morning and he would pick me up in the morning.   I got to my hotel and ran into several Christian missionaries there, everyone was very friendly. The next day my cab driver was on time and we drove to the Citadelle, on the way there the island went from scary to beautiful. People smiled and said ""Bonjour"", people were selling fruit and food by the road and I overpaid for EVERYTHING, bananas were $1 (USD) I gave the woman $10 and told her to keep the change. I saw the Citadelle and Palace Sans-Souci and went back to my hotel to watch the final Womens World Cup game, the hotel bar was filled with Haitians, missionaries and UN soldiers watching the game (that was pretty exciting).   The next morning I flew to Port-Au-Prince and took a cab to a restaurant called The View, when I got their the View was closed, I was a bit disappointed, so I took a cab back to the airport.   TL;DR- The ride from the airport to the hotel is overwhelming to say the least. -I did not take pictures of extreme poverty, what is a ""cool shot"" to me is someones elses house/home.  -If anyone is interested in seeing the country send me a private message I have the email address of the man who took me on the tour I can gladly give you.   -If you are thinking of NOT taking a donkey up to the Citadelle and walking to be a man-of-the-people, please DONT. Everyone wanted me to ride a donkey because thats where they make their money.   -Pretty much everyone I ran into spoke 3 different languages, French, English and Spanish, so it helps being trilingual in Haiti.   -Apps that helped me 1) Currency Converter and 2) City Maps 2 Go"

Like a one way ticket on a bus to a city 5 miles down the road was 5 euro (this was when the euro was almost 2 to 1 for the dollar so I laughed and just walked instead). I was in Corfu for a while and there were basically no tourists so everyone was really nice to us and wanted us to come to their restaurants/shops/ etc. but you got the feeling that is was kind of total desperation. And when we were supposed to leave there was a huge riot and no ferries were going back to the mainland and when I went to ask the police if there was anyway to go back they were like ""No, we don't get paid to stop this"" so we had to convince some truck drivers to let us come on their ferry.

travel,3cn5cx,unboundly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:24:25 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that people on r/travel would tell someone NOT to go somewhere. Haiti is a beautiful and stunning country, and way different than any other country that your typical traveler would visit.  It's a difficult country, and not for the feint of heart, but it is navigable by even novice travelers, as long as you are willing to sacrifice comfort (because lets face it, Haiti is uncomfortable even for the most experienced.). When people think of Haiti, they think of poverty, but it is so much more than that!  Haiti has History. Sans Souci and the Citadel (both UNESCO WHS) are among the most amazing places I have ever been in my life. The Haitians defeated Napoleon. NAPOLEON! Everyone talks about how Napoleon's downfall was his invasion of Russia, they don't talk about his disastrous attempt to reconquest Haiti. (And thanks to the Haitians, we now have New Orleans).  Haiti has Geography. It is the most mountainous country in the Caribbean. Like a tropical Colorado (no snow though). Plus, it is littered with hidden beaches along it's 1800Km of coastline. Beautiful!  Haiti has culture. Its the only republic created from a slave rebellion. A mix of African, French, Spanish, and American influences make the people, culture, and language of Haiti among the most unique in the world. Plus, voudou! How cool is that?  Haiti has food. It  gets boring if you live there, but Haitian cuisine is amazing. Not unlike other areas of the Caribbean, but with its own special flare.  Haiti is safe. People always thing Haiti as a dangerous place. It is if you are a rich Haitian or a Haitian American. But for the rest of us westerners, it's extremely safe. Haitian criminals leave westerners alone. Cops, though extremely corrupt, are not going to haggle you for a bribe. The rest of Haitians will treat you like you are a fucking god from lòt bò a (the other side). And if for some reason, shit does hit the fan, you have the UN peace keeping force, MINUSTAH, there to help you out of any bind.  Congrats on the trip, OP. I hope this brings other travelers to go to Haiti. It's worth the trip, even if it isn't a very tourist friendly place."

travel,3cs9a6,jippiejee,2,Fri Jul 10 10:49:27 2015 UTC,"In May I was in both cities as a tourist and I found the Dutch train system so convenient and simple that it would be easy to see both.  You can just show up at the train station and find the next train in that direction (google maps works great along with the Dutch train planning app) and the rides are short so travel time is really a non-issue.  Obviously the cities are very different so you won't be duplicating your experience.  Sort of related tip, if you don't have a SIM card for internet access, it's really helpful to buy a cheap one just for transit planning on the go!  Especially when you only have a bit of time in a city, catching a convenient bus instead of walking 2 km saves valuable time.  Rotterdam has a lot going on across the city so i'd recommend doing your research and planning your stay so see exactly what you want.  To me, it didn't seem to have the clear 'MUST SEE' attractions but instead had a wide array of interesting things to see depending what you are interested in.  I found it a bit overwhelming to decide what to see!  We only spend 1 day in the Hague but i feel like we got a decent taste for what's happening there.  We visited the Binnenhof, Escher museum, Peace Palace and Madurodam in one day without too much stress, mostly on foot plus we walked the restaurant/bar area and tried some things."

It all comes down to what sort of trip you're looking for, and how much time you want to spend in each place.  If you've been to Central America, you know that it takes plenty of time to travel between places by bus.  I absolutely loved Ometepe, and would recommend spending 3 days there.  Add in probably 2 days in Granada, and a day to bus between the countries, and you only have a couple days to spend in Costa Rica. Is it worth it to go there if you can only really see one place?

The area has three cities, most people don't go to Gdynia, but Sopot is good for a relaxing afternoon.  Grab a coffee downtown, take a walk down the pier, if you're brave enough take a dip in the Baltic (I have friends that swam year-round).  In Gdansk, there are numerous museums, delicious food.  If you take a ferry ride from the city center, you can get to Westerplatte, which is where the Nazi invasion of Poland started.  About an hour south, you have one of the biggest Teutonic Knight castles called Malbork. It was renovated since the WWs, but still incredibly impressive.

There are hundreds of bikes for sale in Hanoi so i would recommend starting there.  Most hostels have a notice board with people selling. We stayed in a hostel called flipside which was really cool and had about 20 for sale on the notice board when we were there. Nearly every single one was 250 dollars.  From Hanoi you can do the northern loop, then come down the coast to Halong (although i massively recommend Cat Ba instead of Halong bay - it's exactly the same except much quieter and much more chilled) - then you can drive the coast and south."

I want to visit Sapa and Hao Long Bay as well.
travel,3crw5x,canuckerlimey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:23:01 2015 UTC,Yeah either way would be good. I'd check the weather in the north for the end of may though cause if it gets worse then I'd maybe do north to south.   We had a month and it was fine. Wasn't a big fan of sapa. Preferred the far north east. Was much more authentic and less touristy. Sapa is insanely touristy. Same with hoi An. But hoi An is still beautiful.   Halong is the most touristy place I've ever been. I really recommend going to cat ba instead. It's an extension of Halong bay and is exactly the same. Except hardly any tourists and just beuatiful to kayak and mess around in.

That delay was only for about 3 hours and they even gave us a meal/drink voucher. Best spaghetti bolognese I've ever had was at the Lalibela airport! (I might also have fairly low standards).  I had a fairly tight timeline, so I didn't even consider travel by road. From what I understand, the roads outside Addis are awful (if they exist) and a trip one might expect to take hours in a developed country takes days in Ethiopia. There are no trains either, so I'd highly recommend air travel personally. I am willing to spend a few more dollars and gain a WHOLE lot more time in experiencing the destinations and outlying areas.

There's nothing different about departing from an international terminal vs. a domestic terminal in the U.S. You go through security, but now you have to show your passport. It's a short walk from Terminal D (where Delta is) to Terminal E (where the international terminals are). The walk would take less than five minutes after you exit security in Terminal D.  Even with the separate tickets, you'd have to be fairly unlucky to miss this connection. It's a bit risky, but with nothing you can do about it now, I don't think you should worry about it.

I know this is an unpopular opinion, and every time I bring it up people bring up how buying products from China is ""kinda the same thing"" I just completely disagree."
travel,3cqzlx,uReallyShouldTrustMe,2,Fri Jul 10 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"I recently visited the DPRK. I totally hear where you're coming from and respect that opinion, and I'd like to offer mine to the mix. It's not the ""China is the same!"" argument, I assure you.  I believe tourism to the DPRK will play a role in the downfall of the regime. I believe this because as more and more tourists visit the country, they're demanding more and more access...and the government seems to be granting it. Things aren't nearly as locked down as the tours I heard stories about from five years ago. Travel groups who bring the tours in are constantly scouting for new sites to see and places to stay and putting a lot of pressure on the government to let them do so. Simon Cockerell, the man from Koryo Tours who is quoted in this article, is one of the people doing that! I've only met him briefly, but he has a reputation for pushing the DPRK to open new areas of the country to tourists.  While all this is happening, Koreans are getting more and more exposure to foreigners...and here's where the good stuff happens. During my short visit, I was able to interact with many Koreans. My interactions were not limited or watched over by anyone. In many cases it was just me walking around by myself with a bunch of Koreans. This occurred both in Pyongyang and outside in some of the poorer areas, and all of these interactions were incredibly positive. Lots of smiling, shaking hands, attempting each other's languages, etc.  The regime has created this narrative about the outside world - that it's dangerous and cruel and decadent and soulless. Each Korean that I interacted with has another piece of evidence that their government is lying to them. Multiply that by thousands of tourists and you have a people who see through the narrative and start questioning more and more of what they hear.  More connections to the outside will also bring more corruption for government and military officials, which is a good thing for the DPRK, ultimately! The more the regime's power is questioned or weakened, the better chance there is that the people will start pushing back. There are already signs that the regime is cautiously testing the ideas of backing away from some of their control - kinda like China has - and all it may take is an emboldened people to speed that process along.  So in the end, I personally believe that foreign travel to the DPRK will help to bring about change. Yes, some of the money goes to the regime. But some of it also goes to feeding and clothing the beautiful people of that country, and if it gets them one step closer to a freer and more open society, I think the good will outweigh the bad.  Just my opinion, though!"
travel,3cqzlx,glitterlok,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:47:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input and for keeping it civil. I am sure my opinion is skewed by having lived in South Korea for a few years. But, here is my argument. They are actually not as ignorant about the outside world as people seem to think. They are actually learning quite a bit from smuggled goods and media. The recent AMA of a defector proves that. But the South regularly gets defectors who verify this (however, they rarely speak English like the guy in the AMA).    To me, the biggest difference is that the DPRK is at the brink of economic collapse (especially with the current drought) and really cannot support its massive army and weapons programs without outside help. There is actual a real shot of change and in the near future by internal pressure. One of the few sources of income is tourism. If I were allowed to move without supervision, I could chose to support whatever North Koreans I wanted, and not the elite few who have access to those dollars. With Koryo or Young Pioneers (who actually is far more active about pushing for more freedom in tours), the money flow is centralized. If I pay 2000 euro or whatever ridiculous price they are asking for, I can be assured a huge amount of that is going to a missile, not to feed anyone. The only way I can really imagine it doing more good than bad is if you speak Korean and can actually talk to the population. I speak basic Korean, but not fluently enough to have a meaningful conversation, and would be totally lost with how different the south vocabulary has diverged. I read this blog a while back of an American who speaks Korean who went to the north and was able to have a conversation with a tour guide who broke character when she was out of ear shot. She was very curious about the South and I do think this might actually cause some good. In the end, your heart is in the right place, so I won't judge you for your decision. It was actually my #1 bucket list place until I just couldn't talk myself to do it."

I saw many examples of just how aware they are of the outside world.   and would be totally lost with how different the south vocabulary has diverged.   Funny you mention that. I speak...the smallest amount of Korean ever. When I got to the DPRK I made a few attempts and the Korean people I was speaking with immediately called me out for my ""South Korean."" (They weren't upset or anything - just asked ""Oh, you've been to Seoul?"") I knew they were different, but I didn't expect it to be that drastically different.  Thanks for the great response! Either way you slice it, I think we both ultimately want the same thing for the Korean people. Here's hoping they get it, however it comes!"

travel,3cqez7,moderatelyremarkable,2,Fri Jul 10 07:45:29 2015 UTC,"There are countless options for hiking in Romania's Carpathian Mountains. Considering your request, I'd recommend the following: go to the mountain resort of Busteni (located in the Prahova Valley) and from there take the cable car to Babele. From Babele you can do a nice little hike to the Caraiman Cross, 36m high and the tallest summit cross in the world (elevation 2,291m); more details about it here. On a clear day the views of the mountains and the resorts below are stunning; the hike is pretty easy, about 1 - 1.5 hrs each way. The general Babele area is also pretty cool and is a site of significance in its own right. You can spend some time exploring it. You will return the same way back to Busteni. Busteni is nice, you cand spend a bit of time there as well. The views of the mountains above it are also pretty cool.  Another option is to take the cable car from Sinaia (located right next to Busteni) to cota 2000 (elevation 2,000m), hike down to cota 1400 (around 1.5 - 2 hours) and take the cable car back to Sinaia from there. Sinaia is the nicest resort in the area, having undergone some recent restoration and infrastructure work.   Both hiking routes should be clearly marked, but feel free to ask around to be sure. As always, weather can be unpredictible in the mountains, check the forecast first and be prepared.   If you choose either of the options above, be sure to visit the beautiful Peles Castle in Sinaia.   There may be crowds, though (esp. for the cable car), so I recommend you avoid the weekends; driving to the Prahova Valley will also take time if you go during the weekends. Let me know if you have any other questions."

So the Sinaia hike is just off our planned path.  I think that will work out great.  We'll look into Babele as well as that sounds like a great hike.  Thanks so much.

TripAdvisor is obviously open to being gamed to an extent but a smart user can read between the lines and figure out how much the information can be relied upon. I just spent 2 months in Europe and used TA all throughout to get inspired and my experiences very rarely differed from the reviewers. TA is also much more than the listings.

If you aren't happy with a hotel and write twenty paragraphs detailing everything down to the kind of soap in your room, and most other responses are from people who had a good experience, you are probably nitpicky and I don't care what you have to say.  Same with people who write flowery reviews lacking in specifics, if there aren't many other reviews that are similar, or if they don't have enough of a post history to be reliable.

You note that yourself:   Of course, going out in bad weather can only go so far – it’s not necessarily safe to be out in a thunderstorm, a blizzard, or a hail storm   Not surprisingly most of us focused on the erroneous title and did not read further. That probably cost you more readers than you gained. I did not read it myself until you replied. Now that I have read it I consider it a good article on how to deal with or take advantage of poor weather - with a poor title.

This is just my opinion, so take it for what it's worth... but I'd say it's highly unlikely that you will contract it. And I've even trekked in some jungles for short periods. Still, if you will be spending extensive time in the jungle, then yeah, perhaps you should get tablets.  You are far more likely to contract dengue than malaria. There is no vaccine for dengue. All you can do is avoid mosquitoes -- which will also protect you from malaria. My recommendation: Use mosquito nets."

We were traveling for 4 months, so we like to stay in places for a month or so at a time, but we ended up staying more like 2 weeks in most places and there were a couple of week long stays. And then there was the week road trip where we were moving almost every day, which was not ideal. It's just too much moving around for my tastes (packing/unpacking, it just gets tiring).

I decided to go here with my brother on the fly and hadn't made reservations. I booked it last minute and was weary because it is a tent, not an actual room, with two beds. The place had its own yoga room, a compost toilet, and a so-so kitchen. However, two things stuck out. One, it had its own private beach in Tulum, which was one of the best I've ever been to. Second, cenotes are very popular in the area and the guy who owns the hotel is part owner of the cenote out back too. He let us borrow his raft for free and had it all to ourselves. It was also awesome that is was walking distance from Sian Kaan."

Its the coolest part and your money will go a lot farther than say Galata or Sultanahmet (which are at least twice as expensive for everything) but you can still very easily visit the rest of of Istanbul because a tonne of ferries leave from Kadıköy.

travel,3cqjvb,HammockHusky,4,Thu Jul 9 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Assuming that you're an experienced rider, Thailand is a great place to get your feet wet riding in a developing country that is already very well developed, but has some developing country traits.    I've ridden at least 10,000 miles all around Thailand, from Mae Sai to Deep South border areas, from Mae Sot deep into Issan.    There is one big paperwork problem with Thailand.  Pretty much every legitimate motorcycle rental place will require you to leave your passport.  Not a copy, the actual passport.  This is how everyone does it, and as far as we can tell, there is not even 1 report of someone getting in deep trouble because of this.  BUT... with the military in charge, this COULD be a problem now.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure that I would be willing to test this myself.  It's worked for everybody in the past, but with the military in charge, some things that used to work don't work anymore.  The only other way around this is to leave a multi-thousand dollar deposit with the rental place.    So this is the risk of riding in Thailand a regular motorcycle, which they call ""big bikes.""  On the flip side, if you want to rent a scooter, then you will have zero problems and you don't need to leave your passport.  Just passport copy.  Very easy.  Dirt cheap.  My suggestion is to contact a few rental places in Bangkok that cater to foreigners.  There's at least two that opened up in the last few years. They're foreigner run and operated, and if anyone has a good answer for the passport issue, it might be them.  Or just get a 50cc scooter.  People have managed to sneak these scooters in through Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and it's not going to a major problem the way it would be if you rode a regular big motorcycle. It looks like you're looking for a budget option, scooter will be perfect.    In regards to riding itself... hmmm...  It's not really high qualities twisties, or amazing vistas.  Even Mae Hong Son is not better than East Coast USA mountains in VA/WVA/KY/NC/TN.   Riding in Thailand is more about culture, food, people, beaches.  It's about making a lot of pit stops to try road side food stands, etc.  Which is also why you might consider a scooter to save money and hassle."
travel,3cqjvb,witoldc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines of buying a bike.  Also my experience is limited to dirt biking as a kid.  I understand that may sound stupid, but I am a fairly quick learner and also I take things slow at first until I get the hang of it.   It sounds like you have expereince riding in the US?  I have also thought about touring America on a shitty bike.  Was thinking money wise this may not be as doable.  But with couchsurfing and other options maybe it isn't so bad.  You have any tips on this?"
travel,3cqjvb,witoldc,2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"Dirt bikes can get you in trouble...  You have the riding skills/mechanics, but on street, it's more about reading traffic and behaving appropriately with other cars.  If you take it slow, though, you will be fine.  Nice thing about Thai roads is that they have all sorts of traffic, from a 100mph sports car zooming by, down to some elderly lady going 5mph on the shoulder on her scooter or bicycle.  You are not forced to ""keep up"" the way you might be on a USA street.  No one is going to be on your ass honking and trying to get you to go faster.  People will go around you...    That said, to ride legally, the easiest way is to get your USA license endorsement for M, and get it translated into International Driver's Permit.  In some of the more tourist areas, the cops are known to target foreigners to pull over and check papers.  If you are in any sort of accident, people are going to see a Rich White Guy With No License and you're risking getting fucked.  ($X,XXX - $XX,XXX or prison.)    It is also worth nothing that because it's so easy for people with limited riding experience to rent scooters, moto accidents are - BY FAR - the biggest cause of foreigner fatalities and severe injuries.  There's a lot of people with zero experience to end up doing a Top Gear Vietnam Special type of trip and it works for them.  Then they post an inspirational post on Reddit and make a Youtube video.  But there's plenty of broken bones and dead foreigners, too.  They don't post up their stories, though.     It sounds like you have expereince riding in the US? I have also thought about touring America on a shitty bike. Was thinking money wise this may not be as doable. But with couchsurfing and other options maybe it isn't so bad. You have any tips on this?   Yes, before my first Thailand trip I had XXX,XXX miles of ""quality"" sportbike miles on street and race track.  But the ultimate irony is that my most serious motorcycle accident happened in Thailand.  I limped away primarily because I had all my gear on.  (amazing impact-absorbing stuff, head to toe.)  People on the side of the road were amazed to see me get up, and walk to the side of the road.    If you really want to make it a budget trip, keep in mind that just flying to Thailand round trip is going to burn about $1K.  In Thailand, your best bet is to rent a scooter.  They can be rented dirt cheap, $100/MONTH or less for quite a decent one.  I think that would be the most realistic option.  You don't have do deal with any bike registration/insurance or passport BS.  You just rent and ride.    On the flip side, $1K can get you very close to a very decent bike.  Maybe Suzuki SV650...  But you would have to couchsurf and eat at grocery stores, probably.  Thailand is more fun on a budget, IMO.  You can still eat random $1-3 street foods that are usually amazing delicious (if you like Thai food.) Hostels and ""Guesthouses"" can be very cheap - as cheap as $5/night but I would say that $15-20 is more typical.  Thailand has a lot of cheap options and even if you ""blow"" your budget, it's not by much. Whereas in the USA, you can get a little mechanical issue somewhere and start looking and very expensive motorcycle dealer bills...    Anyway, first step is your license.  Get that done first."

travel,3coo3v,Willem20,7,Thu Jul 9 15:20:36 2015 UTC,I was bored on a Friday afternoon and decided to check availability/skymile prices to NYC...booked two tickets departing six hours later and got engaged the next night.

travel,3coo3v,uReallyShouldTrustMe,5,Fri Jul 10 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"Well like I said, I was sitting at work watching the clock til the time I usually took my lunch, so I decided to check Delta's skymile prices to NYC for that night.   I thought, ""Well this would be kinda cool if it worked out but I'm sure the rates are ridiculous."" On the other hand I thought, ""Maybe prices will be reasonable since at this point, they might as well sell the seat rather than leave them empty."" It turns out there were a few seats available on a flight leaving at 6pm; one for 25k miles (Delta's lowest price for round-trip award flights) and one for 32,500 miles. I booked them immediately and then called the GF to tell her to pack a bag.  At this point, I wasn't really planning on proposing that weekend. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a completely unplanned proposal, I was planning on proposing a month or so later, but I still wasn't thinking about doing it this weekend.  After booking the flight, I obviously needed to book a hotel, so I hopped on Hotwire and booked The Warwick (4.5 star) for somewhere in the neighborhood of $150/night. It was a steal.  The next morning, I insisted we get tickets to 30 Rock Observatory for sunset. I've been atop the Empire State Building a few times already and always thought it made for good pics, but 30 Rock would be better since you can't actually see the ESB when you're on top of it.   We had both been to NYC a few times already so we didn't do the most typical tourist stuff all day, but we hung out in Central Park, visited stores on Fifth Ave., walked through Chinatown to buy fake purses for family, visited Ground Zero, and a few other things. This was a weekend getaway on a whim—we didn't want to exhaust ourselves so we did the few things we wanted to do while taking a bit of time to relax and enjoy it.  Now as I mentioned, I wasn't planning on proposing when I booked the trip or packed my bag, meaning I didn't actually have a ring with me. The idea to propose first occurred when we reserved tickets to the 30 Rock observatory, so I had to decide if it was actually feasible to stealthily acquire a ring before 7PM. Thankfully, the GF wanted to spend a few minutes in some store on Fifth Ave., so I said I would wait outside. Clearly, this was my chance. A few stores down was a national jewelry store so I walked in, pulled out the credit card, and bought a ring as fast as I could. It felt like I was in a movie because honestly, who does that? The ring and price didn't really matter because it was a national store that accepted returns—not to be a Scumbag Steve, but I bought it with full intention of returning/exchanging it for a ring she could pick out at an appropriate price. With the ring and receipt in my pocket, I walked back just as the GF was done looking around.   We went to the observatory under the guise that I wanted to take a bunch of pics (because why else), including of us, so we had to dress nicely. We got there, I took pics, we hung out, and then it was time to get a pic of us together with the ESB in the background. The whole time I was taking pics of the view, I was scouting to see if there were any pro/semi-pro photographers who knew what they were doing with a camera—this was a big event and I wanted to make sure the pics were good. I found a guy who was there with his wife so I went up to him and said ""Excuse me, can you please take a picture of us?"" As I turned to give him the camera and show him how to operate a Nikon (which I knew he knew how to do, this was simply buying time), I told him I was going to propose, and he said ""Oh that's awesome, I'll take care of this man, don't worry."" He cleared the entire viewing area of all tourists while we got in place for the pic, and then I knelt down, proposed, she said yes, and we went out for a fancy dinner. I attached a couple photos from the trip, one from Ground zero and the other I took of the view just before the proposal.  Imgur  Imgur  TL;DR: read the original comment."

travel,3coo3v,Trillindigo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"I love to travel in this manner. I buy airfare and that's it. It's given me some amazing experiences--it forces you to interact with people to ask where they recommend eating and sleeping, is really relaxing because you have no pressure to be anywhere at specific times, and let's you have a really unique experience that's not dictated by where the guidebooks tell you to go. Most recently I traveled to Cape Verde in this manner. The guy I sat next to on the plane had a friend who was a cab driver....who had a friend who owns a hostel...who had a friend who owns a restaurant....who had a friend on the next island over who gives tours up the side of a volcano, etc. i was there for 10 days and had the most wonderful time!  I've done this all over the world and can't imagine ever going back to the typical format of ""day 1: plans; day 2: plans, etc"".   I will say though that you have to be willing to really embrace whatever the experience throws at you.

travel,3coo3v,TobogganCow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:21:31 2015 UTC,"Currently on one of those trips. We (wife and I) quit our jobs to travel Europe for a year without any concrete plan past the first week. I actually wanted to plan more but we had to do a visa application when we reached Europe so we didn't know if we would have 3 months or 1 year. Since we have the visa for 1 year now, we just go wherever we want.  We usually plan one or two cities ahead and have been going for around 2.5 months now. Not planning ahead makes it hard in busy cities that get booked up but it gives you lots of opportunities as well to stay/leave wherever or take advantage of deals.  It's probably less time efficient to not be preplanned but feels like more of an adventure as you never know what's coming up"
travel,3cq5wr,dZINER_savvy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"We're on the pacific side of Mexico and not the Caribbean side but give or take we have the same hurricane season...realistically hurricane season just means that you're ""more"" likely to get rain during your vacation and the odds of getting a direct hit in any one spot is pretty slim.  Even if it does, so be it...it sucks but life goes on.  We were hit here with hurricane Carlotta head on and it was terrifying but much in part because we were under construction and we knew it was going to cost us a lot of money (we got pretty lucky and only lost a couple grand) but it wasn't like we feared for our lives...I mean, it was scary but not the end of the world once we figured out what was going on and holed up. The actual hurricane part only lasts a few hours and we just took the cats/dog into the bathroom and waited it out.  Funny thing is we didn't have internet hooked up yet so we didn't even know it was coming.  Long story short...I wouldn't let hurricane season affect your travel plans as more days are perfectly nice than not, at least here on the southern coast of Mexico."
travel,3cq5wr,Oax_Mike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"I lived in Bermuda for 2 years and although it's not exactly Caribbean, it's probably still relevant.  The weather can be really hit or miss.  You might get terrible rain and wind for a week, or it could be perfectly fine.  The problem is you can't predict the weather accurately enough too far in advance.  If the winds change slightly, a storm could move a few hundred miles over the course of a week and end up hitting the island.  Sometimes you experience gale force winds, which makes riding a scooter quite dangerous especially as a tourist.  I would say winds this strong are infrequent (maybe 15-20 days per year), so honestly just be prepared that you might have to stay indoors.  I also had the pleasure of living through back-to-back hurricanes within 1 week.  The first one caught everyone by surprise, there was major road blockage, power outages, sunk boats, roofs torn off, etc.  I had no power in my house for 3 weeks, internet took 2 more weeks after that.  Roads were mostly cleared after 2-3 days although significant damage was done across the island.  The second hurricane was a category 3/4 so everyone was preparing for the worst.  Luckily there was very minor damage (much less than the 1st hurricane).  They were Hurricanes Gonzalo and Fay Oct. 2014 if you want to look it up.  Anyways, the good news is these massive hurricanes are very rare (1 every 7 years was the consensus from locals).  If there is any significant risk of a massive storm, flights and cruises will likely be cancelled.  Also, the restoration priorities are given to office buildings and tourism functions (hotels, attractions, etc.) so that visitors won't have a terrible time during their vacation.  There are backup generators and all hotels and their staff should be well trained to handle any weather emergencies since it's just a part of their lives.  TLDR: You'll be fine.  The worst you should expect is 1 or 2 extremely windy days and some very heavy rain."
travel,3cqpa1,Abstract_Asshole,2,Fri Jul 10 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"Cheap Bus travel in Germany - Meinfernbus....this a a very good but cheap bus service I used while in germany. I had a quick look and there are a number of buses from Bremen to Hamburg for 5 - 10 Euros one way, so I would fly into Bremen and take the bus to Hamburg.   Check out Hostelworld.com for hostels.....but i think you should look into Airbnb. If there is 4 of you, each could spend 20 euro a night and get a great apartment for you guys in the city. You will all be paying at least 20 Euros for a shared room in a hostel so might as well use that 20 and get an entire apartment to yourselves."
travel,3cqpa1,LeftHandMonkeyWrench,2,Fri Jul 10 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"I am from Bremen and I also wanted to mention the option of using the coaches to travel. Both Hamburg and Berlin are serviced by the coaches and the prices are really good, especially when booked in advance.  I also wanted to add, as I am from the city, that it is very easy to get from the airport to the main train station (which is also where the coaches depart). There is a regular tram service that takes you from the airport to the city centre in about 15-20 min. Please note that you do have to buy a ticket, of course, but there are ticket machines that take cash (they are on the tram, always in the middle). Also, Bremen is nice in its own right. If you have a day, or even an afternoon to spare it is worth looking around the city a bit. There are many old buildings and little picturesque streets. And as Bremen is not very large everything worthwhile is within walking distance from the main train station. I hope this has been a bit helpful. If you have any more questions regarding the city I would be glad to help :) Have fun in Bremen and also Hamburg and Berlin as well."

travel,3cq3mo,mashel2811,6,Thu Jul 9 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"I think it is great that you are considering travel in the Caribbean without going to an all-inclusive. I've been to about 15+ Caribbean destinations (including St Martin) without stepping foot in an All-Inclusive resort. Great way to see a bit more and support local small businesses and entrepreneurs. :)   You'll find reports of crime for most places in the Caribbean (and the rest of the world for that matter) and hear about bad things happening to tourists. These can happen to people staying at resorts or those who are travelling independently.  Take general safety precautions and you are likely to be OK. Leave your valuables at home (anything you can't stand to lose), don't carry around too much cash or flaunt your electronics, be aware of your surroundings, careful about alcohol consumption, and trust your gut. Also ask your guesthouse/host about unsafe areas, things to watch out for, and how to best deal with the touts.   I think that the Yucatan in Mexico is a great place to wet your feet if you are more comfortable with all-inclusives - cheap public transport, food, and lots of budget accommodations. I personally love the Tulum area - great beaches, snorkelling at Akumal with the turtles, visiting the cenotes and ruins, decent vegetarian food options. Easy to get around with local buses or bicycle.   As you are looking for somewhere you haven't been I'd recommend you look at Jamaica. It can be done on a budget but it gets pricey if you use hired taxis/drivers and visit the heavily advertised tourist spots. My boyfriend and I went last year - travelling by bus and route taxi we went spent some time in Negril, the area surrounding Ochi, and Kingston. We loved the beach at Negril but weren't as fond of the town. We really enjoyed the area Ochi - lots of good beaches, beautiful mountains, great food, and friendly people.  We stayed at a few places we found on AirBnB and were fortunate to have great hosts who showed us around and had recommendations for things to do off the beaten trail. We (surprisingly?) enjoyed our day in Kingston and definitely wished we had another day or two there. The 'Ital (Rasta) food in Jamaica is beyond amazing and vegetarian - even my meatatarian boyfriend was happy to go two days in a row for 'Ital food :)"

It was very nice because the car was brand new and fully insured (no deductible or anything). The one thing to check is the fees associated with pick up and drop off. I think there's a charge for almost everywhere.   I picked up in Rome, which was excellent. The guys were great, they responded to my appointment request via email, showed us the car and all the features... The drop off at Linate in Milan was... less than stellar. I had a hard time getting them via phone or email and actually had to get autoeurope involved to set up the return appointment. Autoeurope was great for that.   Regarding fuel... they give you the car basically on empty (enough gas to get you to a service station), but you can also return it empty, which is nice. I'd do it again if I was renting for a long enough time.   I think that 24/day with full insurance is a great price, frankly.

They have tours and glowing rocks:  http://sterlinghillminingmuseum.org/  This place nearby is a museum:  http://www.franklinmineralmuseum.com/  I've been to John Brown's cave down in WV, but that's an actual dangerous cave that you need to go with experienced spelunkers. Maybe someone can suggest others that are safe or other mines with tours.  For diving, if you are certified, the wreck dives off NJ are pretty good, over 10 miles out, the water is comparable to the tropics. It is expensive, even with your own gear. The beach diving is mediocre, I've gone through a whole book of sites and it's meh. Kind of a pain with beach tags and parking. For boat dives, the farther out, the clearer the water.  http://njscuba.net/sites/index.php  I've done the whitewater rafting in Jim Thorpe, PA (they also have paintball).

This trail is pretty remote and can be an overnight hike through the rain forest down to remote beaches on the west side of the island. You could only go part way if you wanted. The entire trail is 11 miles and is pretty strenuous.  There are a few nude beaches in Kauai, if you're so inclined.  Hanakapiai Falls & Wailua Falls Kokee State Park There are a number of good beaches on Kauai.   Kauai is ""The Garden Isle"". It is less developed than the other islands.

travel,3cqq47,artistec,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... years ago I did a Napali coast tour with a company called Zodiac. We went out in the these high speed rafts. I just did a search myself and it seems that company doesn't exists anymore (or maybe is now called something else).  In any case, you want a boat tour of Napali that lasts at least 1/2 a day. You can get a tour that is not on a raft but is on an actual boat, which will probably be better for you if you fear the ocean.   Look for one that will stop somewhere for snorkeling. A longer tour might offer dinner on the boat (maybe at sunset) and a stop on one of the isolated beaches on Napali. Seriously, you don't want to go to Kauai and not do this, even if you fear the ocean."

Spouting Horn (look it up) Nawiliwili Harbor (yes thats a real name)   We took a bus tour of the island, it wasn't real expensive but it was a nice way to learn about places that I wanted to visit again on my own.

Neither is easily visible from the road and you will have to hike/boat/helicopter to really check them out.  After those two you can see awesome mountains, beaches, and waterfalls everywhere.  From my experience, restaurants are meh, nightlife is nonexistent, but nature is legendary.  You mention a budget and so you will probably avoid a helicopter ride, but I took the one with no doors from the Jack Harter company and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life ($250 a person though)   There are chickens everywhere in Kauai and it's funny.  Your rental car is essential but you aren't going to be driving on highways.  35-45mph curvy roads are what's there, so expect long driving times if you are doing cross-island trips even if it's not a long distance by US mainland standards  Sorry for the paragraph but aside from needing to see Na Pali and Waiamea, you will be in fucking Hawaii.

I started my trip in Tel Aviv - I ended up using a cheap plane fare (Or you can take a bus) to get to Eilat.  From Eilat, I crossed the border into Aqauba.  Take a taxi to the bus station in the city, don't allude to the taxi cab driver you are going to Petra, they'll try everything to not lose the fare.  (The border crossing closes so try to make sure you get there before that time so you don't waste a night in Eilat, although I didn't mind it there)  Once you are at the bus station, you'll find a mini-bus going towards Petra.  The fare is cheap but please ask others what they are paying - the bus drivers also like to try to ""western"" tax.  Once you are in Petra - I'd recommend the Bedouin camp but where ever you want to stay, up to you.  AQJ airport will get you to Cairo for pretty cheap (under 300/400) - You may be able to get it a little cheaper if you just get to Amman and maybe stay out there to check out the city.  If not - just fly into Cairo from AQJ.  Taking a bus to Cairo from Jordan? You have to get back into Israel, otherwise it is a LONG WAY around.  Try finding out if the border is closed or not for Israel to get to Cairo.  Israel to Cairo is the hardest part of this - I am afraid I can't help you on that one although I do believe for security, I would fly from AQJ since that part of Egypt is not safe to travel through."

Flew EgyptAir to Cairo, changed planes and flew EgyptAir to Sharm-el-Sheikh. Hired a car and driver (apx $80-90) for the five-hour drive to Taba -- Egyptian authorities were preventing tourists from taking the twice-daily bus along the Gulf of Aqaba coastal road -- and then walked through the two border crossings and took an Israeli taxi to downtown Eilat.  I think you will find several kiosks at or near the Taba border crossing that will have drivers to take you to Sharm-el-Sheikh in a reversal of my trip. Just make sure you leave lots of time before your Sharm-Cairo flight leaves, because there are at least three (and possibly four) Army checkpoints along the coastal road that may make your driver wait until there are enough travelers to make up a convoy. They did that to us at the first stop, right outside the Sharm airport, but we avoided delays at the other checkpoints because our driver was an ex-Army intelligence officer and convinced the people manning the roadblocks that my wife and I were ""American VIPs who had an important dinner engagement in Taba that evening!"

First class is outrageously expensive and you'll get off the plane eventually.  Hotels? Unless you're vacationing specifically to relax at a resort, don't go overboard on the hotel.  You need somewhere to sleep and put your stuff, that's it.  You don't want to overspend on a place that you'll only spend 2-3 waking hours in per day. That being said, spend enough so that you're safe, clean, and comfortable.  Where I do encourage you to spend money...food and shopping.  Food can be cheap or expensive, but it's location specific. Don't go to McDonalds, eat something local, that can sometimes mean spending good money. Shopping in local economies can also be cheap or expensive, but you shouldn't be afraid to buy the items that will mean something to you.  $300 for a leather jacket can be pricey, but it'll always remind you of your time in Florence.

Sadly, I think you're gonna miss the Michelangelo and Da Vinci exhibit at the Palacio, it was pretty damn neat and worth the 2 hour line.   I suggest you add Museo Soumaya. It's free.

Check out Teotihuacan a bit out of the city (there's buses that take you there) and the Templo Mayor that's next to the cathedral downtown. For more cool museums, there's the torture, MUNAL, Correos, San Idelfonso, and many, many more. Simply ask and I'm sure you'll find something cool to go see.

(But you would pay about triple price for the ticket, and not be able to use it at all the other participating museums.)  Con: You may have to buy the visa. You may want to sleep instead of walking around the streets of the old town. You will be frustrated by all the things you didn't get to see or do when you have to leave. You'll be dead tired when you arrive in Prague.   That said, I assume that you're traveling with Turkish Airlines.

It's huge and takes some imagination when trying to picture whole regiments fiercely maneuvering and battling. One can become burnt out  from all the who, where ,what ,why.   Avoid going in the blazing heat as there is a ton of walking and for the most part you are in direct sun all/most of the day.   Going to specific skirmish/battle sites is awesome. Devils den, little round top, bloody run, the small stone house field hospital.   Guided tours with knowledgeable rangers are really cool. But there is also a ton of YouTube video of rangers explaining everything. Repeat: avoid going in blazing summer heat.   Camping there (with guided groups) is pretty cool. Usually you cook and live your stay pretending to recreate a soldiers daily.  I did this back in cub/boy scouts so they emphasised the fine details of soldiers camp life.   For locals from south east PA. Start or end the day by going to Shady Maple. It will fill you for the ride out and half the day. Eat your weight in buffet."

My personal opinion on the matter is that the Old Visitors Center of ten or fifteen years ago was great, but that the new one is a disappointment. The old one was more like a museum with tons of relics and whatnot and if I remember correctly was free, whereas, in the new one you pay to watch some video presentations, there's a few small diorama cases containing some weapons and equipment, and a fairly large gift shop (Note: Last time I was in the new one was a few years ago).

It is also the easiest way to swim in a hot spring.  The other choice is to go to the Reykjadalur (Steam Valley). There is a park there that is filled with fumaroles and hot springs, inclung one area where a cold mountain strem meets up with some hot springs and makes warm, swimmable water.   There is  also a geothermal park in nearby Hveragerði. It is tiny, and a total tourist trap within a fence, but it has a hot stream and they'll give you the gear to cook an egg in it.  There is the geysers to see, including the famous Geysir that gave the noun its name. Geysir doesn't go off too regularly any more, but there are others that do, most famously Strokkur.  You can take a cave tour outside of the capital - go with a guide not to get lost.   For bigger vistas you can go to the Snaefellsnes peninsula area. There is the Snaefellsnes glacier to climb, nearby seals to see and a hotel Búðir nearby that has a cute historical church founded by the efforts of a local woman, a good restaurant and cute main area. Rooms are clean but less nice (they had a fire and spent their money rebuilding the public areas). They also organize nearby events and activities.  Gullfoss waterfall is pretty spectacular - it disappears into a chasm in the ground.  We really enjoyed the area around Þingvellir in Silfra - the tectonic plates are gradually pulling Iceland apart at a rate of about 10 cm per year. We went snorkeling in dry suits (3 degree C water means crystal clear water). You can also scuba. I strongly recommend this.  Horseback riding is also cool in Iceland - the horses have their own gait in addition to the standard walk, trot, canter, gallop.  Holy Skaholt was interesting, if somewhat small - it is a neat place to stop by if in the area.  We also took a boat out to see the puffins but Im not sure if the puffins are there right now  - check if they are out to sea.  Whale watching is also nice.  There is also a small island accessible by boat from the capital that houses the old governor's house and a church that is interesting.  The National Museum of Iceland is interesting, the Reykjavik city museum and an outdoor museum with historical reconstructions Árbær Open Air Museum - Árbæjarsafn.  There is a giant theater Harpa that could have something interesting."

Your credit card gets charged when you book.  If the host calls it off, you'll get a refund.  As far as booking in advance, that I guess depends on your host.  If they're not an instant book, then they have to approve it anyway.  As you get closer to your travel dates, it would probably be a good idea to check in with your hosts to make sure it's still ok.

There are problems with staying in the boroughs, outside of manhattan.  I lived in New York and when i visit i wouldn't stay anywhere but manhattan or parts of brooklyn.  Mostly, the line between good and bad is too thin, in other words, one street may be perfectly fine but the next few might not be.  Also, there are things to do outside of manhattan but mostly manhattan IS New York.  Brooklyn has become very trendy, but honestly, unless you know EXACTLY where to go and where not to go, you could have an unpleasant time, specifically when dealing with AirBNB.  You may have someone say ""Williamsburg"", cool area, but in reality you could end up on some dodgy street on the outskirts of Bed Stuy.  While there are some nice areas in Brooklyn for example, or Queens, it's not enough to stay there.  I like some parts of Carrol Gardens for example but that's more of a place to go to for half a day but not stay.  And there may be people on Airbnb marketing their place as ""Carrel Gardens, Safe area, etc."" but in reality it's in a bad area of Red Hook with terrible transportation or this or that. I am going to Paris in a month or so for a little over a month and my plan is my usual - book 4 or 5 days, maybe a week with someone.  Walk around the city and find neighborhoods I like then proceed to book the rest of my stay after walking around and getting a feel for the area.  If you do this in NY you can jot down a few locations outside of manhattan, maybe in Brooklyn that you like and go there and hang out for a little to see if you like the neighborhood, then book.  I personally wouldn't worry about not finding a place to book because it's New York, there will be plenty.  The host is always a toss-up whether you will get along but being in a safe, comfortable neighborhood is golden."

First, the shaft of light Antelope Canyon is the UPPER Antelope Canyon.  There is also a Lower Antelope Canyon, which is more interesting in my opinion.  It's not quite as picturesque, but it starts out as a crack in the ground that you hop into and goes on for quite some time.  You'll be hopping rocks and squeezing through cracks and it's amazing.  This is also a guided tour, but it's far more physical.  Also, you'll need to drive out to it yourself.  The guides drive you out to the upper canyon.  The other thing to hit in Page is Horseshoe Bend.  It's just outside of town and is a great spot for photos.  If you're interested, you can also take a boat tour up the river.  It's somewhat interesting and worth the ride."

You will have to take a train from Bucharest and then transfer in Plovdiv, from there the train takes you to a little town by the Turkish border where you then get on a bus that takes you over the border. The border crossing takes forever but you can buy beer at duty free. That bus then drops you off at a train station by the Border. Here you will wait for about two hours where another bus comes and picks you up. Its doable but exhausting. We left Turkey at 9pm and got to Bucharest around 1 pm the next day. All for 60 lira.

If you go in off-season, 20 EUR is possible for some of the places, but all in all your destinations are not exactly very cheap.  If you eat out all the time, expect to spend 30 EUR per food otherwise 15 EUR are probably realistic. Depends upon the place you stay at, whether you can cook at that place and whether you got a supermarket nearby. Add in another 20-30 EUR for doing fun things (entry to sights, entry to clubs, drinks, banana boat ride, skyjumping, etc) I would say it is not unreasonable to bring 80 EUR per day - and yes, that is with transport already taken care off."
