For the most part.  Pushy advertising, crappy advertising, and manipulative advertising certainly comprise a large portion of the ads out there; however they're also an important function of the free market, help businesses with a good point of difference or interesting new innovative product to thrive, and are extremely useful when you're in the market for something. e.g. when you're looking to buy a car, you pay a lot of attention to every car ad you see.  So, rather than getting rid of advertising altogether, perhaps a better way of looking at it is to optimise advertising so that it's better targeted to what you actually are interested in so that it's a service rather than a pushy unwanted interruption."

I think this argument would have held up 50 years ago, but  it's possible now to access a higher quality of impartial information elsewhere. Although it sometimes feels convenient to receive targeted advertising, I think that's an illusion. I think in an ideal case, you experience a genuine need (influenced, unavoidably, by your friends, family, and other people you meet, but not by anyone with a vested interest in having you buy their product), and then you search for the solution. I can't imagine a scenario where advertising speeds up the process by which I find that solution, whereas it is the case that it increases the frequency with which you experience those needs. In fact, we also know that advertisers attempt to sell their products as solutions to needs which they are not in fact able to fulfill.  I appreciate what you're saying about allowing businesses with a point of difference thrive, but I think the benefits are far more directly linked to capital than they are to quality of product. Ideally I think we need to find a way of generating revenue for the service of providing information that encourages the generation of information without bias."

InsightfulQuestions,3dy1tl,VLDT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I take your point - crowd-sourced information is far more objective than advertising e.g. Yelp / urban spoon / Uber ratings etc.  We in the industry are keenly aware that word-of-mouth is by far the most effective form of advertising, which is why you see a lot of testimonials or ads that attempt to be relatable using this same psychological mechanisms.  I maintain, though, that there is a worthwhile commercial relationship between advertiser and consumer. In the extreme scenarios it's easy to villainize, but there's a wide spectrum and a lot of variables. e.g. An author is having a book launch and wants to tell people about it so advertises in the local paper; a software company has a new product that will make people's lives easier and want reach a specific target group and so advertise on the niche website for front-end programmers who are familiar with linux; a pizza shop want to drum up business and so offer customers vouchers in their letterbox.  In each of these scenarios, there's a value exchange where both the advertiser and consumer benefit. There's also a value exchange for, say, the niche website to make some money to support creating its content for its users by offering advertising on their site as a service for those who want to reach that particular audience.  This is an important, and additional, point that I didn't raise initially: advertising helps to support a lot of different content and industries; so whilst some of the actual content and nature of advertisements generally is certainly of limited value, the benefits that advertising revenue generate are quite substantial e.g. television programs, podcasts, websites etc. Plus the arguable flow-on benefits of creating tech giants like Google who are doing things like investing billions into artificial intelligence research, maps, driverless cars and globally accessible free internet.  Advertising offers a way for people to get things for free by essentially crowd-sourcing commercial sponsorship to the small percentage of users/viewers/readers who are in the market for a particular product. It's an extremely effective economic model.  The problem is that it's pushy and annoying. So, the solution, to my mind is to find ways to make it more beneficial, and less manipulative and interruptive. This is likely a synthesis of our positions: a more networked, crowd-sourced, opt-in model where there is much more of a guarantee of value for the consumer, and less of a 'shotgun' approach where everyone has to suffer an annoying jingle so that 0.01% of people buy something."
InsightfulQuestions,3dy1tl,a_dollar_sign_texas,3,Tue Jul 21 05:43:39 2015 UTC,"Only one of the problems is that it's pushy and annoying. That's the problem that we're most acutely aware of, but my contention is that the effects are far worse than that.  I agree that there is a value exchange and that there are benefits to both advertiser and consumer, but I think if we consider the net benefit, then the consumer is no longer in the positive. In fact, if you buy into the idea that equality is better for everyone, and that social perception/material comparisons are a component of this, then you could argue that neither is the advertiser, when considered as a bunch of individuals in a society. Check out The Spirt Level if you're interested in the equality argument. Not only that, but we can't just say that becasue value is exchanged its a good thing. We have to consider whether there is a more efficient way to deliver the same value, and I think there is.  As for the variety of different industries that have traditionally relied on advertising revenue, again we have to consider whether there is a better alternative. Currently, the content that succeeds is chosen by a third party (the advertiser) who is making an assumption about what engages us (or, more accurately, what engages us for long enough to see their ads). This isn't very efficient, although it has of course produced some incredible content in the past. I'd argue that we'll get better content if we shift to a culture where the consumer pays for the content directly. It's a hard sell because we perceive ad supported content as ""free"", but I don't think it is, the costs are just harder to identify. Already we are seeing a positive move in this direction with services like Netflix, and I think this subscription model could be applied to content other than movies and tv shows.  With respect to the benefits of creating tech giants like google who develop and provide services that we find useful - again, are we sure that the costs are well enough understood, and that there isn't a better way of doing it? Just because the current system delivers some benefits, doesn't mean its the best one. How can we be certain that it's an extremely effective economic model when we haven't tried an alternative? In fact, using Netflix as an example again, we have tried an alternative, and given the huge success of some of the content coming out on Netflix perhaps we can say that there is a better economic model."
InsightfulQuestions,3dy1tl,ralph-j,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that if I'm hungry and I get a pizza voucher, there's a net benefit to both me and the pizza restaurant. No one loses. At least at the smaller end of the marketing scale, it's much more of an informational service rather than a distortion of market forces and mass manipulation (most of the time).  I certainly agree that models such as Netflix's are superior, and produce better content to boot (owing at least partially to the fact that they don't have to worry about not offending their advertisers' various agendas).  I also agree with you that within a capitalist system, access to capital provides an unfair advantage that is detrimental to meritocracy i.e. the company with the biggest marketing budget wins (not necessarily the best product).  This being said, I think your argument is too one-sided and absolute i.e. we should get rid of advertising entirely, it has no net value, etc.  There are positive aspects of a more networked, verified, and social approach to many forms of commerce and information sharing (within an information economy) and I agree that many facets of this model are superior, and more beneficial. See this recent Guardian article for more on that: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun  But I think there's some pretty obvious and demonstrable value to an author being able to get word out about his book launch, or reaching a targeted niche market and at the same time helping to pay for content that that niche market enjoys. There's a lot of baby that you're proposing to throw out with that bathwater.  Marketing also has a relational effect on many aspects of a business. For instance, if a company invests $25m into R&D, they want to be able to ensure that their product is going to get a good return once it's in market. Just hoping that a decentralised crowd-sourced system of product verification will make it worthwhile isn't an equation that makes fiscal sense.  If we're talking about moving beyond capitalism as a system, though, then I'm right with you. But in the here and now, we should be realistic, and serve to perpetuate and advocate for systems such as you're describing, but without being too absolutist about it."

If I'm in the market for a car, what I want to know is how much I have to spend, what kind of car I want, and what kind of car I can afford that balances my budget against my desires.  Advertising increases desire, certainly, but it provides no help in balancing those desires against reality. Advertising's goal is to drive revenue for the company showing the ad. In other words, to trick the viewer into buying something or spending more than they would had they not seen the ad. From a personal (i.e. consumer) perspective, this is harmful.  I also don't understand the spin that targeted advertising is better. The more targeted or effective the advertising, the less the company has to spend in order to drive more revenue. In other words, the company only has to show a few ads to make a sale instead of having to show tons of ads to make a sale.  Advertising is terrible for the target of the ad and great for the company showing the ad."

Advertising enables those with capital to build brands, dominate markets, and concentrate wealth.   Who's to say small businesses cannot make use of advertising? Without advertising, if there is only one dominant brand then how will small businesses rise?   Advertising changes individuals' perception of their social position, which can make negatively affect their ability to meet their requirement for esteem.    And why do you only see the net negative of this? People who are gullible enough to be swayed by advertisements are probably likely to be swayed by other sources as well.   Advertising increases individuals' perception of their material needs, which makes them harder to achieve; requiring more work, energy, and other resources.   See above.   We should restrict the visibility of advertising by regulation, tax, or by providing alternative sources of revenue for those who currently rely on ad revenue.   easier said than done.

InsightfulQuestions,3dy1tl,staabc,4,Mon Jul 20 14:10:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks reazura. This has received a far higher quality of response than I was expecting. Hoping I can provide a solid rebuttal to each of yours.   Who's to say small businesses cannot make use of advertising? Without advertising, if there is only one dominant brand then how will small businesses rise?   Small businesses can make use of advertising too, but advertising success depends almost directly on the money put in. Advertising enables a correlation between existing capital and market share/revenue. If we allow companies to compete in this way, there is no incentive to compete on quality of product. As such, advertising reduces the benefit to the consumer. The link ralph-j provided talks about this as encouraging a competition for our attention, which in the absence of advertising would have to be won through quality of product. Any business would then have to rise by satisfying a genuine need, and doing it best (or better in some way than a competitor). We are fortunate enough to be in a world now where information on how to satisfy a given need and which product does it best is readily available.   And why do you only see the net negative of this? People who are gullible enough to be swayed by advertisements are probably likely to be swayed by other sources as well.   There is nothing gullible about being swayed by advertisements. Everyone is affected by advertising, even if they don't end up buying the product. Even if they're not (because I can't prove that they are), do we want any portion of the population being manipulated in this way. If the goal is net satisfaction, and I think it should be, I can't see a benefit to letting any company affect how someone feels about their position in society, or how they think about what they want/need. Can you think of a positive?   easier said than done. Several businesses and websites revolve around making money on advertisements. Saying that you would flat out kill advertisiments for no particular good reason will simply be laughed at. Besides, there are already regulations that exist for advertisements.   Absolutely. One of the things I hoped to talk about when I posted this is what the alternatives might be. At the moment, relying on advertisements for revenue means that content providers operate in a way that satisfies the advertiser, not the individual. This means that the majority of content we see is designed to distract us for seconds, not hold our attention for hours. If there was a way of changing this, would we prefer it? As to how, what about a subscription model where your subscription is paid proportionally to the content providers that hold your attention for the longest? I don't even think this would be hard to implement, if I knew how to write a browser extension I'd have given it a go already.  I don't know much about the regulations that already exist, but if I think about cigarette branding as an example - we know it works, and we know it encourages bad choices. Do we think that only extends to cigarettes? I think we've acted in this instance because the effects of cigarettes on society are much easier to quantify, but clearly our moral standpoint is that companies shouldn't be allowed to encourage people to make bad choices. Why do we let companies exert the same control when it comes to sugar, consumer electronics, or anything else? We appear to have accepted that advertisers can change our perception of what we need, and as I suggested originally, this can only make it harder for us to be fully satisfied."

My opinion is that advertising seems to be having a positive effect on us as workers and consumers, and a negative effect on us as human beings.  There's a big argument to be made for advertising as being the reason that we have as much access as we do to educational, informative material which contrasts with the latter of my previous statement as well.

If I opened a new restaurant I would want people to know about it. Advertising outside my storefront or some small local ads seems reasonable.   I think the problem is that once the potential power of advertising was realized businesses and corporations have been going full steam ahead, dumping billions of dollars into it, and have had very little regulation reigning them in.  Personally, I find certain advertising reprehensible. Advertising effects us deeply, consciously and unconsciously. There should be no advertising in certain public places, like schools. Advertising to children should be limited.  Its worrying that so much of the internet, now smartphone apps, and previously television has depended on advertising money. Luckily, there are ways to get around a lot of ads these days. I got rid of cable, which greatly decreased how many ads I see, and I use adblock.   I think the only thing that will change the current scheme is that if public opinion shifts enough, and people willingly begin paying for things they enjoy to get rid of ads that the business model becomes unviable. Its unlikely though because advertising just plain works, and corporations will continue to dump ungodly amounts of money to get knowledge of their product wedged into your brain."

But whatever, that advertising isn't too bad. Just feels like something to keep my eyes busy style advertising.  Nintendo used to make ads that were sort of manipulative in how ""cool"" something was. That borders on the line of bad advertising.  I just watched a Nature Valley commercial that pretends to care about the children being cooped up all day and not going outdoors. Feeding parents fears of technology, creating a shock factor.. all while having their name tagged all over social media. This is bad advertising. Morally speaking.  So, we shouldn't have to regulate these kinds of things. But we as consumers can absolutely shun away these things. When a commercial comes on the radio, turn it down for a few blocks. When the tv has a commercial, mute and don't watch for about 2 min. Magazine ads, skip the page. Billboard on the road, pay attention to the road like a good driver.

We're realizing more and more now that two different cultures don't have to fight to determine which one is ""right"".

InsightfulQuestions,3dpu6j,BrokenTraveler,2,Sat Jul 18 09:16:32 2015 UTC,"Given that nationalism is a relatively new concept which has had some pretty poor uptake and some awful examples of use, I'd say that a sort of ""globalism"" would be even more distant than the goal of a unified nation, and I'd feel particularly dubious about what it would take to get to that point as well.  But it's not impossible to unify people. I don't believe in a techno-fix to unify people because *gasp!* technology and particularly communication isn't equally accessible to all people, so we might as well talk about democracy for land owners or for lettered people, for all that's worth.  I believe that a parochial confederalism of people that are unified across their differences would be possible, not unlike how the UN is capable of bringing different people from different places with different cultures together on the issues which unite them (mostly, you know, averting WWIII and a nuclear holocaust but I digress...) without enforcing some kind of homogeneity.  But truly, to have people united then they need to be equal and not just in a political or a social sense but especially so in an economic sense. Otherwise we're going to have ""classes"" of countries or groups of which the inherent antagonisms will only lead to more conflict until the inequality is resolved."

InsightfulQuestions,3dpu6j,Ahhuatl,2,Sun Jul 19 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"I think whole world unity is too far-fetched to really be considered right now.  There's still an insurmountable divide between East and West, and first and third world countries.    I think an idea which is more plausible, and worth considering, is ""unity"" among Western civilization, and we've already seen plenty of steps towards that in some ways.  Now, this doesn't work in terms of having everybody ""identify"" with the same culture of government, because even between European countries there are large historical and cultural divides.  However, those divides may not be so deep that economic and political cooperation cannot triumph over it.  I can imagine the French and the Germans not identifying as ""one people"" for generations, but they could still manage to integrate their societies.  Who knows?  Maybe a federalist ""United States of Europe"" will be feasible some day, although the federal powers will likely be quite limited.  Imagine further into the future than that, and I can imagine a pan-Western ""united community"" with the US, Canada, and Western Europe tightly bound in political and social operation.  This already happening more or less.  A lot of the popular conversations with regards to economy and social issues are happening on both sides of the Atlantic, as global issues rather than simply local.  These cultures can realistically evolve together, and have plenty of things in common (and still hold plenty of things unique to each nation).  I could also imagine South America forming a sort of union like the EU, there's certainly been talk about that.  However, I just can't imagine that sort of bond between Western peoples and say, the Middle East.  Their cultures have been at odds for thousands of years, and certainly aren't in any good position today.  I don't know enough about East Asia to guess at how they might play a part in all this.  I just hope that China and the US stay on amicable terms, because realistically no nation poses as much of a potential threat to the West as China does, if somehow things went south in X years and war broke out.  Of course, I don't think China is a hostile or ""rival"" nation, but Chinese culture and Western culture don't seem to overlap or share very much in the way that Western cultures do with each other.  A lot of this may just be a language barrier.  At any rate, I can see China continuing to cooperate economically with the West, but I can't imagine them identifying as a common people in the way that Europeans might.  So, I don't think ""world unity"" is feasible, unless we colonized other planets and your planet became the easiest thing to identify with.  It's plausible that we'll see the expansion of US, EU, NATO, and UN-style ""unions"" among similar cultures though.  I don't think they'll ever wipe out regional governance though.  Even in the US, which is explicitly one nation, there is a separation of federal and state government powers.  As the US federal gov't is meant only to control things between states, or things that affect the whole nation, I imagine a ""super-federal"" gov't would be limited to govern only explicitly international issues."

InsightfulQuestions,3dm6ax,xzxzxzxzxzxzzxzxzx,19,Fri Jul 17 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"We never had and never will have truly free and unrestricted speech. The classic example of screaming ""Fire"" in a crowded movie theater comes to mind. You cannot do that and just walk away. You'll be arrested. People think of the concept of ""free speech"" as being an all-or-nothing thing. It is not. It never was. It has always in every facet and at every point in time existed on a continuum. It has always been a balancing act. You do not have the right to free speech if you are going to use that speech to threaten, stalk, and harass someone. You will be arrested or slapped with a restraining order. There are other limits as well.  So now that we're shifting from thinking of 'free speech' as an all-or-nothing exercise and instead think of it as a continuum, it's very easy to say ""I believe in free speech but I also believe racist and misogynistic subreddits should be banned"". Because I am acknowledging the balancing act of free speech. And I am suggesting that, for the good of all of us, we shift what free speech entails slightly this way or that way.   Furthermore, there is a strong distinction between banning the discussion of topics and banning the way topics are discussed. What I mean is, /r/coontown is not discussion racism. They're talking about how much they hate blacks and how much they wish blacks would die. They are explicitly a hate sub. I believe that, for the protection of free speech for all of us, subs that promote hate-filled ideas should be banned. I have absolutely no problem reconciling a desire to protect free speech with this. This is how society has functioned since forever."

The purposes may vary, including racial prejudice, personal malice, an attempt to force someone to quit a job or grant sexual favors, apply illegal pressure to collect a bill, or merely gain sadistic pleasure from making someone fearful or anxious."" This definition is very subjective. Who decides what is ""unwanted"" or ""annoying,"" and who decides if the perpetrator ""gains sadistic pleasure from making someone fearful or anxious?""  Discussion or roleplaying, even of illegal actions, is not systematic actions towards another human being. It isn't trying to make anyone fearful or anxious because it's assumed that the recipients of the content are within the subreddit community.  By saying that subreddits are contained, I meant that the majority of the subreddits brought up in the discussion so far didn't ever have to reach the ears of anyone they might bother.

The same way you can make coca tea with little consequence, but cannot say the same for cocaine. In short, facilitating discussion of violence, hate, etc in a forum where only those views are expressed makes them much more extreme. It's called group Polarization (look it up). So by allowing it, we are strengthening those views. This was not a psychological phenomenon the founding fathers could have predicted. The Internet makes the spread and amplification of these views very easy. Back in the day, you might have to go hang fliers in town or go talk to people. Try getting a group together to talk about raping women under those circumstances. Now it's easy.   We need to think through the consequences of ""free speech"" rather than taking the party line because we like it.   As for thought crime, it depends what the result of sharing those thoughts is. I've had very despicable thoughts before, and I've discussed them with a therapist under controlled circumstances so I wouldn't act on them or violate my values. No big deal. It would be entirely different if I had a thought which could harm others and then someone consigned my thought. Whereas neither of us might have really been willing to act on it before, you now have two people who think it's more okay.

I'd prefer an actual user driven community as opposed to one where things that are largely disagreed with are removed by an authoritarian figure (i.e. reddit mods and admins).  It should also be mentioned that most censorship is actually self-censorship where people are aware of the perception and implications of what they're saying, asking, etc. The anonymity that the internet provides -- more on boards like 4chan than reddit -- are part of what makes the discussion so much less taboo."
InsightfulQuestions,3dm6ax,beeUnit,3,Mon Jul 20 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"I think that basically people should be able to say whatever they like, especially on something like Reddit, I would support almost total free speech.  The argument against it goes like this;  *Murder is bad.  *Someone who talks about murder a lot might be more likely to commit a murder.  *Therefore we should step in and stop them talking about murder.  However I think this is a very difficult argument to make. For example it may be that talking about murder is the outlet they need and it is actually making them less likely to murder someone.   Moreover is it true the talking about something makes you more likely to do it? I have killed 10's of millions of people in computer games, from nuking cities (which I have done gleefully many times, take that Ghandi) to shooting or stabbing individuals in the face for nothing more than looking at me funny (assassins' creed). And I think this has made me no more likely to hurt people in real life. I want other people to be happy and I wouldn't want to hurt them. Sometimes I say things like ""Man I totally flamethrowered that bitch,"" should I be stopped?  Another problem is where do you stop? If talking about it makes people more likely to do it what about reading about it? If I read Mein Kampf will I become a Nazi? If I read the Marquis de Sade will I become a sadist? Should we ban and burn books which contain inflammatory material? (MdS wrote books with a lot of rape and murder in them, for example).  Personally I think that acts that actually hurt others, (like rape, murder, or shouting fire in a crowded theatre) should be illegal. If you're not hurting anyone else then you should be free to do whatever you like.  And if that means forming an online community to talk about horrific things then I think that's ok."

InsightfulQuestions,3dm6ax,DublinBen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"Free speech is really a protector of opinions. I'll start with a broad sense - you can voice your opinion and discuss any topic you would like under this heading. However, speech that impedes another citizens rights cannot be considered under free speech. Rights are obviously those freedoms permissible by law. Freedom means you can do what you want as long as you do not encroach on other people's freedom. If you think free speech is to say whatever you want, then you misunderstand what it is. (not you, but just people in general)   Now, under the context of taboo subjects - discussion is extremely important, and should definitely be protected, and I think if you post a comment regarding tendencies to rape, pedophilia etc. I don't think you will be banned. Similarly, if you wrote a comment berating the lifestyle of obese people without medical conditions, I'm sure that your comment or post will be left to the mercy of other redditors. However, when hateful or unlawful topics have their own forum, it is more difficult to draw out what is discussion/opinion and what is a hateful agenda. If admins scan subreddits and find that a subreddit has destructive tendencies that harm others or show unlawfulness, I am absolutely ok with banning.  Without going into much further detail, I'm sure you can already see that my thinking is pretty much in line with yours. Just that I am less critical of the administrations decision to ban subreddits which might encourage healthy discussion but can also be enabling pits of hateful/unlawful behavior. I once visited /r/PhilosophyOfRape when there was some topic regarding a mod who claimed to be an actual rapist (a proud one), and I was forced into wonder when the users of the subreddit asked him to fuck off on the basis that the subreddit was for healthy discussion/role playing and he was eventually removed. Here, the community showed that the subreddit need not be banned and that the users understood the constructive reasons behind the formation of this subreddit. Community which uses the subreddits is responsible for propagating good discussion and if they fail to do so they can risk getting banned."
InsightfulQuestions,3dh563,pudding_world,9,Thu Jul 16 06:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say increased empathy comes from increased access to previously unavailable or censored perspectives. You see more support for LGBT peoples coming after movements from Harvey Milk to the Stonewall Riots to be more ""out and proud,"" aka own their identity and let people realize that these are people all around them: fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and so forth. Not just an idea to criticize or support. People.  The same can be said for other, non-mainstream / societal norms. I think increased access to foreign perspectives & identities (subjective to each culture for the individual) via the Internet, increased media attention (TV shows, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc), and so forth has sped this process up and reached more people."

I'm basically kribbing from this essay here.  Basically, the argument is that you have people who show empathy and tolerance for all sorts of people, because they no longer consider them an outgroup.  But for those they do consider an outgroup, they aren't necessarily any more empathetic."

So then do you think that the general ""outgroup"" is shrinking and more people consider themselves part of 1 multinational-multiracial-multietcetera ingroup? Or are the borders simply shifting, with the relative sizes of the ingroups and outgroups remaining about the same?  Very interesting concept."
InsightfulQuestions,3dh563,atomfullerene,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think ingroup has generally broadened over time (the obvious example is small bands to small political units to larger political units).  It's pretty impressive when you think about it: for most of human prehistory your ingroup was only people you knew personally and now we manage to get whole nations together.      I don't know, I don't want to speculate too much.  But nationalism is basically a huge expansion of ""outgroup"", I guess due to social and technological changes.  Nowdays there seems to be some fracturing of large groupings along ideological lines, as part of a generalized loss of respect for institutions that tie people together in groups.

Firstly, because wealth has increased for more people and when one is wealthier, one is willing to extend one's circle of concern to more people, and animals.  Secondly, Independently of wealth, I believe we have grown more empathetic, as a result of conscious awareness of the importance of empathy. Doctors and nurses are now regularly educated on the effects that empathy will have on the recovery of patients, and the negative effects of childhood trauma are relatively well understood by the public, and because of that awareness, some extra effort is made by parents to avoid it. Not as much effort as they could be making, and not by as many people as I would like, but still probably more than 50 years ago when the idea that low empathy from parents causes criminality and psychosis was just a hunch."

By exposing myself to a wider array of ideas and viewpoints, I think that I can continue to learn how to see things from other perspectives and otherwise empathize with people.   However the ""Stream"" discussed in this article offers a bit more unsettling of a view on social media in particular. Many of the things we see are decided on by algorithms of what ""they"" think we will like rather than an active search for information on the part of the viewer (us). Furthermore, we can manipulate the things we see on facebook and reddit and other ""stream"" sites, further blocking out unwelcome viewpoints.

If there is a God who created all this, his experience of it would be much more like technology, knowing the finer details of reality, than the conventional miracles and wonders we think of. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Hypothetically, when Jesus was healing the blind man, he was manipulating synapses and matter, recreating a working set of vision apparatus in situ, by will and knowledge, skill, not just magic. It would be more like reality control on a subatomic scale, telekinesis. Same with feeding the 5,000. Either generating matter from nothing, or creating bread and fish from the template of the boy's lunch out of existing materials, air or quarks, depending on how he would have chosen to do it.   At that level of reality control, bringing something out of nothing, the knowledge goes far beyond what we have discovered. If we ever get to that point, it will indeed be godlike power.

Which would explain the apparent design we see, a coding language for life that allows adaptation.  Anyway, I believe in a Creator God. I think in the Bible He said, let us go down and confuse their language, lest they become capable of anything. Paraphrase.  It seems to me very likely that without hindrance, our technological expertise could easily rival godhood. Nothing will be impossible.  but in such a world, one in which humans are literally capable of anything, what would we do? We have conquered reality, but not ourselves. This is why dystopia is so prevalent. We recognize innate drives that would bring about incredibly bad outcomes if we had the power.   My hope is that we would first develop the wisdom to wield godlike power, and only then develop the know-how to bring about our desires.  As it stands, mankind seems always to start by doing the worst thing first, and only in retrospect, with time, coming to the wisdom to not do that again.

There is no functional difference between an omnipotent God and an omnipotent technologically enhanced being.  This is an old argument from Giordano Bruno when he says our imaginations and conceptions held in these meaningless words we use to describe them - by definition limit the concept of God the moment we utter them.   I can tell you the word ""Trillion"" - and you have NO conceivable understanding of what that word implies. You can look at pictures of one trillion objects, you can have it described to you, but you don't really understand it, it's just a word, a placeholder for whatever denomination comes after a billion. So it's convenient to say God is that. But that's essentially meaningless. You're limiting God to an empty word.   It's very possible technology can produce results that are so far beyond our ability to comprehend HOW it works, it may as well be magic. It's happening right now. Most people have technology they scarcely understand... using a medium that is far more technical than most will ever know, yet they'll pretend God whiffed all this. More specifically an iron-age carpenter from Galilee with his bronze hammer forged the singularities of the galactic cores and dark-matter that is generating the gravitational pull that is all that is keeping the universe from ripping itself apart... even while it continues to expand.

We also have very limited knowledge of just about everything (although many would disagree with me on that): we don't know if life exists on other planets; we don't know if life continues after death; we have defined randomness as well as order and cause/effect, but we're not sure how these paradoxical ideas play together as they seem to do.

These limit our experience and we have no meaningful way of discussing what other sense organs exist. They could sense entirely different realms of experience. Thirdly I'd say they would have to feel internal feelings as well. What we call drives and moods. Anger, ambition, desire, sadness etc. They would feel some of this in some sense or the other.   How would this translate to other life? I'm sure they deal with the same stupid problems we do, like judging appearances, dealing with vanity and narcissim, deciding morally appropriate actions, and creating an elaborate fictional world for people to pretend to be upset about meaningless shit.

InsightfulQuestions,3d1ts9,gravitypulling,25,Sun Jul 12 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"Because there is. Because our grasp on time stems from our concept of self. The idea that now we exist in some way that is distinctly different than another way we once existed. Adding to this, our mind is a closed system that changes only based on experience and the very idea of mortality or limited time is a halting problem. We can't actually understand or know that we won't be alive at some point in time because all we've ever known is being alive. Sure, we can form mental models that project the idea of mortality onto our consciousness, but like all ideas, it's impossible to realize without the visceral experience. Like understanding the vibrance of the color green without ever having seen it before. Limited time and therefore limited mortality is hard- if not impossible- to fully grasp until we experience it.   It's especially hard to grasp by people with less experience (younger people). The most we can do is attach this simple model of limited time (mortality) to a similar concept like loss, pain, or urgency to attempt to fully understand it. But if one's biggest sense of loss is a dog dying and their deepest physical pain was a broken arm while their deepest sense of urgency was to write a school paper, that's not exactly a strong motivator. Especially since you can convince yourself this sense of limited time will lead to none of the above.   The best solution I've had is just not to think of time as a limited resource. I mean, I 'know' that it is, but it's hard to realize that. Instead I tend to think of time as a currency that I'm spending every moment I'm conscious. Some investments are better for future me, others are better for present me. For me, it's about not taking too much for either version of myself. The one who will regret (future me) or the one who is actually making the investment (present me)."

Now wether its subconsciously or not, that fact is that it does happen. The attention that we receive from posting selfies/statuses is a fast way of obtaining gratification. We will work hard to ensure the gratification continues and at any rate become addicted to the amount of likes we receive and start comparing ourselves to others on social media."

I really had a hard time believing this at first, but it's true. I have heard and experienced this firsthand. I am now 39 and in good shape, but have put on some evenly distributed weight and now women tell me, how good I look. They seem to identify this as a sign of matureness.   Don't ask me why this is, maybe a woman can clear this up."
InsightfulQuestions,3cd4l5,dyke_face,15,Mon Jul 6 23:54:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like it comes down to the effect of instant gratification from the majority of internet links. Pictures, Gifs, Videos, Headlines... etc. It wasn't long ago that I could commit to a 4 minute youtube video the second I opened it. Now, I spend the first ~30 seconds (or less) debating if I even want to watch it, or jump ahead to find out if it's worth my time. I imagine it's the same for the majority, hence the need to stand out to garner attention. Which I think is why opinions and titles are exaggerated to appeal to emotion.  The only way I can forsee it changing is if entire generations of children are brought up with a stronger emphasis on critical thinking. I feel like the majority of people would need to be more trained for rational thought, with a skeptical outlook on things like an image macro with pseudo-science, before sharing it. Hell, sometimes even I accept things before researching them. It's so easy to appeal to emotions with opinions directly in line with, or completely against a persons core belief system."

InsightfulQuestions,3cd4l5,KidCasey,13,Tue Jul 7 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"As a journalism student, I can tell you that sensationalism has always been a part of media. There is no escaping it, however, this is why it is important to have a more media literate public.   Additionally, not all of these list-type articles and such are bad. Especially today with our tremendous info-glut, people want to cut right to the core of a story. That's why sometimes a story like ""25 Past Incidents of Racial Violence in Bloomington"" are fine. Most people will not go back and research the history of something in depth, and this short-form story type allows journalists to bring a reader up to speed and can also contextualize current news.   I feel the reason these types of attention grabbing headlines and stories are used is because we truly are able to access more news than ever before. I can find and begin to understand an issue from the left's perspective, the right's, the middle, and totally obscure independent opinions in less than an hour.   So sensationalism is here to stay. It is not something new. Part of having a free press is that journalists can write whatever they want. They can become mouthpieces for politicians, write gossip pieces, or search for earth-shattering stories and try to truly converse with the public. Whether or not these are forms of ""true"" Old Guard journalism is up for the individual to decide. However, the line between what is and is not a journalist blurs more and more daily.   tl;dr Sensationalism is and always has been a part of journalism. It's effects have simply been bolstered with an increase in media diversity. Media literacy is essential for sifting through the bullshit."

InsightfulQuestions,3cd4l5,easyjet,3,Tue Jul 7 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"I've had an interesting recent media experience which a lot of my friends 'fell for' and its been worthwhile as an exercise in showing them just how much bullshit there is out there, and how the new media (print and web) will twist everything to either suit their agenda, their masters agenda or to increase click through.  Someone we know has two fairly high profile family members who have been popular nationally for various (good, positive) reasons - specifically sporting success.   Their father raised them to be successful, and he has subsequently not been part of one of their lives because families are difficult but its not big deal. The media got a sniff of this and went to town. Calling them a ""Jeremy Kyle family"".  Daily mail sent journalists round, researching everyone in the family and even found out that the father had never married the mother, found her full name and went to town on her. Never mind the fact that its really not a thing, everyone knows, and no one gives a shit but the media would have you theyre the most disfunctional family in England.  I know the father well and he is well known. People were calling me up saying ""I heard about X, I cant believe this, i cant believe that, I thought he was different, I had no idea"" - he's still the person that everyone knows and likes, yet the papers print a sniff of controversy (not real controversy, made up controversy) and suddenly everyones opinion of the whole family takes a massive nosedive and its just awful.   To read some of the clickbaity articles about it is truly horrible. I know its all forgotten about mostly and those that know them well know the truth, the fact is, they should have to ""know the truth"", its bullshit. Its just ordinary people, with ordinary lives, pulled over the coals for some manufactured outrage. Its lapped up and then idiots chime in with their usually (badly informed) opinion based on the badly informed article they just read and got angry about.  Since the internet allowed everyone to have a ""voice"", journalism has really gone to shit."

It's just the latest form of yellow journalism, tabloid sensationalism, etc. But it's also easy to spot once you look for it, so it becomes pretty easy to avoid. That's where the real change comes in, is filtering out the hyperbolic sources and focusing on (and supporting/sharing) whoever does it right. The problem won't go away, because human nature isn't likely to change that drastically, but you can find reasonable sources, encourage critical thinking where you can, and surround yourself with like minded people."

If I am riding it any other time I would be open to conversation and I do end up talking to tourist who are lost sometimes. But I think when you live in a big city you never really have your own space so there is kind of this understanding that you don't need to talk on the metro because it might be the closest thing you are to a lone all day."

InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,NachoCanSandyRavaged,11,Mon Jul 6 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"Most people on transit exist within their own personal bubble- they listen to music, read a book or newspaper, or talk to people on their cell phone. I wouldn't say it's an unwillingness to interact with others, it's more that they're respecting each other's personal bubbles. In a given month, I maybe have a conversation with a few individuals, most barely last more than 5 minutes. If most people I sat near on the bus/train wanted to have a conversation I would be annoyed honestly- bus time is newspaper and/or sleeping time for me. The purpose of public transit is transit, not socialization opportunities; if that's what people want there's quieter and less chaotic places."
InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,canadian_anarchist,12,Mon Jul 6 01:31:46 2015 UTC,"Having to follow the social expectations that ally at, say, a cocktail party on public crowded public transportation would be miserable. I can't say high to every person around me, much less ask people I will never see again how their day went and what they do with their lives. We have to give up normal social taboos like not touching/being touched by complete strangers. We compensate by leaving people completely be and a basically pretending they aren't there.   If you run into someone from your own country on a deserted island on the other side of the world, you will likely spend the next week getting to know one another. If you cross pants with someone who lives two blocks from you in front of your own home in a dense city, they might as well live on the other side of the world."

InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,mrmoen,4,Mon Jul 6 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, the twelve months or so I took the bus to and from school each day (a four hour round-trip per day) represented one of the happiest stages of my life.  I was 18 or 19, just about to merge into the highway of adulthood, and I viewed the world with an open mind, and an open pair of eyes. I was inquisitive, curious, and did not seek to guard myself out of fear.  But, at the forefront, I was lonely. I was craving human connection, and my four hour roundtrip to and from school every day (passing through three or four cities) offered me this connection I craved.   At first, I was hesitant. I had a ton of self-doubts (what if people from my high school/city see me on the bus, oh god, it feels like everybody in cars passing by me is staring at me and judging me and I don't have a car and I feel so lame and childish and only losers take public transportation and I'm being judged so bad right now). I couldn't wait at the bus stop outside my house, because I was so scared of being judged, of being looked down upon. Then I realized this was mostly bullshit I fed myself, and every single person in their car passing by me was concentrating on their own inner world.   I dreaded waiting at bus stops or at the transit line. There was a formal etiquette of how to wait for the bus: whoever got there first, started the line. You waited in line, behind every next person. It was simplistic and beautiful, and incredibly efficient. But nobody spoke in these queue lines. You had to line up at an angle so you couldn't face the person behind or next to you, otherwise that was simply unbearably awkward. Once you got on, you looked for a row that had nobody. The informal rule was: you could only sit next to someone when every other row on the bus was filled as well, otherwise it was creepy and weird.  I learned that selfish people use their backpack and bag to take up the seat next to them, forcing people to choose other seats. I learned that window seats were the best, but it was hard getting out because you had to shuffle between somebody else's feet with your butt sticking out. I learned that nobody was really there to hurt or harm you. Nobody was really crazy enough to risk having the police called. Everybody was there to go somewhere, to do something.   I put on my earphones sometimes, and just slept. Best naps of my life. Other times, I'd do homework or read a book, but when it was dim lighting or the bus moved a lot, my head hurt, so I stopped doing that. Some days I just looked outside the bus window. To my right was the Bay Area; beautiful, magnificent urban city life. To my left was the Diablo Valley Mountain Range. Some days, I timed it just right that when I got on it was a cloudy, overcast day. Reminded me of being in some cyber-punk techno world, with the grey skies, the light drizzling of rain, and the urban city. Some days, the sky was bursting on fire with the most beautiful orange-pink hue sunset, that I almost felt like crying because of how beautiful it truly was. People don't realize it, but the weather affects people's mood on the bus. Beautiful weather creates beautiful feelings and emotions. Hot, humid weather produces road rage, traffic accidents, and angry drivers. The rain makes everybody a little more sober, more somber, and more grounded in reality.  Kierkegaard once spoke about the dizzying freedom that accompanies anything we do in life, that this inexplicable freedom we possess as human creatures capable of reason and thought represents the anxiety we face each day when confronted with a choice that we have to make. In every situation, there represents a polarity of choices. You choose to face the situation head on, or you avoid it, thus running from it. In simple situations like waiting in line at the bus stop, the anxiety that I felt from being so close to other human beings, but with nobody talking or really connecting with another, was an anxiety that has been felt at some universal level by others I believe. I have a theory that any time we feel anxious, or are in a situation that causes us anxiety, it's because it's being felt by others on some universal unconscious level as well. I realized you can eliminate anxiety by always choosing the path of discomfort. I felt anxious looking at people, but I realized if I held my gaze a little longer, nodded my head, and smiled, it was up to them to perceive me however they wanted. I felt anxious talking to people I didn't know on the bus, but I realized they felt the exact same way. Two anxious people in an anxious situation means somebody has to do something to break the tension. This is how I learned connection worked.  Most days I didn't talk to people. I sat in silence, with my music, contemplating life. It was four hours of the best contemplative thought-process I've ever had. I've never felt more alone, more freeing, more liberating. Some would consider it too tiring, too crazy to sit for four hours each day as a daily commute. But it was simply blissful. Peaceful. I soaked in and absorbed the emotions of others around me, and I could feel the energies of the bustling city life; I smelled marijuana from citydwellers, I judged others based on their clothes and could tell who most likely was homeless or used up their money just buying the bus fare; I could tell who the 9-5 workers were, and I could sense their anticipation of being late stuck in traffic. When I boarded each bus, I could sense what kind of personality was behind every driver by the way their ""Hello"" echoed to me. Was it loud or was it soft?   I looked at people in the eyes sometimes, and they looked back sometimes. It was weird, I felt uncomfortable sometimes. But some days, it was comforting. To know that there were other humans, other people, other souls. Just looking at somebody's pupils for two or three seconds can tell you all you need to know, and leaves you wanting more. But you can't look any longer, or you need to do something to eliminate the tension of two humans connecting. So I either averted my gaze, or smiled. The latter is always best.  I tried guessing at every person's story, each and every two pairs of feet that were planted in this bus, I tried hinting at little details that would tell me about themselves. Were they writing something in their journal, or reading the newspaper. Were they playing a game on their phones? Single mothers, hippie 20-year-olds, tech workers, food service and day laborers. I saw it all. I learned a lot.  Taking public transportation was an amazing experience for me. I doubt I""ll regret it. I'm kind of sad, nostalgically missing it really. Having my own car now, I just get inside and drive in a wave amongst other cars. I have to worry about not being hit, about changing lanes, I don't have the time or energy to think, to just let myself zone out and drown out the city. I don't have time to be myself, because I'm behind the wheels of a car that keeps moving.   I miss taking the bus."

Then a few people engaged with me and shit got weird. They usually wanted something from me, either something specific like cigarettes or some money or they would try to suck me into their bullshit. I quickly realized that anyone worth talking to was just looking out for their best interests by keeping to themselves. If I ride transit, I only speak to communicate quick and specific things: excuse me, thank you, etc. It's a damn shame.

InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,LetsJerkCircular,2,Mon Jul 6 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"Culture?  Also the London underground can be quite loud, especially the older trains, you pretty much have to shout over the background noise to be heard on trains like the victoria line or central line still.  Now I think it's become more of a respect thing..The same with Japanese trains .  People have to get up early and get to work (people in finance/stocks usually need to be in the office by 7am, which means getting up at 5 or so), the last thing you really want is a lot of noise and conversation.  It tends to be more talkative during the day and evening, but in the mornings people just respect each other to rest/relax until they get to work.  Personally I like the trains to be silent, it's one of the thing I find very jarring when using european metros, everyone's on the phone talking loudly to someone that's not even there, I personally think it's rude and the only real way to shut it out is music, which generates it's own noise."

InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,mechanicalhuman,3,Fri Jul 10 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"My admittedly anecdotal experience on public transit has been that the people who ride transit resent everything about having to do so; they generally resent the jobs that force them to swim in the sea of human fragrances that characterize rush hour on transit, and they resent the time they are forced to spend sitting in a chair that has been chosen as the least expensive seating that they will tolerate.  The trip to and from work/school is the time in which people are most transparently reminded that they are cattle, rushing to consume the only resource they can: seating space.  Transit is the point where people are at their least human, because they are at their least humane; they're interchangeable units, being shoved from one box to another.  The rare counterexample is the case where one runs into a good friend on the tube/metro/bus/whatever: conversations can happen, but they're awkward, because both parties see each other in an awkward spot."
InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,handshape,0,Mon Jul 6 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the same conditions apply; nasty conditions being paramount. I'd also challenge the assertion that non-rush-hour travellers aren't headed to work/school.  Next time you have the opportunity, look at the people who ride transit; really look at them.  Another counterexample would be the BART to and from the airport in SF. The seats are padded, there's plenty of room... and it's the only transit system where I've seen strangers strike up conversations with each other."
InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,handshape,2,Mon Jul 6 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"Whoa... deep breath. I'm not making any assumptions about what you personally choose to look at; ad hominem attacks don't serve the discussion in any way, either.  In terms of workers travelling outside core hours, I'll assert that I see quite a lot of them; again, it's anecdotal, but they're there -- people in fast-food, security, and healthcare uniforms.  I won't deny that there are other reasons for people to use transit -- young parents, retirees, tourists (heavily dependant on the city and the route), and people headed out to bars being the common cases I see.  Maybe I can turn it around -- in what context are people who use transit celebrated in our culture? Aside from travelling on foot, is there any other mode of transportation that is less prestigious?"
InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,handshape,3,Mon Jul 6 01:24:38 2015 UTC,You two should just state the cities and part of cities you're biased from right off.  Because transit is used very differently in different places.
InsightfulQuestions,3c8y2j,kairisika,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:05 2015 UTC,"If you were in a social venue where you could say ""everyone here is here for the same reason"", it would be easier. Even if the reason was something as unpleasant as 'we're in the waiting room of a hospital's emergency room together'.   You're on a train with, essentially, random assortments of people going various places, who may well not want to even be going there and are doing their level best to pretend they aren't, or daydreaming about other places to be. Or girding for the day, unwinding from it, or doing any number of things that involve not conversing with other people.  Also, with no social context for people, it's tougher to know where the boundaries are. Take the pleasantries between a waitstaffer and a customer. When they ask 'how are you?', the social custom is not for the waiter or waitress to honestly say that the job has been tedious today, the customer to say that that's just too bad, because they want to order now, and so on. Everything is on a very surface level, for a reason- just like here. Unless a situation exists to create comeraderie (This air-tram is stuck, there's a really awful fellow passenger we all agree is awful, etc), there is otherwise no sense of commonality."

InsightfulQuestions,3bql3p,fsacb3,7,Wed Jul 1 10:17:20 2015 UTC,"Whether it's safety, or any other issue, the mistake in thinking is supposing any action is all good or all bad. Every concept, thought, or action has both positive and negative consequences.  Let's look at child safety, for instance. We're starting to see how overprotectiveness may have a positive impact on ensuring physical safety in the short term. However, in the long term, it has some negative consequences, like children who cannot assess actual risk for themselves, and who are reactive and afraid.  This is because risk is being overblown by adults. Of course, when one hears of a local child being abducted or harmed by a stranger in some way, many parents react as if the chance of it happening to their child is high and imminent. This leads to an overreaction, making the child more fearful than is really necessary.  In addition, rather than teaching said child to be aware of the danger in a way that doesn't make them fearful of an overblown assessment of risk, what a child embraces is a general state of fear. Instead of learning a skill of environmental awareness and risk assessment, they learn an emotional reaction, of fear of the unknown.  This does not serve the child as they become an adolescent and adult, where new situations of varying risk present themselves more frequently, without the safety net of a supposedly more logical parent to judge risk for them.  Of course, attitudes about risk and safety swing like a pendulum across the ages. Eventually we'll come to a point where the pendulum starts to swing in the other direction. We may have already gotten there, as evidenced by your question and similar conversations which are becoming more frequent."
InsightfulQuestions,3bql3p,JustMeRC,2,Wed Jul 1 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"This is because risk is being overblown by adults.   Kids are actually just as safe today as they were back then. I think this is an area where we should relax. Cars, however, are definitely dangerous and most people underestimate that. It's the number one cause of death of people between the ages of 18-34. So I suppose safety is good and young people will have to find their fun elsewhere. Like the internet?    In addition, rather than teaching said child to be aware of the danger in a way that doesn't make them fearful of an overblown assessment of risk, what a child embraces is a general state of fear.   This is huge. If all we're doing is making people more anxious but safer, then it's debatable if life is any better. I might like to life a short carefree life rather than a long, worried one. The truth is somewhere in the middle."
InsightfulQuestions,3bql3p,JustMeRC,5,Wed Jul 1 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"Cars, however, are definitely dangerous and most people underestimate that.   I don't have a citation or statistic for you (too lazy to look it up,) but I believe cars are more safe than they have ever been. I don't know what the relationship is between the statistic you cited, and the same statistic in the past. If there is an increase in danger, I suspect it's because of texting and distraction more than anything, though that's just an educated guess.   It does seem like a genuine risk, and educating young adults about it would save a lot of lives. It's not about fear, really, just common sense. There are plenty of ways for young people of driving age to rebel without without doing it behind the wheel. This seems like an opportunity for parents to teach kids about community, and the responsibility that comes along with such a privilege.    I might like to life a short carefree life rather than a long, worried one.   As long as carefree doesn't mean texting while you drive, or taking a similar risk that has a high potential to physically hurt someone who doesn't want to be hurt, that seems like a personal choice. You don't want to be an asshole or narcissist either."

That would require drivers to be responsible and accept the risk that (a) they may not see oncoming traffic/a pedestrian and collide into them when turning at a red light or (b) a car that has a red light will pull out in front of you.  I just don't think in today's age we collectively would accept the additional risk to the other stakeholders that is required for an individual driver to save a few seconds/minutes waiting for a red light.

It has never occurred to the teenager driving down the freeway texting on their phone that something bad could actually happen to them. Maybe it is because they've never been allowed to do anything dangerous.   The more the someone else tells us what we can and cannot do, the less we have to think for ourselves.

In order to enforce safety, the requirement is massive bureaucracy, which is inefficient and stifling.  A big place where I think this is an issue is with healthy food and the government. Many want the government to legislate to make food healthier and curb obesity, but this poses way too many problems. First, it leads easily to the government obstructing free trade and controlling our lives. Second, the government is often very slow to adopt new scientific advancements (e.g. promoting the idea that  fat makes you fat, rather than sugar, for an obscenely long amount of time). I'd much rather be free to do as I like, possibly while being educated about health, than to be forced into certain behaviors."

One might suggest that since there is a general interconnectedness among sentient beings and their environments, no thought or action can impact only an individual. So then, what is the responsibility of others to curb actions which might have negative consequences? In the same vein, what is the responsibility of others to allow for autonomy and freedom for one another?  Remember that one person's idea of what should be curbed, will be different from yours.

InsightfulQuestions,3bmdan,shepdashep,20,Tue Jun 30 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"The trolley problem is more or less irrelevant in real life.  The three biggest problems with applying it in real life are that it assumes perfect knowledge, assumes there are only two potential choices and two potential outcomes, and assumes that the time it takes to make a decision does not effect the outcome of the decision.  That's fine for hypotheticals, but it doesn't hold true in real life situations.    Perfect knowledge is the most critical flaw here.  A car faced with, eg, people in the road can't know how those people will react.  Will they freeze in place?  Dodge to one side or another?  In your hypothetical situation, the car wouldn't even be able to reliably choose to hit one or another, because it wouldn't be able to predict the future location of the people.   Heck, the computer wouldn't even be able to know for certain one person was old and one person was young, based on a split-second scan of the nearby scenery.  It could make some imperfect guesses.  Second, it assumes there are only two potential responses.  This is pretty much never the case, especially with cars.  There's a whole range of routes a car could take, not simply two.  And the car can slam on the brakes or gas while steering.  And it can look at the road ahead to take measures to avoid such situations in the first place.  Finally, the thought experiment doesn't account for processing time.  Even a computer can't think infinitely quickly.  This is especially true if you are asking it to do things like estimate the value of human life based on things a visual estimation of age.  If your computer spends time trying to figure out which person is more valuable to impact, it may wind up plowing into one.  Whereas if it just slams on the brakes without thinking, it might well avoid hitting either.    In short, I don't think computer programmers will care about the trolley problem at all. They'll likely program cars to make decisions the way humans do: by using heuristics (rules of thumb) and doing future discounting.  This is the most reasonable way to deal with the trolley problem in real world.  The rules are going to be something like ""If there's anything in the way, slam on the brakes and steer for an open road""  and ""if the object looks sort of human-like, prioritize avoiding it over non-humanlike  objects"" and ""if an object is going to be hit sooner, prioritize avoiding it over more distant objects"".  Trying to get a car to reliably identify a bunch of characteristics about humans and then make some complicated decision between them is just not going to happen."

Does it choose to save a young couple or a toddler on the sidewalk, one results in 2 deaths but the other is the death of a child.  We have to choose how the software is going to respond.  What about the first lawsuit when it's found the software made its choice and chose one person over another and their relatives are now angry and asking why it didn't make the other choice, then we have to justify these decisions in court.

You could argue that a president should be prioritized over a teenager ""not doing much with his life"" regarding an AI decision for lethal chance. Although I'd understand where you're coming from, I believe there's no way of telling if the teenager won't find a magical cure for cancer or if the president won't go insane and order the killing of thousands.

InsightfulQuestions,3bmdan,TheMusicArchivist,2,Tue Jun 30 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"That would be my opinion, indeed.  A related ""paradox"" is the fact that western societies tend to consider the loss of a baby much more terrible than the loss of an elder, the reasoning being that the child still had a lifetime to live which he has lost and that the elder had already lived for a long time and thus didn't lose much.  Other societies consider the loss of an elder more sad, the reasoning being it's lived so many experiences that he was a source of wisdom and teachings for everyone, as opposed to a baby.  Different cultures have different belief systems. Different people have different belief system. Could self-driving car owners ""tune"" their AI to prioritize young, busty women because they're single? It sounds stupid when put that way, but the underlying principle is the same"
InsightfulQuestions,3bmdan,jmottram08,2,Tue Jun 30 14:02:29 2015 UTC,"I always thought our western obsession with the life of a child was odd.

Something like a virus scanning 'toll booth' comes to mind, where your vehicle's software would be automatically scanned and any alterations would be reported to the authorities. If your vehicle didn't pass the scan, it would be re-routed to the shoulder or, if the hack prevented that, would be tracked by the police and forced off the road."

Two principle middle lanes. Two side middle lanes. And two outer lanes. In between the east side middle lanes and the east outer lanes are trolley tracks going in both directions. The only way to switch from the side middle lane to the outer middle lane is to traverse the trolley track.   So the trolly problem is being able to make this lane shift without being sideswiped by (or sideswiping) one of two trolleys traveling in either direction.

InsightfulQuestions,3bcez6,Beddersthedog,19,Sat Jun 27 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"40 year old here. I'd argue it's a false dichotomy. It is possible to have a stable career and family life (boring, to use your word), and at the same time pursue passions and goals. I'd even argue that the former is likely to increase your success rate of the latter.    With a safe, stable home base, you will feel more confident taking a risk on an idea or passion. If it fails, you have a safe physical and psychological place to return to. Your job provides an economic safety net, your partner provides relational support. If it succeeds, you have someone to celebrate with. And along the way, you have someone you trust to consult with. Those are some valuable assets when you've got a dream to pursue.  All that said, I'd never bet the farm on a passion. That's irresponsible if you've got other people in your life to look after. So, you take calculated risks. You plan, you save, you wait. But that doesn't mean you let your dreams die. You just have to be more thoughtful about them and less impulsive. I think that drawn out preparation phase is an asset too.  It's been a long time since I read Brave New World. If your impression is accurate, I disagree with Huxley's argument. He's arguing the best way to be your true self is to live in a vacuum. I can tell you I've become more whole (and happy) as a person in my marriage and through raising kids than I would have in that same time living single. And, I still have dreams and passions I pursue."

InsightfulQuestions,3bcez6,ygduf,7,Sun Jun 28 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"It's a false dichotomy. It seems like these are the two options from a young person's point of view. I can either be single, adventurous, career-minded, and wild. Or I can be married, with kids, living a boring life in suburbia. This is not really how it works. The equivalent would be if I, as an adult, looked back on high school and said a kid can either be smart, get good grades, and a complete nerd with no friends or he could be athletic, good looking, and popular. Bullshit.  There is no exciting vs boring split. You think people who raise families are not pursuing their passions and are no longer idealistic or taking risks? No way. I would argue that they are often more passionate, adventurous, and idealistic. And the people who focus solely on their careers at the expense of finding a balanced life? They may end up boring, and their path could be considered ""safe"" since they never took the biggest risk of all: loving someone and creating a life.   Let me also say that I am 36 and single. I have taken the road of adventure, passion, and following my dream. I have no desire to have a family. But don't think for a minute I consider my life to be better, more adventurous, or less boring than those that have families and steady careers. Boring people are going to be boring. They could be boring with a steady job and a family or boring while living la vida loca.   You seem to want to take the risky road, the road less traveled by. But let me tell you, there is no fork in the road. There's no moment when you get to choose this way or that. Or rather, every moment is a choice, but there is no right choice and no choice is irrevocable, and no road will lead to the place you think or hope it will. And also let me say that having a ""stable"" job with a family is one of the most risky and adventurous paths to take. Since when did creating a life and raising a person become antithetical to pursuing one's true self? You are the person you are, and you will live an amazing life of passion if that is what you pursue. But the details of how many kids you have or how long you've held your job have no effect on your level of passion or badassery."

InsightfulQuestions,3bcez6,-eagle73,3,Sun Jun 28 08:00:53 2015 UTC,"I can tell just from the wording if the question that you are young - early twenties or younger. This isn't a real problem. You'll see when you get there. It's not giving up in dreams and passions; you become passionate about different things.  Once I dreaded the prospect of living the meaningless suburban life of everyone I knew. I went to India, traveled with (Indian) musicians, studied puppetry in Bulgaria, acted Chekov in Russia, sang at a conservatory, saw the Great Wall, served as an advisor to senators, participated in tea ceremonies in Japan and studied karate... it's interesting but it's lonely. And it's self-centered - I mean that non-judgementally.  Today I derive more joy and passion from watching my little girl proudly show off her new fly swatter to everyone in the hardware store. I make up stories about monsters who wear sneakers. And when I look on the smiling eyes of my baby, I contemplate whether my kisses and cuddles are building a solid foundation for happy relationships somewhere deep inside her forming mind. I wonder what makes her so happy every morning.  The people I know who had a true dream and stuck with it are like my husband: once a long-haired president of the environmental club at his college, now goes to work in a suit to protect the environment as a lawyer for the state. When you have a passion to make a difference and you stick with it, it eventually turns into a regular job working away at your piece of the puzzle. If you want to play the part of a passionate hero with a dream, you usually aren't actually accomplishing much.  You'll see. Your dreams change. The happy, dull life you once dreaded means a steady partner in your life who laughs at the same stuff you do, and listens to your thoughts and helps you plan things.  The suburban house you thought would make you mediocre becomes a space you can design to your liking, and room to take care of your kids. And your kids become the source if an intense passion and magic in your life you haven't even dreamt of yet. You'll see."

Hell, you may find that what works for you in your 20s doesn't fit who you are in your 30s and so on. It is a brave thing to ditch what you are doing and start over but I've known plenty of people who've done it.  My dad was an office worker in his 20s and then whilst mom was pregnant with me (VERY brave) he walked out of that job, fixed up a van he found in a field and started delivering groceries door-to-door. That worked well and then he owned a shop for 15 years (ran the shop next door to it for a couple of years too). Then in his 40s he went back into education (never got a degree when he was younger) and now he's a scientist in a lab!  I also know a woman who was a very successful scientist in a pharmaceutical company for decades - she earned good money but was tired of it by her late 40s so she went back to university and now she's a teacher. Less money and harder work, but it made her happier.  Finally, a family friend has a couple of degrees, very clever man, but you know what finally made him happy? Janitorial work.

Finished my 4 year degree in 2.5, and have the same expected 'bright future' from friends and family. I now live on my own in a big city getting started. So listen to me:  Don't look for your work to bring you happiness. I promise you won't find it there. Study something you're interested in, yes, and something that you would be interested in doing professionally, but this is NOT to be where you should draw your ""happiness"" from.  Find hobbies. Thinks you love doing and can progress in. Until now, most of your extracurricular interests have been measured as competition, graded, stacked, or otherwise assigned to something. All your hobbies from now on? They grow with you and only you. Want to take up something? JUST. DO IT. And grow with it. And know that no one will ever require you to do it, or give you some sort of reflective 'grade' of improvement or performance.  Want to learn an instrument? Do it. Don't worry about being in orchestra where you have chair tests. Want to take up pottery? Do it. Don't worry about getting a grade for a project. Want to try a new sport? Learn calisthenics or gymnastics? Do it. Grow slow. And never have to compete against someone to validate your hard work. All your validation comes from the small growth you make in the hobby.   That's where you find happiness. You're like me. Your ultimate goal was graduating early and finding a good job. That was what was pushed by your friends and family! And damn you were good at working for that goal. But now you're there...and secondly more than likely by yourself starting your adult life. And you're feeling like now what?

I think a lot of people are looking at what you do to be happy instead of how you chose to view the world.    I have a job that is high paying for a 26 year old, and has excellent earning potential.  I pursued marketing and finance in college because it was somewhat interesting but also because I knew it could land me a good job.  If I ""followed my heart"" I would have been a high school history teacher.     I feel immensely satisfied and fulfilled with my life, but it has a lot more to do with my outlook than my work.  I appreciate the things in my job I like, such as the challenges and competitiveness, and know some things you just have to hold your nose on.  I also am engaged and have a wonderful fiancé and a crazy little puppy.  Those two bring more joy than any job ever could, and knowing I can take care of them makes me feel fulfilled.   Maybe the real answer is that my purpose is not tied to my work life. I can appreciate aspects of my work, but I am fulfilled and find purpose by learning, growing intellectually, and spending time with loved ones.

You have to find something good and positive to do for a career, but if you let you're job define you there are loads of problems.  What happens to your identity if you get laid off? What if you decide to totally change careers? Your purpose should be deeper than your career choice, but echo through it.  I love learning new things and solving problems, so my career works but I could easily find those same characteristics in jobs ranging from engineering to psychology.   Basically, don't freak out or feel lost because you have a decision to make that will influence your career and life.  Figure out what makes you, you. Creativity, intellectualism, competitiveness, problem solving, etc. and find a career that provides those things, knowing it won't be perfect. Then, work to build relationships with people who will help you become the kind of person you want to be. If you do that, you'll be great.     On a more practical note, I'll add that worrying about money is life consuming.  That worry can come regardless of your income- for example I had friends buy new trucks and boats out of college because they suddenly had money. I bought a used car.  I'm not at all worried about paying my credit card bill on time, though, where they are always bitching about boat repairs and what have you.

InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,bojslo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was talking of animals but you might consider the physical relationship of inanimate represents the perfect interaction.

Intelligence doesn't exists; stupidity does, the best we can hope for it to be less stupid."
InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,davidpbrown,2,Sat Jun 27 10:05:07 2015 UTC,"All morality is derived from that thought.. and then all law is an attempt at optimisation towards that ideal. Sometimes law will make an arbitrary choice where there is no known difference.. like whether we drive on the left or the right.  Beyond that there is only opportunity, where it could be understood that we might have an interest in acting to further progress the world beyond the stupidities. So, for example, there might be events that present themselves where becoming involved in a constructive way would see the world progress - arguably education is one of those. The bigger instance which some might argue is an obligation, would be event that without our input would be seen to actively frustrate or retard progress.. that is fighting what would be substantially evil and contrary to what is better for all. So, an example would be action to counter any natural disaster. However, such action perhaps might be limited to natural ignorant action by others and by nature itself, rather than any other considered actions. Considered actions are better resolved by reality pushing back at them, rather than us emulating what perfect response reality will give. That's not to suggest we should not act; we should represent our interest but we should not get involved in some pretentious way suggesting somehow that we can action feedback better than reality would do.  The common error made by those who are concerned with the state of the world, is well intentioned proactive interference, which is then dull relative to reality; their moralising then causes far more problems than it resolves. Knowing when to act and when not, is most important."

When we look at liberal vs conservative policy in the United States both can be described as moral by supporters and immoral by dissenters, but objectively speaking they both seek to minimize harm for the greatest number of people. Conservatives have stricter laws to benefit the safety of the out of prison population and preempt potentially dangerous behavior of the governed. Liberals prefer to minimize harm to others by maximizing pleasure to a greater number of people, typically and historically this involves repealing laws that are restrictive on citizens."

InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,jawdirk,2,Sat Jun 27 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"I think there is degrees of evil besides the morality of harming others. Some evil is criminal and some evil is not. The golden rule is based on the logic of human behavior. If you break the golden rule you are a hypocrite/illogical and therefore wrong. Logic therefore can be seen as an absolute ideal for morality. However, if we try to make certain actions absolute (that is to say, ignoring extenuating circumstances), we can further our idea of morality with the ideal of rationality. It is evil to kill someone, but if out of necessity you kill someone who is trying to kill you then that is rational (or practical). Another example is, even though it is looked down upon in our society, stealing from wealthy people out of necessity(the caveat being you are not stealing for your own personal wealth but instead for survival, like food/water.)"

InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,maitreyan1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well I think in general consentual acts shouldn't be illegal unless they violate their basic human rights(which are difficult to define as absolute without a God, but can be agreed upon none the less). I don't think nudity in designated public places should be illegal nor should prostitution.  In the case of incest it can lead to deformities, and you could say you wouldn't have want to have  been deformed so you shouldn't do that to others. Even if it is sex with protection/birth control those methods aren't 100% effective and there is a risk. If a woman is barren or to old to have a child I guess it would be okay for her to have sex with family members."
InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,maitreyan1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"This is where I disagree with you. I think some lines that cultures have consistently drawn through the millennia ought to be respected for their wisdom. It is not good for the inner self to do some things. Sex with a family member is unnatural. It is a twisting of normal relationships. It is not without consequence.  There are some things that ought not to be done because there is a proper way to live that results in the optimal health of the self and others. Psychotherapy would havea ahard time reconciling the inner tensions that would result from an oedipal relationship, for instance.  I assert that morality should go beyond simply avoiding harm to another, and ought to recognize norms as healthy, and to depart from those accepted norms with great care.  It doesn't have to be harmful to others in order to be wrong.   I know this isn't the popular view. But there are subtle and not-so-subtle complications that occur when we transgress moral boundaries that our ancestors have set. Those lines were not drawn arbitrarily. They are the result of vast years of experience. Just as traditions hold wisdom, so do many taboos. Proper might be termed as that which avoids trouble.   Promiscuity, for instance, is not harmless. It results in fatherless children, children raised by fewer than the two parents involved in conception, which I assert is the ideal. Adoption is not wrong, but it is certainly not preferable to being raised by one's own parents, all else being equal.  Lowest common denominator morality is not very effective, just asserting what everyone can agree on. A higher standard results in a more ideal life. Honesty is good, but kindness in honesty is better. Settling for not overtly harming others is settling for the lowest standard of good.  I feel that great care should be taken in determining how one ought to live life, for all concerned, and avoidance of overt harm is the least one should strive for.   you touched on the golden rule. Love for one another is the gold standard.   Anyway, I don't think I'll convince you. It is my opinion that morality should pursue an ideal of behavior. And that traditions and taboos passed down may or may not have relevance, but ought not to be tossed aside thoughtlessly, as there may have been very good reasons for their development."
InsightfulQuestions,3ba7de,WaitThisIsntDigg,2,Thu Jul 16 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, I believe in God, so the idea that some actions can be evil because they are unnatural is entirely plausible. So if all promiscuous sex is evil, because sex is meant between two  married people as they are fit for raising a child(God's plan), then sex between family members could be evil too. It may also be unnatural to see family members as attractive. But do I think it is a crime that is punishable? Not if anyone is offended or violated. edit : I think God's higher justice would be to defend victims, not just punish people for sins unless there was greater reason for this. Also, I have a very complex theory of morality, but there are basic tenets with a strong philosophical basis which seem to be irrefutable. It is just a matter of putting all the pieces of the puzzle together to make a coherent whole idea of morality."

InsightfulQuestions,3b7j8s,jimprovost,18,Sat Jun 27 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"First came barter.  I'm a goat herder, and I have goats.  You're a clothier and you have clothes.  I want clothes, you want to eat.  We come to an arrangement.  But what if you don't want goats?  Well, I can't get clothes until I find someone who wants goats and has something that you want.  Or until I find someone who wants goats and has something that someone else wants who has something you want.  Or...  well, you get the picture.  At some point, someone came up with the bright idea of trading something valuable.  That way I can trade my goat for something small and valuable, such as a small copper trinket.  I can then trade that small copper trinket to you for clothing.  And then you can trade it to someone else to get whatever it is that you actually want.  As society got more and more wealthy and people specialized more and more, the trinkets used as a medium of exchange similarly got more valuable.  So now we're using gold and silver coins.  But commodity currencies have problems, some pretty serious problems.  For one, they're heavy and bulky, so it's difficult (and dangerous!) to transport large amounts of currency.  For another, supply is difficult to regulate (because even if it's not a coin, a bit of gold is just as good) and doesn't respond to the tempo of the economy, leading to large economic booms and busts.    To solve the first problem (and for other reasons) governments started issuing certificates that basically said ""this is an IOU.  If you ask for it, you'll get a gram of gold for this.""  To solve the second problem, governments started issuing certificates that didn't say that.    So, long story short, money is valuable because money is valuable.  In the modern world of fiat currencies, it's value is largely tied to the economic health of the country that printed it, but it's far more complicated than that."
InsightfulQuestions,3b7j8s,Astramancer_,10,Fri Jun 26 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"While the barter system is a nice and tidy explanation, there is no evidence that it ever existed before money was created. Rather, it was only used in market economies that had had a shortage of currency.   The reason we hold on to barter is because we're looking at it through the lens of our market-based economy - we assume (falsely) that the only means of economy are an equal exchange of goods, so we assume (falsely) that this was the case before money was created as well.   As it turns out, economies operated VERY differently than we assume they did, often even after currency was created. In many societies, there was no concept of individual ownership of goods, they belonged to everybody and could be used as such, while social norms like cooperation stopped one person from, say, eating all the food. The thinking was, ""We have goats and we have clothes"".  Other societies used gift economies, where one person would give another a gift, and it was expected of the recipient to give another gift to the giver or to somebody else. Sometimes the gifts would escalate in value and become more and more lavish. This didn't necessarily have the frivolousness we think of with gift giving, and not obeying the gift giving traditions could have serious social repercussions.  The thinking here was ""I have goats. You need goats. Have a goat.""  Perhaps the biggest bit of misinformation about economies is the idea that market-exchange systems are somehow in our blood or DNA. They were historically created, with most of the exchange ideas we accept as given being born out of the industrial revolution."
InsightfulQuestions,3b7j8s,MrSamsonite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"Trade between markets has existed since at least the second millennium BCE with records of long distance trade being maintained by the Assyrian empire. Market based economies are in fact deeply rooted in history. In so far as there was communal property, certainly true in many places, there was generally a mix of communal and private real property with certain functions having a communal role (bread ovens, resources in lakes, religious institutions and so on), and others having a decidedly private nature that were recognized under the law (for example houses, personal harvests, cattle and so on). Sumeria for example, one of the oldest civilizations for which we have records, had laws that prevented the forced sale of property.   Basically though, most complex agrarian societies had some concept of personal property, and often private property, usually codified in law, and certainly every state touched by the Roman Empire and the Chinese Empire developed complex bodies of private property law. Indeed the Roman Law is still studied in law schools to this day due to its impressive scope, depth of thought and alternative system of jurisprudence. The primary difference is not in the fact that all property was common, something simply not evidence by the historical and archaeological record, but rather that the way property rights were codified was significantly different in past societies. It is fair to say that common property was, well, a lot more common in the past, to say that many societies had no concept of ownership is simply not accurate unless you are confining your claim to hunter-gatherer societies, nomadic tribes and horticulturalists. Once surplus agriculture and coinage enters the picture, based on the evidence we have available, it seems nearly every society begins to get involved in trade and various forms of private ownership begin to be recognized."

InsightfulQuestions,3b7j8s,gus_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:49:02 2015 UTC,"Because no one really gave a full correct answer IMO:  Money is simply an IOU; that is, a financial credit/debt relationship between the IOU issuer (who sees it as their liability) and the IOU bearer (who sees it as their asset). Then when you're talking about money 'things' (like physical bills/coins, electronic numbers in a bank account, etc.), those are simply formal recorded evidence/accounting of the underlying credit/debt relationships.  So what gives IOUs/money value? Well, it's what the IOU promises to pay when redeemed. Said another way, what it can be 'converted' into upon redemption. So we could denominate our IOUs in real goods, like ""I owe you 5 lbs. of bananas"", and that bill could circulate at around the value of bananas (and depending on how much you trust me to be good for it).   But in our monetary economy, basically everyone denominates their debt in the national unit of account (dollars, euros, yen, etc.) which is a measurement unit for value (like an inch or meter for distance). And what their debt promises to pay is someone else's debt (someone more important/trustworthy/valuable). So when I write a personal check for $100, I'm creating an IOU (essentially money) that is a promise to pay you $100 of my bank's IOUs (moving some numbers from my checking account to yours). My bank's IOU (checking account) is a promise to pay an equivalent amount of government IOUs (central bank notes, coins, or reserves).  At the top of this hierarchy is the government money/IOU. With the current fiat money system, it is said to be 'non-convertible'. If you turn in a $5 bill to the central bank, they only promise to give you another $5 bill (or maybe five $1s to make change). In the past, governments have experimented with gold standards (giving their liabilities convertibility to real goods), to make their money more trustworthy/valuable. But ultimately it's not required, because the true value of government liabilities is that they're the only way to discharge our own debt to the government (taxes). So if the government declares that every adult in the country owes taxes, and taxes are only payable in the government's own IOUs, then everyone has a reason to value the government's own non-convertible IOUs. This understanding of fiat currency is known as chartalism, and there's building evidence now that it's the way most money systems in history have worked.  Here's a great paper on the problems with the typical barter myth, and solid logical/historical arguments in line with the chartalist approach. And I second the recommendation of Felix Martin's book Money."

Unless a supervisor is going to be there all day anyway (and a certain amount of conversation is to be expected during slow bits) virtually all interaction with management is, ime, filtered through the question ""can I get back to work?"". ('Is this going to end in a reprimand, or a commendation?', 'Why are they singling me out- is it good or bad?', etc being offshoots) Whether the person in question has ink or not doesn't enter into it.

Keep in mind we basically have to figure out a way to override a very deeply ingrained evolutionary history of creating (now unhealthy) reward circuits associated with food.
InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,helpful_hank,10,Thu Jun 25 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"Of course. The conditions I have in mind are inspired partly by the Rat Park Experiment. If we can get our vital needs met in everyday life, we won't need to compensate endlessly for unmet needs via addiction. I don't have the energy to write in depth about this now, but here are some ideas:   Not feeling respected or useful as a young adult (nobody cares what you think until you have a college degree; just spend all day in a high school building with a literal fence around it like a prison, being told what to do and think, subject to unjust rules (""zero tolerance policy"") and legally disallowed from leaving) obsession with celebrity culture and glamor (if you're not rich or famous, you're worthless and/or have no hope of being happy) feeling powerless as a citizen in the face of corporate and political corruption advertising based on exploiting base desires and exacerbating our sense of lack and insecurity ""meritocratic"" approach to life -- if you're not working or pursuing a well-paid conventional job, you don't deserve love   etc.  All of these make it more difficult to feel satisfied, even when we have enough to satisfy us. It's not substances, therefore, that become addictive, but inner conditions brought about by environmental conditions not oriented toward serving our interests. That's not to say ""blame society,"" I'm a huge proponent of personal responsibility -- but I don't think the epidemic will end until it is ceases being so pervasively motivated."

InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,Smithium,2,Thu Jun 25 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"There is a good reason for corn subsidies: food stability.  Corn is easy to store and in the event of a global food shortage having that large supply of corn will help prevent all food prices from spiking nearly as much.  Also, beet sugar isn't actually more expensive than HFCS, at least not anymore.  Between 2009 and 2012 it was more expensive spiking at about 2x the price in 2010, but now is the same price: http://www.cornnaturally.com/Economics-of-HFCS/price-calculator.aspx .

InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,ArcherofArchet,6,Thu Jun 25 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"We don't know the answer to this question yet. The science underlying a lot of nutrition advice is shockingly weak. I donate to the Nutrition Science Initiative which is funding and coordinating some much higher-quality studies on obesity-related topics than most of what's in the literature.  The results matter a lot because without them, it's hard to make concrete recommendations or put concrete rules in place and have good confidence that they'll actually work. Just look at the Food Pyramid, a mostly political invention which for decades urged people to scarf down lots of bread and cereal and cut their fat intake to near zero. Nowadays there's a decent (but not yet completely slam-dunk compelling) body of evidence that that's exactly the kind of diet that leads to long-term weight gain in most people. The studies the Nutrition Science Initiative is leading will get us much closer to settling questions like that.  There's also some evidence that different groups of people are genetically more likely to gain weight quickly from different kinds of foods. Again, having solid empirical evidence will help us figure out which bits of dietary advice are one-size-fits-all and which ones need to be tailored to individuals. Common sense is a very poor guide here since what works for you and your family may not work for people who don't share your specific genes.  With solid, reproducible evidence in hand, consumers and governments can start to pressure food sellers to change their menus in specific ways and those changes will be likely to have actual positive effects. Absent good evidence, it's kind of a free-for-all and people are likely to demand changes that actually end up being harmful."
InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,ArcherofArchet,21,Wed Jun 24 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Obesity is not surprisingly highest not in the richest, but the poorest of population segments.  Why?  Because healthy, nutritious food is expensive; because cooking it takes a lot of effort and planning; because fresh food doesn't keep long.  Imagine that you live on the bare minimum - minimum wage or less, aid, food stamps, very low income at or near poverty levels.  You likely don't have a car, or if you do, you need to really watch your gas usage, so you probably go to the store once, maybe twice a month.  Less trips to the store also means less temptation to buy something that makes you forget about the crap you are in (chocolate, alcohol, cigarettes, snacks - anything that's immediate gratification).  So you get your food stamps on the third of the month, and you buy everything you will need until the third of the next month.  Likely, you also have very little means of cooking - either because you just don't have the appliances/dishes for it, or because you are disabled.  Possibly, you would have the appliances, but the idea of spending two hours over a homecooked meal is just an impossible waste of time for you, because you work odd shifts, you may have a side job to make ends meet, you may have kids or other family members who need tending, so the whole time investment is kind of out.  There's also the factor of ""I have no idea how to cook anything that's not Hamburger Helper or fried chicken.""  So your choices are these...  $1.50 will buy you a healthy, nice crown of broccoli, which you then have to take home, cook, season, etc., and isn't very satisfying.  $1.50 will also buy you a McDouble, which is meaty, satisfying, and makes you feel at least somewhat full until you roll out of bed the next morning.  So there's the diet end of it.  I do suggest the movie Food, Inc. - it describes pretty well how working poor families are trapped in the drive-thru (no joke or alluding to Weird Al's opus).  As to exercise, kind of the same thing.  Poor people don't have the time, and can't afford a gym membership.  Most likely, their residential areas are not suitable for running or outdoor exercise because of pollution or crime.  Any equipment needed (including decent running shoes) are just out of their budgetary range.  And again, there's that time factor, when you put in long hours at your job, which is quite likely mentally/emotionally draining, you are not going to want to work out.  The rate of poverty is higher in the US today than it has been pretty much ever since WWII.  The middle class is crumbling, and struggling.  More and more are falling into these pitfalls.  So what's the solution?  Uplifting the poor.  Providing meaningful nutrition assistance - currently, SNAP provides something along the lines of $4.50 a day to live off of.  The CEO of Panera tried living on it for a week, and said it was miserable.  Also, providing the poor with meaningful access to healthcare, to healthy exercise, to ways to learn about how to cook healthier would go a long way."
InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,ArcherofArchet,8,Wed Jun 24 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the empirical fact that those who are less wealthy (in developed countries) have higher rates of obesity and this is unlikely to be a coincidence. I do disagree with some of your analysis, however.  I think living at or near the poverty line is likely quite grueling. Individuals in this social class tend to work really taxing, menial, stressful jobs (often more than one). As a result, I can understand why someone might choose to use food as a form of instant gratification or stress relief. I think emotional eating in general is likely a very under-recognized factor that contributes to obesity, and it is a difficult one to address.  However, I'm not sure about the accuracy of some of your views about having access to appliances, the cost of healthy food, and prep time. Perhaps perceived costs and prep time do inhibit people, but those concerns don't seem very well grounded in reality.   Firstly, most Americans (I assume we're generally talking about developed countries) have access to a microwave, stove, and refrigerator. Those who are homeless are obviously a noteworthy exception, but also probably aren't the primary contributors to obesity. Here's the data to support my assertions: in 2005 in the United States, 99.9% of households had a fridge, 98.5% had a stove and oven, 87.9% had a microwave, and 58.3% had a dishwasher (but doing dishes by hand really isn't that hard). [Source](http://www.heritage.org/~/media/images/reports/2011/07/b2575/b2575_chart1600px.ashx?w=600&h=586&as=1)    Some healthy food is expensive, but this certainly isn't universally true. In fact, I'm inclined to think that unhealthy food is often more expensive (drinking soda instead of tap water, processed foods as snacks instead of fruits like apples, etc.). Things like oatmeal, chicken breast in bulk (if you have a freezer), many fruits and vegetables like broccoli, spinach, oranges, apples, etc., beans and legumes (like lentils), rice, pasta, and eggs are all quite cheap. Also, in terms of spices, I find that garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning can get me pretty far. I'll be honest when I say that I have never had a McDouble before, but it can't be that satiating, and I know broccoli is actually extremely satiating (and takes me 2 minutes to prepare in themicrowave  with a mug of water to steam it). Fresh broccoli flourets are roughly 1.80 per pround, and to be clear about how much broccoli we're talking about: https://cookingincollege101.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dscn2308.jpg its a quite a bit.  I think that at the very least though, you're right that these are perceived barriers to entry for being healthy those in lower socioeconomic classes. Perhaps promoting education about healthy + cheap choices and some basic cooking skills. Weekly meal preps have really helped with my busy schedule, so perhaps promoting awareness of that strategy would be helpful too.   I partially agree with you on exercise, although frankly I'm not sure how much I buy the argument that urban areas are usually too polluted to go outside. I think you're probably right about being exhausted though. Then again, most of weight loss is just about eating less, rather than exercise. It kinds of makes sense too considering its basically the difference between choosing not to eat a snickers bar and running 2 miles.  What type of alternative nutritional assistance would you suggest? Apparently, improved access to nutritional food doesn't tend to help in food deserts (perhaps because old habits can be hard to change). I would definitely support expanding SNAP - I know its sort of a sensitive topic to 'shame' people for what they buy with food stamps (not getting the 'right foods'), but I think it might be a decent idea to expand funding but the additional money can only be spent on certain healthy categories of food items.  I'm nots sure to what degree education will make a difference. Its certainly with trying, but it already feels like there is an abundance of non-govermental resources about how to eat healthy on a budget and how to do do basic cooking / weekly meal prep. I'm not sure to what extent spending resources to have the government just reiterate those things would be productive."
InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,Uncle_Erik,4,Wed Jun 24 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Let me address this by factor here...   1) Emotional eating: totally agreed.  Especially on the menial, taxing, crappy jobs.  I've been there, and done that, personally, as well - both the job and the self-rewarding cheeseburgers.  2) Appliance access: I slightly disagree.  Just because you may report as ""owning"" a stove, it may not be in working order.  I know this is anecdotal evidence, but I do know several people living on welfare who ""own"" a stove and a microwave, except that it doesn't work.  As to perceived cost in time, it's definitely there.  3) Exercise: It's somewhat grounded in my own reality of the Central Valley of California.  Here we have more ""unhealthy to sensitive groups"" or ""unhealthy"" air days than moderate or good air days in a year.  We also have an extremely poor population, a high rate of asthma, and little to no chance to exercise outside.  4) Old habits: I did not mention this, but you are most definitely right.  Especially those who grew up poor, and got used to the taste of unhealthy foods have a hard time adjusting to the taste/texture of their healthy versions.  5) Additional food assistance: I know it would be an investment, and difficult to get off the ground, but food pantries should start offering more fresh choices, rather than easy-to-store nonperishables.  There are lots of people out there who get a large chunk of their monthly food from the food pantry - and usually their choices are limited to various canned goods, pasta, and maybe legumes.  If food banks/pantries would provide fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis, I think it would go a long way towards fostering healthier eating habits.  6) Education: I exactly meant the education you mentioned; helping people figure out what healthy options are also cheap, and what cheap options are also healthy.  I'd also improve education of this in schools, from an early age.  I can't speak for nationwide trends, but I know that my local school district completely did away with home economics classes.  Returning something similar to classrooms, where kids can learn how to cook some basic things will not have an immediate impact on obesity, but more of a long-term effect on how the next generation will choose to eat.  7) Expanding SNAP: I agree, and I don't at the same time.  I do believe that SNAP should be expanded, and that there should be some guidelines on what to spend it on, but to me, it's a question of where to draw the line.  Personally, I'm pretty libertarian, and I don't like the idea of the government telling me what I can and can't do with my own body, whether it's about nutrition, smoking, drugs, abortions, etc.  So I'm somewhat disagreeing with you on regulating what you can and can't buy...  but I am all for incentives like the farmers' market double-dollar program for SNAP.  Another idea could be simply reducing subsidies to crops like corn and alfalfa, and funneling more money to ""specialty crops"" (vegetables, fruits - anything that needs more tending than a field of corn) to help the prices come further down."
InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,G-42,6,Wed Jun 24 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a lot of good reasons to reduce subsidies. But I can't quite understand your libertarian opposition to my SNAP suggestion - it would make sense if you were against government handouts in the general, but if you already support the government giving people free money, I hardly see how that's a restriction on liberty. To me that would be like me loaning a friend money for a specific purpose - I'm not restricting their liberty by specifying it's intended purpose because I'm the one lending them money...."

Two McDoubles and a glass of water is around 900 calories.  And that was the only thing I'd eat.  That ran a calorie deficit that stripped off two pounds every week.  I stopped being fat by eating shit food.  So if all you can afford is McDonald's, that's totally fine.  You can run a calorie deficit eating McDonald's.  I know because I did.

Our digestive tracts contain a great many bacteria, which are necessary for the digestion and assimilation of nutrients. Scientists are investigating the variations in the make-up of one's gut bacteria, and how they might produce health, or autoimmunity, or obesity, depression,  etc.  The decline of certain bacteria in the general population, may be the reason for such widespread obesity (which is not just a poor people problem). There are four conditions it is theorized, are responsible for the rise in obesity and certain diseases:  1.  Increasing consumption of industrialized processed foods 2.  Widespread use of antibiotics 3.  The alarming rise in cesarean section deliveries (now one in 3 births) 4.  The decline in breast feeding   There's a whole subreddit dedicated to information about it, /r/microbiome. A quick search over there for articles on obesity yielded this list.  There was a really great article in NY Magazine not that long ago about a husband and wife researchers who came out with a book about their study of the gut microbiome called, The Good Gut. The article is a bit long, but I highly recommend it if you're interested in this stuff.  In regards to depression, it may also be the result of imbalanced gut bacteria. So, one's system gets out of whack because of the factors listed above, which causes them to be more susceptible to depression, which causes them to eat worse. One theory is that we eat what our gut bacteria crave, so if you've got more of the wrong bacteria, you're going to crave more of what it wants, which will only make things worse. There's absolutely a stress element involved, which they address in this article from the NY Times, Can the Bacteria In Your Gut Explain Your Mood?  The solutions posed by the authors of the Good Gut, are to eat less processed food and more fermented foods, reduce antibiotic use, prioritize vaginal deliveries, and breastfeed. They also think we should stop cleaning so much, and increase our contact with bacteria via dirt.  The solutions proposed by other scientists include fecal bacteriotherapy, which is currently being used to treat C. difficile infections, but being investigated for many other things. They are also looking to categorize and isolate certain bacteria, in the hopes that administering more massive doses of certain types or colonies can provide more rapid improvement."

InsightfulQuestions,3azn49,GoldenFalcon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"Control the cost of or tax junk food. I would like to see food prices roughly in line with a certain $/calories figure but also with consideration for nutrition (e.g. if a head of broccoli costs $2.50 and gives you 51 calories, and a Baconator gives you about 1000, then the Baconator should cost you -at least- $49, and a can of coke should cost you about $6.90; I don't know how you'd price diet coke and things with 0 calories, but perhaps they are exempt from this scheme). This is analogous to the proposed carbon taxes to cure our dependency on carbon. Seriously, would you eat at Wendy's if it cost you $100 for a normal sized meal? (or would Wendy's be offering more reasonably priced and portioned meals).  More legislation on making food information available to people. I like that Coke and restaurants are putting more nutrition information out there; I'd like to see more of this.  I would like to see more work being done on alternative sweeteners, and more subsidies for them, like Stevia and Xylitol (Xylitol is actually good for your teeth). I love Pepsi's Stevia blend soft drink (it tastes juts like regular Pepsi - terrible).  I'd like to see more cookbooks that focus on balanced meals - a book with tons of ideas for breakfast / lunch / dinner / desserts / snacks that if you combine them  together (one of each meal and two of the dessert/snack group), you get about 2000 calories.  More focus on good nutrition and healthy balances, rather than stupid fad diets that don't make any sense.  Better therapy and support for everyone in life."

I'll agree buying some drugs does contribute to all sorts of shit like human trafficking, but it doesn't need to be like that. There is a worldwide force keeping it this way. If allowed a free market they could be regulated and completely detached from all that shit.  Imagine there was a store that was the only one in town, but everything they had was slave labor made. Everyone else shopped there and the government actively worked to stop any other stores from opening. Are you responsible for the slave labor if you went to the only store when you were given no other option? Plus, the store is going to stay open and sell stuff regardless, they make billions a year, and your contribution is practically nill.  I mean you could not do drugs, but I'd say prohibition is what causes this. It's the one that ties the two together. Do you blame the people buying the drugs or the people forcing it to be involved with all sorts of horrible shit?"
InsightfulQuestions,3ax4sr,m1sta,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:06 2015 UTC,"Do you blame the people buying the drugs or the people forcing it to be involved with all sorts of horrible shit?   Can I blame both?  With regard to the former - there are many freedoms that I'd like to take, and physically can, but that I do not take because of the indirect repercussions. Could I get away with rape, theft, and/or assault? I believe I could. There are important differences in each instance but there is also a fitting analogy here. The purchasing of stolen goods is the closest match to my mind. There are things that I cannot afford to buy legitimatley. Do I blame the third parties for the price at which those goods are offered legally? Do I blame the people in the marketing company or in my social group for making me want those goods? People in all of these groups are partly to blame for me wanting to buy the stolen good, but I choose not to do it anyway, because I don't want to encourage theft.  Side note: I too would like to see alcohol and drug laws completely rebuilt. Many people should be free to purchase and privatley use many common controlled substances."

If the cartel or gang is big and powerful enough, that delta can actually  be so close to zero it could be regarded as zero.  That is, there comes a point where an increase or decrease in income of say, a thousand dollars per year (or whatever sum one spends on drugs or whatever), is completely negligable. If say, the cartel has a turnover of several hundred million dollars every year this will not make a difference in the slightest sense.   Change has to happen at a certain critical volume for it to actually make a difference and I think that a single person (even maybe ten or a hundred) abstaining or partaking is seldom enough."

InsightfulQuestions,3ax4sr,Jumbojanne,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:07:03 2015 UTC,"That is true, but consider the following: if the requirement for change is say, 100 people abstaining, there are different ways to make people abstain. These ways will vary in efficiency, and thus vary in how effective they are at stopping whatever problems are caused by the business.  For example, if one could replace the cartel with a legal organization the money would not support other illigal activities. This alternative could be so effective and fast compared to changing opinions and expecting people to stop doing drugs for moral reasons, it is immoral to wait.  I think that a single persons contribution is negligable in the case of the drug trade and expecting everyone to stop doing drugs for moral reasons is not realistic.   It might seem like I am making excuses for myself, which is probably slightly true, but at the same time that makes me an example of how most people don't really care about what their money contributes to.

Cutting off their revenue supply further would only make them do more trafficking, no?   That sound facetious, but my point is that the logic of all this is misguided. Human trafficking is a completely separate crime from drug trafficking. People tend to do them both because they use similar tactics/equipment and criminals tend to associate with other types of criminals.  But buying drugs does not ""fund"" human trafficking.

I did not create the system that enables and contributes to these horrors and me buying or not buying drugs will not in reality make any difference at that level.  If voters and lawmakers want to continue to pretend that people won't do illegal drugs because they are prohibited that's just fine I guess.

To answer the question though...  Age is a measure we use of how old someone is (shocking, I know!). It doesn't matter where we start counting, so long as we have a measure of how far from a certain point everyone is (you could measure a race as distance from the start OR distance from the end, both are equally good). We could have chosen to measure age as years until drinking age, and it would be arithmetically an equivalent measure (just subtract 21 years from your age if you're in the US).  The deeper question (past the arithmetic point) is: What do we really want to do with this metric we call ""age""? What if we judged people's ""age"" by height instead? This would make age a good metric for things that we use height for (roller-coasters, for example), but a poor metric for things like school. This brings up two very interesting (in my opinion) points:  How you count age depends entirely on what you want to use it for. In some cultures, you're not considered a man until you've passed a rite of passage. In others, you're considered one solely by living past a certain point. Neither one is necessarily better (age or strength/skill), but they're both used as a metric for the same thing, because they're seen by that culture as a good measure of 'manliness'.  People ""age"" differently, depending on what you want age to count for. Some people are wise beyond their years, others can lift a shocking amount of weight for their age, etc. In these cases, it may be more appropriate to judge based on test scores or achievements rather than age. It's just the wrong measure to use!  In short... does it really matter? Hope we've gotten somewhere with this!"

Of course none of this matters as long as current tax code and loopholes exist."

InsightfulQuestions,3apt1n,themanofum,3,Mon Jun 22 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"I think I would sacrifice a small fraction of innovation for some financial security for the masses. That would be if your assertion were true, which I'm not sure it is.  Sometimes conversations like these get shut down when someone says, that wouldn't work. I'm more interested in a conversation which entertains the idea of what would make something work. Even if we don't end up with the original idea in the end.   It would be interesting to have a similar conversation about taxation, which you brought up. Maybe it would be easier or better, maybe it wouldn't. Still I think it would be good to entertain each idea. Sometimes pushback is about shutting down conversation.

After reading your question I genuinely started to think about it, but I can't see a way governments would effectively go about this.  Of course, that doesn't mean there isn't a way, that's just my opinion based on my limited knowledge.  It's an interesting question.  By ""It would have some kind of negative effect on innovation, seeing as you're 'punishing' companies which find ways to add more value and thus make more money,"" I didn't mean to suggest it'd have a net negative effect compared to the current situation.  Merely that there would be some negative effect.  There would also be some positive effect, so this doesn't mean the overall effect would be negative regarding innovation and development.  So I'm not suggesting that under your hypothetical situation innovation wouldn't be better than the current situation or my hypothetical situation of higher taxes for rich and lower for poor.  It was more just a thought to add something I guess.   Anyway, my thoughts on the issue are simply that we'd probably be better off using tax on capital and higher incomes to subsidise poor people to a greater degree to address income inequality.  I think this is probably the most efficient way of addressing the issue.  It's just that, in America especially, the government is heavily influenced by interests that don't want this to happen.  The issue could be easily solved if the political will was there."

I'm glad you brought up the point about innovation, because usually the argument goes something like, one guy says it will kill innovation, and another guy days it won't. I'm interested in the third rung of the conversation, which is more like, so what if it does have a negative impact in some ways. What other things might we gain? What other things might we value as much or instead as the usual suspects.  Taxing and subsidies are another interesting conversation, but you're right that it is all hampered by interference in governance by certain powerful interests. These people also shape the conversations we have about these things, so I like to ask, so what if we innovate a little less? So what if growth is slower? There will always be positives and negatives to different approaches, but we'll never get off the ride if we keep playing by their rules."

InsightfulQuestions,3apt1n,pixlepix,2,Mon Jun 22 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Some companies have found that paying higher wages results in higher profit margins. This is a result of several factors: 1) lower churn rate - employees who are poorly laid often quit as soon as they find a better paying job. So all of the time invested in training them is lost and has to be spent on their replacement. This is expensive when it happens often. 2) Poorly paid employees tend to try to make up for their poor wage in opportunistic ways, such as stealing inventory or office supplies. When this is systemic across an entire company, it adds up to a lot. 3) Poorly paid workers often perform more poorly due to a lack of motivation caused by resentment. They resent their employer, and this causes them to treat customers badly resulting in lost sales, make careless mistakes that cost money to repair, and underperform in any number of other metrics that have quantifiable outputs such as sales quotas, amount of work performed per hour, etc. 4) Poorly paid workers are often less qualified for their job or have less experience.  This means that there will be more inefficiencies in their work no matter how motivated they may be, and more frequent mistakes that cost money."

The popular view of accountancy is that it is similar to the hard sciences, with lots of math and precision.  Accounting isn't anything like that.  For one, advanced math rarely comes into play.  We have to take calculus to get the degree (or at least I did, and it turns out that I love calculus, but that's a story for another day), but most of what we do turns out to be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Accounting is more about the rules of where you put things.  Those rules are more flexible than what you might think.  Accounting is actually one of the creative professions.  More like art, music and literature than chemistry and physics.  We have latitude on where to put things and classify them.  Further, you can use several business entities (as many do) to shift costs and move profits.  Trying to pin it down would not work.

What seems to be missing in the general understanding of capitalism is that it requires a referee in order to work right. When you apply your profit-based wages idea to capitalism, the idea requires a referee to know everything about every company's financials so we can be sure companies aren't Hollywooding themselves out of having to pay up.  And of course as we've seen with corporations buying politicians, that referee has a lot of incentive not to be objective, and so you end up with the corporations telling the referee what to do.  Of course, if we eliminate capitalism and instead forge a society which encourages mutual cooperation for the greater good, which I do suspect will happen once automation eliminates most jobs and people get tired of starving, then we would no longer require referees as we do today...

That's a useful factor to keep in mind. Part of me wonders if it might be worth it for society to go through an exercise like this, or at least foster some meaningful conversations about it. We tend to talk about regulations in the abstract, and in a way that reduces it to whether or not it kills jobs, or hurts small business. It would be interesting to expand the public conversation.   It would also be intereting, as a practical experiment, to actually do the type of refereeing required for my hypothetical system. I'm sure it would produce some sobering facts and bring to light the types of shenanigans you talk about.

And the harm would be real - minimum wage is not a livable wage. Where I live, to qualify financially for the lowest-rent 1 bedroom apartment in the cesspool side of town, you need to make $15 an hour. That's well above minimum wage.   Still, I think we shouldn't throw our hands in the air and resign ourselves to it as if it is fait accompli.   If the question is limited to ""should we make profit-based wages a thing,"" then the only thing to do is say ""it'll never work."" The question needs to be broadened to ""should we re-work society such that the first objective is not to accumulate as much individual wealth as possible and rather to build up society as a whole,"" at which point your proposal both becomes possible and unnecessary.

Converting to an entirely arts-based economy wouldn't work either, because there are people who aren't any good at art, but who are very good at engineering. But if the computers are doing all the design work what will the engineer who can't sing do to earn his supper?   would be interested to hear more on this if you have any thoughts.   Just that capitalism, like all other economic systems, has fundamental flaws. Unfortunately, we're unlikely to shed it for something better until we're forced to. When the vast majority of the population is jobless, homeless, and starving because all the work is being done by the machines owned by the elite, there will likely be a revolt, the elite will be... Disposed of (assuming we don't wait too long and give the elite time to acquire machines that not only do the work, but kill the former workers), and we will try something different for our economy.

As with economic systems, this prediction failed to factor in basic human traits like greed and general assholishness, so instead most of us are working just as much if not more, putting out vastly more per unit time than ever before, for less money. Many are even doing the same work that 3 or 4 people did before because computers now make it possible for them to do so. Those 3 or 4 people whose jobs are now being done by one person got downsized and kicked to the curb to try and find other employment, to varying degrees of success or lack thereof. And the one person who took over their job not only didn't get a raise, but very probably took a pay cut. ""Hey, if you don't like it, there's 4 people we just fired who would love to come back here...""  In short, as long as there is a wealthy elite, there will be motivation for them to maintain their wealthy elite status. The easiest way to be richer than everyone else is to make sure everyone else can't get their hands on very much money. The wealthy elite are not going to look around and say ""Hey, machines can now do 90% of the work. Great! Everyone go on permanent vacation and we'll just keep paying you like you were still working!""   They will instead say ""Machines can do your job now. You're fired. And your personal struggle with finding work in a 90% unemployment market is not my problem because I have plenty of money and I own the politicians, so I'm going to tell them not to change anything because my life is fantastic right now.""

InsightfulQuestions,3aidxb,WereAboutToArgue,12,Sat Jun 20 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of SJW :      Social Justice Warrior. A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation. A social justice warrior, or SJW, does not necessarily strongly believe all that they say, or even care about the groups they are fighting on behalf of. They typically repeat points from whoever is the most popular blogger or commenter of the moment, hoping that they will ""get SJ points"" and become popular in return. They are very sure to adopt stances that are ""correct"" in their social circle.  The SJW's favorite activity of all is to dogpile. Their favorite websites to frequent are Livejournal and Tumblr. They do not have relevant favorite real-world places, because SJWs are primarily civil rights activists only online.     #1:  A social justice warrior reads an essay about a form of internal misogyny where women and girls insult stereotypical feminine activities and characteristics in order to boost themselves over other women.  The SJW absorbs this and later complains in response to a Huffington Post article about a 10-year-old feminist's letter, because the 10-year-old called the color pink ""prissy"".  #2:  Commnter: ""I don't like getting manicures. It's too prissy.""  SJW: ""Oh my god, how fucking dare you use that word, you disgusting sexist piece of shit!""    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

I saw a perfect example the other night on Reddit. Someone was talking about how they realised the ultimate goal of technology and machinery was to create a sentient being. He said when he realised that it gave him a whole new respect for the capabilities of a woman's body. I took this as he meant it was ironic that humanity has been working towards this technological marvel when all along woman have been able to do it through child birth.   However the first commenters post was ""Omg how dare you compare a woman's body to a machine!"" That in my opinion is the definition of a SJW."

They claim to be interested in ""social justice"" when in fact they simply want vigilante-style retribution. They want the voice of the accuser to override all due process. Cries of ""racist!""

In reality people don't generally mean to be awful people and don't understand that what they said is offensive.

The same thing has happened to the Men's Right's movement, which has gone from a movement concerned with securing men's parental rights to one that just hates women, and from which many men have run screaming.

Depends on how you define justice. If you take the concept far enough you'd give native americans the right to hunt down and shoot non-natives to claim ground, the african-american population should be able to trade white-skinned slaves, and take away men's right to vote.  On the other hand, you could argue for laws that ensure equal pay between genders and ethnic groups, more police resources for rape investigations, measures to increase educational levels in low income groups and so on.

For example in a murder trial I might find a piece of evidence persuasive, but not so convincing as to leave me knowing if the person committed a murder. By contrast, if I know someone committed a murder, I have already been persuaded this is true.

InsightfulQuestions,3a60vg,ArcherofArchet,5,Wed Jun 17 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"If what happened after death was effected by what we did during life (heaven hell, being reincarnated into something 'better or worse', nothingness ect ) I think the majority would try harder to be a better person, more compassion for others because there would be a consequence for not being kind. There are also a lot of people who are the 'live for the now' type and they may go rampant. They know for a fact what will happen to them, they accept it and live the life the way they see fit. I think there might be a increase in communes for people who want to spend their life working for their death. The more popular strict religions would feel gratified in their teachings and some would become even more unforgiving.   If our life does not effect what happens after we die, be it good or bad, I think people would live their life more to the way they want. People who only do religious things for the hope of saving themselves will change. Morals will still exist, I dont think most people need a 'reason' to be kind to others. The more popular religions will fight it for years and years and deny the proof handed to them. But even the proof of an after life does not prove a God, so atheists or generally un-religious people will go on as they have all along with the morals they believe in."

InsightfulQuestions,3a60vg,warpus,2,Thu Jun 18 12:17:54 2015 UTC,"I think regardless of what happens after death and whether or not our choices in life affect our post-mortal destiny, society (especially Western society) would stop making such a huge to-do about death.  If you look at it, death has become a scary concept, and an industry of its own right.  People are scared of dying.  Especially now, that we are closer than ever to living forever due to technological and biomedical advances, and that our society has placed such a huge emphasis on everyone's individual experiences, we are scared to death of having to stare down that long road, knowing that some things will simply go to the grave with us - things that are impossible to share, like half-thought ideas, forgotten dreams, or just the very way and perspective that you lived through your life's events.  And exactly because of this fear, and fear of loss of others around us, we have build an industry around death.  From elaborate funerals to memorials, turning your loved one's ashes into diamonds, or turning your Facebook account into a ""legacy account.""  I think knowing what happens when you die would ease all of these worries, and we could start treating death as what it is - a natural part of life.  We are born, we live, we die.  It happens every day.  It's not as big a deal as society makes it."

And yes, disease, starvation, suffering are all parts of life - but as you put it, we can alleviate or try to escape that, unlike death.  Just because we are close to immortality and cheating death, we are still unable to do that, remember?  So yes, we need to grow the heck up as society, and learn to move on.  We need to accept that people (and more - think of the loss of a beloved pet) are in our lives for a finite time, and it is not up to us to choose when they leave us.  Death does not need to bring suffering, if you are willing to keep this in mind.  And you don't even need to accept any form of afterlife for this, if that is against your philosophy (it is against mine)."

The difference is...  when you get something or someone taken away from you, irrevocably and forever, do you throw a temper tantrum like a misbehaving 2-year-old, defying the Powers That Be and shaking your tiny fist, or do you choose to appreciate the time you had with it?  This is what we need to learn as a society.  Look at any of the East Asian cultures - Sikh, Shinto, Dao, Parsi, Buddhist, etc.  Death is not something to gripe over, but a passage.  For the record, I really hope I can have a Parsi-style sky burial when I die.  Unlikely I can do it in California."

The other is simply a cultural thing.  I honestly could care less of individuals' own strategies for mourning their losses, although yes, I do think it's more dignified to accept it and move on.  I won't say I won't judge people ever, at all, because I know that I do, when I find it excessive (e.g. going 10-20 years in deep mourning and breaking down into a crying heap at the mention of the deceased).  In most cases, no, I don't judge.  I lost a parent and a fiance, the latter lost to a quick, horrifying battle with brain cancer.  I lost more friends than I would have thought before any of us were 30; you name the cause.  Car accident, suicide, overdose, ""war on terror,"" illness....  So I'm definitely no rookie when it comes to dealing with it.  The point I'm trying to make, which you refuse to see, is that I think Western culture puts too much emphasis on the ""this is the end"" part of death, and not enough on celebrating what time we shared.  Instead of seeing death as a terminus, we need to see it as a station."

Stop treating death like it's a simple ""part of life"" sort of thing. Maybe it makes it easier to cope, but still man, it sucks to lose someone. People don't want to hear ""oh it's a part of life man. Stop being such a kid"", ""I don't judge people"", literally what you're doing now.

InsightfulQuestions,3a60vg,Mookite,2,Wed Jun 17 17:43:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think much would change.  Most of the world believe they already know what happens after death.  As an atheist I would hope it made people get along better knowing there is nothing after this, but that is just a dream."
InsightfulQuestions,3a60vg,eleitl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"Let's start with the first possibility. If the answer is ""After you die, you simply cease to exist and all your experiences and your consciousness disappear."" then I believe that we as a species would have a bit of a problem. Most people take comfort in the idea that death is not the end (you could easily argue that this is the reason why the concept exists in the first place), so naturally when you remove this idea, you take away the comfort. What replaces that feeling of comfort for most people will probably be fear since, let's face it, the idea of losing everything you've ever known and, well, ceasing to exist is kind of a scary idea. I mean, if you've ever played a videogame and your console or computer has just crashed and you lost all your progress, take that feeling and multiply it by a couple of thousand times and then you might understand.  The second possibility is that one of the world's religions is right and all the others are wrong. So people gradually stop following their own religions and convert to this ‘correct’ religion. Everyone now knows what happens after death, so a new question will probably arise, for example, regarding how long the afterlife lasts, what you have to do exactly to get into heaven et cetera.  And of course the third possibility, and last that I can think of, is that a completely new and unthought of afterlife is discovered to be the correct answer. People will probably claim credit for the idea and, as with the other two possibilities, they may deny it, but in the end, literally, everyone will just accept it. This would probably be the most peaceful of the the three possibilities, since everyone is wrong and there's no ‘winner’.  So in answer to your question, I believe that the only thing an answer like that will produce it fear. Whether it's a fear of nothingness, a fear of reincarnating as a mollusc or just a fear of going to heaven or hell, most people will simply be terrified by an answer to such a question."

If absolutely nothing happens after death, we will never be able to find something that happens after death and thus, we wouldn't know for sure if something happens or not.  If we find that something happens after death, we'd probably live in a world that's less fear-oriented. That is, after a few years! If such a discovery were to be made, many people wouldn't accept it or not until the fact has been known for a long time. A lot of our behaviors are based on what we believe is true about concepts that are so ""core"". If someone has lead is life stealing, raping, killing because he believed he would become non-existent when he dies, he would need time to digest the pill of existence after death (if he manages to digest it at all).    Now for the part that'll get me a gazillion downvotes: I know what happens after death. Or rather, I have a belief about it that is true for me and that is logical enough for the scientist in me to validate. When I decided to make that belief my own, my life changed in a good way.   If what I believe about death is relatively accurate and it becomes widely 'known', burials would be much more joyful !"
InsightfulQuestions,3a60vg,Jack2671,0,Thu Jun 18 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"Unless acted on by external forces like embalming or refrigeration, the body decomposes. This is observable and verifiable.  Throughout history there have been claims of an afterlife by various individuals and organizations, but there has never been any verifiable data to back these claims. Despite evidence, a sizable majority of the population believe in some form of afterlife, with the most violent conflicts not over the existence of an afterlife, but over disagreements over a particular brand of afterlife.  Given the above, I think it is safe to say that the presence of evidence would not change the situation in any noticeable way."

They didn't ban specific people for harassment. They banned an entire subreddit. Is that not banning 'protesting jhorts' (hating fat people)? Maybe the test for this is for a single user to go around to various with hateful comments... I'm willing to bet that user would be banned fairly quickly too.   I agree that FPH was out of control. What started a backlash to ""body acceptance"" turned into hating on random people. It hit /r/all many times a day and was often spilling into other topics in other subreddits. But also the admins need to stand up and say that. That claim that 'we want to ban actions not ideas' doesn't mesh with what they did.

Let me preface this by saying, I was not subscribed to any of the subs that got axed. The idea that sites like fph were harassing people is laughable.  Yes they mocked people, but find me a sub where someone isn't mocking someone else.  No one is forced to go there, they don't start letter writing campaigns to fat people telling them they are bad.  In your scenario, a sub like fph is a group on the lot, secretly trading little placards saying how much they hate people that wear jhorts.  Everyone knows they are there, knows they hate jhorts, but everyone is still able to do or say what they want. If you love jhorts, you just don't talk to that group. One day, you as the landlord decide to kick them out because of their beliefs, claiming it is because of their behavior.    But since every other person on the lot has a choice whether or not to engage the Jhort haters, how is this not policing thoughts and beliefs. How is that not censorship?  Where does it stop.  How exactly, did a sub like fph, or even coontown, surround a group of people and start assaulting them?  You do know that the small but vocal crowd that is driving this hates a lot of other things too, they just didn't want to create too much drama by axing it all at once.  So is it ok to ban people from your lot, as long as they are the people you don't like?  I get that Reddit is a business and as such, wants to make money.  And they will, but at the cost of what made it great to begin with, the free exchange of ideas.  Reddit has just chosen to be the judge jury and executioner that gets to decide what  beliefs are ok to have and what beliefs aren't and that pretty much makes them no longer the Reddit that drew a lot of people here.  It's the same thing that happened to 4chan.  Let me ask you this, when was the last time you heard of anything about 4chan?  Been a while, hasn't it.  Because they did the same thing and all that is left is the people that are too lazy to go elsewhere.  And, not on your post but another, if I hear one more idiot spout the ""It's only censorship when it involves the state blah blah blah"" I will simply puke.

Reddit has just chosen to be the judge jury and executioner that gets to decide what beliefs are ok to have and what beliefs aren't    It has, as has been explained, nothing to do with belief. People can still say that being fat is a bad thing. People just can't harass other people all over the site about it. That's a good thing.    and that pretty much makes them no longer the Reddit that drew a lot of people here.

Oh and...   t's a good thing as long as you earnestly believe that you, or someone else, has the moral authority to decide what is ""good speech"" and what is ""bad speech"".   Reddit is not the government. Reddit owns the site. Reddit gets to decide what is and is not allowed here. ""freedom of speech,"" ""moral authority,"" etc does not enter into the equation. Private entities have the right to censor anything they want within their private purview. It absolutely is censorship, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with a private forum censoring its own content.

You can go right now onto a fitness subreddit and a bunch of other topical subreddits and say that being fat is bad for your health, and that claiming that being fat is a good thing is bullshit, and that people who encourage other people to get fat should stop doing it.   /r/fatpeoplehate decided to set themselves apart first by declaring themselves a hate group in their name and then by acting like a hate group not only on their own ""territory"" but spreading their hate speech throughout the site. They were caustic bullies, end of story, and civilized discussion fora do not tolerate bullies.   That is the point of these subs, to allow people to congregate with like minded individuals.   What you don't seem to be grasping is that there's little objection to people congregating in a like minded group, even if they express ideas which are repugnant to sane people. In the real world, there are very few calls to outlaw the KKK. But when the KKK burns a cross on a black guy's yard, society recognizes that they have crossed a boundary and must be stopped, up to and including arresting everyone in the klavern who was involved in any way with burning the cross. Within the confines of Reddit, this means getting rid of the group and people behind the bullying.   By destroying the sub, you send the message that that type of speech isn't welcome and is therefore censorship.   I do not understand why anyone would possibly have a problem with sending a message that bullying is not welcome.   Iron sharpens iron and it is only through challenging ourselves and our beliefs that we ever grow as human beings.   Yeah, that's cute and everything, but no one is going to grow as a human being by having fat-shaming assholes running around stalking people and trying to make them feel terrible about themselves.   Reddit stamped out a subreddit of jerks that was not contributing anything to societal growth, the human condition, or any other esoteric bullshit people want to come up with to defend what is, at its core, a hate group bullying people because hate groups enjoy bullying people."

InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,edmundburkewasright,3,Thu Jun 11 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"But wasn't this about behavior that was over the top? From what I've gathered, members of fph,actually followed certain people around reddit, as opposed to just within that sub. To further my analogy, it'd be like they followed the jhort guy to the mall and threw eggs at his house.  Again, if my perception is incorrect, I'm willing to hear more and change my outlook."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Thu Jun 11 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"If that is true, and I wouldn't be surprised as the world is filled with scumbags of all types, how does that justify the scorched earth destruction of a sub.  The sub did not engage in that behavior, individuals did.  ""They"" didn't follow the guy, individuals did (if true).  This is nothing more than an attempt to make Reddit more commercially appealing so they can ""sell"" it to corporate america as well as the thought police that run rampant at places like Tumblr and Imgur attempting to shape the world in the image they think it should be.  How else do you explain the mass deletion of images off imgur?  Did those images follow people around and harass them?"
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,edmundburkewasright,3,Thu Jun 11 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"If that were the case, they'd be doing a lot more than just 5 small subs. Have you seen some of the subs on reddit? Pics of dead kids? cute female corpses? Space dicks? Come on man, that argument just holds no water whatsoever.   This is about protecting people's ability to come to reddit and not be harassed for no good reason. They want people to feel safe here, and not scared away by douchebags."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:27 2015 UTC,"It's only a matter of time.  If they nuked them all at once, they couldn't control the backlash.  Tin foil hat time? Maybe.  But check back with me in 9 months and let's see if I was right.  It's like draining a lake.  You don't just open the floodgates all the way, everyone downstream drowns.  You do it a bit at a time."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,edmundburkewasright,3,Thu Jun 11 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"If reddit ever starts nuking subs to get rid of speech they don't like, the dorks that are complaining will have a point...but again...if sanitizing is the goal, there are TONS of subs they could go after that are MUCH worse than these 5 and people would applaud them for it."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Thu Jun 11 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"If they nuked them all at once,    If they nuked ""them"" all at once, there would be less speculation about motivations because they clearly hit enough communities to have a pattern.    Instead a whole bunch of people refuse to believe the five targeted communities behaved as egregiously as Admin says, Admin will never be interested in backing up or clarifying what occurred, and the tin-foil hat crowd can make up narratives around SJWs and ideology all they want.    I mean, if they selected a ""them"" and hit every sub related, people would still complain ""what about _____??? so inconsistent.""   they couldn't control the backlash   I dunno, FPH is controlling its own backlash just fine by wearing out their welcome and shitting up other people's communities in their outraged rampage.  The site's mood has already begun swinging against them, just look at the discourse in places like this compared to similar conversations taking place yesterday.  I don't think a wider cone of anti-bullshit deletions would really be so much of a crisis.    The real problem is Admin's atrocious handling of the issue, half the people that were angry yesterday probably wouldn't have been if admin hadn't been utterly obtuse about details and communicated almost entirely via cryptic euphamism and hinting.  At no point did Admin say ""well, FPH repeatedly went on campaigns of targeted harassment against Imgur staff and other redditors, and moderation supported or failed to adequitely prevent this behaviour, so we banned the sub"" ... everyone just kinda had to find that out for themselves."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,Anomander,2,Thu Jun 11 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I was here, all day yesterday, and I'm just now finding this stuff out in this thread of conversations.  I might not have been nearly so quick to defend them if I had that information.  I believe in free speech, 100%.  But I also believe in peace and quiet. If what is being said is true, and the sub as a whole was being used to organize said harassment, I am less bothered.  I couldn't support the constant stream of ""Fat ass Reddit Admin"" and Imgur admin attacks.  But, I subscribe to several other subs that are hated by your average Tumblrina and I know for a fact that those subs do not violate Reddit's rules.  If any of them get nuked, Then I will know I am right.  Just gotta play wait and see for now.  FPH certainly didn't make themselves easy to defend, but I did it because I didn't have access to the things I do now. I don't know what to think now."

Further, those same people could just as easily create new handles and come right back to the same sub and continue doing the same thing.

Look at this sub....  https://pay.reddit.com/r/beatingwomen2/  Surely, if reddit wanted to sanitize itself, THIS is the kind of thing that would go, wouldn't it?

InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,matthewjosephtaylor,8,Thu Jun 11 09:34:15 2015 UTC,"Reddit has a huge network effect advantage to any other similar competing site and will continue to enjoy that advantage for the foreseeable future.  What began with the reaction to the fappining is continuing. Reddit is attempting to make itself 'safer', only this time they are attempting to do it pro-actively.   There is nothing inherently wrong with this. The problem is that there is a natural anxiety between 'safe speech', 'free speech' and 'interesting speech'.  Reddit accidently generated a lot of shock and horror in the clumsy and arbitrary way in which it chose (is choosing) to transition itself from 'free excluding child porn' to 'free excluding what Reddit independently deems ""harmful""' while hopefully keeping the 'interesting conversations' going.  At this point nobody is quite sure what the rules are (the worst outcome of all) which is creating an opportunity for competition.  Reddit is in the near future going to have to make a very clear statement on where they are going to draw the line. If they don't, then they will leak away more and more users to other sites as users stop talking on reddit for fear of being banned (even if there is little chance they would be banned) and the interesting speech moves elsewhere.  For now, my guess is that no communities except those being actively driven from the site will leave.  The question is what is Reddit's end game? If they continue bumbling around as they are currently, it's possible that the entire community as a whole will lose trust and faith in Reddit itself. That is the turning point. They've banked up a lot of good will, and for right now I think most people are willing to cut them some slack. However, that goodwill could be lost very quickly if there were one or two more incidents like this in a short period of time."

The reason I say this is because the French are more negative about being overweight and Americans are perhaps not negative enough about it, or else they turn into monstrous beast. but the death rate for obese people is really high and this is going to be millions of people. It was a genuine crisis and it seems like having a certain negativity about it may be important. The question is how to have that negativity. Part of the answer probably is to ban it truly abusive subreddit or something like that. But, should we retain a certain negativity about eating practices and being overweight? By the way I'm overweight myself. Not terribly so but definitely so."
InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,GoldenFalcon,4,Thu Jun 11 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between negativity and shaming/bashing.  The latter will solve nothing.

InsightfulQuestions,39ee1k,ravia,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"I generally more than agree. don't get me wrong. But there is something in the obesity problem is that might require a certain careful negativity. But then again, one has to realize but there is also another danger and, judging by the sub that was just banned, what really should be referred to as and obesity of negativity. the haters on that sub were obese with hate. isn't that interesting? it was they who were the real fatties and really they who most deserved the straightforward, in your face, perhaps a little bit nasty disregard precisely because they gorge themselves in exactly that disregard itself. so like I say, don't get me wrong.  It is a general tendency owing to the nature of categories within people that if we commit ourselves to being positive we may be inclined not to be negative, and if we commit ourselves to be negative we may be inclined not to be positive. Only if thought emerges as an independent value with some independent sense of avoiding and ameliorating harm can a better approach be developed. But one of the things that is required for this is to include negativity within the positive approach rather than banishing it where it will crop up like weeds out beyond the edges of things.  We are not really in a big disagreement, but the remaining problem is so enormous that it really has to be thought about very carefully: that is the problem of obesity itself. It is becoming the primary health problem in the world today. Look back on what I have written here. The tendency to go one way or the other only, to be positive or negative only goes hand in hand with a tendency to eat without mitigating, to portion without limiting, etc."

We were specifically talking about the goal of genetic diversification through reproductive measures.    The theory of Evolution is called that way because it is a theory; an explanation of an ensemble of facts created by humans (referring to your initial comment   Okay. I seriously hope you're not calling into question the validity of the theory of evolution. It kind of seems like you're trying to toe that line. If you feel you have evidence to argue against it, I'd love to see what you've got.    The theory of evolution, I believe, tells the process through which species get selected, not why.   Never argued against this. Not sure why you brought it up. But, for arguments sake, the theory likely does show why they were selected for - it's in the definition. Those that prosper the most are able (and very willing) to pass down the favorable traits... via reproduction :)   It is not because species need to go through procreation to be preserved that they are inherently forced to do so by nature or that they are made for the purpose of procreating.   Never said that they were ""forced"". All I explicitly stated was that, for a species to grow, genetically, they need to reproduce. That's basic developmental biology. Diversify or perish. Simple.

I seriously hope you're not calling into question the validity of the theory of evolution.   All I'm saying is, as much as nature doesn't give a fuck about anything, it doesn't give a fuck about evolution. It may evolve, but it isn't in anyway provable that it is ""a goal"" which is the word that you keep using while it is only speculative, you're attributing teleological ends to life while you can't possibly know whether that's the case or not. You can't epistemologically prove that life (= nature) has a goal. Initially you were arguing that life had the end goal of reproducing but it is not possible to be sure of that. Any physics law is based on observation, it determines a pattern, it says: ""there's gravity in the universe, it works like that"", then try to predict what's the outcome, it explains the ""how?"" but it doesn't explain the pour quoi, the ""for what reason"", which is the kind of attribute you're putting into the theory of evolution, as if any form of life, any form of reproduction moved towards a finality. That's misguided because the point of this theory is to say how species go through natural selection, not that they have an a priori reason or an ultimate goal that makes them do it.  You were also talking about ""Surviving as long as possible"" being a human construct. All I was underlining here is that the theory of Evolution is a human construct; there isn't any theory of evolution present in nature. Life is just life, things happen; making a theory (a theory can be true or not; I'm not arguing about that since it is pretty evident the theory of evolution has solid proofs) is just apposing values, coming from our human subjectivity, to nature; it is a human construction.  Saying that species, life, or nature have a goal is trying to put human values into nature, it's defining it as sentient and with a thought process similar to ours. It isn't false, it is simply nothing more than a belief, on the same level as a position on the question of God, which doesn't go in pair with trying to hold a discourse based on facts. With this kind of reasoning you blur the limit between belief and knowledge and make one seem like the other while it isn't.   Gay Uncle Hypothesis. Necrophelia Fuck, man. I don't know. Some people are just into kinky shit.   I'm not talking about humans but about many animal species that went through the same process.

First I don't agree that you can't harm someone who is dead.    For instance take a Will. If I leave all my money to the Blue party, and my executor instead gives all my money to the Green party then my executor has harmed me by defying my wishes.   You can certainly not physically harm someone who is dead. But (unless you have an absurdly narrow hedonic understanding of what a ""harm"" is) you can be harmed in other ways. We can generate more examples by thinking of all the ways you can harm someone who is far away: slandering them, harming their property, harming their loved ones, defying their wishes, breaking a contract with them. These are all surely real instances of harm, and the mere fact of death (while putting them beyond the scope of legal recourse) doesn't stop them being morally offensive.   And second I don't think it's clear that the badness of dying happens to a person who is dead.    Falling out of a plane without parachute (which will result in my death) is bad to me at the time when I fall out of it in a way that falling out of a plane with parachute (which will not result in my death) is not bad to me at the time when I fall out of it.

It's the people who are strong-willed and fight their way out of unfavorable odds who earn our memory.

These seemingly ""immortal"" figures are everywhere in historical records, mythology, religion, etc.  Jesus Christ is a very prominent example of this because he was able to ""conquer"" death. But, you can trace this immortal archetype back to early Mediterranean religions which drastically predates modern Christianity.    Take any motivator - fat loss, depression, poverty, altruism - all of them relate back to a fear of annihilation. Fat loss? ""Lose weight, healthier, live longer, avoid death"". Depression? ""I'm faced with the reality of the world and no human being can shoulder the weight of that burden. I must escape this hell and avoid staring into the abyss of annihilation"". Poverty? See fat loss.

To me, I think we have. And that's not just a U.S. problem. Sure, we're the most egregious example, but the problem is global."
InsightfulQuestions,38hezq,bojslo,2,Thu Jun 4 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"This whole thing reminds me of a Chinese saying, 'it doesn't matter if the cat is black or white so long as it catches mice.'  The modern western lifestyle was built on the back of colonization and America's version of colonization 2.0 is really dependent on cheap foreign goods. Nobody will care if the colony is a democracy or a dictatorship, so long as it produces cheap goods. It's really about economics, not government.  And I think we're steadily pulling away from the consumerism of the post war years. Locally produced and sustainability are the new keywords for successful companies, while those crazy youths of today are becoming more aware of how their financial decisions can impact the world.  The west is not existentially dependent on the products of oppressive regimes."
InsightfulQuestions,38hezq,bojslo,3,Thu Jun 4 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"The idea of democracy is on the opposite side of dictatorship. One does not need another to function. So, is the idea of a modern democracy dependent on dicatorship? My thought would be no.  There is a but!  Do the people that serve modern democracy conduct economical trades and on the same time forget about the democratic values. Definetly yes. When faced with money, values are doublecoinded?  What do you think?"

Can ""light"" exist without ""darkness""?  This isn't to say that dictatorship is the polar opposite of democracy, just that simply because something is considered ""opposite"" doesn't mean there isn't some level of codependency.   Think about U.S. support for Pinochet in Chile, or for the military dictatorship in Brazil. The United States, supposedly the bulwark of democracy in the world, overthrew democratically elected governments to put dictators in their place.   The reason for that? The democratically elected governments were acting in such a way as to inhibit America's capitalist ambitions (nationalization of natural resources,  ISI, etc.). Now, capitalism isn't the same as democracy, per se, but the two philosophies have a lot of common goals. Democracy implies the freedom to choose, and capitalism provides that diversity of choice.   But what if the choices made in one democracy (say, Chile) adversely affects the freedom of choice in another democracy (ie. the U.S.)? Then, if every country were to become democratic, they'd make a lot of choices that would decrease the quality of life in other democracies across the world. If even one of those countries were to revert back to dictatorship as a result, it would essentially prove right my initial point - that democracy, to a limited degree, depends on dictatorships for survival."

The United States, supposedly the bulwark of democracy in the world, overthrew democratically elected governments to put dictators in their place.   Both of those countries are now democratic.  And that fact has mostly benefitted the United States.  You are confusing economic choice with political choice.  And frankly, all you need to do is look at how democracies are interacting to see how they are trying to prevent that.

While it's not a dictatorship, per se, you see very little of the executive turnover that defines modern democracy. Or Saudi Arabia, consistently ranked one of the most autocratic governments in the world. The United States benefits immensely from our dealings with both of these countries, making us loathe to do anything that might upset our relations with them.   Would we still do business with them if they weren't so authoritarian? Of course! We'd champion their advances as evidence of the triumph of democracy. But, inwardly, I'm sure certain members of our government would wince, knowing that getting what they wanted would become a lot more difficult under a democracy. It is much harder to convince a democratically fractious nation to back you than it is to convince an authoritarian government with which you already have good relations.   And I would contend that I'm not confusing political/economic choice, so much as saying that the two are inextricably linked up in each other. We in the United States are permitted the economic choice we enjoy because of our (often indirect, see the apparel industry) dealings with dictatorships. If political choice is allowed to flourish in one area, economic choice becomes constrained elsewhere. Push that far enough, and you're inevitably going to see political consequences."

Could we deal with Saudi Arabia becoming a democracy? Certainly. China? Sure. But both of them, and every other country in the world? Eventually, that's going to come back to haunt us. Maybe a populist resurgence in China pushes them back to isolationism. Or maybe the African League, newly emboldened by a democratic mandate, begins demanding more equitable trade relations.

This shows that the NSA does not have our best interests at heart with its actions, and entirely undermines their defense of continued mass surveillance and is further evidence that they should not be trusted to continue performing these actions."

This shows that   The NSA is not there to help prosecutors and investigators of individuals, in the same way that the police are not there to stop crime. The police are there to frustrate crime enough there is a stable environment and so society has opportunity to progress; the NSA is there properly to provide defence against that which individuals have no prospect of defending against - groups and nation states.  The error such agencies do make then is overreach and becoming proactive in providing support to economy, which in turn becomes a liability.  If you look at the NSA's ""Mission, Vision, Values"", it suggests:   The NSA (is).. in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.   That is a really bad way of framing the mandate they should have but the architects of such agencies appear to lack imagination, which is why there is a cluster of errors that follow.  A common error that has been encouraged especially over the last couple of decades in the face of easy money, is that Government could and therefore=[insert bad logic] should do everything for us.. because we now lazy and want parental Government, despite the reality we cannot afford it and should not want it.  Such agencies as the NSA, should exist but need an overhaul relative to their past and an incoming new reality. Currently, it seems, most are just intent on digging in and doubling down.

That said, the NSA has not demonstrated any meaningful or consistent ability to put that data to use (but several great ways to abuse it, Google LOVEINT). So the ethical concerns might be moot for the lack of practical application.  There is one additional issue this could lead to. If it worked and the NSA did free a person or two, they would use it as a selling point to keep violating the 4th amendment. Then we are stuck in the ethical trap potentially imprisoning innocent people or allowing the NSA bullshit to continue.

InsightfulQuestions,37xtu2,Phallic,15,Sun May 31 08:17:27 2015 UTC,"1) The whole of human history is the attempt to agree with others. The miracle is we can find anything to agree on at all, not that there isn't some perfect system to which we all subscribe.  2) rational and logical mean internally consistent. It's a priori, which means without reference to the external world. So if I say   all apples are green, this is an apple, therefore it is green.  I don't need to look at the apple to know the statement is correct. It's just a formal statement.  However if you look at the world you can make an a posteriori argument. Look and find this apple is red and then the assumptions of your logic change, but not the logic itself, they are two distinct processes.  3) Science is rational empricism. That is an attempt to knit these two things together, to have a logically consistent structure which is also consistent with the world. That's why it's so powerful.   However it's also never going to achieve that goal. You can't find a circle anywhere in the world. Science is most successful, ironically, with things we can't sense with our normal senses (electrons, protons, quarks etc) and much less so with big systems (weather, human behaviour etc).  4) This  ""how do you move forward to a point where it actually makes sense to build arguments against other people’s subjective realities""  is a kind of disturbing statement. Why do you need to do that at all? This whole idea comes from the place of saying ""I am right and you are wrong."" But as you say the idea of ""being right"" is deeply flawed.  You could move to a pragmatic position. To have a society we need to not hurt each other enough to make things work and then we are free to believe and do whatever we want. We can all see the world in a completely different way from each other and that's fine. In fact seeing the world differently from each other can become a great blessing in life, not a curse.  5) If someone else makes a logical statement you can challenge the internal consistency of it. And if someone makes an empirical statement you can challenge their observations. But ultimately you can't challenge their reality, and why would you want to or need to?  6) I think that there is very limited value in general to creating ""“rational” arguments in support of the things I believe.""  The problem is that all rational arguments are based on assumptions (""As a constructivist"") and so your arguments are only as good as your assumptions and so you are really saying nothing other than ""I believe these things"". Which is the same as other people saying that.  If you aspire to being rational then that is a good thing but rationality is an extremely limited tool. The idea that you could create a rational system that covers the whole of existence is doomed to fail, there's almost no point in starting on a project so vast and so bogged down in assumption.  Anyway this turned into a long response. Hope it's helpful."

While this may be the case right now, Science will solve those problems eventually. It's similar to saying years back, ""Science cannot explain how we came into existence""; but Evolutionary Biology did. The important part is how  those millions of years of evolution, has made our brain incredibly powerful at Pattern Recognition. That is why we are so good at performing complex tasks. Computers and AIs, right now primitive, will eventually reach that level.     how do you move forward to a point where it actually makes sense to build arguments against other people’s subjective realities   is a kind of disturbing statement.

I agree that trying to win an argument and ""being right"" is counter-productive to what we say, we want to accomplish : Change a person's mind.  And this internal need, to be correct, superior needs to go away.   Changing someone's mind is an incredibly difficult task, but it is not in vain. This is how we achieve things, by communicating our own ideas to people around us. Often these ideas conflict, but in case of big ideas(not speculative or entirely subjective) that are really important (which affects the basic values of a large number of people), there needs to be a discussion.    But ultimately you can't challenge their reality, and why would you want to or need to?   SOPA and PIPA, were bad for the Internet and that was sufficiently obvious, but without the collective efforts of active members of the Internet community, we wouldn't have gotten to this point. Even though it was agreement through inaction, there was a need for change.  We are incredibly ignorant to some things, due to our cognitive biases, growing up. And that ignorance can inadvertently lead to some very bad decisions. Hate and Killing exists due to the very same reason. Terrorists, Hitler, Criminals. Don't you think we should stop this, or have the capacity to stop this?   What about people in North Korea? Is it immoral to think that they should be introduced to a higher standard of living, or have more rights ? Because these may be people who have not reached conclusions based on their own understanding, but rather imposed on them. That doesn't mean they or we should get along with those conclusions.  This may sound overly dramatic, and may not be what you were addressing when you wrote the above statement. But I believe that some things are wrong and ought to be changed.   6) I think that there is very limited value in general to creating ""“rational” arguments in support of the things I believe."" The problem is that all rational arguments are based on assumptions (""As a constructivist"") and so your arguments are only as good as your assumptions and so you are really saying nothing other than ""I believe these things"". Which is the same as other people saying that.   Above I make the assumption that ""Internet Freedom"" is our basic right. And that ""Killing is bad"", and a person can disagree. You are right that we are only as good as our assumptions. And that is where I think, we can help each other. By checking our assumptions with each other. An individual cannot always take the ""right"" decisions, as we are delusional by nature, and have many bugs in our reasoning. We need each other to keep us in check. That is how humanity has progressed, through Collaboration.  For Subjective matters I agree that people shouldn't be too passionate about debating every other opinion.

It's counter intuitive to recognize that all beliefs come from a valid experience and then still try to see your argument as the ultimate truth. Like once you see it you can't go back.  So for example, in stead of beliefs what if we talked about culture? Is there one ultimate best way to exist on this planet or can humans exist in multiple ways on the planet and each way be valid?  The same can be said of beliefs-is there one ultimate ""right"" argument or are tons of arguments that okay to co-exist?  Now this doesn't mean that you are argumentless. It means that the best way to help a person with an opposing belief get to understand your belief is by finding a way to communicate your reality and your understanding to them and vise versa.

Quick example - what's the deal with abortions? - Abortion is about protecting womens' right to use their body as they see fit.  versus - Some people think Abortion is about protecting womens' freedom of choice, and others believe it is the right for every fetus to be able to grow to term.

The difference I notice is that the debates around the house differed, so for example when the Iraq was was about to happen a lot of talk from us was about the morality of it, the rights and wrongs, whereas those who wanted to go in had no debate going. Over the years I think one set of kids learned to think and argue and the other watched their parents simply complain about people not working hard not doing well etc. Yes, there is doctrine, but also method, and when as a child you learn to debate and question a system that process is with you for life. it also taught them to be engaged... mine learned to ask about things, whereas several people I know just told their kids not to be silly- BUT there is often a difference in parenting styles overall.

On the other hand, I suspect most people who get their children involved in these things assume political/religious/ideological (or one of the above, take your pick) are fundamentally something where some views are more ethical than others, or where there's a right approach and/or a wrong approach.  After all, you have to feel pretty strongly about a cause to get that involved in the first place.  In this case, avoiding getting children involved from an early age would be like not teaching them math, spelling, or appropriate social behavior.  After all, young children learn these things before they really know why they are done a certain way.  But it would be unethical to allow them to grow up without teaching them these things, because then they would be entering adulthood without important knowledge about how to do things.  If you take this view, the ethical thing is to do whatever you can to make sure your children choose  the right view, not to leave them be to potentially choose wrong options.  I guess there's a third approach too, where you see political/religious/ideological setups as something like sports affiliation.  Is it ethical to deck your toddler out in the local sports team color?  I doubt most people would have a problem with that, since sports affiliation is basically meaningless outside of it's use as a tribal or socially unifying force-and it's probably good to do things that make your kid feel like an accepted member of local society.   Anyway, that's just my take on the different ways people can approach this question, and why, given some approaches, it could be considered quite ethical to involve children in campaigns, demonstrations, etc."

Or that it might be wrong to take your kids to a women's sufferage protest because maybe women voting would ruin the country?  To most people going to these protests, the causes involved are just as obviously correct as being anti-slavery or pro-women's sufferage, and leaving their kids at home because they might be wrong makes about as much sense to them as avoiding these topics because they might be wrong."

It's a crime to raise ferrets in California, under your definition this is an evil, and you can see how many things could be swept away in this new world of yours that reduce its value.  However if we restrict the definition of evil to wilful, malicious acts, then I think it's pretty obvious that this new world would be better. You are positting that things may be defined as 'good' only when there is an opposing 'evil'.

Beyond the definitions and semantics, beyond any relative value, there would still be the absolute of ""People are no longer willfully being harmed. There are no murders or rapes or thefts or mutilations, there are no people intentionally destroying the lives of other people.""   Most of us, in Western society, do not experience evils that are commonplace in other places and other times. The lack of that evil does not necessarily bring us daily joy . . . but many of us are only alive in the first place, to experience that lack of joy, because of the (relative) lack of evil.   You're right, people's views would change, but is that really worse than the things eliminated? Is it really that bad at all, if we lived in such a world that they could afford to become a little ""spoiled"" through ignorance of true depravity?"
InsightfulQuestions,37piu3,JustMeRC,5,Fri May 29 19:29:32 2015 UTC,"do we just keep finding ways to redefine it   Eliminating evil, would not be about changing actions, but changing perceptions. Evil is just a concept we assign to things we see as not beneficial. The idea of evil can shift from perspective to perspective.   Is it evil to murder someone? What about going back in time and murdering Hitler as a child to prevent the holocaust? Is it evil for an abuse victim to murder their abuser? Is it evil for a doctor to aid in euthanasia?  One may say then, that the question is whether there was malevolent intent vs. benevolent intent. Did Hitler think he was doing something positive for the world? Does a mother who drowns her children because she is mentally ill and thinks she's protecting them from something? Does a captain of industry believe lowering his employees wages, actually saves jobs and creates a net benefit? Look at the biblical story of Noah. The god of the Abrahamic bible drowned the whole human race, except Noah and his family. He supposedly did it because there was so much evil in the world. Was that action good, or was it evil?  The problem is not with the existence of things we call ""evil,"" but the perception that anything is black and white or good or evil. In psychology, it's called splitting. People have a tendency to create simple categories, and want to put everything neatly in categorical baskets. It causes us to look at the world in extremes, like ""all good"" or ""all bad.""  Categorizing things in this way, makes us feel better about our own ways of thinking. Consequently, the concept of ""evil"" will probably persist throughout time, there will just be shifts concerning which things go in which baskets.  It would be better to understand that nothing is all good or all bad. Even with the best intentions and the worst intentions, there are both positive and negative outcomes. These are known as unintended consequences.   Therefore, an improvement would not be in whether ""evil"" acts were committed, but how we react to them as a society. Do we escalate things and make them worse by going too far in the opposite direction, or do we learn how to react in a less extreme way, and take the middle path. Remember when you think about this possibility, that you have acted out of both good and bad intentions yourself, at some point in your life. You have done things with positive intentions which have produced negative consequences. So has everyone else. So, who and what is evil? How does changing ones perspective on the thought of what evil is, change your ideas about how you might react? How would you want things to be if one day, being /u/sardaukar_siet was the world's definition of evil. How would you hope to be treated?  If you define utopia as a world free of what you perceive of as evil, no problem: just wait until you die, and your perception of evil will no longer exist! Unfortunately, the definition of the term is constantly shifting, and will most likely persist. So, the only way to get rid of evil is to stop looking at things as if they are. You can do it right now if you wish.  If everyone stops looking at things as evil, what would the world look like? Good question. I suppose it depends on who you ask. Maybe you should ask that question instead, and see what people say.  Edit: TL/DR You can live in a world without evil right now, and instead see negative actions and consequences as a result of ignorance, aversion, and fear (including your own.) See for yourself what it would be like and what has changed. It will have been your perspective."

There is a real threat of escaped ferrets breeding and damaging local wildlife populations.

I don't think we live in a world where everything is great, or that we live in the best of all possible worlds (excepting the possibility that we live in one of a very small number of possible worlds).  We live in a world devoid of evil because evil is an abstract concept that exists only insofar as we have invented it.  Take a moment and attempt to imagine a world devoid of evil as you interpret that idea.  I'll join you.  In a world without corruption... well I'm not sure what that world looks like.  I assume you mean the social definition of corruption, since a world without decomposition would have ended millennia ago.  Let's look at this from the perspective of a tiny transgression and work our way us.  Is a world without corruption a world in which everyone is always honest?  Is that what that means?  Clearly not.  There is definitely nothing corrupt about the fact that I refrain from telling my best friend that I would like to bang his sister - and then refrain from banging his sister.  Is wanting to bang his sister selfish in the first place?  I suppose, but, is it still selfish if she wants to bang me too?  There is this other women I want to bang who wants to bang me, too, and I've managed to make a whole marriage out of that.  If I wanted to bang his sister, and his sister wanted to bang me, and I weren't married (or had my wife's permission... ;) ...) Wouldn't it be selfish of my friend to want to stop us?  So far we've found that conflicting desires can cause conflict without anyone clearly being in the wrong necessarily.  In fact, that whole situation has largely relied on the idea that my friends has some degree of ownership over his sister as member of his family, which is a bit demeaning to women in general (if I wanted to bang his brother would he feel the same way?).  It's clear at this point that we can't readily hand-wave away interpersonal conflict as being the innate result of some sort of evil humour.  What if crime went away?  I think we can all agree that we'd be better off without rape or assault or stalking or carjacking.  What about stealing food?  What about civil disobedience?  Should that damn, ungrateful woman have followed the law and gone to the back of the bus?  It's the law.  That was a crime.  Trouble is, the law is not intrinsically anything at all.  The law is what we make it, and sometimes the law is wrong.  What about all those terrible rapscallions who were illegally growing marijuana this whole time?  If they weren't breaking the law, the law would not be changing.  Does the changing legality justify their earlier crimes?  Do their earlier crimes delegitimize the new changes in the law?  Why do we charge 14 year olds with felonies for possessing nude photographs of themselves?  Sure, everyone would be better off if they had not committed that crime - but no better off than if it had not been a crime in the first place.  Johnny Depp might go to prison for ten years for bringing his dogs to Australia.  There are two examples where laws themselves are sometimes necessary evils.  We can easily come up with explanations for how these two genuinely harmless acts should be circumscribed to prevent other, more malicious ones.  Both laws make perfect sense, and perhaps their enforcement is a bit wonky, but they are there for a solid reason.  Neither can be said to be good or evil.  The only thing I can think of that could remotely qualify as an evil that would have clearly good effects if ended would be active personal malice.  It would cut the murder rate significantly.  It wouldn't end domestic violence, as that is as much about love gone wrong as it is about hate.  It wouldn't end theft or graft even war.  What if there were no more earthquakes?  How would that even work?  We rely on the Earth to be tectonically and volcanically active to shield us from the lethal-fucking-radiation of space.  No more flooding?  How would our new, better water cycle work, and why would molecules of floating H2O have to rearrange themselves to conform to our moral standards?"

I imagine utopia would be different for each individual, because as /u/Diabolico said so eloquently, conflicting desires can cause conflict without anyone clearly being in the wrong necessarily. Therefore, one person's utopia could easily conflict with another person's utopia, causing conflict.   The Buddhists have an interesting idea of what individual utopia, or enlightenment looks like. Forgive my sloppy definition (I'm not Buddhist), but, it's an understanding one reaches, where one has learned to let go of attachments to things (physical and conceptual), through the diminishment or elimination of reactivity to desire, fear, aversion, etc., with the ultimate goal of ending suffering/unsatisfactoriness (dukkha) for all sentient beings. (Edit: This comes from learning how to pay attention to how our own reactivities arise and play out in our thoughts and actions, and understanding that it is similar for everyone.)  So, to think of utopia for all, they suggest we create our own individual utopias, where our thoughts and actions do not depend on whether evil exists or not. Of course, it relies on the idea that utopia is not perfection, rather, it is the acceptance of  imperfection. So, a utopian world would have conflict, but it would be dealt with in a compassionate way which recognizes universal fallibility (edit: our penchant to succumb to desire, fear, aversion, etc.), by helping others how to find their own states of enlightenment."

Here's our problem.  This is so vague as to be useless.  In this Utopian world do I still want to bang my friend's sister?  Poverty is not caused by people being greedy.  It's caused by troubled upbringing, unconscious racism, natural scarcity, mental illness, fear and anxiety and lack of inherited resources and a million other little, twisted, troublesome things.  How many of those things can we sweep away in our purge of evil?  Does mankind growing out of its teens mean not only that people stop being greedy, but that those who have been hurt in the past stop being injured?  Greedy people are responsible for some poverty, and that poverty would surely get better, but that isn't enough to solve the problem.  Poverty is a problem that needs a solution, not for us to just quit causing it.   people just snap out of it and realize the best thing in life is to make more sense of the Universe around you   I thought the best thing in life was to bring happiness to others and to prevent as much suffering as possible (Epicureanism).

I thought the best thing in life was to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.  The best thing in life is self-expression, art, nature, bungee-jumping, fine cuisine, sacrifice, children, love, family, a job well done.

Then we might be eradicated as a race, since the will to strive is gone, unless somehow we are selfless only for our own race and selfish towards others and remain as apex predator.

""Good"" has come to mean ""weak, and good for the shepherds"" and ""evil"" has come to mean ""strong, and not a shepherd."" He argues that the ancient dichotomy of ""good"" (meaning healthy and strong) vs. ""bad"" (meaning unhealthy and weak) is better. A will-to-power (a desire to change the world according to one's will), which by today's terminology is ""evil,"" is strong and healthy.

I would say that people really often making that error of thinking of utopia as this boring, or worse oppressive, faux-harmonic thing. A slightly altered version of Rockefeller America with the only difference that everybody gets exactly $1250 salary.  I think the conventional left with its primitive visions of communism are very guilty of feeding into that.  A good motto I came up with to  counter that would be: ""Utopia is exactly how we want it to be.""  Now in terms of equality I personally (as a nonbuddhist/anarchist) even believe in some structured inequality.  It would just feel shitty to work really hard and then not see the slightest benefit from it, it just goes against human nature. As a rule of thumb I would go maybe to a 1-3 or 1-4 ratio of income. Now this doesn't sound that much but you have to remember that in such a society there would be no need for saving up, worrying about your kids futures, as that shit is already taken care of, so making 3 times base salary means you could spend that money completely on hedonistic crap.  I think there is a strong aversion to thinking about it like that as it would make clear that society is this self-constructed pavlosian maze. Libertarians argue with the same argument of motivation, but they want the inequality to be somehow ""natural"" ignoring the fact that we already live in a simulation.  To answer your question would be pretty deep, as this is pretty much what I think about all the time, it goes pretty deep into some philosophical and psychological questions, the great circularity between society and the individual, etc..., but my answer would be: ""Yes a society without ""evil"" is thinkable, imaginable, and I dont think it would match its cheap clichee""  But to imagine this society precisely means letting go of such primitive concepts of harmony.  Another flawed assumption in your post would be this contradiction between selfishness and ""working for the greater good"". The great thing about utopia is that there is no contradiction here. You go to work for a reason and you get rewarded for it.  The fact that this seems so incredibly utopian just shows us how incredibly sad this capitalism really is."

As you do away with the basic errors and their associated deliberate actions (evils), then you see there is more not less by way of opportunities. The derp that surrounds us, does limit what is possible; and as you've noted having that imposed, is at the heart of what is truly evil. There's not a lot to be done except waiting for the stupidities to play out, there's no real prospect of killing off all the stupidities, there are just too many and it requires collective action to evolve. In the absence of education, certain people need to experience the negative feedback from their actions in order they learn their ABCs; others are more considered but rarely do people change their understanding. So, more needs to be done to educate the next generations in basic ethics and Good action; we also need to acknowledge more about how what is considered evil arises from lack of resources and necessity, rather than having wars on nouns.  In a world where everyone has what they need =[privacy; security; freedom; food+water; energy; education], I would expect change to accelerate rapidly. However, encouraging society forward, is no simple business and for the most part the process is as slow as treacle."

In other words, the first year of life is counted as one instead of zero, so that a person is two years old in their first western year, three years old in their second, and so on.

Consequently before you are born you do not even exist, your personality, tastes and memories (in other words ""you"")are yet to be developed. Consciousness is just a state where matter has reached an organization high enough to become aware of itself, consciousness does not and cannot exist separate from matter.

The title of the experiment reminded me of one of my favorite TED talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU   which is also about split brain hemispheres. Very interesting imho.

To me it seems if animals or people act like they're aware of their enviornment and exhibit similar behavior to myself and other living things this implies consciousness. If spliting the corpus collosum creates two seperate awarenesses that act aware of their surroundings in different ways but are not necessarily aware of one another that means either consciousness is made up of physical matter and therefore can be manipulated and changed through it or alternatively that our brains are always composed of seperate conscious agents who then can be argued to be either made of matter or simply manipulating it.  Consciousness is the thing that's doing ""being aware""."

Lose another, and you can no longer understand language. Lose another, and you can no longer feel pain. etc. etc. etc.  It's absolutely ridiculous to say that despite the years of information we have on how the brain relates to consciousness, the cessation of brain function does not lead to the cessation of consciousness.

No. Your comparison is misconceived and brain research still hasn't cracked the code to the human consciousness.  edit: Im not an anti-science idiot that refuses to acknowledge theories on consciousness but being that that's all they are and there is no scientific consensus we don't have an answer

When it comes to sight, Antelopes are just as ""conscious"" as we are.

Yes sight is not what defines consciousness, the inner experience is what consciousness is. Is there 'something to be like' an antelope? If yes, then antelopes are conscious. Human thought also does not define consciousness. Consciousness is the collective experience produced by separate regions of the brain. If you lose one of the regions, you lose the part of conscious experience it's responsible for. If you lose all the regions, you lose all conscious experience.

Others yet may argue that originality is predicated upon intent, and if I intended my painting to be similar to Rembrandt's it is not original, but if the similarity was accidental, my painting is original.   So maybe different people have different thresholds for originality, and maybe OP's threshold is low. Maybe for something to be original to OP, it must be less than 30% similar to extant work. Depending on the metric we choose to obtain that difference, there may indeed be a limited amount of possible diversity present within any given medium. This would be dictated by whether our metric follows the triangle inequality. If it does, then there is a limit to the amount of art that can be created that satisfies a given difference threshold (given a limited resolution, of course)."

I don't think art really strives to be new, art strives to communicate something. Newness can be an aspect of that (conveying ""shock,"" for instance, depends upon bringing the viewers into something outside their normal sphere of comfort. So bringing them into a ""new"" space), but it isn't a necessary element of that. I think we can ask what the artwork is trying to do and then judge it accordingly. Newness might play into that judgment, or it might not."

InsightfulQuestions,36iq2a,bobbyfiend,2,Wed May 20 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"Part of it, I think, is the lack of a common ""visual vocabulary."" If you wander through any art museum, you see the same images repeated down the centuries. Madonna and child, a lion in the wild wood, ships in the bay and smokestacks behind them -- these are all images that conveyed a meaning to anyone who viewed them. For the most part, we lack that sort of generally-understood imagery (unless you count things like the Golden Arches). And the few images we have in common are ephemeral. That shoves an artist toward either introversion, a search for fundamental imagery (think abstract expressionism), or the sort of banal, ""tapioca pudding"" you write about.  It doesn't help that visual stimuli are ubiquitous. If you think about it, you see more human-created imagery driving to work, than our recent ancestors did in their entire life-span. There are probably hundreds of artists doing work that you'd find refreshing, right now. You'll never see it, because it's drown in the flood."

One staple crop is grown all the way over here, another one hundreds of miles away.  This necessary product is made on the other side of the country.

A fat juicy steak is affordable and much more tasty.  But if someday the price of beef goes up, I might buy Soylent.  As demand grows, it will fund R&D and the technology will get even better.

InsightfulQuestions,35psam,maiqthetrue,2,Wed May 13 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: We aren't concerned enough about the future, though we're getting better at it.   we seem very concerned about preparing for a future where the earth is no longer habitable.    In my opinion, humans have never been very good at thinking of consequences in the very long term. This has happened for a number of reasons:    We've only recently become capable of causing the damage to the environment. The 20th century, with the development of the airplane and the automobile (as well as advances in engine technology), made the logistics of current consumption possible. The majority of consumption used to be local/regional, transported by horses, etc. As transportation of goods and services got easier, a person could have a larger effect on the other side of the world than ever before. At the same time our effect on the environment (per capita) has increased as population has grown and people have been able to live longer. So there is a larger call for resources than ever before. Taking these two points together, I'm not sure whether it could have been possible to realize the damage that could be done by humans just a hundred years ago. A large part of it can be pegged to lack of knowledge. The major religious traditions have emphasized that the afterlife (ahem!) will be spent away from the mess of the earth. Even those religions that incorporate reincarnation emphasize the release from the cycle of rebirth as the goal of a good spiritual life. In most cases, Earth is meant to be escaped from. I believe that it's an understandable emphasis since before modern medicine and technologies diseases were often deadly (and very painful) and luxuries were in short supply.    Is our ability to manipulate biology and ecology on a micro level, really better for the survival of sentient beings and planetary systems?   harmony with Earth's nature?    The ability to better understand and manipulate our environment is an important factor in bringing us to a more sustainable solution. We shouldn't let nature takes its course if it goes against us. If we can develop a way to disperse tornadoes before they can fully form, I'd be in favour of it. The amount of time and money and suffering that could be saved is a huge consideration to be made before dismissing technology. What's very important is the responsible use of technology. Proposals like dispersing reflective material in the atmosphere needs to be thoroughly analyzed before implementation.   Ever since we started getting together to farm and live as communities we started to move away from ""harmony"" with Earth's nature. There are many parts of nature that are not welcoming - disease, exposure, wildlife, etc. No one wants to move back to a time without antibiotics or irrigation. Though again, natural resources aren't just meant to be thoughtlessly consumed for our immediate benefit. Responsible usage is very important.   Are our financial systems too short-sighted, and causing us to speed toward a future of more rapid boom and crash cycles? Would it be better to settle for slower growth, in exchange for greater stability?   This is a very complicated question. Overall, the benefits of rapid economic development cannot be denied. If countries like China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, etc. did not stress rapid development there would be many more people suffering from the limits of extreme poverty. In more developed economies the share of growth is less equitable, so maybe yes. But how? Developed economies are often based on consumption, so to grow there needs to be more consumption. Maybe the recent movements that emphasize meditation and well-being over things and vices will lead to some changes."

Biodiversity has certainly suffered because of transportation and globalization. What we've gained from it on the one hand, we've lost from it on the other.   I'm troubled by the belief so many hold, that we can somehow conquer nature and overcome the obstacles of its limitations. Of course, this is true to a certain degree, but to forget that we are of the earth, and part of nature, is a grave miscalculation in my opinion. For example, we're learning that a lot of chronic diseases may be the result of lack of biodiversity in our own gut ecosystems. We rely on bacteria and organisms to convert our food into fuel, and we're damaging ourselves with low-quality food and over-sanitized environments. (check out /r/microbiome and a recent article about a book called The Good Gut)   The major religious traditions have emphasized that the afterlife (ahem!) will be spent away from the mess of the earth.

I don't have a lot of hope that the Satanists will rise in popularity and numbers any time soon, haha, but Secular Humanists may have a better chance (though still not a great one.) I used to think that eschewing religion as a society was a good idea. I'm coming to understand that religion will always be present and powerful, so it might be a good idea to invest in viable alternatives. I think we may need a new Jesus/Mohammed/Buddha, etc. to shepherd the flock into the next era. Unfortunately, there are plenty of charlatans out there now vying for those positions.   We shouldn't let nature takes its course if it goes against us. If we can develop a way to disperse tornadoes before they can fully form, I'd be in favour of it. The amount of time and money and suffering that could be saved is a huge consideration to be made before dismissing technology. What's very important is the responsible use of technology.    I wonder how we can define responsible use? I'm all for eliminating suffering, for sure. Still, I'm hesitant of weather manipulation. There was an interesting video I watched a while back, of a meeting of people in a town in Hawaii where they were dealing with potential lava flow.   The town was made up of both indigenous Hawaiians, and more recent transplants. I think it was posted on an atheism board, to disparage the indigenous residents for their belief in Pele, the volcano goddess. While the anthropomorphism of the volcano could be initailly dismissed as folksy ignorance, there was a certain wisdom in the logic of allowing for the natural process to occur.   What if the town diverted the lava, and it ended up in the next town over? What if they tried to divert it, and ended up causing more damage than would have been done if left on its own? What about the next lava flow? The native people preferred to let nature take its course, and rely on each other as a community to help rebuild and support each other though it and after it.   Of course, lava and tornadoes are two different things. Still, the calm the native Hawaiian's felt about the impending destruction, came from their faith in the reliability of their community members. I found their argument quite compelling within their particular context.   But how? Developed economies are often based on consumption, so to grow there needs to be more consumption.   I don't know the answer, but I tend to think we need to imagine a new type of economy, where we value consumption of things which provide true benefit, and don't just serve as salves on our collective dissatisfaction with the way things are. I'm far from an expert on anything economic, but I think we need to value people and services and food and resources MUCH more than we do now. The powers that be get rich from siphoning off the things that are of true value (time, community interaction, healthful means, enjoyment of nature,) and replacing them with cheap substitutes (wealth, self-interest, pseudo-food, electronic entertainment). There are more of ""us"" than there are of ""them,"" and we have to raise our collective voices and demand something better. They could profit from an improved system, too. It can be a win/win, but we have to redefine winning.  Thanks for bringing up so many good points!  Edit: added subreddit link  edit 2: added article link"
InsightfulQuestions,35psam,jzpenny,1 point,Wed May 13 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"This is a really good conversation, but I hope other people come and join us. I still haven't answered one of your questions, ""are there any other areas of concern I have not mentioned?"" I'll try to fit something in this comment and relate it to your response. The original comment took me about an hour to write (and format), this one shouldn't take too long. Just for some background, it'd be great if you heard this talk by Jonathan Haidt about the morals of liberals and conservatives.   For example, we're learning that a lot of chronic diseases may be the result of lack of biodiversity in our own gut ecosystems. We rely on bacteria and organisms to convert our food into fuel, and we're damaging ourselves with low-quality food and over-sanitized environments.   I read the article; it was good. I'm not an expert, but I have been keeping up with the major news about the microbiome in our digestive systems. It's certainly very important to our health, much more than was previously thought. And the kinds of food and diet that are recommended in the article are what I try to eat as well. My typical breakfast is a quarter onion, a small tomato, a mushroom, a bell pepper --all chopped-- sauted with peas and carrots. I add 3-4 eggs, scramble it all up and I'm good to go. One of my new year's resolutions was to eat more veggies, and since I've been doing this my gut feels smoother.  What I'm concerned with is that we don't overlook the benefits of sanitized environments. Because when you say   a certain wisdom in the logic of allowing for the natural process to occur   I need to make it clear, though I'm quite certain that you're already aware, that natural processes often don't favour us. We must be aware of the naturalistic fallacy. Many of our closest ancestors, the others in the Homo group, went extinct because of natural processes - weather, disease, etc. So we need to make sure that we minimize the potential harm of natural processes while maintaining its resources and diversity. National parks, protected reserves, environmental research for conservation is very important. And urgent action regarding climate change, better resource management, etc to reduce our effects on the environment. These are all necessary because the natural world really is wonderful, aside from also being essential.   I'm coming to understand that religion will always be present and powerful, so it might be a good idea to invest in viable alternatives. I think we may need a new Jesus/Mohammed/Buddha, etc. to shepherd the flock into the next era. Unfortunately, there are plenty of charlatans out there now vying for those positions.   There was some recent news that the US is becoming less religious. In most developed countries around the world, religiousness is dropping. The rapid progress made by the LGBTQ community would not have been possible if the hold that religion has on a society's perception of morality had not loosened.  There are plenty of charlatans posing as the new saviours. One of the ones I despise is Deepak Chopra, the guy is absolutely frustrating. Stupid, manipulative, disingenuous, and completely irritating. But I don't deny the role that strong leaders play in society. People follow leaders, and strong leaders have undeniable charisma. It's very important to choose those who we can be proud of. I'm not sure that choosing a religious leader would be a good idea. If we're serious about progress, we need to support scientists, skeptics and the like. But yes, there is definitely a need for people like Malala; she's really something special. Despite the fact that I think the current Pope is doing a good job of pushing some progress through the Catholic community, he's part of a system that has many other problems.  You did bring up something that I do believe is one way to really turn around society, maybe focus a little less on senseless consumerism.    imagine a new type of economy, where we value consumption of things which provide true benefit, and don't just serve as salves on our collective dissatisfaction with the way things are.   things that are of true value (time, community interaction, healthful means, enjoyment of nature,)    This is the solution right here. People need to shift their spending from goods to services. Just a small shift, nothing major. It's so encouraging when I see people heading to yoga classes, or buying hiking equipment, that sort of stuff. This sort of consumerism needs to be encouraged. But you know, I don't know whether it would be economically beneficial for everyone to suddenly care a lot more about well-being rather than egoism. Most developed countries are too dependant on consumption to be able to switch up the status quo. It would be disastrous. I don't believe that there's an easy solution, but it may be possible."
InsightfulQuestions,35psam,agromonkey123,1 point,Sat May 16 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the length of this reply. I wanted to edit it to be more succinct, but it's not my strong suit. The TL/DR is that I agree we (the global we) should try to see beyond our own moral biases, whether conservative or liberal, in order to work together toward goals which are as mutually beneficial as possible.  Excellent video, thanks for sharing it, and also for the time and effort you put into your responses! In the beginning, the speaker talks briefly about whether we are born with a set of beliefs/morals, or if we are blanks slates, and then shows images of children in the arms of their caretakers. This reminds me of what psychology calls Attachment Theory, which I think fits in with the paradigm of liberalism vs. conservatism, because it attempts to understand part of the development mechanism for adult social relationships. Up until a few decades ago, the theory has been used mostly in reference to infant/child bonding, and more recently, how it relates to adult romantic relationships. I think it can also be applied to the greater dynamics of moral leanings the speaker in the video discussed, in regards to both liberalism, conservatism, and the more fluid open morality he advocates for. It's nice to hear someone talk about it, because I tend to relate more to that fluidity, than to either ""team,"" though I have certainly taken sides on occasion.  Though I'm sure to most people I come off as quite liberal, I tend to think of myself as more fluid. I can usually find merit in any perspective, and often wondered if I was just wishy-washy, haha.   One thing I think I've developed over the years though, is a pretty good bullshit meter, so I find myself debating anyone who thinks they have ""the answer,"" even though in certain contexts, I definitely propose some ""answers,"" of my own. Limited interactions on forums like these don't allow us to go too in depth most of the time, and cause many individuals to boil their arguments down into such succinct bits, that probably just reinforce the type of moral certitude the speaker in the video asks us to be wary of. So, I appreciate a chance to try to go beyond that a bit, and your ability to do so.   I still haven't answered one of your questions, ""are there any other areas of concern I have not mentioned?""   I think I've though of a big one that I initially left out, though it's probably implicit in a lot of the other things: population increase. I think that when we talk about the future, and about placing importance of focus on one issue over another, it's hard to do so without acknowledging that with a growing population comes additional levels of competing interests.   This, along with our ability to communicate on a more global scale, and industries operating more globally, has expanded our concept of ""community."" No doubt, this has both positive and negative implications, which probably depends a lot on where you are in the world.   The diversity of economic environments that exist on a global scale, certainly give me pause when I think I might understand what is better for anyone. Maybe others are more correct when they say it's not so easy (or even possible) to think so globally, though I tend to lean toward the idea that some issues lend themselves to this more than others.  Still, with increasing population, competition for resources is just going to put further pressure when it comes to an entire range of issues. I suspect it will just cause more strife, and so coming up with ways to encourage population control (not necessarily through restriction, but maybe through education) might be a good place to focus some energy and resources. I'm sure it will be an uphill battle. Reproduction is one of our most basic human instincts.   There was some recent news that the US is becoming less religious.   I've noticed that trends in thinking, not just about religion, but in general, follow a pattern of expansion and contraction over time, and that people tend to converse about these issues in a ""push and pull"" sort of way.  I think some of the statistics about religious belief probably reflect a subset climate of societal acceptance in certain regions of countries. So the trend toward ""less religious"" may include the fact that more people feel comfortable expressing that they are not religious. Yet, because of the ""push and pull,"" I mentioned before, another subset who are religious, have become even more fervent.  I've spent some time on r/atheism and related subs. I went there thinking I'd find some camaraderie among non-believers, but the problem with atheism by design, is that the absence of belief is an empty hole. This is why some atheistic non-religions like Secular Humanism have sprung up. Even many who don't believe in the conventional notions of a supernatural being, and reject the social constructs of religion built around them, still want or need something to believe in. Of course, the shift is from supernatural gods, to sentient beings. So while religion may be in the waning phase of its cycle, belief and the need to make meaning are still part of the human condition for many.  Then, of course, the religious seem more religious and cling more to their churches, etc. in recent times. This may be due to a combination of factors, including political exploitation. It still leaves us with a majority of individuals who continue to subscribe to a religion, with a subset of them who are heavily dogmatic.  I had an exchange in r/politics recently, with a pastor of a church in a ""red state"" in the U.S., where he expressed beliefs which were more in line with the teachings of Jesus, and contradictory to the current ""religious/political"" beliefs embraced by his congregation. It has gotten to the point where he can't preach what he believes Jesus and scripture call his followers to do (love each other, care for the poor, etc.) because the religion has been so sullied by political influences which value selfishness, prejudice, and greed.  Most people in the conversation suggested he abandon ship, and become a liberal, and leave his church. This is not a practical, nor a productive solution. I think those who don't believe in supernatural beings, should try no to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Here you have a person who wants to bring what he feels are the true teaching of Jesus (which fall very much in line with Humanism in many ways), and many liberals can't get past their own aversion to religion to see that this man is an ally, staying right where he is. I suggested he read a book called Teaching As a Subversive Activity, which discusses a method called Inquiry Based Learning (similar to Socratic Method). It's from the late 60's, so it's written in the context of that time, but there are many things discussed in it which still apply today.  I should've expounded on my previous statement about needing a new Jesus/Buddha/Mohammed. I didn't mean that we need new religion, per se, rather that we need new leaders to bring us back to the shared values which those in power manipulating religions have monopolized and bastardized, and have been usurped for personal gain.   Jesus and Gautama Buddha (I can't speak well about Mohammed) were not about religion. Religion is what happened after they vanished. There are many similarities to the type of conversations going on in todays secular communities, and those which were espoused by these individuals and their followers. When I speak of needing new leaders, I mean those who bring a current context to these conversations, and help their communities move forward without clinging to past notions of religion, or being averse to the idea of belief.   There are plenty of charlatans posing as the new saviours. One of the ones I despise is Deepak Chopra   Haha, I can't believe I'm about to defend Chopra, because I know exactly what you mean, and have similar criticisms concerning his egoism and opportunism. However, I went through a very difficult time last year, as a result of my disabling chronic illness. I was too exhausted to do a complex search for audio meditations, so I picked the first one I came upon, which were his. I even had to pay for them, which I still find rather greedy of him (and Oprah, who he marketed these recording with). Still, I can't deny that this set of recordings helped me begin to turn my dark thoughts around, and so on the other hand, I am extremely grateful for them and for him. So, while I have criticisms for the man, and even for some of his messages, most people will find the thing they need to hear, no matter who is saying it or how it's being presented. I found what I needed to hear in his recordings, and am grateful to him for helping me get through that time.   Seeing the flaws in others is often very easy. Finding our own blind spots can be surprisingly difficult, despite spending more time with ourselves than anyone else, and making the same mistakes over and over again. This applies not only to individuals, but to communities whether local or global. If we can lovingly and kindly support one another in seeing those places growing beyond them, while accepting and forgiving each other's (and our own) humanity and the inevitability of making mistakes,  I think there's much hope for the future.   Sorry if I digressed too much from the original topic. Thanks for reading my ramblings."

I have a monstrously loud voice that I keep modulated to mouse-mode most of the time. I also have the knack for giving engaging, entertaining presentations. It's served me tremendously well in my career.  Thinking about it, appearing to have confidence is made up of a zillion little behaviors, instead of any small handful of things. A few of them:  Present well - in every social interaction, each person plays a role. Exemplify that role. People defer to stereotypes, consciously or not. It makes them comfortable.  Manage the conversation - in business meetings, keep the conversation flowing. Interrupt tangents if you have to, and be sure that everyone who is trying to speak gets heard. I find myself using small gestures and body language to direct the attention of the people in the room quite a bit.  Win every pissing match - dominance games happen all the time. All the time. Particularly when being introduced to a new social context, folks with poor social skills will use dominance games as an opening gambit. There are many ways to push past this - the least desirable is to simply call them on it. My preferred technique is to let them spew their BS, then ask a question that forces them to double down on an untenable position. Once they've done so, I smile, give the ""oh really?"" facial cue, and move on to my next point.  Rather than turn this into more of a wall of text, I'll shut up now and ask if anyone else has particular techniques."

Confidence is not: I'm better than anyone else in this room; confidence is: I am strong, and I can do this.   I've always been told I had a very strong presence, though. The nature of it has changed some, I think. I am told that I am very intimidating, which surprises me none. I have masculine/aged features, which is seen as intimidating on women (there are actual studies on this), and I am quite tall and physically fit. Additionally, I have a dominant (but not domineering) personality and was raised by an extremely intelligent family, so I learned to make quick, smart replies. And this combination intimidates people sometimes. But my introverted personality and genuine friendliness generally put people at ease after a while, so those intimidation factors end up just adding to my ""presence."""

I've found that whenever I wanted more positive attention it was because I didn't actually have any substance or characteristics that would interest anyone.   What I'm saying is that maybe instead of trying to get people to notice you, maybe you should focus more inwards and cultivate habits that interest yourself.  By finding things that truly interest yourself, there are bound to be people who are also equally interested.   Thus you will find more quality of presence with people that you find interesting rather than an abundance of low grade attention from people whom you find boring. I had to find this out the hard way and very possibly this does not apply to you at all.   What matters most of all is why you want the presence in the first place."

In addition to being an introvert and a minority, I am one of the youngest people in my office.   I personally don't think there is anything wrong with being an introvert, I don't intend to change, but I think having the ability to put on an air of presence to get the job done would be a helpful skill to have.   At work, the main goal is not trying to attract people with shared interest. For that I have my friends and family.

Something helpful I've found in a school related environment is to talk only when you are ready to have a discussion, try not to talk authoritatively. A common mistake is to try to lead the discussion when you are not in a position to do so. If you are trying to change your image then becoming part of the discussion is a big first step.  It would seem rather odd to people who know you if you came in one day as a new man with a strong voice and a domineering standing. Just gently insert yourself, gently push into the situation, then once everyone's comfortably situated/adjusted to the new you (may take a week to two months), start learning how to project your voice. The best way to do this is to practice famous speeches in front of the mirror with a recording device. In this stage of your development you need to convince yourself that you are the man you want to be.

Even the ""embracing of other cultures""  meme can be considered an aggressive defense,  adept at neutralizing conflict (and isolation) in a primary culture so that a secondary culture can be subsumed,  or aimed at protecting the isolated ""carrier""  of a culture from outside prejudice or cultural replacement by adopting the ""soft"" non conflict defense.

In regards to environmental impacts, seeing minorities living in sketchier parts of town, religions of criminals noted on the news, societal expectations of the sexes, or whatever gives an impression that it's ""their"" society or culture that's wrong, therefore it's a ""them"" thing and nothing more. But centuries of outright prejudice (e.g. slavery) as well as covert prejudice (e.g. lack of female political say, Jim Crow, etc.) shape circumstances and perspectives.  With the passage of policies that aim to protect those from prejudice and achieve equality, the prejudice and the effects of centuries thereof don't simply go away.

InsightfulQuestions,35aljl,jerichojerry,22,Fri May 8 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"This is a great question. I often wonder this myself.     There was a pretty good discussion from Deng Xiaoping's former interpreter about this sort of issue. The just of what the audience said was that as China develops a middle class, they will realize their political deficiencies and demand liberal reforms - the Fukuyama kind of thinking.   But the reality is there are plenty of modern illiberal states that exist with large middle-classes. Russia is clearly a propaganda fueled quasi-military state built around a post-totalitarian anti-western agenda. China deals with something like 1,800 large scale anti-government protests each year. Singapore remains imperfectly democratic even if it mostly believes in liberal values.    But for each of these examples of liberalism seemingly halted by the sweets of economic boom or propaganda, there are examples of other developing countries becoming liberal states. Nigeria was a country like many other African countries just a few years ago. Two election cycles ago there were anti-muslim and anti-christian riots protesting the results of the elections. Large scale fraud, corruption. But the last election cycle was actually quite legitimate. There was no blood, not much contention, things actually went well for Africa's most population nation. India of course primarily retains its liberal values of free speech and individual rights even if they sometimes take channels off the air because of incorrect information. Indonesia and the Philippines, Japan and South Korea.. whether by US influence or a natural cause of development these countries are all strong democracies. The standard for the world is certainly a liberal one.   The best thing about liberal democracies is that they lend a long term stability. Even Putin himself knows that his countries political foundation is extremely fragile. There was a talk in the news some months ago about how Bill Clinton's effort to liberalize China by getting close to it (like the opposite approach to Cuba) have failed. That since it's been ~15 years since we've traded and openly talked and shared with China and they still aren't a liberal democracy we have failed. That kind of attitude really surprises me. That people think history moves that fast. That a country built around centralized authority for the last 6,000 years is suddenly going to have a revolution of more than a billion people because they get McDonalds and dubbed Magnum P.I. episodes in just 15 years. This will take a lot of time.   Basically considering that every other nation has at least gone liberal in rhetoric (in that they pretend to be liberal), I have confidence that China will as well. The only primary variable I can see changing China's history is a cultural value of order that you don't quite have in the rest of the world. Brazilians and Chinese don't quite match up on the ""harmony"" scale. But we've seen other countries with the same cultural values easily transition to democracies in most other Asian countries, so it certainly isn't a full-proof blockade to liberalism.   But it's worth noting that Japan, South Korea, the Philippines all became strong democracies under US occupation. In lieu of that happening with China, I imagine they will put up more resistance to liberalism as long as they are fat and happy economically. So to answer your question I don't know. I feel like as long as we can not stoke the flames of nationalism in China and they don't fuel it themselves by asserting regional authority, things will happen much quicker. But I can definitely see a Chinese premiere feeling iffy about their political stability and starting some international conflict just to secure things at home, as Putin is so fond of doing. It seems like during those times liberal reforms get put on hold. The question is how long can those eras last?"

Full suffrage, and the social welfare and public pensions that followed, all came in the 20th century.  Before that, the ideals of the enlightenment were restricted to the rich professional class.    After the French Revolution, Robespierre and Napoleon showed the value of a large mass of poorly trained peasants with muskets.     This was accelerated with the industrial revolution, as improvements in transportation and administration allowed for the mobilization of truly massive armies.  And these million-man frontline armies were dwarfed by the armies of factory workers on the homefront, pushing out munitions and equipment for made by the modern industrial worker.    Automation and exportation of jobs, along with the specialization, professionalization and automation of warfare means the common man is no longer needed for either production or warfare.

In many if not most ""Western"" countries, they have a social democracy, not a constitutional democracy, in that they don't emphasize freedom of Religion, freedom of the individual, etc, but instead prioritize the needs of the Society at hand.  So, in much of Asia, they have actually an importance in freedom of religion, but not so much in way of freedom of the individual, as it wasn't historically the issue as it was with the Founding Fathers. An Asian history specialist would be able to inform more about the politico-cultural history of the region, but by and large don't confuse socioeconomics with cultural ideals and values, which is what you are doing predominately.

And that is why i specified the difference between constitutional democracy and social democracy.  As far as perpetuation of ideals, they can't be replicated like a commercial product given these ""Set A"" of circumstances, such as large middle class, etc, IMO.

Relatively superficially, most would agree that fashion as it relates to feminism and female empowerment is a relatively personal thing and women should feel free to wear whatever is empowering and appropriate in their own eyes, societal and gender norms be damned.    But fashion is inextricably intertwined with both societal and gender norms.  An outfit one woman feels empowered and confident in is degrading and objectifying to another, while the reverse can of course be similarly true.  Nor is the outfit a given women wears what she might choose to be wearing in a different world or under other circumstances.  Some feminists empower themselves by flaunting and enjoying the power their sexuality gives them while other womens' sexuality is exploited in a degrading and objectifying manner ... but the outfit looks real similar if you see them on the train home at the end of the day.    But that so far is all staying relatively individualistic in its scope.  The mess really comes in when people start judging others' values based on their outfit and some very limited context.    It is a perfectly valid feminist position that most western women's fashion is objectifying and subsequently contributing to patriarchal culture - clothes that aim show off physical appearance traits rather than aim to convey impressions or status.  I've heard it very convincingly argued that conventional womens fashion predominately focuses on flattering assets and masking defects to create a ""beauty trope"" illusion, while conventional mens fashion is more focused on creating an impression of success, stature, authority, or power than it is focused on flaunting traditionally masculine assets.    It's just as valid a position that fashion informed by notions of modesty or chastity are disempowering women by reinforcing cultures where women's value is tied more to their virginity or virtue than any particular acquired or personal traits.  Similarly, that those cultures are very directly contributing to ""rape culture"" by enshrining the notion that men are mindless sex-beasts unable to resist the slightest temptation of the flesh into fundamental values of cultural fashion.    So Islamist feminists see Western women as dominated and objectified by their own fashion ""choices"", while Western feminists see Islamist women as dominated and repressed by an oppressive patriarchy.  In each case, they're sort of correct in some ways and sort of incorrect in others and in neither case is it safe to make absolute statements about any individual based on what they're wearing but in all cases the culture is to some degree male-dominated and the fashion directly informed by that male-dominated society and no one is really making their fashion choices genuinely independent of the culture they exist within."

InsightfulQuestions,3586z9,mazzzeffect,0,Fri May 8 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"If you are wondering if there's such a thing as Islamic feminism, you had better ask Muslim women, don't you think? It's ironic that people deprive us of agency precisely by ignoring us in this way. Humans can speak for themselves, and I resent the condescension in comments and entire ""feminist"" subs that Muslim women can't think for themselves any more than ""Western"" women, as if Western women are particularly objective, mentally endowed, or any less influenced by their cultures. Muslim women were at the forefront of revolutions, for crying out loud. The answer is, of course there is Muslim feminism, as there will be women noticing and acting anywhere there are injustices or inequities, whether that is violence, undue constraints or burdens, suppressed rights. Firsthand experience of injustice is quite a teacher, let me tell you, and the practical realities of life reveal the gaps in a lot of interpretations favorable to one class, gender, or race, making it obvious where people have elevated their lifestyles to prescribed religion or haven't consulted with or interacted with people of X race, class, gender to determine the effect of a scholar's ruling on people's lives. There are also Muslim women remarkably similar to non-Muslim women who say they don't need feminism. Human diversity.   I will tell you that Muslim feminists face even more obstacles because they must also deal with racism -yes, racism, not prejudice or anything else. Do you picture a white Muslim? Thank you, media. Because our identity is often under attack, this sometimes leads to screams from Muslim men of ""traitor"" when women try to bring problems to light, in addition to resistance to new viewpoints. The former is somewhat similar to trends in the Black community.   I'm Muslim, female, and a feminist. I don't really want to evaluate non-Muslim women and Western clothing trends because I don't like positioning myself as separate from the West -I'm Arab American- and because I don't believe in dismissing other women. Muslim or not, they're my sisters too. Sexuality and the body is a very nuanced and complicated discussion even between Muslims from different ethnicities, nationalities, classes, generations, and religiosity, etc., much less between non-Muslims and Muslims. There are disadvantages and advantages, setbacks and advances for each subject. Culture is constantly evolving. Do I think that it's questionable that women's clothes are sexualized and men's are not in the West? Maybe. Does it betray immediately, rather than on further evaluation, valuing women more on appearance than other assets? Maybe. (This is dependent on the beholder. No one should be thought less of because of what they wear. There's also the question of expression, etc.) The Aesthetics' preference for edited bodies and body ideals never really caught fire in other regions of the world. It may be a pressing issue in the West, among other issues, but the dress code is not nearly as concerning for Muslims -or viewed as a problem at all- compared to other issues for women (and others) that are not so visible. Pointing at hijab is the lazy, ignorant way out. Most Muslim-majority countries do not mandate hijab; yet they have plenty of problems. Hijab would not fix them nor has secularism alone fixed them. Although, yes, it does help when one can actually argue law, which is difficult when one interpretation is determined to be divinely ordained and particularly when the authenticity of hadith, upon which much law is predicated, is not nearly so cut and dry as many Muslims would prefer. Working justice systems, rather than bribable individuals, would be nice and a legislature with power. Better literacy and education in rural areas, less child labor, more economic opportunity, more infrastructure to help women.   ETA: Check out Malaysian feminism, grassroots feminism in Egypt, etc."

InsightfulQuestions,35508m,extasytj,8,Thu May 7 03:52:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know a lot about managment, but I read an interesting book recently, called Quiet: the power of introverts. It talked a bit about different management styles, and how it was typical for introverts to see the people they were managing as their equals to a greater degree, and work with them instead of bossing them around.    Like the other poster said, I think the most important thing is to eliminate the arrogance on the part of the manager, and get the workers to appreciate the manager's skills. If the manager realizes the workers have skillsets the manager doesn't, they'll be more open to taking advice from the workers on how tasks should be done. In addition, if the manager isn't trying to tell the workers how to do their job, they'll be more likely to appreciate the manager's skillset regarding allocation of resources and who should work on what when. Arrrogant managers is probably one of the easiest ways to get a toxic work environment.    A way to push this in the right direction could be to arrange for the crew to go eat some pastries together once a week. A sort of laidback ""meeting"" where everyone can discuss the current project without the hierarchy in place and throw out any wild idea they want without being blown off. Granted, it's easier said than done to get this kind of atmosphere in the ""meeting"".    In the end it's probably going to be on the manager to ""lower"" themself to the workers' level so that they feel the manager is adding skills to the team, not just getting in the way of their skills."

They did not need someone more technical, they just needed someone who could do the job right.  The biggest thing is that if you aren't technical, you don't actually know the ins and outs of what your employees are doing. Trust them and listen to them, if you don't then you should replace them with employees you do. Do not view them as tools that you are using to get job done, they have knowledge about what is going on that you probably can't do your job as effectively without access to.  Not having that knowledge doesn't make you a failure as a manager because you have a team ready to consult with on the pieces you don't know, and the fact is that a lot of teams don't want to do the managerial work. They want to do their jobs. It means that you have access to something that can help you be better at your job and you should take advantage of that. It also shows that you respect your employees will make them respect you a lot more too.  I'm not sure exactly what you're managing, but this paragraph is mainly applicable to something very technical like software development. Work with the team to smooth over the details of upcoming work and to set time frames. They know what works and have a rough idea for how long thing will take and if something is actually possible or not, and it's a huge waste of time for them to not be consultant somewhat during planning to make sure what is coming up is feasible. Though over time you can get better at it, unless you have some technical experience the fact is you're probably just never going to know the subtle differences between what is possible and not possible to do."

InsightfulQuestions,35182y,extasytj,17,Wed May 6 06:52:12 2015 UTC,"Most intelligence tests measure between 1 and 5 of the following factors:    Crystallized intelligence - Information that you have learned somewhere along the way, like what ""frangible"" means. Typically assessed through verbal methods like Q & A, so sometimes called 'verbal' intelligence. Fluid intelligence - The ability to solve problems that you've never seen before, like finding the next element of a pattern you've never seen. Essentially, this is a measure of how many times you need to be exposed to something before you ""get"" it. Typically assessed through nonverbal methods like puzzles and pictures, so sometimes called 'nonverbal' intelligence. Visual-spatial intelligence - The ability to manipulate objects in your environment to achieve a specific goal (independent of your actual motor skills or hand-eye coordination). Typically assessed through building and drawing-type tasks.  Working memory - The ability to keep information ""in mind"" while working, like hanging on to all of the elements of a math problem when adding 3 digit numbers in your head. This sounds like a weird thing to include in intelligence, but you are better at solving problems if you can mentally ""hang on"" to all of the moving parts of the problem at once.  Processing speed - How quickly you can complete tasks. Brains that are faster are usually wired in a way that makes them more efficient, so speed is a rough measure of how well-organized and efficient your brain is (just like running speed is a rough measure of overall health).    Different IQ tests measure more or less of these factors, and some (like the Woodcock-Johnson) measure a bunch of other factors too like long-term memory, but basically these are the main high points hit by a lot of IQ tests. These factors are typically combined in various ways to get your overall ""IQ"" score. In the general population, the factors tend to be highly correlated -- which makes sense if you think about it. If you are good at ""getting"" things quickly, you'll have high fluid IQ, and will have learned lots of things through small amounts of exposure, which will lead to high crystallized IQ, and you'll be fast, which will show up as high processing speed, etc. Of course, for some individuals, these are not correlated -- someone who ""gets"" things quickly but has had no educational opportunities may have a high fluid IQ but low crystallized IQ. Another person who is high on some of the factors might be very anxious, which reduces their processing speed. Etc. But in general, the factors are highly correlated, so measuring one factor provides a good rough estimate of all the others.   In any case, IQ tests are meant to be a behavioral sample of these skills. They present a standardized way to obtain enough behavior to comprehensively and reliably measure all of these skills, in a way that is exactly the same for each person. IQ tests are not meant to be an exhaustive measure of everything the person knows and can do -- they are supposed to be a quick and relatively objective way to estimate what the person knows and can do. (Although they are not meant to measure everything the person knows and can do -- they are only meant to be an estimate of how easily and efficiently the person can ""get"" things (solve a problem; learn something well enough to use it later; etc)).   There are other formal (some) and informal (many) ways to estimate the same skills. For example, standardized achievement tests like the SAT are objective and a good rough estimator of crystallized knowledge, and your speed when you're playing DDR or some similar rhythm game are semi-objective and good rough estimator of your processing speed. Informal things like watching someone solve a mystery or seeing how many numbers they can hold onto at once or noticing what vocabulary words they use in everyday conversations are all informal rough estimates of some of the skills described above.   The problem with these informal methods is that they are not objective. That is, they don't present each person with the same stimuli, time limits, sample items, etc, and the scores are not normed against same-age peers with similar backgrounds. Since an IQ test is meant to be an objective measure of the skills that we define as intelligence, your question is really asking ""what are objective measures to assess intelligence outside of objective measures to assess intelligence?""  If there were such things, they would be called... IQ tests."

Current IQ tests demonstrate a high degree of repeatability and internal consistency, but whether or not they are the best or most ideal measures of intelligence is certainly open for debate. How we measure intelligence depends entirely on how we define it and how we define it determines the outcomes of our measurements.  As far as determining what intelligence is, the field of psychology would argue that modern IQ tests represent our best understanding of the various factors that make up intelligence and how those factors can be quantified. Of course whether or not you find this compelling depends on whether or not you find the APA's definitions satisfactory. Do they measure what they set out to measure? Yes. Is that intelligence?

It makes a lot more sense for me to choose to ""Cooperate"" than to ""Defect"" in your paper's example. It seems more rational to me to have $6 total than to have $5 alone. Before I make a choice I would consider the effect of me getting $5 and the other person getting none because in that case the other person would have preferred to ""Cooperate"" and may not choose the same in the future. The economic principle of most for myself does not seem to be the most rational to me. (And I studied Econ. in college, believe me when I say I studied enough theory.)"
InsightfulQuestions,34i5d6,hpdeskjet6940,2,Mon May 4 00:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yes but the real problem comes when the opponent/partner expects you to behave as a rational actor, i.e. to maximize your personal wealth. In that case, he is certain to defect, not because he is greedy but because he expects you to be greedy. In fact, he does not even need to expect that; he only needs to believe that you will believe that he will believe that you will believe... ...that one of you will be inclined to defect. Even this abstract inkling of doubt causes the downward spiral into the game's only Nash equilibrium: mutual defection.   These forces get even stronger when there are more than two players, and when the players are not face-to-face, and when their battleground is abstract rather than concrete (cash-based). And all of these conditions occur simultaneously in real-life economic situations."

My problem is with the assumption that it is always in an individual's best interest to maximize their own well-being. I hold that it is not. Often? Sure. Always? No.  So if you grant that forces are very different and much more complex in real life, you must see that it's impossible to reach the same conclusion every time. I'm not insisting that your interpretation is wrong, or that mine is correct, absolutely nothing of the sort. All I'm saying is that the Prisoner's Dilemma operates under assumptions that may not be as universally applicable outside the thought experiment. In fact, it makes the thought experiment that much more valuable since it lets me and you come to slightly different conclusions based on our own values and assumptions."

Personally I am more into challenging thought experiments that challenge the current established ideas. These help me to understand physics. Like:   What if the wave-function of quantum physics is causing the Lorentz transformation, and all other effects of relativity. The established idea assumes that relativity is an independent phenomenon, partially due to historical reasons.     Economical: What if there was no money? What if there was no police?

InsightfulQuestions,34i5d6,exosequitur,1 point,Fri May 1 19:59:58 2015 UTC,"The thought experiments in physics are really interesting. I only know about a few popular ones (Schrodinger's cat, Einstein's twins, etc.). Could you try to explain, preferably in ELI5 language, how your thoughts about relativity give you some insights.  I do know that there's an answer to the question, ""What if there was no money?"" And it's always that we'll define something to become money. As far as I know, only very small groups of people (maybe a few tribes, etc.) survive without any ""money."" Once trade b/w cultures begins the concept of money is quickly integrated."
InsightfulQuestions,34i5d6,exosequitur,1 point,Fri May 1 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Entanglement Entanglement in Quantum Physics shows that at two points A and B the same information appears at the same time, during a measurement. This is described by the wave function equation of Schrödinger. We know this works, because it is necessary to conserve momentum in a system.  Relativity Einstein says that when energy goes A to B, this energy moves with the speed of light in the form of particles. But we never see those particles unless they leave or arrive. He also says that this speed of light is independent of the speed of A and the speed of B. Which leads to a complex mathematical formula. In this maths, we can see a change in length, in mass, and in time. This again gives all kinds of paradoxes.  But there is already something at A and B according to quantum physics. It is the wavefunction. We know that from entanglement. So whenever we try to combine both relativity and quantum physics we get some kind of conflict. Currently scientists are assuming that quantum physics is affected by relativity in the same way as large objects.  But, what if But, what if quantum physics is causing relativity as a side-effect. Mass and time seem certainly related to quantum physics.     1) Mass could be related to the amount of entanglement in a system. It is certainly related to momentum.    2) The measurement of Time can be done in the amount of quantum interactions.   Relativity can be described from a direct connection between A and B without any problems. In math: R= Function(A,B)  Because quantum physics is the basis of everything, it is only logical to assume that it is also the basis of relativity.  Consequences The consequence of doing this is greater than you may think.   1) Relativity could become much simpler. It is just a description of the speed of an energy connection between A and B.  2) No more paradoxes.  3) It does not need the mythical Multiverse theory anymore.   4) Time is irreversible, just as we know it is.  5) If relativity is different, some theories about gravity will be different too.  Problems The problems that I found with this theory are on the gravity level. The measurements of gravity seem to conflict with quantum physics. So many scientists don't go this way.    But these measurements of gravity are very inaccurate compared to quantum physics. The gravity constant G is changing every year or so.  So if I follow my line of thought, I assume that these measurements are telling something else: that the model that we have for gravity is incomplete.    And with an incomplete model, I start to look at scientists that observed problems with the current model. But sadly they are heretics of science.. Their measurements do seem to confirm that a direct linear connection between A and B, instead of a bent space connection.   Also I found other explanations for examples where many scientists think that time and space is bending.    Conclusion My conclusion is that science has gone into one theoretical direction for a long time, and it would not be bad for it to revise its theoretical basis. But I don't think that it can, because scientists want to go forward, not backwards. Even when going forward maintains slightly wrong theories."

InsightfulQuestions,34gsh4,slappymcnutface,3,Fri May 8 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"I think about this sort of stuff a lot, and here are a few thoughts I've had:   First off, national boundaries will likely always exist. A nation is a group of people with unifying culture. The modern version of a nation-state is a relatively recent invention, and works only by establishing states (which are fickle, impermanent things) around already existing nations. A single world-spanning state would have to encompass all the nations there are out there, so it could not reasonably be expected to resemble a nation-state. A loose (con)federation like the UN or EU would be more likely than the more closely held centralized government of any given well-established state. In general, a flexible governing structure would likely have greater popular support. Second, for the sake of stability it should probably have an opt-out. I'm reasoning that having such a place would be good since objectors to the way of things could always leave. Some landmass, a continent say, which would be explicitly outside of the global government. Em- and Immigration between the two would have to be pretty easy, otherwise it'd be defeating its purpose. The sensitive point would have to be being very sensitive to the formation of a us-vs-them political dynamic between the two. Third, some serious cosmopolitanism would be in order. Cosmopolitan = citizen of the world. As in, there'd need to be a very strong culture of belonging to humanity, in addition to whatever other group inclusions people may have (and mind you, identifying as e.g. French would still be a thing, but more in a cultural sense). So children would be taught world history in addition to the more conventional national history. Fourth, I think it'd mostly come about from a growing global class. The global class already exists; it's composed of people who don't identify strongly with a particular country, of people who may change countries for their convenience. That class has more in common with each other than they do with fellow compatriots in their nation. They have friends spread across the world, and travel regularly, and have non-localized careers. Arguably, they already live in a single world government, but one with very little authority. It's not what most people think of when they think of one world government, but I think it's the most accurate way of thinking of the rise. As the global class grows in size, influence, and geographic indifference, their worldview will start to approximate that of a single global state closer and closer. It may not even be necessary for an actual government to follow suit to get an equivalent world. Fifth, I imagine that eventually there'll be identity cards that take care of citizenship, credit cards, rewards programs, certifications, authorizations etc... A lot of people aren't going to like that idea, but it's so much more practical than the alternative. It'd probably be necessary for such a service to be managed by a paragovernment to make it (a) acceptable to the general public, and (b) to allow for strong protections against the government. What do I mean by strong protections? I mean that the government couldn't access private information without the citizen's consent, and withholding consent would have to protected by something similar to the fifth amendment. Six, a military will likely always exist, even if there weren't really any human 'enemies' per se. Their work would mostly involve things like disaster response. Actual peace would be enforced by economic interdependence, like it already is today. Seven, separatist / independence movements will always be a thing. Young, idealistic wannabe revolutionaries will always be a thing. 'Domestic' (Cosmic) terrorism will always be a thing. A liberal global government can handle the first pretty well, by allowing sections to nationalize without their necessarily moving outside of it. The latter two will fall under police-type matters, but will primarily be kept at bay only by good economic conditions; similarly to how it is today. Eight, the welfare structures we typically associate with goverment, like a basic income, education, and welfare are probably not going to be administered at the global level, at least not for a long time. I can only really see them unifying in response to arbitrage. Nine, I'd personally like to see something more of a task-oriented government, unlike the representative governments we have today. So rather than a person in theory having a representative in some global governing body, the body would assemble taskforces to address problems as they appear. Each taskforce may have representative structures within them, but in this form there wouldn't be a single legislative entity. Ten, it'd be easiest if it had a legal grammar, which would have to 'recognize' all laws. With a legal grammar, the laws of various sub-governments would interface cleanly (or at least deterministically) with each other. It'd specify things like the source of authority for a law, as well as the implementation details. With a legal grammar, you could actually relax restrictions on e.g. who gets to propose new legislation. It would also be more easily machine readable, which would allow for proper analysis and things like having a computer lawyer or legal aide.   That's off the top of my head, but there may be more later on. Sorry if it's vague and confusing; I'll clarify if you are confused by something.   Eleven, I think it's worth noting that a good global government would be structured across several levels of granularity. E.g. similarly to how the US is organized across federal, state, and municipal levels. Different 'governences' would be handled at different levels, according to their need. The distinction is that rather than forcing everything onto only a set variety of levels, it'd make more sense for it to be organized across as many levels as would be needed. For example, watersheds would be organized into different water districts, and aquifer districts would administer different acquifers. The appropriate size for such districts is most obvious for natural resources than human resources."

A nation is NOT a group of people with a unifying culture.  It is a group of people with unified governance.  All nations have vastly disparate cultures."
InsightfulQuestions,34gsh4,TitaniumDreads,2,Fri May 1 09:54:54 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. I usually separate out consolidated nation-states into a few components: a state, a nation, a government, and a country. The state is the authority and enforces laws and regulations, the government makes the laws and regulations, the nation is a group with unifying culture, and the country is the physical area. The reason why I use unifying culture rather than unifying governance is because it can extend to e.g. the nation of Israel, which includes lots of people who are not in Israel, but merely jewish. All nations do have disparate cultures, but there's typically one that's dominant enough to be ingrained in the governing structure. In the US, for example, that's be WASPs for much of its history. Groups with minority cultures, like Cree Indians or Louisiana Creoles I would argue constitute a sort of nation onto themselves even though they may lack a unifying governance.  In any case, there probably isn't a 'right' definition, just ones with different uses. Someone who professionally studies political science could maybe lend a hand if they pass by here."

Sure the legal definition of free speech is that you won't be arrested for something you say.  But I think that makes assumptions about the world as it really works.  For one thing, in the days of the founders, most people were either farmers or skilled workers or shop owners.  In the essence, you could call them more or less self employed.  There was little threat that a slip of the tongue in the pub would make them unemployable-- they were their own bosses.  That's not true today.  Today, few people are self employed, so the majority are at the mercy of the employer.  That creates another coercive power that a person might reasonably fear to speak against-- the employer.  If you lose your job, you have a major problem, you are at risk of losing everything, and worse, if you have a hard time finding a new job, you might join the ranks of the unemployable.    Imagine two countries.  In A, the government will arrest you for opposing the majority religion publicly.  In B, criticizing the religion will mean losing your job and being unable to find another one if people find out what you said.  Imagine that you live in A, you wouldn't say anything against the religion.  But then in B you would be in exactly the same position.  You're no freer in a country with legal free speech and a corporate culture that punishes certain opinions than you are in a country that will arrest you for the wrong opinion.  You are not free to speak if you're afraid that your mere opinion is going to hurt you.  If I'm afraid of angering someone with power over me with my words, I self censor, I don't talk about ""dangerous"" topics, I don't give opinions in public places.  If asked I don't answer truthfully.    Neither of the above are good for a republic.  We have to have a safe place to debate ideas or the republic is totalitarian-- only the ""orthodox"" position is safe to hold, and unless you're a serious contrarian, you'll never consider an idea outside of the mainstream."

This is what people are implicitly using when they lecture you that ""lol free speech doesn't protect you from being fired over hating gays"".  2) Moral principle of free speech, in ""people should feel free to express controversial ideas without fear of reprisal beyond refutation"".  This is a stronger sense of free speech, which regards it as a ""bad thing"" for people to get fired over what they say, because it makes them less likely to express controversial-but-good ideas when they have them[1], which results in them never being expressed.  [1] ""Hating gays"" isn't what is meant by a good idea, but it's often hard to tell the difference between crazy-good and crazy-bad ideas without public debate."

InsightfulQuestions,349z4a,likechoklit4choklit,2,Wed Apr 29 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"the fundamental lattice upon which that law was built. What were they trying to protect?   This is just my current view, based on my current understanding, which is likely incomplete. I would say that one thing they (the founding fathers,) were trying to protect was themselves, their money, and their power.  In the early years of the United States, with a few exceptions, men who did not own land, and women were not allowed to vote. Voting rights were determined by the states, and not specifically delineated in the Constitution.  To keep non-voting members of society from rebelling, (and to keep any political adversary from being able to limit and therefore punish anyone who criticized them,) there had to be basic protections which everyone could agree on and would take a major effort to change. I suspect that since nobody in power wanted to be subjected to limits on their own speech, they agreed not to limit anyone else's. So, it was enshrined in the Constitution.  This also had the added benefit of giving those who could not vote, the sense that they could air their grievances and have a voice in political outcomes. Of course, there have to be truly massive uprisings and threat of great upheaval to the financial powers that be, to really get noticed.  We can see how this plays out today. Even though we know that the general public has little to no effect on federal governance, and that our votes are relatively meaningless given the limited choices of corporate owned candidates, we still think we can change something by organizing and protesting, etc.   Unfortunately, that stuff is mostly ignored by our leaders in government. Still, they know without it, we would have rebelled in a much bigger way a long time ago.  If you're talking about free speech on a personal Political level, there should never be any limits, in my opinion. Any limit would favor one side over the other, and open the door to additional limits. Though, to limit money is a different thing than to limit speech, and unfortunately, the conflation of the two has brought us to our current state of dysfunction.  Unfortunately, as our government gets bought up and our public services become privatized, free speech has become more and more limited in some ways. Non-governmental entities can create their own rules ""to protect their shareholders,"" and they regularly do. They get the politicians they bought to back up their union busting efforts, they control what you can say about them by controlling your access to a livelihood through firing, and they use the court system to financially ruin those who speak out against them, but don't have access to the same amount of financial resources to keep the fight going.  Since we are addicted to their products and they have greater control over our services (information, water, incarceration, utilities, transportation, some schooling, etc.) they hold a tremendous amount of power, like a drug dealer does over a junkie. So, we can't speak out against them without reprecussions of some kind. This is the slippery slope to plutocracy.  On a personal individual level, free speech is not just a right, but a responsibility. To just say what you want to say to anyone in earshot, has consequences. So, one should use this power wisely. If you have something important to say, you should think about how, where, and when you choose to express it. Sometimes it's necessary to make some people feel uncomfortable, in order to speak up for others. Still, one should try to keep in mind the thought of trying to get others to come over to one's point of view, and be careful not to alienate those who could be ones allies.  Edit: spelling"

If we allow free speech, whistle blowers should be allowed to speak freely about state secrets, but we've already seen that isn't true. So does it only mean we have free speech as long as it doesn't reveal government secrets? That's how groups like Westboro are allowed to exist anyway, right?

InsightfulQuestions,342mcv,skwacky,18,Mon Apr 27 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"Let me be the first to link to this video about the single transferable vote. The STV system of voting is probably the best possible system of voting available to us. It's not too difficult to implement, and it's also easy to explain to voters. Voters need to do is to rank the candidates in order of preference, that's all. I think it would be a great way to get past the partisan politics in modern democracies, especially the US. Right now, if the voter doesn't vote for R or D, then the vote is basically wasted. With STV voting, independent candidates get a shot at being elected instead of always being outliers.  Your idea to have voters take a test before being allowed to vote, though well-intended, is not a good idea. An obvious problem is that it would disproportionately affect those who are less educated about politics, or those with little/poor formal education. I grant that having a test would educate them about government, but it would become an additional barrier in the voting process. There's the additional problem of how the program would be funded, who would administer the test (and how fairly), at what point would a potential voter pass the test, etc.  Other ideas to encourage voting are things like compulsory voting the way it'd done in Australia. If a voter doesn't show up to vote, there's a small monetary fine ~ $25, I think. And even at the voting station, the voter is also able to register a no vote - it's only required that the voter show up and inform the officials of their presence. I do support this idea, though there are drawbacks to this as well. It's another thing that the government can force its citizens to do, though I think that it is important enough for it."

Your proposed solution brings more problems. Who decides the curriculum? What about issues like the anti-vax movement? Or climate change? Should each side get a say in what's on the test? And most importantly, the stuff that governments actually do, the fine print stuff - legal documents, drafts, committee meetings, none of it interests the average voter. People vote for the candidate(I wish it weren't so), not for the candidate's policy. Take the presidential debates - the only things discussed are social issues, even foreign policy is given simple narratives. Is it really possible to educate someone about Iran's nuclear program? Why is the US eager to reach an agreement while Israel --it's close ally-- is against any agreement.  It would be a better idea to promote independent research, like Politifact than to waste a tremendous amount of time and money explaining issues to the electorate every time there's an election. Remember, the issues would change every time. A new curriculum would be required for each election.  It's taken an immense amount of social progress to give everyone the right to vote. To revoke it would be catastrophic. The most stupid thing that Steven Levitt has written is that a vote is statistically irrelevant (I'm assuming your source is the author of Freakonomics), which isn't true.

In this example they do it because it counts as one more conviction - one more point on their tracking statistics in an effort to show that they are doing their job.   If you don't want to use that example law, make it something corporate. Your friend emails you the new taylor swift song, and then you both get popped for piracy. Or they go through the GPS data in your phone or car and find that you made an illegal U-Turn on a deserted street 2 days ago and decide to send you the ticket now that they've noticed. In general, if you start to show up on the radar of a corrupt police force with your information, they can do things to make your life hell. Let's say your new SO has a pissed off ex who's a cop, and they decide to start sending police to your door at all hours of the day to look for something to arrest you on. Then you have to deal with the stigma of them showing up at work (that might make your boss suspicious of you as a whole) or they go through your phone and threaten to send nudes of yourself to your boss, or they start pulling you over and ticketing you for any infraction they think they can get - yeah you can fight them in court, but every ticket becomes a court date, and then you have to deal with that.   Yes these are all 'extreme' or 'niche' examples that 'won't apply to the average joe' - but that's not an argument for generally increasing everyone's chances of getting shit on for something. It's like saying ""Yeah I live in a war zone but I've never seen anyone get shot in front of me"". It's not going to make the world a safer or sunnier place just because police have more power/intelligence. It puts everyone on lockdown and creates a power structure where nepotism gets people ahead, and everyone trying to get by is a potential casualty."
InsightfulQuestions,33vsta,KarunchyTakoa,1 point,Thu May 14 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I have seen someone ""shot in the face"", in that I personally know people who are targeted by police, and unfortunately the police already have more than enough power to make someone's life difficult.  The NSA program doesn't change that, or bear any relevance to it. I think your position reveals some ignorance to how the program and our laws work. The NSA doesn't communicate with local law enforcement unless it is to pursue an interest of theirs. They don't open their databases to anyone outside their agency, even agencies like the CIA and FBI, as it's not their jurisdiction and they all compete for clout.   Even if they did, none of that information could be submitted in trial, and police would have to use it to find new evidence. Take into account how extreme and irrelevant your cases are (Sodomy laws have been unconstitutional since 2003, and torrents are already inherently trackable), and you understand what would be the much more typical case. Some guy keeps complaining to his friends about his wife, makes jokes about killing her, which turn into substantial threats and plans. The police are prepared. Gang members text each other about some beef or shooting that just occurred or is about to occur, and the police have plausible suspects. Still, none of this evidence could be used against citizens in court.   This is all of course assuming the program works in a way that it doesn't. All the arguments I've seen to the dangers of this program have to either A) Allude to some extreme case that's vague, unrealistic or pure fantasy, or B) Makes false assumptions about how the program works.    EDIT: Should add C) because it's been used twice in this thread, and that's to argue against things that are not the NSA program."

They all share budgetary councils and board members and workers, so you can have a CIA agent working in the FBI next to a DEA  agent whose weekends are in the NSA. To say that those people don't share information with each other is a complete lie, not to mention all of their reports end up going to the same sources for review - a senate council or a presidential group.   Here's a pdf produced by the Department of Justice and the FBI and CIA specifically for local cops with ""tips and tricks"" that local police can use that the national agencies use.   ""Since 9/11, new regional intelligence centers have been created, or are in the process of being developed, to deal with counterterrorism.  In several cases, the RIC is funded by the DHS, yet in other cases local and county governments are bearing the costs.  While counterterrorism is what stimulated the growth of RICs, as a general rule these are “all crime centers.”  That is, the centers perform the intelligence function on trans-jurisdictional and organized crime as well as terrorism.  To enhance this function, the FBI Field Intelligence Groups are also supporting the RICs"" - straight off page 141 of the book.  Here's another pamphlet that says the same thing. Second paragraph of page 8 - ""Analysts who have been told for years that releasing certain types of information violates the law  must now be strongly encouraged to exchange the inf ormation with others."" A stupid 10 page booklet literally says get your intel guys to break the law.  On top of all this, you keep referring to 'The NSA program' as if they only do one thing. They have separate programs for collecting and analyzing data from everyone on the planet.   https://projects.propublica.org/nsa-grid/  There's one for all cellphone calls/data, another for pc data, another for cellphone location data, one for GPS data. You can say they only do this to foreign people, but that's bullshit from the jump. Cellphone data is collected off Americans as well as the GPS location data. Everything in that grid that is ""foreign"" is everything that touches a server outside of the U.S. - if you go to the guardianUK.com they can scan your pc. Or, better yet, they just have to share their info with GCHQ, the British version, because to them you're foreign.  Now, onto the whole court thing. None of this information has to hold up in court. They use this information to make something that can hold up in court. Let's use this site. If reddit's servers get child porn uploaded to them, and you get redirected to a link of that thread, you go onto a list. If the fbi decides to ""crack down on child porn"", all they have to do is cherry pick some names off that list, go through the data and show the court ""Yes he visited the page with the incriminating evidence on this date at this time"" and shut down your attempts to say it was a mistake or was only for 2 seconds or whatever.  This whole security thing isn't really about whether you personally give a shit about other people reading your texts. It's about giving the right to the government as a whole. Because maybe you don't care that someone in an office can follow your life like a data-based version of the truman show, but maybe your kid might care. And they won't be in any position to make or change the decision if it is allowed now. If you don't have qualms with this, what do you think of doxxing? What makes doxxing any different - because some guy with a nametag has your info instead of your twitter followers?  The police have an incredible amount of power these days and you claiming that ""the NSA has no bearing or relevance"" to that is simply untrue and a dangerous assertion. It's not dangerous to you, it's dangerous to the shit we spout off about in this country about being 'free' and 'loyal' and 'brave'. Data collection doesn't do shit to prevent crimes, it just gives police an excuse to lock a random person up and mark a win without trying so hard."

Your local police are notified and use parallel construction to build a case against you and you end up in jail for something that, in the past, nobody would have ever known happened.  Since you ask what the worst thing is, let's take it one a lot of steps further: the police serving the warrant perform a no-knock raid at 3:30 in the morning. They don't identify themselves as police as they bang on your bedroom door. After you hesitate to open the door for more than 4 seconds, they open fire and kill your wife and child who were also in the room, and injure you. They frame you as having resisted arrest and attempted to assault an officer with a weapon and the bodycam that the police were wearing is not introduced as evidence in court because it had a potential malfunction (some scanlines were seen obstructing your face for 1/25 of a second).

The NSA will have information on everyone to ruin their reputation or even put them in jail or simply blackmail them. This can include politicians and otherwise influental people. Even IF someone was completly clean they could simply plant or create false evidence and nobody would ever really know. Even if you think you are clean, what about your family or your boss or whatever? It is simply not true that you have nothing to hide. If someone like Snowden was able to get away with all these documents, then what is to say someone else won't be able to get away with stealing your credit card information or selling other personal information to a third party for money? Let's face some facts... the ""war on terror"" and the ""war on drugs"" has greatly eroded away the freedom of the common people. The police force in america is getting more and more militarized with armored vehicles, big lethal weapons, etc. and they can get away with more and more otherwise illegal activities. We have seen police get away with murder, rape, theft and other things. We also know that money has a HUGE influence on the politics of the US, this is not a conspiracy. Now imagine if the US would descend into some kind of totalitarion facist state ruled by a couple of rich and powerful families. How would you even attempt to raise any kind of resistence? You cannot use the internet, there're cameras and maybe soon drones everywhere. Every phone call or text message you send is recorded. The goverment will have an easy time labeling you a terrorist for thinking to go against the state, the ruling class, the wealthy power elite. (and don't think something like that could never happen or was never attempted before.)   And what IF one day we have the technology to monitor thoughts or intentions? What IF one day all physical money disappears and we only use digital currency which the goverment will have an easy time to freeze. What IF one day we will be required to have a chip installed in our body that serves as a GPS, a monitor, a credit card, an ID card etc. And what IF one day the goverment decides it would be neat if these chips would be able to incapitate someone at the press of a button?

One could argue that many of the conflicts of the middle-east and the modern era's problems with terrorism are caused by ramifications cold warfare.  If the US, Russia, China, etc were able to duke it out in a more open fashion there would be less propping up of dictatorships, funding for terrorist organizations and need for oversized surveillance networks.  Instead of large periodic wars, one gets slower more insidious warfare that is more or less constant.  So yes fewer 'big wars', but at the price of a more generalized lowlevel kind of constant war against 'hidden enemies' we currently find ourselves in."

InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,RustyRook,88,Mon Apr 20 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"There are millions of disabled people who live on the margins of society, sometimes languishing for years while waiting for services to survive and research for cures. If the general public was aware of the additional suffering some of the disabled suffer, on top of their physical challenges, they would be horrified.   Applying for disability services is demoralizing for many, glacially slow, and produces a financial existence that is tenuous at best. Waiting lists for disability housing are incredibly long. Young and sick adults are often forced to live in nursing homes with the aged, when their families cannot provide care (which can be very depressing when one still has a lot of time to live). Long-term care environments for non-elderly disabled people are few and far between.  Research funding for many illnesses is woefully inadequate. People who could be living productive lives where they contribute to society (which is what they want more than anything), are left to suffer in silence in homes all around you, and you have no idea. They lay in beds, or peer out of windows, and talk to you on message boards, desperate for human contact. They are even more desperate for answers, but research for many chronic conditions are pushed aside for more lucrative pharmaceutical endeavors, like baldness cures and boner pills.  I'd like to say this will be the next front in the human rights struggle toward equality for all. Unfortunately, I know from experience, that things which remain out of sight are also out of mind. If only we could get up and get out and march for our freedom, we would show you how many and how desperate we are. But, we are stuck just surviving, barely and depressingly, like shadows of people. We fight to survive and to be happy and to be heard and seen, but we can't do it alone. We need your help.  Edit: I went to sleep last night, and woke up to GOLD! Thank you so much!"

InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,JustMeRC,6,Tue Apr 21 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing such a moving answer. I'm glad the internet exists so that it gives some sort of outlet for communication while progress is being slowly made. I have a couple of questions for you: 1) Could you provide a summary of disabilities in the general population, by country, as well as by type of disability so that I can get informed; 2) How can I help?"
InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,captainjess,7,Tue Apr 21 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the gold! I'm glad my post resonated with you. I'm especially glad if it brings more attention to the global problem of disability rights. I'll try to answer your second question first, though I am not an expert in disability rights advocacy, just a person in a bed.  Disabled people are the largest minority population in the world. Most people will become disabled at some point in their life, so it behooves all of us to get involved in some way, if only out of self-interest.  Of course, some people face disability challenges for larger portions of their lives. The barriers to human rights are many and varied. It is easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of issues which need attention. However, the problems are far from insurmountable, and everyone who is interested in helping can get involved in some way, whether on a personal, local, state (province, etc), national, or global level.  On a personal level, look around and notice how you interact with people who are disabled. Do you have co-workers, neighbors, church members, etc, who are disabled? Are there ways you can reach out to them or their care-givers, to ask if they need help with something, or simply develop an authentic friendship? This can be a very rewarding way to get involved, and can help you learn about some of the pressing issues in a direct hands-on way.  Locally, you can contact your town or county's Social Services office (if you live in the U.S.), to see if you can volunteer to help with any services they provide to the disabled and elderly. Your local library may be able to help you find additional organizations which need help from volunteers on a local level.  In your state (province, etc.),  there are opportunities to work toward legislative goals which improve conditions for the disabled. Some of the many issues of concern include housing, Medicaid funding (or National Health Service allotments), long-term care availability, access, and community services for the disabled.  Educating oneself about the specific legislative initiatives and advocacy groups in one's state begins with a search for [state] disability rights advocate. You can find out about and contact whichever group you think you can lend your time and talents to.  There are many national groups and causes one can get involved with.  A good source to begin with in the U.S. is the National Disability Rights Network. They offer information and links to national, along with more local efforts. ADAPT is an example of a grassroots organization which advocates on national, state and local levels. Since poverty disproportionately impacts the elderly and disabled, joining groups which advocate for the poor also helps the disabled.   Funding for research  is one of the most pressing issues on the national level. There are a myriad of diseases and conditions which cause disability. Adequate funding for medical research and access to affordable adaptability devices, could allow some percentage of the disabled to get better, or improve in health so they can rejoin the world as productive members of society. In the U.S., the Rally for Medical Research brings together advocates from many different diseases and conditions to present a united voice encouraging more funding for medical research. They have a ""how do I get involved"" button you can click on for more info about issues, legislation, and contacting your Senator and member of Congress in support of Medical research funding.  On a global level, the conditions for disabled people around the world are as varying as the countries they live in. Conditions are obviously much worse in war-torn countries, and outside of the developed world. UNICEF, along with the World Health Organization and World Bank, compiled the World Report on Disability in 2011. For anyone who's interested in really digging in to the issue, it's an in depth report. For everyone else who might be curious, but not have the time, there's a great forward that's just one page long, written by Stephen Hawking. You can also watch a short 4 minute video on the report on the Disabled World website.  The Disabled World website offers some statistics on disability rates, if you look to the sidebar on the right. Most of the more detailed statistics available are for the U.S., though one could do a search for statistics in a specific country by doing an internet search for [country] disability statistics. Gathering global information is a much larger task, and hampered by varying conditions which prohibit it, like war and government policy. The United Nations has a page on collecting disability statistics worldwide,  in an effort to target ways forward for advocacy and interventions.  Of course, the fight against global poverty will do much to improve conditions for the disabled all over the world. People with disabilities are the poorest of the poor. They are your grandparents, and parents, siblings, spouses and friends, and neighbors. If you think disability and poverty are somebody else's problem, it's just a matter of time until most of us see it's our problem too.    Here's a general list of many Disability Rights Organizations.  Here's a shameless plug for my own disease, ME/CFS, now known as SEID (Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease). There are many other organizations supporting awareness and research in many countries, besides the one I linked to. Donations to these organizations are greatly appreciated!  I hope other people with disabilities who might see this add their input. Like I said, I'm just one person in a bed. I just did some basic internet searches. Anyone who is interested can get more information if they want to look for it. Thanks to anyone who read this far!  TL/DR- People with disabilities need able bodied advocates to help in the fight to cure conditions, and improve quality of life through access to resources. Anyone can get involved from the personal/local level to the global level, if they just take the time to investigate a little.  Edit: a word"

Interestingly enough, I am a law student who currently works at my state's P&A and is tied to the NDRN. I'm actually about to do a summer internship in another state's P&A to get more valuable experience. Not only that but my father has been a disability rights advocate working on the state wide level for the past 16 years. One of my most fondest memories with my padre was when he took me out of school to go to a rally for the SCOTUS announcement of the Olmstead v. L.C. decision. It's those things that make me jokingly call the disability rights movement the ""family business"".   But I do say, there is a strong shift with the movement as it is going currently. Especially considering the aging of the baby-boomer population, combined with the fact that the current leading advocates are in the baby-boomer generation means there is an exponential need for a focus on disability policy, services, and supports. When you also consider the long past of the disability rights movement (which slowly crawled from the 1800's to 1970, and boomed post-Willowbrook), now is the time to build coalitions and bring these issues to the forefront.  Congress even passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which was a surprise and a half--much credit given to the advocates for make sure it got pushed through.   The time is now. I'm very excited in my attempts to be on the ground floor when the disability rights movement comes into the main spotlight, and that us advocates can achieve so many great things. The time is totally now."

InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,JustMeRC,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"Independent Living Centers. That's the most direct way a person could help out on a local scale, either directly or indirectly.   The good thing about ILC's is that they're not necessarily pure service providers who go into the game for a profit. The ILC's get funding through the feds or through state programs. Actually, this ties to WIOA because it's mixes up how the funding is disbursed and divvied out--but that's just getting uber technical.   But you can directly support by volunteering at events, supporting different programming, direct donation and contributions. You could even get involved and be a member of the board of directors for the ILC, which gives a person some invaluable community board experience and chance to build one's network. A lot of the places you already pointed out have local chapters, like ADAPT or the state DR office (from NDRN). National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) should have a directory of each state's Independent Living Council, and you can look up local centers from there. Even then, once you connect with an ILC, a person could be quickly introduced to the community of disability advocates.   As a side note for yourself, I'm also doing a research paper on the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD), and claiming that as a matter of customary international law through the past 25 years of legislation and jurisprudence of the American's with Disabilities Act and other supporting legislation, that the United States is bound by the CRPD.

InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,axel_val,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"I've only come across the concept of basic income pretty recently, and haven't had the opportunity to really get to understand some of the ins and outs yet. My initial though is that it would depend a lot on the particulars of how it's implemented, but I think it's an interesting idea to consider. Wasn't Sweden thinking of adopting a basic income at some point? Has anyone actually tried it out yet?  I don't see it as a replacement to all social programs, like Medicaid. I don't tend to take the Libertarian view I've seen on it, which seems to eliminate almost all of the social safety nets."

If the general public was aware of the additional suffering the disabled suffer, on top of their physical challenges, they would be horrified.    Why are you generalizingg here? That is the main issue I have with how you're talking about this. I am in a wheelchair, and I know people who are in wheelchairs, and there is no suffering. Maybe  part of it is that most of us have have been in a wheelchair our entire lives so there is no having to adjust to anything, but another part of it is because we have lived our lives purposely and for ourselves. I have literally created my own life, and have become an accomplished person on my own. So, this idea of ""all us disabled people suffering"" doesn't sit well with me because I hate generalization. I wish with all of my heart that you hadn't put all of ""us"" in the same light and opinion.  Yes, I am what you would call ""disabled"", but I am also a woman and a full human being. A lot of handicapped folk can get out and march for what they believe in, whatever that may be. Not all of us are stuck at home doing nothing. I do not want to come across as mean in my comments, because I know of disabled people who can't contribute to society, but because of an added mental disability. People with a physical handicap who have the greatest thing of all (normal intelligence) can achieve things, and shouldn't be stopped. So, discrimination against the majority of the disabled in the workplace is what we should ALL, whichever way we can, fight for.  I hope my thoughts didn't come across as too jumbled, but in a nutshell, this is how I feel. And please, please do not generalize.  Just because this is your situation, doesn't mean it's everyone else's."

People with a physical handicap who have the greatest thing of all (normal intelligence) can achieve things, and shouldn't be stopped.   This is also a generalization.

InsightfulQuestions,33aboh,JustMeRC,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"The point is that, as an advanced species, a mark of our humanity is bucking natural selection. Just because something is selected by natural selection doesn't mean it's the best. It means it's most suited to survival. If all we care about is survival, than we are still nothing more than animals.   We have defeated our survival pretty handily. For a lot of the world, even in many impoverished countries, it's not a daily fight for survival from the elements themselves. Obviously a great deal of the world fights for survival against ourselves, but that's another thing entirely.  Thinning the herd is a short-sighted view. It will just grow back again. What's wiser is to try to address the reasons the size of our herd is unsustainable.  I think rejection of natural selection in ourselves is the most significant mark of social advancement. It shows introspection, it shows wisdom, and it shows growth.  Yes, it would be EASIER to just break the neck of every baby with a terminal or incapacitating disease or disorder. The meaning of life for advanced species has shifted from simply surviving and propagating to improving ourselves and expanding ourselves.

When you are looked at as some sort of junkie for taking meds that may get some others high, but what you need in order to function.  When your ACA plan doesn't cover proper mental health care, or your HMO is habitually bad about providing assistance, and you end up self-medicating through alcohol, cannabis, or methamphetamine, just because it makes your life tolerable.

It often falls into the category of Invisible Disabilities that people all around us suffer from in silence. It has its own unique challenges (especially public perception) which make it a unique form of illness.  Some issues could be addressed by changing the unreasonable expectations of the capitalist system, which will run you into the ground like a battery in the Matrix, ready to replace you with the next crop of fresh workers.  Other issues could he helped by more research into causes and cures. The brain and nervous system are in the same body as every other part, yet we still tend to conflate psychological problems with neuro-psychiatric problems. There needs to be more study into the role of pathogens in mental illness, and the gut-brain connection, along with neuro-feedback, and other now experimental techniques which work on brain elasticity.  I find it abhorrent that a disorder needs to be categorized as physical rather than mental to be given the same legitimacy as every other medical condition.

At my old college campus, we had a sort of mental health awareness week, but it ended up just further perpetuating the stigma that if you have mental problems, you're a basket case.  I think with the changes in society, mental problems in general, but especially depression will become more and more commonplace.  It boggles my mind how many people think that ""suffering from depression"" = ""sad all the time.""  If kids learn about physical diseases in school, they should learn about mental issues as well.

Then we can focus on Things That We Want To Do and Things To Do In Doing The Things We Want To Do. The Catch 22 is that we need money to live, which is inherently contradictory to an access/abundance/post-scarcity economy by design. Since we're making bold predictions anyway, here's another: the internet will continue to act as a catalyst of globalization, setting the groundwork for a decentralized global economic model (similar to a resource-based economy).   Between self-driving cars, robotics capable of automated design, 3D printing, and the internet of things will be a vacuum. This vacuum won't (can't) be filled by a World Government, it needs to be filled by empowered and educated citizens of Earth. Science Fiction tends to be dystopian in revealing future realities, but the world is generally a better place than it used to be. People generally are better than they used to be. Our political debates haven't gotten better, but as a species we're better problem solvers than ever before. Unfortunately, by using money as our primary access resource, we're limiting our abilities to problem solve to more and more niche issues. Those same people who have the chance to be better educated by their mid-twenties than their grandparents could have been by life's end don't have the cognitive capacity for civic duty by the end of the work week. Effectively, we're trying to solve technical problems socially, but it wasn't votes that got us to the moon, nor is it debates that fuel rockets to mars.

Most of the crimes on the books are soft crimes like simple drug possession, shoplifting, theft by deception, etc.  At the moment as soon as we can label someone a 'criminal' we discard the rest of their social value, similar to how racism etc operates.  That's a lot of human capital to be throwing away over what amounts to poor judgment and it's the basis of people calling for rehabilitation vs punishment in the legal system.  I don't have a solution off the top of my head (and have to get to a meeting) but you absolutely have to split crime into ""can't risk you don't that again because the results are catastrophic"" and ""you just screwed up things for a whole lot of people and we really want you to stop being an asshole"".  Everyone's committed a crime, it's just that most people think that they were justified...sometimes they are, and sometimes they are and it's still illegal but they didn't get caught.

It was huge because it showed the gradual change of opinion in society that advocacy can create.  Atheism is quickly heading to that watershed moment as well. More young people than ever are non-religious, and that number is growing quickly. Though it's still impossible for an atheist to become a political leader in many countries, including the US.

The documentation of unarmed civilians (especially black males) being shot or otherwise mistreated.  The example in Ferguson last year, the police department was found not guilty of criminal charges but was found guilty under civil charges.  It took weeks of riots, protest, national and international media, etc. before Federal civil rights charges were raised.  In South Carolina a young black male was found hanging from a tree.  It was ruled a suicide without investigation.  I haven't followed that case closely, last I heard NAACP was bringing it to international media to get a light shining on the case to get a full investigation.

InsightfulQuestions,338j71,surfingatwork,7,Mon Apr 20 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree. I'm gonna go really wide with this, I hope y'all will indulge. The way I model it, is like this: 'Good' is a meme which developed organically on the substrate of our natural primate tendency towards prosocial behavior. It has since evolved into a sort of symbiont with the survival strategy of improving the survival of the population of the hosts it infects (while not necessarily improving the survival of each individual host). This would explain our veneration of heroes and martyrs. In a host population with an independent drive for social recognition tying 'good' behavior to that recognition would increase the probability that 'good' behavior would propagate.  This too would explain the shifting moral norms which define ""good."" Different host populations in different circumstances require different non-native stimuli to increase the survival of the population, and therefore the propagation of the good-meme. At time x and place y it's avoidance of pork and shellfish, at time z and place m it's the veneration of one's ancestors and filial duty, and in yet another place and time its firm rules about host-guest relationships. We have since invented the words 'good' and 'bad' to describe a pre-existing phenomenon. The way it differs place to place, century to century is in response to new and different pressures. However just like the flu is always the flu even though we get a new one every year, Good is still good and recognizable as such. That being said, since memes have to be observed to be imitated, no I don't believe humans are inherently good, but a meme has to be suited to its host just as much as a germ does. This suggests to me that humans as a group have a proclivity towards good."

I work in the field of human development. While I often employ constructivism and social constructivism in my research and teaching,  I think we need to notice something about the human brain's evolution throughout ""big history.""   The prefrontal cortex is a very new piece of equipment. In evolutionary terms, its like the Watch: just has barely hit the shelves.  Over time, both in evolution and from embryo to birth, the brain starts as a very simple ""lizard"" like brain. But then becomes more and more complex. The back/center of the brain is very simple and primitive. The new front part is hi-tech  The prefrontal cortex is where a lot of our most advance processing happens including regulation of social behavior.   I know I am only making an inference, but there is a strong case that the design of the brain overtime overwhelming shows a trajectory toward, at least the capacity, for ""goodness.""  This, I think can combine with the constructivist argument to support a ""goodness"" theory. Our brains have evolved to support empathy and prosocial behavior. It still requires the proper social nurturing/constructivism.   I do not buy the whole humans are bad idea or that we are just a ""blank slate"" totally at the will of constructivism. Humans seem to be designed for good but need the proper guidance. But if you look at a baby at birth, you already see that it has many amazing abilities. and at 6 months attachment theory comes into play. The baby is seeking out connection with the primary caregiver. This is where I think we see the inherent nature of goodness.

Just about anytime you witness real mean behavior, I would argue that your dealing with a brain subject to abuse and/or neglect. So constructivism is a big part, but I find it compelling to look at the way the brain is evolving.   tldr: If you look at the evolution of the brain over millions of years, there is a clear trajectory in it's design into something ""meant"" to be ""good"""

In the French Revolution, it was the Nobles, Priests, Profiteers, and Reactionaries that were seen as poisoning the inherently good nature of the people.  The solution?  Execute the malefactors.    Quoting from Wikipedia...  In his Report on the Principles of Political Morality, given on 5 February 1794, Robespierre stated:  If virtue be the spring of a popular government in times of peace, the spring of that government during a revolution is virtue combined with terror: virtue, without which terror is destructive; terror, without which virtue is impotent. Terror is only justice prompt, severe and inflexible; it is then an emanation of virtue; it is less a distinct principle than a natural consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing wants of the country ... The government in a revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.  ...and later in the article...  Terror was thus a tool to accomplish his overarching goals for democracy. Historian Ruth Scurr wrote that as for Robespierre's vision for France he wanted a ""democracy for the people, who are intrinsically good and pure of heart; a democracy in which poverty is honorable, power innocuous, and the vulnerable safe from oppression; a democracy that worships nature—not nature as it really is, cruel and disgusting, but nature sanitized, majestic, and, above all, good.""  ...unquote."

That's a very hard form of empathy that most of us can't ever master. There are easier forms in the same vein.   I guess I can imagine sharing and cooperating as evolutionary products. Group survival depends upon them. I'm not sure I'd argue that those qualities make for a ""good"" person though.

I had the thought that ""if humans were inherently bad then would we not have been wiped out completely already?""  Now for the stuff I have read. Yes, apparently we are inherently good. The number of people who are actually anti-social and act out on it is extremely low.   However, have scarcity in a society, whether just naturally from the surrounding environment (Tibet, deserts, arctic territories) or in policy (such as with polygyny, the form of polygamy where one man marries multiple women, and having large disparities in wealth and/or power) and then the societies become worse than if they did not have that scarcity. Check out ""Why Beautiful People have More Daughters"" for this one.  There are other factors that can contribute to making a society or simply social interactions worse than they could be. Such as having an Anonymous Dictator. If a person can get away with something that will benefit him or herself virtually all of the time they will do that, even if it means the detriment of another person in someway. However, recall that I said very few people are actually anti-social and act on it. People will pretty much do almost anything to get what they want, especially if they can get away with it such as never being found out. That is pretty much anything just short of harming others. Virtually always people cannot stand harming others. However, create a conflict between 2 social groups and it's possible to make people harm other people more readily than in any other typical situation. The 2 social groups could be formed based on liking some particular soccer team, or simply doing a coin toss in front of people to choose who is on which side.  Those last few things mostly have information from ""The Blank Slate: the Modern Denial of Human Nature"" by Steven Pinker as well as ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" by Jonathan Haidt. And a little bit of stuff probably from 2 of Robert Cialdini's books ""Influence"" and ""Yes!"".  Personally, I have purchased several copies of ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" by Jonathan Haidt and given them away, and have even gotten translations of the book in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. I'd like to get a translation in Spanish as well.  I have a small story about how I got the Chinese translation. I asked a friend who's studying finance like myself, we met over WeChat, if she could get the Chinese translation of ""The Happiness Hypothesis"". She asked her mom who is actually a teacher of psychology in a Chinese high school if she could get ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" in Chinese. The mom was surprised and delighted she was asking for the book because the mother had already read it and said it was a great book, and has read many other books, including popular books on psychology, and said of all of them that it is one of the best. PS, my friend was kind enough to give me the book for free."
InsightfulQuestions,338j71,Memeic,-7,Mon Apr 20 16:49:47 2015 UTC,"I had the thought that ""if humans were inherently bad then would we not have been wiped out completely already?""   Who is to say we won't be?   In terms of geologic time, human beings haven't been in existence as much as the blink of an eye.   If we extinguished ourselves in the next 10,000 years, we'd still not be more significant than any of the other billion species of plants and animals that never lasted beyond 30,000 of the 4.3 Billion years the Earth has been here.   Now for the stuff I have read. Yes, apparently we are inherently good. The number of people who are actually anti-social and act out on it is extremely low.    It's all subjective.  If for example, treating other life forms humanely, including cows, chickens, pigs, and other creatures is a component of being ""inherently good"", then we humans make Adolf Hitler look like a pacifist.     Even if you want to arbitrarily suggest lesser life forms shouldn't count in assessing ""goodness"", we can examine the way we as a species treat our own, every day, in each and every country and culture and find overwhelming examples of ""inhumanity"".  From the eradication of native Americans and slavery and our cavalier attitude about how that's in the past, meanwhile in the last two decades America has murdered more than 1,000,000 Iraqis and nobody thinks twice about it.   You have a very narrow vision if you think there's not plenty of examples of where our species has not yet figured out that treating each other humanely is a good thing.  We're still vehemently arguing about whether or not it's acceptable to give all people access to affordable healthcare!  If there was any notion of ""inherent goodness"" in us as a species, there's a lot of things that would not be happening now.   I would expect anyone with any inherent sense of good will towards others, would not in any way be arguing about whether or not starving people should have a way to eat - even if that means the more fortunate give up some of what they don't need, and sick people, regardless of their scenario, should have access to decent healthcare.     And, when you have people who promote themselves as arbiters of what is moral and good, making such arguments, that's a sign of the illusion of goodness."

The News and History aren't littered with good things people do everyday because that is largely taken for granted. It's taken for granted that an overwhelming majority of the time that I go to the corner store and get a pack of gum I am not going to get stabbed. I take that for granted.  Also, conflicts have gone down a major amount in history. Still, we aren't as peaceful as most other animals who practically never ever kill each other, exceptions being animals such as gorillas & bears, probably some others I just am not aware of off the top of my head, who have been known to kill infants so that the mother will want to have sex with them again... at the same time we are actually more co-operative than most animals, but the other animals who are as co-operative as us achieved that by actually all being related to each other, while we have developed psychological kinships such as through religion, culture, and ethnicity.  Our circle of empathy has been constantly expanding overtime as people have been figuring out how all sides can trust that a conflict is beyond the need to be thought of. Also, we as a species have been expanding this circle of empathy as we have been able to take time to bring awareness to various issues and really give them time to be incorporated into our daily lives.

You have a good point that good is subjective, however, there are many things people can agree on even if they don't want to admit it.   The factory farming is a good example of how humans can be not so empathetic. Heck, ecological destruction is another one.

Ever since learning about Godwin's law I've preferred to avoid invoking it unless if it would be humorous hyperbole.

The trouble is, we are smart enough to be able to convince ourselves that what we really want to do is actually relatively harmless and thus we are able to do very selfish, sometimes even violent things while still being able to look upon ourselves as morally correct.  Good and Bad are loaded terms, but I take the high view, that goodness is an absolute standard which we at times near but never consistently achieve. Bad is very hard to define as is Good, but if you look at it as selfish vs altruistic, I'd say a good balance is a person who cares for the needs of others in equal proportion to one's own needs. Even by this reasonable standard we usually do not qualify as good, and this standard of equality is denied by most people in exchange for a more lenient one, in which so long as you aren't doing overt harm to another person in meeting your own desires, you are considered a good person. This is a sort of consensus morality. I would say in general each person has enough rationalization to believe they are decent enough according to this more lax standard, even though we know that buying a cheap shirt at a store is likely supporting the equivalent of slave labor in a far-off country. It is messy, but hidden from view, the real consequences of our actions.  I would say it is like gravity, selfish urges, and our best efforts to be good are about as effective as chickens flying.  We desire to soar, to be as good in whatever standards we recognize as we possibly can, but we are doomed to fail because of the irresistability of our baser drives."

Obviously, these are all debatable, but most of us would agree these are good traits, desirable traits.  I would argue that these are all characteristics that we learn. We are born selfish and greedy--- just look at babies. I think it was Chesterton who had some quote about how Original Sin was one of the only empirically observable theological doctrines, because all you had to do was watch a whining toddler.

For example, ingroups and outgroups are phenomenon observed by social psychologists that help to explain a lot of human behavior.  We seem to inately categorize people into either a group that we are part of, or one that we are opposed to, and then think and act toward those groups based on that categorization.  We perceive and act on our ingroup more favorably, and often point incredible amounts of kindness and goodwill in their direction.  This is good!  But the opposite is true of outgroups.  This can lead to evil.   In the real world, this is most easily observed in war, politics and sports fanaticism.  Is this a good or a bad thing?  That's a complicated question, and it depends on which group you are in at the time, and how much your group needs that cohesion to survive.  But it gets even more complicated when we add in the fact that some people are more or less susceptible to this bias.  Some are able to develop more objective impressions of others, others get lost in it.  In other words, even if one were to decide this shifts the tide toward good or evil, the effect is still influenced by the individual's personality and background.     And to top it off, this is only one of an unknowable number of factors that influence human behavior.  So it's an interesting question, but there's a reason that it's unanswerable.  It's just not that simple."

Similarly groups and society as a whole, are evolving their own understanding but those tend to lag in time, because of the delay in communicating change to systems.  tldr; Yes.

I began to realize that even the most mundane and seemingly trivial questions must be answered by our minds, consciously or subconsciously. Referring back to my original post, I noticed that my brain was often on auto-pilot and asking questions like ""why am I so stupid?"" or ""why can't I be more like XYZ?"" or ""why does this always happen to me?"". Whether I wanted to or not, my brain would find or create an answer to these questions. ""Because you're an idiot,"" ""because you never do anything right,"" and ""because god hates you"" or whatever the answer turned out to be.   It's interesting to me that another human being can read my question, create their own meaning, and answer it based on their very own interpretation of it which makes me wonder... do we all ask and answer questions in a similar manner? You answered my question based on your own experiences and beliefs, does that mean that the process one uses to arrive at an answer is unique and different from all others?"
InsightfulQuestions,32ofpg,Tetragramatron,14,Wed Apr 15 12:41:08 2015 UTC,"Throughout history humans have tried to distinguish themselves from other animals by a variety of means, be it our consciousness, use of technology, social structure etc.  As we've become more aware of our own limitations and the capabilities of other animals this has become more and more difficult.  I kinda think the idea of ""post-humans"" is yet another attempt to liberate us from our nature by appealing to technology, a topic that has been extensively written about, but my favourite criticism of is that given by John Gray in Straw Dogs. If you're interested, it's a very good read on how we see ourselves and other animals.   Based on this, to answer your question, I strongly doubt there will ever be such a thing as post-humans. Perhaps technologically augmented people, but I doubt we will ever be able to escape our biology (and/or psychology)."

You can always still state that the results are still human, but I don't think you have a serious argument for it being anything other than evolution until you can change what makes us ""us"".  That's the brain and our DNA.  If you can create brain-IT digital connection you're a long way down that road and if you change the DNA...well, that's literally what defines us as human."
InsightfulQuestions,32ofpg,Metallio,3,Wed Apr 15 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"DNA is not a permanent thing.  It activates and de-activates portions of itself as well as mutates itself during your lifetime in a response to many different factors.  In addition to that most of what makes us human is our brain, not our physical DNA.  Our brains change heavily depending on what and how we are taught during child-hood and adolescence.  For example if you don't teach a child to speak, they will be incapable of learning it in adult-hood.  In further addition, the mind is fully capable of self-change.  Start a regular meditation practice and within six weeks your brain pathways will be noticeably different.  As our society changes and children grow up with different sets of experience, what it means to be human will change.  Cultural values have a profound affect on the mind.  Which, as a complete aside, is why I've always found arguments that human nature is X and unchangeable very weak."

The mechanism by which we will change that much is probably not at all what you're thinking, though.  As out obstetric medicine becomes more and more advanced, we will be able to save infants who would have been less and less likely to survive childbirth in a pre-medical environment.  This is a massive relief of one of our strongest evolutionary pressures.  Human physiology is, above many other considerations, a balancing act between the advantages of a long gestation period, the disadvantages of a long helpless infancy, and the limitations of our skeletal structure.  We are currently relieving the limitations created by our bone structure through obstetric medicine.  Human in the future will be able to safely develop longer before birth, and over several thousand years that could well turn us into a species whose birth process involves surgical intervention by default, but whose offspring can benefit from longer gestational periods and safer infancies as a result.  That type of human would be unable to interbreed with earlier humans because the resulting fetus would not trigger labor until it was far too large to be delivered safely.  And then we shift from Homo Sapiens (the wise man) to something else.  Homo medicāns?"

My second, better theory is put simply as this; if you took a modern human and mated it with the first scientifically recognized human, for all intents and purposes no viable offspring would be produced and we have therefore speciated.

I think it sums up pretty well the quasi-religious/mystical connotations of merging with the ever expanding and evolving machine-mind that we are living within the skeleton of.

Some people graphed things like processing power of computers, and some other technological things, saw a curve that looked exponential, and noted that at some point exponential curves just shoot up.  That sort of vertical asymptote is referred to as a singularity...when advancement of technology is so rapid that, eg, the amount of change that happened between 1900 and 2000 happens every hour, every minute, or every second.    Of course, the sticking point here is that past performance is no guarantee of future success.  Just because things have been progressing rapidly until this point, doesn't mean that progress will keep happening faster and faster.  That's the sort of reasoning that had 1960's and early 70's science fiction writers putting interstellar travel by 2050.  If you graphed the growth of human transportation tech between, say, 1900 and 1970 it seemed plausible, but things kind of stalled at Apollo and then even regressed.    Then again, it could happen.  The future's unpredictable.   and does this happen to all civilizations?   It's not known to have happened to any civilization, but to be fair we don't exactly have a good sample size to work with."

You know what two is because someone told you one of something added to the same will result in there being two of that thing. Just as you know what a cat or an apple is. So what is important isn't necessarily the numbers themselves but what they represent and the relationships between them. The Arabic numeral 2 and the roman numeral II, though from different systems represented the same thing and are understood in the same way. Now why particularly mathematics is so astonishingly effective at interpreting the phenomena in the world, I recommended reading Eugene Wigner's paper, ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"". You can find in on Google scholar. I would also be weary to label anything that science produces as the truth, as that is more philosophical that the precision required by science. The best that can be said is that according to our knowledge currently, this seems to be the case in these particular circumstances. And these claims are open to revision and so forth. For an example, watch veritasium's YouTube video on the history of t kilogram.

The Americans are invested in keeping the Kurds as part of Iraq because if the Kurds left it would signal that the political unit known as 'Iraq' is now dead; the entire country would dissolve as a political entity. If Iraq collapses completely and each faction attempts to go it's own way, Iran will surely gobble up (or at least gain significant influence over) the Shiite portions. That will upset the Saudis, the Arabian peninsula will see a huge military build up, oil prices will go through the roof, and nuclear proliferation will be an issue of when, no longer an indistinct if.  And that's without even factoring in the Turks. The PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) has been freedom fighting/terrorizing the Turks for the last few decades while agitating for independence.

The difference is that during Da Vinci's time there were a lot more low hanging fruit in the arts and sciences, there was also a lot less competition and social position mattered a lot more then it does today.   For example, just having access to enough art supplies to refine your skills would have been impossible for a lot of would be artists in Da Vinci's time. So Da Vinci could easily get skilled enough to set himself apart from other artists while having enough time to indulge other interests. People like Da Vinci today, probably get decently skilled in many different areas of life but never skilled enough to get to Da Vinci's level because they are so many people that devote themselves to only one thing.

He was also extremely competitive with Michaelangelo. But here in Florence there was a lot of money sloshing around and a lot of respect was given to the arts. There are things he invented that were inconcievable at the time, like flying machines, helicopters, armoured tanks. Perpective in art, studies of the human body.

InsightfulQuestions,30g9y4,eiliant,3,Fri Mar 27 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"But each field is much more developed now, there is much more to know to get to a level where you are developing novel ideas. If you look at the lists of Nobel Prizes for Physics or chemistry or other STEM fields there is an increasing number of awards being given to pairs and then groups of people until the present day when an individual winning a Nobel Prize for science is relatively rare.  People haven't gotten dumber, the subjects have gotten more complex. Even Art, as strange as that may seem to a non artist. His only concerns really in the art field was depicting reality as realistically and immaculately as possible. But since his time the techniques of classical realism have been refined and increased to the level of photo realism. There are probably tens of thousands of people in the world today that can capture reality in oil paint more accurately than Leonardo (just judging by his own ideals). And if you add in the entire weight of artistic developement since then, the innumerable styles and schools and techniques the odds of an individual setting themselves apart from the crowd and becoming as famous as a Leonardo was in his day are tiny.   We are all standing on the shoulders of giants like Da Vinci, but though he was clearly a genius, some of his fame comes from being a genius in the right time. There is almost an economy of scale to it. The worlds population when he was born was less than 400 million people. There are likely dozens, possibly hundred or thousands of potential polymaths of his level alive today in our world of 7 billion (although sadly the odds are also good that some of those possible geniuses are living in parts of the world where they will never have access to education). But in order to truly excel in our world he would likely have to focus on one or two fields, even if he was rarer than one in a trillion."

So what looked like a high curb in his time now looks like a narrow 2-story building.  And that's for each field.  So you've got to learn all of that stuff before you're considered to be near the top of any of those fields.  Sure, we have access to more information these days, but actually grasping the structure inside all of that information doesn't really take that much less time.  That's why doctors now specialize in narrower fields - if they had to keep abreast of all the new techniques and studies to stay current and proficient in all the different branches of medicine, they wouldn't have enough time in the day to see any actual patients."

If a friend says that they sold an item on Craigslist and they got a cashier's check for $8000 over the amount of the sale, then I'm going to tell them about that scam.   You have to let reasonable adults make their own decisions, with the amount of input from you dependent on the amount of harm possible from the decision. So if it's an 18-year-old who is ""investing"" $500 in a pyramid scheme, I'll mention it but consider it a lesson well learned if that money is never seen again. It's fairly cheap at $500 and will save the potential for greater harm down the road, say, if s/he's is considering taking out a second mortgage or raiding the kid's college fund to invest in a pyramid scheme.

Film is a young art form so the early innovators will be given high renown for inventing a lot of film techniques that are ubiquitous today, but that does not mean innovation will die out.  One newer form of film I've heard about is the improvised film, where there is no script just a general understanding of where characters start and end up and then you just go.  Which is completely different from how every film ever made has worked.  So in that way innovations aren't tied to technology, but they are related.  360 degree film may be a big player in the next wave, but I personally think having strong camera movement and editing is a better cinematic experience.  I mean, found footage was a huge innovation that actual used WORSE cameras than they had available at the time to create a specific effect with the audience.  So honestly as long as the director is doing something different or has a crazy idea there will be unique voices and innovation in film."

InsightfulQuestions,309p64,feared_rear_admiral,7,Thu Mar 26 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"I was just talking to a buddy about Children of Men, which has the strangest pacing I've ever seen in a movie.  Most movies of a similar bent start out relatively sedate and gradually climb in intensity until they reach a peak, at the climax of the movie.  Children of Men, instead, is rather intense from the very beginning.  And for a while, that rises as it would in an average movie.  But then you reach the climax, and the entire movie deliberately flatlines.  Rather than a harsh music score, you get silence.  Rather than shouting, you get whispering.  Rather than intense dynamic action with a lot of cuts, you get a slow long take.  And the quiet serenity of that scene is absolutely breathtaking, in context.  I can't think of any movie built the same way.  So in terms of reinvention, I'd say that counts.  And it definitely happens.  Not so much in mainstream fluff written by accountants, but in a lot of ""corner of your eye"" cases.  I think a good way to research this might be to look at the tvtropes website and see what kinds of tropes are newly added, or only seen in recent movies.

Sadly, I think it'll have more to do with interactive media where the viewer (or player?) can have an impact on how the story unfolds, or details about the cast through conscious choices.  That or it'll take VR, with movies literally putting you in the action (along with the elder generation not thinking VR is something like Max Headroom or Lawnmower Man).  From a storytelling standpoint, though, the vast majority of stories in various media tend to fit the mold of The Hero's Journey (aka: The Monomyth -- link:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth).  It's not that new movies don't try to do new things, it's that so many stories are basically telling the same thing, with different (often ambiguous) roles assigned to different characters/events/ideas.  It's not that the movies aren't worth seeing, it's that the basic structure of stories in general hasn't changed in centuries (not just the movie medium, story telling in general).  And I'm not sure what would change the whole Monomyth Paradigm short of some ancient greek story tellers rising from the grave and making some new structure for us all to cling to."

It already is happening in games like Eve Online in which users retell stories of political intrigue and how current powers came to be at a level bigger than even House of Cards considering it was generated by the users themselves to build these storylines.

Possibly, but it probably won't happen in film.  The cost of making and marketing a movie is increasingly expensive.  Investors want a near guarantee on returns today.  This is why almost all films are franchises and reboots, made by formula.  No one is willing to take a chance any longer.  Even the Oscar bait films are done by formula.  To me, cinema is dead or dormant.  It makes me sad since I spent my high school years back in the 1980s working at a theater.  I saw everything that came out and had the privilege of free movies.  I'd watch a movie on the big screen five or six times a week.  Even after, I'd go to the movies at least twice a week.  Today, I haven't been in almost two years and will watch five or six new movies a year on Netflix or Red Box.  I still like many older movies that I have on Blu-Ray, but I can't stand another franchise comic book movie or stuffy period drama made to snag an Academy Award.  I'm 42 now and have seen enough explosions and formula tropes.  It's old and boring and I won't watch it.  There is innovation in cable TV and we will probably get some good indie movies made with good, but inexpensive, digital gear.  I look forward to it.  But the traditional Hollywood movie is completely dead as an art form.  Hollywood has abandoned everything to chase 15-24 year old males.  I realize that Reddit is mostly 15-24 year old males who are big fans of the output, but for the rest of us, that stuff is a snorefest.  It's all so predictable."

It's more that we are very used to seeing North America and Europe as ""central"" to the world, seeing other continents how they visually relate to the West, from our perspective. The world map as we know it was created, adjusted and tweaked by Western scientists and travellers. In early Middle Ages, onlty Europe, Asia and Africa continents were known. I guess it wouldn't have made sense to shift the whole world map and make the Americas or Australia centras - instead, they just places these continents on the sides of the ""old continents"". Interesting fact: in Japan, the world map is often portrayed with Japan being at the centre, like this. Doesn't it make sense to think that the Japanese, once having belonged to a great empire, didn't want their country ending up at the periphery of the world but wanted to place it in central position instead? It's the same with the West, I think. A matter of historical convenience that still does have a subtle effect/meaning."

InsightfulQuestions,302v0z,psychedelegate,3,Tue Mar 24 20:09:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure there is a difference
InsightfulQuestions,302v0z,greatmindsiguess,3,Tue Mar 24 10:33:07 2015 UTC,"Both of these are situations where the person in question projects themselves into a future (or an alternate universe) where they have all the things that they want.   Maybe a 'dream' is an instance where the person considers all the steps that s/he needs to take in order to attain her/his goals, and is willing to go through all of those steps. An 'escapist fantasy', on the other hand, might be an instance where the person does not know those steps, or is unwilling to take them. They probably don't have any real intention of carrying it out.  Basically, a dream is a future that can be conceivably reached from the present. An escapist fantasy is just a ""what-if"" scenario."
InsightfulQuestions,302v0z,toxikant,2,Fri Mar 27 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"Escapism usually roots from a profound dissatisfaction with ones circumstances, while a dream is something unrealistic that someone looks forward to. Atleast, that is how I see it."
InsightfulQuestions,302v0z,changes_needed,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"A dream is something that is somehow realistic and yet not.  A fantasy is something that is unrealistic, always creating the best scenarios alongside of no bad ghings happening around you unless you desire them."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,samplist,6,Tue Mar 24 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it is a line but rather a gradient. When I think of excitement, I think of moving into my new apartment or starting my new job. There's some elements of fear, but by far it's just pure joy, excitement, feelings that are closely attached to hope and cheer. When I think of fear, I think of a new rollercoaster or giving a class presentation. Both are feelings of nervousness/fear that give me an excited adrenaline rush I enjoy, but the feeling is sharper, a little more intense and doesn't last as long. I feel literally shaky, whereas with excitement, I feel like I want to jump around the room.   I think in everything that excites me there is an element of fear in some degree. Just because that is the nature of novel situations and the nature of how I like my fun (like scuba diving and rollercoasters, just a hint of fear).   But it's a healthy amount of fear. There's an abundant amount of safety precautions taken to mitigate the fear from rollercoasters, scuba diving, white water rafting, public speaking, vacationing somewhere new.... if you find yourself actively seeking an unhealthy amount of fear that isn't safely mitigated (deliberately putting yourself in dangerous situations for the rush, etc) then thats where it goes wrong. That's when you're just looking for something scary, not necessarily exciting."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,funnygreensquares,3,Tue Mar 24 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think the difference comes from mastery. The first time you do something new and scary, you will be scared shitless because you don't know what to expect. You have no confirmation of the outcome. It is the unknown. You are vulnerable.  The next time you do it, you will have some knowledge of the experience. Some mastery. Some assuredness of the outcome. Some degree of control and safety. So the next time may be exciting for you rather than scary. Your body may still get tense and you may feel the fight/flight hormones, but you may still feel somewhat ""safe"".  So to sum it up, I would say it depends on how safe you feel."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,mamajoysan,3,Tue Mar 24 20:24:02 2015 UTC,Fear is usually held with reservations. Excitement is held with anticipation. Or something like that.
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"This was a really good question I feel.  I've been in situations that truly should have been fearful, should have had reservations, but instead it was pure excitement.  There was no anticipation.  I was actively 'IN' that moment.  I was alive and without any concern for the future or the consequences.  It only elevated my excitement and resolve.  I don't know the answer, honestly.  I think that the only difference between excitement and fear is a mindspace.  Mindfulness.  Being ""IN"" the moment, versus being of the will to avoid it."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,jiohdi1960,2,Sat Apr 11 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"fear is anticipation of damage to either your body, self image, goals or ideals. While excitement may have a bit of an overlap, it often has nothing to do with damage, but rather the elivation of bordom."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:16:23 2015 UTC,So.. Excitement is elevated arousal that something might change- while fear is elevated arousal that something might change?
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,jiohdi1960,2,Sat Apr 11 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"excitement is often anticipation of pleasure while fear is of pain, which to a select few may be the same thing as pain can trigger pleasure."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,Jonluw,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:07:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like you to explain a bit more closely in what way you mean excitement and fear are difficult to distinguish. I get excited when I hear amazing news, for instance, and that feeling is nothing like what I feel standing atop a tall cliff. One is pleasurable and light-headed. The other is more of a body-centered discomfort.    Makes me think of this though. Hehe."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,Infinite_Otaku,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"These will coexist.  I'm excited for my new job, yet I am also throughly scared about my first day....but this does not mean that I am to be TRULY scared of this.  I am only momentarily scared, dor a period of time that is, in the sclae of things, completely insignificant."
InsightfulQuestions,302x7d,Humunkoloss,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:04:19 2015 UTC,Fear is knowing something new is coming and your not sure if you can cope with it. Excitement requires that you think you can handle and that will possibly better your situation.
