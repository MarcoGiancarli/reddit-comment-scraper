Test and test derivatives would fit pretty well for this look imo. Wouldn't surprise me if these low iq fake natties are running upwards of 2 grams of combined aas just to get the results you see here either.

nattyorjuice,3dvfh9,haharrhaharr,3,Mon Jul 20 11:00:48 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fact that different compounds can have different side effects.  You'll want to keep in mind that just because crossfitters are juicing, doesn't meant they're juicing all the time.  Crossfit itself has a fairly long off-season. (From August to February, or 7 months) And typically in professional sports, drug testing is only done in season, usually days before an event.  So they can go on a cycle off-season to bulk up, and then once the season starts just focus on preserving muscle, while they let the gear clear from their system."

Not all actors are on juice. Some look totally attainable natty and are probably on juice, while some look better and are probably natty. Remember people look bigger in movies, because of camera angles, make up, very good light, photoshop, etc. Some examples :   Jason Statham is probably natty. He was a diver and competed. His paparazzi pics look like he's fit, but his movie shots make him look much bigger. Tons of oil and make up + pump help a lot. the movie 300. I mean, the movie had ONE YEAR of CGI post production. They literally painted abs on the actos and underlined their chest with brown foundation lol and enhanced everything again with computers. Tom Hardy was natty in Bronson and TDKR (lol), but juiced as fuck in Warrior. Not because his physique is impossible natty.

The problem is mostly the Internet, and the lies going back 70 years in bodybuilding magazines."
nattyorjuice,3dpsxf,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,-2,Sat Jul 18 22:32:46 2015 UTC,This guy is a example what u can build if u are ecto and a lil' Mezo. But if u are a Mezo/endo then u can be a lot bigger than him. Not so lean but bigger.  Its not so easy.
nattyorjuice,3dpsxf,knorg,0,Sat Jul 18 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"Have you measured his wrists and ankles? no.  This whole idea of judging ecto/medo/endo is flawed, if he was fat, or holding lots of water, using creatine you would probably say he was a different type, this is a bodybuilder in contest condition, that's how it looks."
nattyorjuice,3dpsxf,goudendonut,-3,Sat Jul 18 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"NBA players are likely to be natty because the sport is very demanding in terms of cardio. Sports like football and baseball are much slower-paced, giving steroid users time to recover their breath.  Dwyane Wade is 6'4'', 220 pounds, and LeBron James is 6'8'', 250 pounds. They both have impressive physiques by NBA standards, but certainly not the best. IMO, neither of these guys has touched a muscle-building drug in their life.  http://i.imgur.com/9vvp8w8.jpg  Those physiques would be great lifetime goals for a natty, although you'd have to be pretty gifted to ultimately achieve them."
nattyorjuice,3dpsxf,knorg,2,Sat Jul 18 19:36:51 2015 UTC,Your logic doesn't make sense. Since they have less rest Times and do a more cardio orientated sport they dont juice? If anything they would have a bigger advantage by juicing because rest Times are less important for People on gear.
nattyorjuice,3dpsxf,possumsquirrel,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"Most anabolic steroids decrease cardio output by increasing muscle mass and increasing blood pressure. Anyone who has done a cycle will know that it kills your endurance.   Endurance athletes who juice are using small doses of anabolics along with EPO, blood transfusions, and corticosteroids. Juicing for endurance sports is very different from juicing for strength sports.  Basketball probably requires more athleticism than any other sport, which is another reason that juicing doesn't pay off. You can't juice your way to talent. A sport like powerlifitng is the polar opposite, which is why even unathletic guys can excel if they use enough juice."
nattyorjuice,3dp8x2,buckfunter,5,Sat Jul 18 03:23:07 2015 UTC,of course he's juicey.  He competed in Nabba and INBA and finished first many times.   The INBA is full of juicers who pretend to be natty.

nattyorjuice,3ddicc,modernbenoni,0,Thu Jul 16 12:26:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting use of this community's judgement on this. Without knowing your weight, height, and age, I would say you will struggle to make much more gains. But it is pretty doable. Stalling for a year isn't good though, it's all about diet at this point I imagine.  Depending on your age and living situation I'd probably say get yourself into a really good routine for diet and working out, settle in that, then go juicy after a couple of months. This also gives you time to see if you can gain some more muscle mass naturally while you're nailing your lifestyle, plus will maximise juicy gains if/when you do go on."
nattyorjuice,3ddicc,modernbenoni,2,Wed Jul 15 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"Tks mate, i just begin my 30s. I think my workout plan is OK  chest/biceps, back/triceps,  HIIT sprint,  deltoide/traps,  legs,  rest,  HIIT sprint then repeat.  1h30 per workout and 45mins per cardio.  Recently i'm doing the carb cycle (100% 75% 50% 50% 75% 100%) to get away the belly fat. Gonna seriously eat more clean and healthy soon."
nattyorjuice,3ddicc,modernbenoni,0,Wed Jul 15 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"So you hit everything once a week then cardio in between?  That sounds really sub-optimal to me, increase your volume and frequency, do something like generic bulking routine but with lots more sets."
nattyorjuice,3ddicc,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 4 times lift + 2 times cardio in a week. You think that's not enough? Im gonna do a general bulking when i get away maximum my belly fat."
nattyorjuice,3ddicc,darkades94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:49 2015 UTC,What kind of training do you do? Mainly hypertrophy or more strength/low reps? Do you do lots of compound lifts?  Given that you've been lifting for 5 years I wouldn't necessarily agree with /u/BIG-ASSTEROIDS that you should be working muscle groups more than once a week. Depends on your goals a bit though.

I have been working out for close to 8 years now and my diet has been on point for the last year or so. Never ran a pro hormone, steroid, Sarm, or any other AAS. Only supplements like protein pre workout fat burners and of course creatine. Ran a test booster made by Intek for about a week and choose to quit taking it because it didn't do anything for me and it had DHEA in it which I think may be banned by some natural competitions. But if you think one week of a low dose of DHEA that I took long ago has any effect on my physique you're simply an idiot. Here come the downvotes by the haters.

nattyorjuice,3d6clj,NiceTryDisaster,20,Mon Jul 13 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"She's JUICEY  1.) She hid in her panic room when she was visited (surprize!) to get drug testing samples  2.) Serena Williams has a LONG history of injuries. There are many more injuries that professional athletes hide from the public, fearing fan support / relevance / sponsors / ranking, etc.  3.) Another list of her injuries HERE and another one HERE  4.) Among female players, her level of muscular development is only matched by Australian tennis player  Samantha Stosur, a known juicer whose voice has gotten deeper and deeper over the years  5.) And finally, if you want to know how they go through all the drug tests unharmed. You can visit this blog about PED abuse in tennis  It was long suspected the tennis authorities ""helped"" the players who were caught or who were going to. Like Nadal and Monfils who were the most obvious. They also helped Gasquet or Hingis when they were caught using cocaine. Many players were given ""time off to recover from stress and injuries""...  Just like Le Tour de France, if you take out the juicers, the sport wouldn't have many people left"
nattyorjuice,3d6clj,are_u_natty,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:20 2015 UTC,Why does the long list of injuries indicate steroid use? Because of the implied fast recovery time?
nattyorjuice,3d6clj,modernbenoni,4,Tue Jul 14 10:53:04 2015 UTC,"In non contact sports where you have frequent directional changes like tennis, badminton, basket ball and so on, it's frequent to have leg injuries. However the list of her injuries is still quite high. It COULD be caused by PED use.    The PED user could see his speed, strength, stamina and bodyweight increase very rapidly. The joints / tendons may not have the time to adapt to those changes and become the weaker parts. Any athlete becomes weaker and weaker after sustaining an injury. Tendons usually take months if not years to heal. She instead managed to overcome some really serious injuries and win competitions after YEARS of repeated injuries. Impossible without assistance Many athletes take steroids when injured to preserve SOME muscle mass. Especially when you have to be bound to a wheelchair / bedridden with the leg elevated etc. On top of all that, I suspect she's on various painkillers / anxiolytics / weed and probably receives localized shots for pain management.    Again, why was she never tested positive? here is your answer"
nattyorjuice,3d6clj,are_u_natty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"That first point about rapid growth would surely only apply for a first cycle, after which growth slows and tendons keep up better.  I don't doubt that she's juicy btw, but I'm not convinced on many injuries being an indicator of steroid use. She's spent some 20 years playing the sport, so if her injuries are well documented then it will always look like a lot after that long."
nattyorjuice,3d6clj,modernbenoni,2,Tue Jul 14 22:00:40 2015 UTC,Thanks.   Especially for PED link. I'm always curious how easily these athletes are able to go through multiple drug tests without testing positive.

Knowing steroids, it's pretty clear that no genetics can ever compete with the advantage steroids (among other drugs) give you, given all individuals are doing somewhat equal training.  Also, it's really easy to juice and for that matter use various performance enahncing drugs, without getting caught. It's almost laughably easy.  So if you know what you are doing, there's no reason not to juice, if your livelihood depends on it. Hell, it's not even that unhealthy, as long as your're nottaking the amounts that a competitive bodybuilder would.  It's the logical thing to do, assuming every professional athlete is or has been juicing."

nattyorjuice,3d44b3,facetomouth,8,Mon Jul 13 13:44:27 2015 UTC,These comments are so fucking ignorant
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,ArchieSwart,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:40:22 2015 UTC,welcome to the sub.  Pretty much any person posted is considered juicing here because only a few people actually lift
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,Tiny311,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:39 2015 UTC,Haha I can not agree more
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,ParacordDan,9,Sat Jul 18 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"I hope it's achievable naturally, but I doubt it"
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,fishburn7,3,Mon Jul 13 11:21:41 2015 UTC,Not much development in the upper chest. Spends all his time curling or crunching. Tricep development lacking. Delts not overly developed. Traps are from improper curling form.   Natty.
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,kraken514,2,Mon Jul 13 12:02:13 2015 UTC,Can you explain the 'traps are from improper curling form'.    Would that mean you could curl to way to build larger traps?
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,aussiequestions,0,Mon Jul 13 12:12:32 2015 UTC,I think it's slightly tongue-in-cheek. Do not curl to develop traps.
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,modernbenoni,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"He uses his traps to help the weight up while curling. Kinda like a little jump while you're shrugging heavy, to get the weight moving."
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,kraken514,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:20:14 2015 UTC,Not natty
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,fede37,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. He has pretty much no upper chest compared to lower, and his shoulders are unimpressive compared to his traps and lower chest. Very possible natty"
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,Tiny311,0,Mon Jul 13 12:34:50 2015 UTC,Why are you getting downvoted?
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,kraken514,3,Mon Jul 13 21:38:47 2015 UTC,because people on this sub don't lift and don't want to believe that an impressive physique is obtainable because it would mean someone put effort into their body
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,Tiny311,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you for clearing that up"

nattyorjuice,3d44b3,Eugen_sandow,0,Mon Jul 13 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"I generally don't think you can have arms and delts this big while being that lean without juice.  On the other hand, he's got a lot of very weak bodyparts and steroids grow all muscles, even if you don't really work them.  So could be natty."
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,eXXaXion,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"Not really true about the growing all parts, but too tired to get into it.  That said, I think I agree. The angle of the shot is going him a lot of justice, but he really could be natty. Its right on that edge."

My verdict is if he just did an upper body workout, could potentially be natty, I would err towards juicy but he's black.  I think he has no legs, so to be that high on FFMI with seriously lagging bodyparts, he's on steroids."

Not too far off from ""natty"" with good pump and lighting like you say but it's simply not a natural look.  I lol at people who call natty on these kind of physiques, but somehow when they reach (if ever) 10% or lower bodyfat they don't bat an eye when they have liters of water splashing around beneath their skin (as opposed to all the water being in their muscles and barely none beneath the skin) causing them to look both flat and soft. Guess they are just so delusional that they think they look like this."
nattyorjuice,3d44b3,niceandfull,0,Tue Jul 14 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"I saw that guy aswell, manlet version of polska genetics. I'm sure at this point you could post matt ogus here and at least 50% of the people would defend his natty status."

nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,4,Mon Jul 13 15:57:14 2015 UTC,No I work out! But yeah this is the point of the subreddit! Its being realistic! I appreciate everyone who works hard on their physique. But again all of us have different situation and not all of us candidate our entire lives on it.  But who do you know they are 110% natural?
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,-4,Mon Jul 13 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  But that's the difference with these guys.  When they would start prep I wouldn't see them outside the gym for 20 weeks, and towards the end of prep they were cranky as fuck.  Every detail was planned out, every macro planned, and they wouldn't deviate.  They wouldn't even have cheat meals inside 16 weeks.  I couldn't do it. I love cheeseburgers and pizza and beer."
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,miketheblade,-3,Mon Jul 13 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"How do I know? Because they're my friends, I know them, I know their personalities.  Their personalities didn't change with the addition or removal of drugs or PCT.  They didn't gain or lose weight or strength quickly. I've had discussions with them before about it.  They had no reason to lie about it.  They aren't IG personalities, or trying to be.  Our entire group of friends used except for them so it's not like they would have been the odd ones out.  Think about your best friend.  How do you know he's natty right now?"
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,modernbenoni,3,Mon Jul 13 20:25:09 2015 UTC,Then good for them!

nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,7,Sun Jul 12 17:58:51 2015 UTC,Natural lifters don't retain so much muscle when they diet down and their delts never are so out of proportion.

nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,modernbenoni,5,Mon Jul 13 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"The fuck are you talking about?  It's well established that when anyone diets down they lose LBM, especially natural lifters, just look at any natural bodybuilding competition.  I see your comments all over Reddit and you are full of shit. You mention elsewhere you're on gear, now you have unrealistic expectations of what is achievable naturally because you are using drugs and see much easier results.  You probably think early Arnold is doable naturally, and a young Ronnie Coleman when he was fucking jacked is achievable because 'good genetics'."
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,jabbahabba,-3,Mon Jul 13 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"Two of those pictures ARE from an OCB show. So yeah, I know exactly what a natty lifter can look like when he is smart about his dieting. I posted to show everyone here."

nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,quackamoly,-3,Mon Jul 13 14:05:14 2015 UTC,Did you miss the part where I said these guys are my friends and I am 110% sure they are natty? I will place any wager on it.
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,quackamoly,3,Mon Jul 13 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"if u even were 110% sure on it, why the fuck post it on here?  u obviously have some doubt which is logical since they are in fact juicy. im sorry that they lied."
nattyorjuice,3d0tmo,fishburn7,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:00:14 2015 UTC,Your reading comprehension skills are as good as everyone else's juicy or not skills lol.  I posted it as a rhetorical question lol.  There's not a doubt in mind.  I wanted to prove a point to everyone.
nattyorjuice,3czf74,3gIGkBlLOk,8,Sun Jul 12 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"Obtainable natty, but would take a while plus an amazing diet to get abs like that. He could have taken a few, but that is possible natty"
nattyorjuice,3czf74,Tiny311,2,Sun Jul 12 07:12:19 2015 UTC,take a while plus an amazing diet to get abs like that   or Photoshop... which these clearly are
nattyorjuice,3czf74,kraken514,3,Sun Jul 12 16:19:50 2015 UTC,But these are easily obtainable. Most college runners have better midsections than this. I knew a few at lower d3 schools that have better abs and are at a lower bf% than him. They dont have the chest mass but thats not what they train for. This is 100% obtainable natty

nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,NotTheClA,-11,Sun Jul 12 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"Really? I see this as a classic case where someone looks unaesthetic but is OBVIOUSLY on gear.   His traps, neck, puffy nipples, stretch marks, acne, and bloating give it away. He's juicy as hell."

nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,KennethGloeckler,-12,Sun Jul 12 03:21:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pretty much. If your physique looks noticeably impressive, then I don't think you got there naturally. Exceptions are if you're a freak athlete or a genetic freak like John Cena. But ironically, if you are extremely gifted, then you'll like juice up anyway since you'll be making money from your physique or athleticism. Seeing a random dude who just happens to be naturally jacked is rare imo."
nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,Fleshgod,6,Sun Jul 12 03:30:44 2015 UTC,That is probably the saddest thing I have ever read. If you look at all decent you're not natty. Holy shit. Seriously do you even lift?

nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,lsaz,-5,Sun Jul 12 04:20:08 2015 UTC,"How are his traps so enormous? Coincidence?  My guess is he wanted bigger arms and shoulders so he kept upping the steroids doses. Upper traps of course respond best to anabolics, and that's where he got all of his growth."
nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,konzine,3,Sun Jul 12 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"lmao, my traps are just as big as his and I developed them from kettle bell lifting. Jerks, cleans, snatches and maybe a little help from pull ups and jiu-jitsu. This physique is very easily possible and this is not impressive."
nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,Zorpheus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:42:59 2015 UTC,what this guy said.  most OLY lifts build your traps like nothing else. he probably played football at one point and was fat - hence the stretch marks and higher bf%. guy is 100% natty i wouldnt even give it a 2nd thought

nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,Cleglaw,4,Sun Jul 12 03:06:37 2015 UTC,Hard to tell because of the high fat % but his chest definitely takes longer than 7 months to achieve unless its all fat. That said I still agree with you his physique is by no means impressive or has any signs of gear use.
nattyorjuice,3cyxpt,Tiny311,2,Sun Jul 12 04:04:17 2015 UTC,Nothing special here.

Also someone posted this his actual routine on r/bodyweightfitness a day or so ago.  Honestly the Routine was not a great one. This guy did say ina comment on you tube that he prepares all his meals at home and doesn't eat junk. he weighs like 170 ilbs and is sorta tall.

The circumference of your leg bones plays an enormous role in your calf size. Most naturally fat people are naturally strong -- they're the strongest, in fact, even compared to mesomorphs.

nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,konzine,12,Mon Jul 6 07:30:38 2015 UTC,All the too athletes use gear of some form. In order to stay competitive they don't have a choice.
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,dssssd,-1,Mon Jul 6 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"So. fucking. full of it. This is just what internet people have decided now. It is the consensus. Not that they actually KNOW any better than before, but they've decided it makes sense so it must be so. I have yet to see any compelling evidence for this line of thought besides the asses of internet people"
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,konzine,2,Tue Jul 7 04:21:16 2015 UTC,..lots of athletes get caught with gear wtf
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,dssssd,2,Tue Jul 7 04:40:47 2015 UTC,Yes lots my point is it has become the attitude that 'everyone who relies on their body is on gear.' That is a pretty big leap from 'lots of athletes have been caught with it.'
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,konzine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing at all in the least that the internet is quick to jump on the gear train, I do it too.. But I do it because I'm well versed and have personal experience with gear. Most of the time it is pretty clear if someone uses, and then there is the fine line where you can't tell  I personally think supplementing your hormones is in no way a bad thing as long as it is done safely and responsibly. Caitlyn Jenner can take hormones and she is a hero, but a bodybuilder takes hormones and he is a fucking outcasted cheating cunt. They are the same thing, testosterone and estrogen.. No difference.  The problem lies in people who say they are natty and aren't. They skew the perspective and are the entire reason subreddits like this exists. Who could blame them? There is such a misunderstanding and negative stigma around them... Would you believe me if I told you that in 99% of circumstances, a cruise dose of 200mg/week of Test E is actually beneficial to your health? Can lower blood pressure, clear up acne and help you maintain a healthy weight. But that doesn't matter because what I just said goes against everyones knowledge.  I invite everyone who thinks they have any say in this to actually do some research into gear, steroids, hormones... whatever you want to call them. They aren't the big bad monster everyone thinks. in fact, they are safer than 99% of drugs including caffeine and tobacco.."
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,dssssd,2,Tue Jul 7 05:38:45 2015 UTC,Is this copypasta? It has nothing to do with my point. My point is that I am tired of the internet rule that 'everyone who relies on their body must be on PEDs.' It's become the accepted stance on here but I have yet to hear any solid proof for this rule beyond the speculation of internet people. That is all. I am saying people are speculating beyond what they can know.
nattyorjuice,3ca1t8,johnyann,2,Tue Jul 7 15:37:03 2015 UTC,Pro athletes that use gear generally don't look like body builders that use gear. They still look fairly normal. Especially with the klitchkos.   I'd say it's 50/50 on this one.

THen he decided to cut. He doesn't mention that in either the title nor in the post. Claiming he did this in a year is misleading. I mean, look at his upper bakc or arms in the before pics. In some pics he looks big because he's literally standing 5 inches from the camera  Is his physique achievable natty ?? YES.

nattyorjuice,3c0cqf,Kwizkey,7,Fri Jul 3 23:29:23 2015 UTC,My vote is on the juice.

I just do not like the life is x times better speculation, there r still juicy people offing themselves. And drugs of whatever kind do not solve problems, they just will make you care less.   Unless your problem is a lack of muscle or brain size, drugs can alter that ( for the not so educated brain-size =! Intelligence )."
nattyorjuice,3c0cqf,Coma-,4,Sun Jul 5 01:36:53 2015 UTC,"No, because heroin and meth are physically addictive drugs. Physically addictive drugs rarely lead to happiness in the long run because they create negative feedback loops in the brain.   Anabolic steroids are not physically addictive (they are slightly psychologically addictive though). When used prudently, anabolic steroids have relatively minor side effects and can improve a man's life in dramatic ways. They are especially useful for guys who got shafted in the physical giftedness department."
nattyorjuice,3c0cqf,knorg,0,Sun Jul 5 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"Read a bit up on Memantine; it reverses amphetamine tolerance and hinders dopaminergic excitotoxicity.  Remote stimulant doses can increase your kearning efficiency by a magnitude which can also drastically improve your life. Stimulants are also not to all people addictive I used to take lots of em like candy, I just stopped one day. Well that is because I didnt want to stack em with AAS.  If you say minor side-effects you mean TRT and a bit above? As someone who used to blast I do not see the reason for those doses unless you are as you said deficient. If you are talking those doses, yes hormones are extremely safe. But hell most amphetamines have neuroprotective doses, where they actually help your brain. Just saying that I think it is weird to act like one sub-set of groups is totally good and another is the devil."

Some genetic freaks may do it better."

nattyorjuice,3btgm3,snow_reefer,-10,Thu Jul 2 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"His physique isn't that impressive, but I'd bet anything he's juicy.  Steroids are very common in frats (especially at a big public university like Moorehead State). Every frat will have at least one football player or bodybuilder who is a heavy juicer, and they'll soon get the rest of the brothers to try a cycle or two. This guy probably drinks 4-5 nights a week and works out his arms and chest a couple days a week with his bros, but he still manages to have a very buff physique that would put the vast majority of men to shame. He's juicy -- count on it."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,7,Thu Jul 2 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"You really think everyone and their 95 year old grandmother is on juice don't you.  Plus, apparently you dislike fraternities.  Do you think all these people have the money to pay for juice and where do you get these statistics?  Most fraternity members are more dad bod status than bodybuilders.  Sure, you'll have the occasional jacked guy, but it's a rarity, unless you're in PIKE."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,Vantius,-5,Thu Jul 2 03:52:14 2015 UTC,"This guy has a VERY solid build. Huge chest and arms, big traps, and big shoulders. He just isn't that lean. Also, his face looks pretty puffy (chubby cheeks and no jawline -- kind of suspicious). Most men CANNOT build as much upper body muscle mass as this guy has without drugs. It's simply impossible for the majority of men. Now, there are some genetic freaks who can, but the odds that this guy just happens to be one of those freaks is MUCH SMALLER than the odds that he takes steroids.   And yes, I claim that most guys who are noticeably muscular are on steroids, because most guys who are noticeably muscular ARE IN FACT on steroids. Humans are a very frail, lightly-muscled species. We're lean, endurance athletes, by default. So most guys who are walking around with close to 200 pounds of lean muscle ARE on drugs. It's just not in our genetic code to be like that."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,4,Thu Jul 2 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"Please show me what you consider a normal amount of muscle that a man can have?  You only draw your conclusions on what is normal because the majority of American men do not lift or exercise as much (almost never) as they should.  If they did, they would have much more muscle mass and better physiques.  Also, these decisions are made based on photos and not by observing the person in person.  Both pictures he is tan, which accentuates muscle by boosting shadows, and in darker lighting, again boosting shadows and thus musculature.  Finally, please go see a therapist.  It appears to me that you have serious inadequacy and self esteem issues in regard to your own body.  I bet most people are not on gear that you say they are."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,Vantius,-4,Thu Jul 2 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"GENETICS bro.  Someone with freak genetics like Mark Henry can carry 300 pounds of DRY muscle with minimal effort.  Someone with bottom-tier genetics like Justin Bieber has to kill himself in the gym just to look more muscular than the average 12-year-old boy.  That said, this fratboy actually appears to have good genetics (he has thick wrists and ankles, and big forearms). I still don't think he's natural because he's carrying a ton of muscle mass even for a big-framed person and because he's probably not living an ideal lifestyle for muscle building, being in a frat and all. His upper arms are, what? 16, 17 inches? That's ENORMOUS for a man, especially someone who seems to be shorter than average. I think it's very unlikely that he's natty.   For comparison, this guy has a way better physique than Jason Blaha, who blasts and cruises as well as uses peptides.   http://i.imgur.com/myuCQmT.png  So Jason Blaha = year-round gear usage and decades of powerlifting experience, while the fratboy has never even touched a drug? Do you realize how absurd that sounds?"
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,-3,Thu Jul 2 04:30:10 2015 UTC,"Blaha used to be a bodybuilder and is probably much more dedicated to working out than this frat boy is. With gear usage and a lot of food, powerlifting will produce very large muscle gains, not far off from bodybuilding. The only powerlifters who still look small are the ones who are sticking to the lower weight classes.   Jason Blaha, is 5'9'', 220 pounds, but most of his muscle is in his hips and thighs (aka the natty muscles). The fratboy seems to have at least as much muscle mass at a lower body fat, AND it's all in his upper body (which are the muscles that are most sensitive to androgens and are the hardest to grow naturally).  This fratboy is NOT natty."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,4,Thu Jul 2 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"God you're such a fucking idiot. You don't know anything about steroids or bodybuilding.  Please stop commenting here literally everyone here hates what you have to say. You probably spend all day online calling juice on anyone who even looks like they go to the gym and probably don't even lift yourself.  I almost fell sorry for you, but in the end I just think you're a dyel jelly phaggot and can't stand a word you have to say.  Please leave reddit and educate yourself you fucking suck at life."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,thebeltsander,0,Thu Jul 2 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have tons of experience with juice and bodybuilding. I know the telltale signs of juice because I've used it myself and have watched tons of my friends go through cycles. There's an unmistakeable look that guys on supraphysiological levels of anabolic hormones possess. It's not just about how big they are or how ripped they are -- it's more about carrying too much muscle for their skeletal frame size."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,5,Thu Jul 2 09:53:57 2015 UTC,I doubt any of that is true. Anyone can make unsubstantiated claims on the Internet and pretend to be an expert.  Considering pretty much everything you said on this sub oozes ignorance I don't have any reason to believe a word you say.
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,thebeltsander,0,Thu Jul 2 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"No, the problem is that very few people here understand the limits of natural human muscle growth. And there's a very strong tendency toward delusion among beginner bodybuilders/powerlifters (i.e., everyone here), because they want to believe that their efforts will pay off substantially in the form of a muscular body that turns heads."
nattyorjuice,3btgm3,knorg,3,Thu Jul 2 22:55:42 2015 UTC,I'm 27 and I've been lifting since I was 19. With consistency and diet I've achieved a physique that most people would find impressive drug free.  The problem with you is that you probably had no patience or will power to stick with a diet and grind through years of gym sessions and just decided the only way you can look like you lift is to take drugs.  That's of course of you even ever took drugs or lift in the first place.  You are misguided and people with your outlook do more harm than good.  Fuck off

nattyorjuice,3bjcsv,knorg,5,Mon Jun 29 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"Classic example of trying to cherry-pick pictures to make his transformation seem natural.  This guy is 100% juicy:  https://instagram.com/p/pdrB80ttOB/?taken-by=naso_official  I don't know his height and weight, but he's definitely bigger than Zyzz and probably Jeff Seid."
nattyorjuice,3bjcsv,modernbenoni,2,Mon Jun 29 20:12:35 2015 UTC,Zyzz was bigger than Seid bro
nattyorjuice,3bjcsv,knorg,2,Tue Jun 30 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"Zyzz was 4 inches taller, but they weighed roughly the same. Jeff Seid is bigger in terms of FFMI."

nattyorjuice,3blt59,CrypticCrippled,2,Tue Jun 30 06:55:04 2015 UTC,What's not natty -- his HAIRLINE. It is really impressive how well they hide his balding. I need some of that Hollywood magic.
nattyorjuice,3blt59,GatoradeIV,4,Thu Jul 2 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"Of course lol  Btw, it's hollywood so : overhead light + lights around him to make him pop out more, fake tan, pump and probably some make up. That's his body in plain daylight"

nattyorjuice,3blt59,JakeyG14,2,Tue Jun 30 13:30:36 2015 UTC,I would say he's natty considering his role for Foxcatcher and he is normally unimpressive compared to other actors his caliber.
nattyorjuice,3bfvjl,raul_passos22,11,Sun Jun 28 21:27:28 2015 UTC,Juice. Even he looks surprised that he has that much muscle in the 4th picture.

I mean, I wish it would, given I'm the same height but 20 lbs lighter at that body fat.  Oh, also his bench press is a giveaway too. Ain't no 5'11 natties walking around repping 4 plates."
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,EqusG,4,Sat Jun 27 22:51:44 2015 UTC,Ain't no 5'11 natties walking around repping 4 plates.   Really? Also that's a 1rm
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,ahallgarth5,2,Sun Jun 28 00:19:32 2015 UTC,My bad.  A 405 bench is still a massive bench.  I've never seen anyone I trust to be natural ever bench 4 plates that isn't huge (i.e. extremely tall and extremely heavy. It's different if you're 6'3 and 250 lbs but at that level of leanness at his height...)
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,EqusG,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:51:53 2015 UTC,What about say john haack or Brett Gibbs?
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,ahallgarth5,0,Sun Jun 28 05:49:28 2015 UTC,What do you think his ffmi is? At 10% he's 25.9. He's young and been working out for EIGHT YEARS.
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,squak_more,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"Right, which is extremely high, and given how sliced that guy looks in some of his other pictures (you can look them up, but here's an example: http://imgur.com/WBcXcoP)  I would say significantly lower. Probably 8%. He looks like he's a few weeks out.  So 26-27 FFMI.  A few problems.   He could just be lying about his weight and be really good at taking pictures to exaggerate his size. Who knows. It's possible. I don't know this guy, and if weight is anything like dick size, maybe this guy only weighs 195, which is a big difference.    Or 2. He's just not natural.  I would also like to point out that 8 years is extremely irrelevant when talking about naturals. Yeah, I know naturals that have been lifting for 15 years. Guess what? They stopped growing 10 years ago. You don't keep getting bigger when you're hormone free. You cap out and can't really make any physique improvements other than conditioning and muscle quality if you compete. Continuing to get bigger and bigger is a clear sign of gear usage. You can get stronger over time, but even it gets progressively harder each year and you become more and more injury prone."
nattyorjuice,3bbkcy,EqusG,8,Sun Jun 28 17:20:30 2015 UTC,Juicy.

But when you see stretch marks in combination with other signs of juice (high muscle mass, bodybuilder proportions, trap veins, huge physical transformation), it's yet another indicator of a person's use of steroids. You need to look at the whole picture."
nattyorjuice,3bazeh,knorg,5,Sat Jun 27 20:03:16 2015 UTC,Knorg are you natty
nattyorjuice,3bazeh,Thatsnotawaffle,0,Sat Jun 27 22:54:01 2015 UTC,Nope. I juiced up a few months after I got into weight lifting because I realized that I didn't have the genetics to get big naturally. I'm very good at recognizing guys who juiced up right away because I've been there myself. I have the EXACT same stretch marks under my armpits that this guy has. There's no way it's a coincidence. And just the shape of this guy's body gives him away -- it's not anatomically normal to have such broad shoulders and a tiny waist.

He is strong as fuck and remains very lean year round and countless of other people have achieved the same results using his Warrior Shredding and Greek god programs. He is one of the hardest working fitness experts I know and puts out fabulous YouTube content almost on a daily basis. You guys who are sceptical of him should check out Kinobody.

nattyorjuice,3b85y2,Link_GR,7,Sat Jun 27 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"Juicy and misleading.  He calls himself ""fat"" in the before picture, even though he's very muscular with a little bit of a fat over it. It's obvious that he had been lifting for quite a while and probably took juice to get there. His ""transformation"" itself is nothing impressive, which is why he's tricking you into thinking he's natty.  Also, he's repping 315 on the bench press at a bodyweight of 170 pounds and dumbbell shoulder pressing 100s for reps.  https://instagram.com/p/3t_3lGlne5/  His bench and overhead press numbers put him in the ELITE category, and anyone who knows anything about juice and lifting, knows that upper body pressing strength is the one that is most strongly correlated with steroid usage.  This guy is NOT natty."
nattyorjuice,3b85y2,knorg,6,Fri Jun 26 20:14:27 2015 UTC,If you can't attain that physique or rep 315 naturally then all natty lifters should just quit right now

nattyorjuice,3b85y2,macdemarco,2,Fri Jun 26 21:14:45 2015 UTC,He doesn't look juicy. And what world do you live in that 315 bench for a 170 pound guy means that he is juicing? 315 is not that impressive for a natty 170p. Your argument would be valid if he was pressing around 400s.
nattyorjuice,3b85y2,Rhyno08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"While I agree with him not looking juicy, repping 315 at 170 is extremely impressive.

However considering Zac is in hollywood, it wouldn't be at all surprising if he was using steroids.   Imo Scott Herman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEtMRF1ywKMc4sf3EXYyDzw) is a good guide to seeing what's achievable natty. I feel as though he has fairly average genetics and is around his natty limit. He's certainly big and has a great phsyique, but isn't insanely huge or insanely shredded like lots of fitness models and bodybuilders you see. I mean, it's essentially the guys job to lift (and make videos about lifting/train others to lift), he seems to really know what he's talking about (does tons of research), and has been lifting for something like 15 YEARS. He's almost certainly at his limit. So in general I think he's a good benchmark, if someone looks significantly larger than him, or is similarly big but a lot more shredded, theres a good chance there's juice involved."

His physique is totally achievable natty, but really difficult with such crazy schedules.  As far as what's possible natty, Jeff Cavaliere from Athlean, Victor Costa and Scott Herman come to mind.

nattyorjuice,3b9aex,bicureyooz,-3,Mon Jun 29 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"It all depends on your genetics. Not everyone has the potential to look muscular without drugs.   I judge people on a case-by-case basis, for that reason. Zac Efron appears to have outstanding genetics for bodybuilding (wide shoulders, long arms with long muscle bellies, shortish torso, big forearms, mesomorphic build). I believe he has the ability to have achieved his physique naturally, but given his profession, I suspect that steroids probably played role.  Now if someone like Mclovin suddenly showed up with a muscular body like Zac's, I would say roids in a heartbeat. He doesn't have the potential to put on a sizable amount of muscle.  http://i.imgur.com/E1cxM4E.jpg  Also, even if he did put on 40 pounds of muscle, he would still look like shit due to his insertions and proportions. Guys who look weird with a lot of muscle (e.g., huge biceps with tiny forearms) probably didn't get there naturally."
nattyorjuice,3b9aex,knorg,0,Sat Jun 27 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"Very much agree with this. It's all about where they started from before they ever even started lifting. Some guys already have a solid base of muscle without having ever picked up a weight in their life so it's perfectly possible for them to achieve an impressive physique without gear. Other guys start off with next to nothing and have no chance. I was one of those guys before I started lifting, 105lbs at 5'9"" which is why I chose to use gear"

Very quick progress (especially after a plateau) - self explanatory.  Acne - generally ""bacne""; bad back acne.  Unreal leanness while retaining ""full"" looking muscles - sign of cutting agents like Clenbuterol, Ephedrine, Trenbolone, etc.   Sudden increase in facial and/or body hair - testosterone is responsible for the growth of the aforementioned hairs. Elevated levels can also speed up balding.  Distended gut - a sign of HGH use. 1, 2, 3.

It's very hard to become jacked if you were ever skinny, the reason being that people who have the potential to become very muscular have been that way all their life. If you finished puberty and ended up as a skinny man, then you simply don't have the genetics for a muscular physique.   Also, veins in unusual places are an obvious sign. Normal people don't have visible veins in their shoulders, chest, traps, and neck. They have them in their hands, forearms, and MAYBE their upper arms if they're in good shape.  Here's an example of a classic ectomorph transformation that everyone here would think is natty.   http://i.imgur.com/qXxubKc.jpg  People here would say he's not that big (which is true) or that he spent years transforming (which is true).

nattyorjuice,3b3zxo,smash214,0,Thu Jun 25 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because juice suddenly gives you great genetics, right?  The reality is that a lot of guys take juice for years and years and still didn't look good. However, this guy does have a lot of muscle mass for his height and looks pretty young.   Having juicy muscle mass =/= looking good. Good insertions make you look good. That's why all the black guys who get posted here get accused of juicing but few of the white guys do. You guys mistake good genetics for juice and bad genetics for lack of juice."
nattyorjuice,3b3zxo,knorg,-16,Thu Jun 25 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"He's definitely juicy. Arms are really pumped and his blood pressure looks high (if you feel his forearm veins, they'll probably feel like cables). If you're so muscular and vascular that you look unhealthy (as this guy does), you did NOT get there naturally."
nattyorjuice,3b3zxo,knorg,11,Thu Jun 25 22:29:34 2015 UTC,I want whatever you're taking to be able to determine a person's blood pressure by looking at a picture of them. #UselessSuperpower
nattyorjuice,3b3zxo,Vantius,-8,Thu Jun 25 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"Umm...my eyes and a brain?  Steroid users have obvious signs of high blood pressure and high hematocrit that normal people don't have. Namely, reddish skin, excessive sweating, high resting heart rate, high body temperature, and increased vascularity (especially in places normal people don't have visible veins, such as the neck, traps, chest, shoulders, etc.). Also, guys on juice have veins that feel different from normal ones. When you press a normal vein, you can totally compress it, but guys on juice have veins that are hard as steel because their blood pressure is so high.  http://i.imgur.com/1tRdImR.jpg  The guy in the OP has the exact same look to his veins that Hafhtor Bjornsson does. This is NOT an anatomically normal look for humans!  Honestly, if this is news to you, then maybe you shouldn't be posting on this sub."
nattyorjuice,3b3zxo,knorg,4,Thu Jun 25 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"His blood vessels look normal in OP pictures, plus the resolution isn't the best quality. Also when looking at a photo, you cannot make assumptions about things like blood pressure, resting heart rate, and body temperature.  And since we are looking at a photo, you have to take into consideration the lighting and background colors.  Additionally some of the physiological aspects you listed also are comon in people who have just finished vigerous exercise. So, next time you try your bs, link to a reputable medical journal on PubMed. It makes your arguments! Ore believable than a photo."

nattyorjuice,3b20hq,Rhyno08,2,Thu Jun 25 09:31:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think this physique is unobtainable, however it would take some serious weightlifting plus a strict diet. I don't think one could achieve this in under 3 or 4 years of weight lifting.   With that being said, I think most actors like Efron are most likely taking test. That plus personal training, personal diet plans, and plenty of time to workout all contributes to looking like that in such a short time."
nattyorjuice,3b20hq,konzine,2,Thu Jun 25 12:12:33 2015 UTC,No reason to be ashamed. While I don't think his physique is unobtainable naturally I do think the amount of time (~1 year) he achieved it was.  Probably blasted test for a few cycles. Nothing super neat.

nattyorjuice,3ayxux,sigmundfroid,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:41:41 2015 UTC,Do you have anything close to his genetics? His muscle insertions are elite. It doesn't take much for him to grow or look big. He's only 240 but looks so much bigger because his muscles are so well-shaped.
nattyorjuice,3ayxux,sigmundfroid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"""Elite muscle insertions""? You're delusional.   He is 240lbs at a ridiculously low bodyfat while doing insane endurance training (16+ hours of low intensity steady state per week or more).   I reckon you don't hang around many tall guys, because then you'd know how fucking skinny they (we) are/look even after years of lifting.  Besides, he's an untested athlete in the golden age of steroids, he'd be professionally and financially stupid not to dope."
nattyorjuice,3ayxux,frazzleddd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because you and your buddies don't have good genetics? Most tall NBA players are actually in the overweight to obese BMI range with low bodyfat as well. They aren't your typical skinny virgin nerds who posts on Reddit.  Do you even know what muscle insertions are? Some guys (like you) have crappy insertions that don't cover the length of the bone and result in a lot of tendon. Others (like David Robinson and most black dudes) have muscle insertions that span more of their bone length and look naturally full and round (the exception being for calves -- black guys have bad calf insertions, which is why they don't grow).  http://i.imgur.com/BeHErob.jpg  So if you're a skinny white guy with bad insertions, I'm not surprised you didn't grow: it's literally impossible because there's no muscle on your body, just tendon. Don't assume that everyone else -- especially NBA players -- is as poorly endowed as you."

Also, his prominent Adonis belt is another thing you don't find in natties.  You can't say that because he isn't that big or doesn't look that good, he must be natty.

nattyorjuice,3aru0b,knorg,-4,Tue Jun 23 05:01:20 2015 UTC,They look like guys who juice and don't take bodybuilding too seriously or are ex-juicers. I doubt either of them has been a lifetime natty. (Especially the guy on the right -- his wrists are the size of a teenage girl's but his upper arms are bigger than 99% of adult men's. That's not possible without drugs.)

There are a lot of black guys who can get that big and lean naturally (not racist, just facts). You don't see it as much in America because most blacks eat fast food, but West Africans look like living gods (no homo). A lot of white guys can get Zyzz's size, but will struggle with the leanness. Even naturally lean white guys struggle to get below 8% bodyfat without drugs.  Of course, what made Zyzz so impressive wasn't just his size and leanness. It was his muscle insertions (especially his abs and serratus anterior muscles imo). That's not something that you can change."

nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,pretzelzetzel,0,Wed Jun 17 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"Lie about what? Steroid use?  First off, it's fucking illegal. Get caught with it and depending on your lawyer and other factors, you could easily face a misdemeanor charge or most likely a felony.   Secondly, look at his hair. Maybe he's in the military? You ever think of that? Maybe he's friends with his work buddies on Facebook, and if he goes around gloating, and his commander gets word of him using, guess what, immediate investigation, drug tests, and then probably getting a dishonorable discharge. A lot of people have been kicked out of the military for steroid use.  Third--maybe he's a trainer and doesn't want his clients knowing. Fourth---maybe he pursues modeling on the side and has sponsors. Fifth-- maybe he doesn't want his hypothetical wife knowing, eventually getting a divorce and then she mentions steroid use in court, loses custody of his hypothetical kids he has in 10 years, and various other consequences that could arise out of his wife deciding to fuck him over (mentioning to health insurance. etc).  Who the fuck knows. These are merely speculations, but no matter what, it's probably not a good idea to post pictures like that of him on Facebook in the first place, and it's a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE idea to admit to anyone that you're using and possessing a schedule 3 drug, you dumb mother fucker."
nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,TheGreatDandeano,2,Wed Jun 17 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"I meant, why would he go around bragging about being natty when it's obviously not true? Do steroids if you gotta, I guess... but why actively deceive people? It's not like some girl approached him in a bar and asked if he was juicing and he deflected and said ""Nah, I don't do that."" He went out of his way to post a picture of himself comcomitant to the obvious lie that his gains were natural. Why, I ask? What does he gain by putting himself in the public eye only to lie about his drug use?  Also, your list serves better as a list of reasons not to use steroids in the first place than as a list of reasons to lie about it."
nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,pretzelzetzel,0,Wed Jun 17 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"but why actively deceive people?    I told you why, can you not fucking read? It's better to create doubt than to let others know the truth.    your list serves better as a list of reasons not to use steroids in the first place than as a list of reasons to lie about it.   It's both. The examples I listed are legit situations that have happened to steroid users who were not careful about their usage.   You can easily fuck your entire life up if you're not careful. Even telling your doctor can potentially hinder your ability to get basic health insurance....and that's just one example out of the many I listed. You should probably get off this sub though and go do some basic research. And if you're using, or have used, you're stupid for asking stupid questions/downplaying the seriousness of admitting to cycling."
nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,TheGreatDandeano,2,Thu Jun 18 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're not getting my point here... Let's take me for example. If he hadn't put his picture in that group, I (and everyone else in this subreddit) would almost certainly never have become aware of his existence. However, now we not only know he's alive, we all know he does steroids. Creating doubt is only preferable to a case of strong suspicion. It's much worse than total anonymity. If he's worried about repercussions of using steroids, he should be trying to maintain a low profile, not posting shirtless pictures to a public facebook group in which he chest and arms look like a map of the tributaries of the fucking Mississippi."
nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,pretzelzetzel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"I will try to answer your question. TheGreat is obviously too stupid.  So why is he actively proclaiming beeing a NATURAL bodybuilder? well, the main reason is probably the hype of the hole natural/astehtics/fitness scene. There will be more money in the future as in real(obvious steroid) bodybuilding.  second: by proclaiming natty you can and will attract all the young and naiv fellas as well as all the doubters...which he (the roadmap guy) will refer to as haters. The ""haters"" will help him to spread his name in the social media...which takes an important role if u wanna make it in the fitness industry."
nattyorjuice,3a4ps4,ossimc,-1,Sun Jun 21 09:49:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're not getting my point here   You asked why he doesn't admit to steroids, I told you why. And now you're saying shit like...   but why actively deceive people?   And then when I tell you again, which is the exact same fucking response as the first time, you come back and tell me I don't get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. But it doesn't change the answer.     we all know he does steroids.   Maybe WE do, but most of society doesn't know. The fact is, why doesn't Jeff Seid, or any of the people in the fitness industry who cycle, who we also talk about on this sub admit to steroids? Uh, because of my no.3 point that I listed above---sponsors. According to your point, Jeff Seid probably shouldn't post pictures either, along with a large portion of the fitness industry....  They deny. And that's as good as they can get."

nattyorjuice,3a18bd,mwpa7,-3,Wed Jun 17 03:40:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not in anyone's genetic code to be both big and lean. You can be lean and small or muscular and fat, but not both. Rounded delts, bulging biceps, and flared lats aren't something you see in nature.  I would say someone like Russell Westbrook is the peak of an aesthetic natural physique: http://i.imgur.com/ih0FHlU.jpg  Of course, he has freak genetics, and very few people can achieve his physique naturally. Also, the few who can are probably playing real sports like football and basketball rather than trying to make it as an amateur bodybuilder. The fitness industry seems to attract people with below average genetics, ironically."

nattyorjuice,39x8s6,imnumber4,10,Mon Jun 15 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Jealous friends/rivals/etc.  I always get sketched out when somebody posts photos of younger guys/guys who don't put themselves in the limelight. This isn't a particularly ethical sub when it comes down to it, conceptually. Accusing, or ""calling out"", people who deny using illegal hormones.   I feel the ethical line is drawn when people post publicly that they are natural. In doing so they open themselves up to the questions, and the accusations. But when a person is simply asked, in person, ""Hey bruh you juicing?"" and he responds with ""no""... I don't think that is the same in the context of the term ""Claiming natty"".  Wonder if maybe the mods could consider setting some rules regarding this at some point? The way specifically American high schools work, both legally and socially, puts young fit men in a slightly dangerous position.  Felt like waxing philosophical (as much as a basic bro can), work is slow."

To answer you well... if you have photos of yourself out there you really don't have much control where they end up. You have no reasonable expectations of privacy with photos taken in public or photos posted online.  The whole point of this sub reddit is to speculate on natural or not.

Some guys just want to be big and bulky.  That said, I think this kid is juicy. His anterior deltoids are enormous. Anterior delts are one of the muscles that blow up from steroid use (because of high androgen receptors and because people train the hell out of it).   Also, his head looks way too small for his body, which is often an indicator that someone's juicy (usually head size is strongly correlated with muscular potential). Add in the fact that he looks kind of douchey and is flexing in a hot tub, and I'd say he's juiced.   MOST guys who are noticeably muscular are JUICED. I'm sure that in a few years when the natties on this board have made ZERO progress, they'll finally realize this."

nattyorjuice,39t18l,_Vova,0,Sun Jun 14 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Lol at the guy saying ""The only people claiming natty I really trust are ones who add the 'and now this is what I look like on juice!' afterwards."" No.. This is a common tactic used to make it seem like the juice didn't really play that big of a role in their results, that they are extremely hard workers or have superior genetics. Same idea as a fake natty, only it's a ""half"" lie instead of a complete lie. Seen it many times; open juicers will show pics from their ""natty time"" but they were already one or two cycles in at that point.   On topic, this particular guy looks like hes in the middle of his first blast with test+dbol on his ""natty"" pics. Yeah he could be natty there, but I don't think its a good example at all like you say it is."
nattyorjuice,39t18l,niceandfull,-6,Mon Jun 15 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"That guy is juicy in the before pictures too. 6'1'', 205lbs puts him at a BMI of 27 (overweight) even though he's shredded and vascular."
nattyorjuice,39t18l,knorg,0,Sun Jun 14 20:02:33 2015 UTC,So he has the same BMI as the Hodgetwins with WAY worse genetics and he somehow got there naturally while the Hodgetwins are heavy juicers according to this board?   Riiiggghhhttt.
nattyorjuice,39t18l,knorg,2,Sun Jun 14 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"Okay. It's difficult to explain to a layman because the fitness industry is SO incredibly warped so that models on juice can claim natty and sell their products telling us that it's the way to gain muscle just like them. Which is a lie. Hell, I though Arnold was natty until I was like 17... You don't get told these things.  Try to remove ALL information about muscle you have in your head. Forget about any body builder you have seen. Just go by the people you have seen in real life. The human body wasn't meant to be very muscular and ripped.   Natural body builders (and I mean truly natural. Natural bodybuilding contestants are also on steroids) look like a human. They look like skin and bone. They can still obviously be very impressive but they will still look like like just muscle, skin and bone.  Bodybuilders on juice look like plastic statues. There muscles are smooth, sculptured and full. They don't look like skin and bone.  IMPORTANT: As a general rule of thumb (because everyones genetic potential is different) if anyone looks ANY better than Scott Herman (google him) then they are extremely likely to be on juice. Also, bare in mind that when you google him, you'd see professional photographs with lighting, photoshop and weeks of diet preparation etc. to make him look at ripped as possible. Scott Herman is at his absolute genetic potential, already has very good genetics and has been training and dieting with extreme dedication for many many many years. So if anyone looks as good, or better, than him it's very very likely they're on juice. That shows you how screwed the industry is because a lot of people would say he looks ""small"". (Take note of how he looks like skin and bone).   However, someone can have a body less muscular and ripped than Scott Herman and be on steroids. For example, an underwear model will use drugs to achieve his body type more easily. Why would he gruel over staying natural?    Edit: I didn't go over specific details like you asked because I know others will. I think it would be more easier to just deem anyone else who looks ""better"" than Scott Herman to be on juice.  Edit: The skin and bone explanation can seen quite easily from /u/are_u_natty 's example. The guy on the left looks like he's modelled from plastic. He looks very athletic like he could run a marathon. However, the guy on the right looks like skin and bones. He looks very depleted and if you saw him in real life with no context you'd think he's ill. He doesn't look like he could run a marathon."
nattyorjuice,39t18l,Lemon_Destroyer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"for me when i'm asking myself if a buddy in my fitness, the 3 things i watch is the traps if they are really huge and seems to be always congest. the shoulder normal shoulder have not the shape of a ball, when you see juicy shoulder you can see that the muscles are really round. The last thing is the skin, when someone is on gears you can see that the skin is a bit thinner, like if there are no subcutaneous tissues. if you have the 3 things together it's more likely that he is on juice."
nattyorjuice,39t18l,Mehdisk8,-5,Sun Jun 14 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Well, pretty much anyone who takes bodybuilding, powerlifting, or strongman seriously will experiment with roids at some point.   If I see someone who is naturally unathletic looking sporting a muscly physique or impressive weight lifting numbers, I usually assume he's on juice. The average Joe can't develop a body that turns heads, let alone someone who went through high school looking like Mclovin and being shoved in lockers: https://www.reddit.com/r/nattyorjuice/comments/34nruf/tim_thebodeau_elite_powerlifter/  Also, it seems like steroid users are the ones who seek attention the most. Pretty much anyone with a Youtube fitness channel or Instagram account is likely on the juice. Someone who can develop a great physique naturally likely spent his entire life excelling at sports and getting laid with pretty girls. They never developed the inferiority complex that most steroid-using bodybuilders and powerlifters have."

Slightly off topic, it also seems like alot of gays are juicing up these days. I mean they are obsessed with muscular+shredded physiques so from a smv standpoint it gives them far more than straight men, and most of them probably aren't too worried about becoming sterile so they have a lot of incentive to juice."

nattyorjuice,39fev2,Fradyo,-2,Thu Jun 11 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a troll, but I do like to debate.  What bothers me about this sub is how quickly people will say that a Youtube/Instagram fitness guru is natty but how every pro athlete has got to be juiced up. Pro athletes are the ones who can actually develop great bodies naturally because of their exceptional genetics (especially NFL and NBA athletes). Someone who is trying to make a living through protein supplement affiliations on Youtube and selling ""online personal training"" is far more likely to be juiced because 1) they lack the genetics of elite athletes and bodybuilders (after all if they were so gifted, why wouldn't they be making millions of dollars in real sports?) 2) they have no drug testing 3) their income depends largely on their physiques and lifting abilities and 4) they have very little to lose.    Also, you guys need to realize that someone on roids can still look like crap because of their genetics. A guy with short muscle bellies and long limbs can still look skinny despite being juiced to the gills (see Tim Thebodeau: https://www.reddit.com/r/nattyorjuice/comments/38xj1k/this_powerlifter/)  You need to judge guys based on their progress and how much muscle mass they are carrying given their genetics."
nattyorjuice,39fev2,knorg,2,Thu Jun 11 23:00:42 2015 UTC,"All I want to know is,   Are you m00t? How do you know what genetics people have?"
nattyorjuice,39fev2,CLICK_HERE_TO_WIN,2,Fri Jun 12 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"Good genetics for bodybuiling means long muscle bellies for the most part. For instance, a good bicep would be one that goes all the way to the elbow instead of stopping a few inches short with a long tendon.   Elite genetics: http://i.imgur.com/wnrfXl1.jpg  Shit genetics: http://i.imgur.com/JgYjytJ.jpg  Those guys are the same age, believe it or not. Notice how the black guy has biceps going down to his elbows (despite being 6'9'') while the other guy's stop short and it's all fat below. Also, the guy with good genetics is naturally lean, with thinner skin and well-shaped deltoids. It's no coincidence that he's an elite athlete as well. Good musculature = good athleticism.  For strength, bone size is the ultimate indicator of good genetics. A guy with thicker bones with always be stronger than a guy of the same height with thinner bones. If you end up both tall and thick-boned, then you hit the jackpot for strength.  Mark Henry is one of the thickest people to ever live and is also quite tall (6'3''). It's no wonder he set weightlifting records with little effort and no drug usage. http://i.imgur.com/mAFvYYU.jpg  So good genetics for bodybuilding = full muscle bellies.  Good genetics for strength = thick bones."

nattyorjuice,39e8bt,DoctorSatan69,-6,Thu Jun 11 05:13:56 2015 UTC,Natty traps? https://instagram.com/p/2_xmlHlTYQ/  Here we go with the typical upvoting of natty claims and downvoting of (correct) juicy claims. All you newbies desperately want to believe that your Starting Strength and Jason Blaha programs are going to make you big and strong despite being genetically poor athletes who couldn't cut it in a real sport like football or a basketball and who only got into lifting at age 20 because you wanted to lose your virginity. Keep dreaming.
nattyorjuice,39e8bt,knorg,9,Thu Jun 11 06:51:49 2015 UTC,"Because traps when flexed, in position to make them seem bigger with oil and perfect lighting are indicative of juicing, right?"

Yes, I do keto, but not as lots of people label keto to be. Mainly my diet is more akin to a classic bodybuilder diet: adequate protein, lots of green veggies, and fat from meats, eggs, cheese, coconut / olive oil. Its not an ""all fat diet"", as I do it and explain it to people, it is a mostly unprocessed diet full of nutrients.

I bet if anyone  lifted for so long, avoided fuckarounditis, were strick and consistet with diet and with somewhat good genetics could avhieve the same.  Do you know of the Fat Free Mass Index?  ""A study of elite athlete (some admitted steroid users and some not) combined with an analysis of 20 Mr. America contest winners from the 1939-1959 pre-steroid era, determined that a fat free mass index of 25 is pretty much an upper limit for someone who does not use steroids.

nattyorjuice,396jyr,elzeardclym,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the size is definitely natty-achievable, whether or not this guy is actually natty himself. Just some things I'd like to point out to make my case:   No visible signs of side effects normally associated with AAS  In the first picture, he looks to be wearing a form-fitting shirt which emphasizes his wide shoulders and narrow waste. Not to mention, v-necks are popular shirts among gym goers for bringing out features of the upper body that make it appear larger (including those stated above, as well as making trap and upper chest development look better) Also evidenced in the first pic---no particular feature of his physique appears to be juicy. The shoulders are nice, but not out of proportion; the arms are developed, but far from big (my guess would be ~16 inches); and the wheels do not appear to be very large at all, given that he is able to fit them in what on first glance looks like skinny jeans. In other words, he doesn't have the freaky proportions normally attributed to juicers He does not look heavy for his height--maybe 5'11-6'0,180-190lbs. Assuming I am correct, most would say that is small according to the standard set by roid users The third picture is clearly taken with a pump and in very good lighting. It looks like he's standing in a group exercise room at a globo gym, and he seems to be perspiring a bit, which both suggest that he has just completed a workout Lastly, he doesn't appear to be outrageously ripped or dry. Even so, it is debatable whether the use of cutting agents makes an athlete ""not natty"" as it is commonly understood in the bodybuilding community   Edit: at second glance, he does not appear to be sweaty  Edit 2:  Okay, looks like he's 6'5, he made the bulk of his progress between 2010 and 2013, and weighed 225 at ~8 percent BF, which is an FFMI of 24.6. The fact that he essentially maxed out his natty potential in 3 years suggest juice."
nattyorjuice,396jyr,Perplexicles,3,Tue Jun 9 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"He's 6'5"", and in that third pic he claims to be 235lbs.  I completely agree that it may be attainable naturally."
nattyorjuice,396jyr,Perplexicles,4,Tue Jun 9 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"Haha, I totally believe with the right genetics this look is possible. However, given the circumstances stated here--the fact that he has a larger frame to fill, his claim of carrying so much lean mass, and the relative short time it took to make his progress--my guess is this guy is probably juicing.   In my experience though, if you are at or below the median height for males in the West, have average genetics for muscle-building, and you grind hard for 7-10 years straight (in your prime muscle-building years), this is not too far off from what you can achieve. Just expect to be between 10-12% BF rather than being in the single digits."
nattyorjuice,396jyr,niceandfull,2,Tue Jun 9 19:50:00 2015 UTC,Whatever he's on I want some
nattyorjuice,396jyr,Perplexicles,2,Tue Jun 9 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"you guys misunderstand FFMI grossly.. having 24.6 FFMI natty, at 8% bodyfat will not give you the same look as this guy. you will probably look amazing, but NOTHING compared to someone of similar FFMI and muscle insertions on gear.   tldr; you can achieve this FFMI. you can't achieve this look.  edit: and when i say you, i mean someone with elite genetics for hypertrophy."
nattyorjuice,396jyr,niceandfull,-1,Tue Jun 9 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"I believe I said at 10-12% BF, which is not nearly as lean as some people think. I agree that at 8% BF naturals usually look very depleted, and I would even go so far as to say that 24.6 FFMI with single-digit BF may require elite genetics to achieve naturally. Normal people don't have unlimited time to devote to lifting, resting, and getting proper nutrition--everyone occasionally has to take shortcuts to fit bodybuilding into our daily lives, and all of these factors weigh more heavily against those of us who don't augment our results with drugs.   That said,  I still stand by my previous statement. Obviously if you compare a natural lifter and a roider who have equivalent lean mass side-by-side and pick apart various elements of their physiques (assuming they have similar proportions and genetics) you're going to find that on average the roider is going to look sharper and fuller. However, my point is that the level of lean mass and the ""general aesthetic"" presented by OP  is reasonably achievable for naturals with sufficient time in the gym, proper rest and  good nutrition, which is good enough for most people."
nattyorjuice,396jyr,europe_is_shit,3,Tue Jun 9 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"i don't fully disagree with you, i just think people have too high hopes for natty physiques for someone with average genetics. also, apart from maybe eugene sandow, i've never seen a true natty with 24.6+ FFMI at 10-12% bodyfat.. have you? and i mean true 10-12% bodyfat, as the overwhelming majority of bros underestimate their bodyfat by 5-10%."

nattyorjuice,396jyr,sick_stuff1,0,Wed Jun 10 07:31:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that most people underestimate their BF, and I agree that most non-drug users overestimate their potential. I just prefer to give those with borderline physiques the benefit of the doubt. I consider a physique borderline if it's under or only slight over 25 FFMI. Also, to some degree I use my personal experience as a marker, which is entirely subjective.  Edit: assuming about 7-10 years of hard work under ideal conditions, of course."

nattyorjuice,398ag5,knorg,2,Wed Jun 10 03:09:25 2015 UTC,He looks like an ex juicer. http://i.imgur.com/kDsCQyP.jpg  There's no way he's a life time natty imo.

In one breath you say he has no idea how to condition and looks full of water. In the next you find it suspicious that he looks full going into a comp.  There is nothing, nothing at all, that looks like steroids in the above."

nattyorjuice,38rn8p,Stan063,5,Sat Jun 6 05:55:45 2015 UTC,Guy was posted a month ago and consensus was juicy. Guy is huge.
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,Cleglaw,3,Sat Jun 6 13:12:23 2015 UTC,"Id guess juice because of context, and his sheer size. Natural bbing at those heights is hella tough afaik.   That said, this guy's hair has me jealous as shit."
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,BasicGymBro,2,Sat Jun 6 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Juice, for a LOT of reasons (muscle mass, narcissism, fitness career).   http://photos-e.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-ash/10311154_305252362971964_2012074679_n.jpg  ^ Transformations like that don't occur naturally. It's about the equivalent of a cross country runner turning into an NFL tight end after a few years of training."
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,knorg,2,Sat Jun 6 06:11:02 2015 UTC,"Lol, you're an idiot. I've seen some of your posts on this sub and you seem to think that people can't get from skinny to muscular in a few years."
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,c0rsack_2,-1,Sat Jun 6 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"Skinny guys have a very hard time putting on muscle naturally. How is that news to anyone? They aren't just smaller to begin with, but they also have poor potential for growth due to smaller bones, narrower joints, and shorter muscle bellies. A classic example is someone with thin ankles and small, high-set calves. There's literally nothing they can do to make them grow (even with steroids). Granted, most other muscle groups aren't as limited as calves, but someone with small wrists and short biceps bellies will never get huge arms naturally. So if you see someone with tiny wrists and big arms, it's almost always a sign that they are juicing."
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,knorg,3,Sun Jun 7 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"Or they have trained for muscular hypertrophy for a few years while maintaining a proper diet. The physiques I've seen you accuse of steroids are most of the time certainly attainable naturally. Also being skinny as a teen != not being able to put on mass while growing up.  http://www.reddit.com/r/nattyorjuice/comments/389qkd/thoughts/ - you accused this guy of jucing, like what the fuck do you think is the purpose in working out if you can't make such an average progress after training for 3 years?"
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,c0rsack_2,-2,Sun Jun 7 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"Ectomorphs typically don't respond well to strength training because they have lower proportions of fast twitch muscle fibers. You could say they are built for endurance sports, not explosive ones.  Here's an example of what an ectomorph with great genetics, a strong work ethic, and high motivation can achieve after several years of training.  http://i.imgur.com/8psVBbt.jpg  Transforming your body beyond recognition like O'Hurn did is not possible without drugs."
nattyorjuice,38rn8p,knorg,7,Sun Jun 7 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't an ectomorph, this is an anorexic kid after a 2 year progress.   Ectomorphs typically don't respond well to strength training because they have lower proportions of fast twitch muscle fibers.   Total BS, like every word in this sentence is wrong. Somatotypes don't exist and it's impossible to gauge proportions of muscle fibers by looking at someone.  You should refrain from posting on the topic when all you know is some broscience."

If you check out logs on youtube on sdrol/dbol cycles etc you'll find people you could never have guessed had taken anything, and even when they tell you, you are still in doubt because of how scrawny they are.  The thing to take into consideration imo is that this is a 1 year transformation, in the first year of training, from 13 to 14 years old.  My suspicion is that he's went on some oral cycle, didn't gain much muscle from it because he obviously is that young and doesn't know what he's doing. However he stayed on the drug long enough to reap the side effects of a tiny bit of fullness and vascularity, and that's why he has that look in good lighting."

nattyorjuice,37pj2e,Metric3036,0,Fri Jun 5 11:46:41 2015 UTC,I feel sorry for this guy! He's on roids and yet his chest and abs look awful! Overgrown shoulders and traps because of roids and underdeveloped chest and abs!
nattyorjuice,37pj2e,krisperioyu,0,Fri May 29 11:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely juicy. His chest looks okay though, it's just a weird pose. A bad pose for all muscles tbh. Why does he have his arms so far back? Smh. Abs are hidden because he isn't very lean. He has a good body though, idk why you're ragging on it."
nattyorjuice,37pj2e,modernbenoni,1 point,Fri May 29 12:55:44 2015 UTC,"His chest is pretty underdeveloped tbh. Most less than average-intelligent lifters who juice are usually bodypart-split, accessory loving broscientists and don't develop balanced physiques until they up the dose so much that their training almost doesn't matter anymore.

nattyorjuice,37irpu,SovietMoose,-4,Thu May 28 16:37:55 2015 UTC,I honestly believe Mark Henry is natural (and thus the strongest man to ever live). He weighed 215 pounds at age 10 and squatted 600 when he was 14. He dominated powerlifting and still holds drug-free records even though he didn't take the sport seriously at all. He grew up dirt poor and almost illiterate and didn't even know what steroids or supplements were until he started training for the olympics. He seems to have some of the thickest bones and widest frames of any person in the world.
nattyorjuice,37irpu,bangbangahah,2,Wed May 27 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"Its surely he probably has used them but funny thing is even though this dude grew up DIRTY fucking poor and was still ridiculous god damn strong as a very young teen people will still say roids.  This goes to show you there are people out there who truly do have insane genetics yet when we see these folks we will always say nope no way natty, has to be roiding.  I don't know where he'd be able to get roids as a 14 year old kid let alone pay for them since he was so poor but guaranteed everyone today would scream roids lmao."

Here's a little list of why you're wrong and should unsub so no one else has to listen to the ramblings of a creature so obviously from the bottom of the gene pool.  ""Amount of muscle mass@..? He's not even big. He has a large frame, and that's about it. I have friends who don't even fucking lift that are about his size just because they're big dudes. Look at the size of his actual muscles to see they aren't even very large.  ""Given his genetics"" sit the fuck down boy, you don't know squat about his genetics. You're a keyboard warrior looking at someone's Instagram. Lemme know when Instagram pictures let you see 3d models of a human body and the way their genetics work. Please.  ""Masculinizaed dramatically"" good god. He grew up. Guess what happens to the human body when it grows older? It's fucking changes. But nah I have a square jawline now and broader shoulders because I took androgens as a baby. Yup.

But when theres no dht compounds in the picture and no bare torso pics from the front it becomes difficult. Which would be smart to do if you wanna avoid all filt accusations (matt ogus most likely steers clear of dht compounds/ tren at all times but a good amount of people realize hes still on gear when they see his torso without a shirt on)"

nattyorjuice,374140,timmyfinnegan,1 point,Sun May 24 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"Part of that is that his shorts are too small, giving him a muffin top-which makes him look not lean even with abs."
nattyorjuice,374140,120poundstud,9,Tue Jun 2 03:30:41 2015 UTC,This sub is shit. That's attainable natural. Everyone here claims juice if the dudes got even a shred of muscle. Buncha fuckin half wits
nattyorjuice,374140,Thatsnotawaffle,3,Sun May 24 20:51:10 2015 UTC,Agreed!
nattyorjuice,374140,theox16,-4,Sun May 24 23:13:43 2015 UTC,This sub has a bunch of jealous do you even lift weak whiners who can't discipline themselves to make gainz. To all you guys here here think to call juice at the first sight let me ask you this. Do you track your diet?  Do you never miss a workout? Have you even lifted for more than a year +? Do you even have basic bodybuilding knowledge?  If you can't say yes to most of these questions please stop commenting. You can't speculate on someone's progress without understanding the process itself. If you have honestly done all day those things you would actually know what can be achieved by a person without drugs. Sitting at a keyboard and hating on guys all doesn't make you better at guessing natty or not. It makes you worse if anything.  Your perceptions are so warped you don't know what to think anymore.
nattyorjuice,374140,playah8rz,-2,Mon May 25 00:14:24 2015 UTC,I'm sure if he was leaner you'd be claiming otherwise.

nattyorjuice,374140,Thatsnotawaffle,0,Mon May 25 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"You are sadly mistaken if you believe all carbs are not bad.    That's attainable natural   You still haven't answered shit, you know nothing about carbs nor how this sub works   Buncha fuckin half wits   lol, who are u   No, I wouldn't   Yes, you would, hypocrite.

His physique is attainable naturally for a number of reasons. He's big but not huge and he isn't very lean. His muscles are full because his body fat is high enough to support it, but they don't have the ungodly glycogen storages a juiced physique would have. His delts are normal (as cliche am observation that is) and I don't see a single suspiciously bulging vein. Granted you can be on juice without some of these but you won't be on and not have any of them. Carbs CAN be bad yea just like water CAN be bad if you drink too much. Thanks for informing me that things can be bad. That was super helpful. If you have to post to r/fitness to ask about motherfucking carbs (lol) then you shouldn't be sauntering around fronting like you know anything about steroids."

nattyorjuice,374fss,TrenbleClef,2,Sun May 24 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"Juicing is always a possibility, even in sub-par physiques, but this dude seems natural. The pose he's in is notorious for complimenting well developed delts, and I'm willing to bet he's sporting a pump in this photo too. I say definitely natty."
nattyorjuice,374fss,profeyn,3,Sun May 24 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"Juicy for sure. His deltoids are disproportionately big.  Ironically, people here will say that Dwight Howard's deltoids are a sign that he's juiced (even though he's a 1 in a million genetic freak), but some random gym scrub who has similar deltoids is completely natty. Also, this guy doesn't even look that wide in terms of bone structure like Dwight is. His delts are ALL muscle. He's 100% on juice."

nattyorjuice,36vwko,dssssd,1 point,Fri May 22 22:01:58 2015 UTC,There are consequences for actors juicing? Sly got caught a bunch of times. Tom Hardy admitted to using for Bane. I could go on...
nattyorjuice,36vwko,SwordfshII,3,Sun May 24 19:31:31 2015 UTC,What's happened to this sub in this post?   OP is right. If your job is to be a model you'd take gear to have a good body. Even if it is to make it easier to maintain a not-obviously-juiced body like here.   What are you even on about? Him getting caught would have negative side effects? He's a model/ actor... he'd be expected to juice to meet deadlines easier.
nattyorjuice,36vwko,Lemon_Destroyer,5,Sat May 23 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"What the fuck are you on about? You don't need gear to look good or be big. ""Durr everyone whose job depends on their body would take gear"" has become a retarded refrain on the internet that gets automatically accepted as fact. You don't fucking know what these people are doing, and there are plenty of good reasons not to take gear. Acting like cynical know it all internet retards about shit doesn't actually make you knowledgeable. Most people on here don't know shit about dick all or they're lifters who hopped on gear before ever lifting seriously and so their opinions are next to worthless because all they think they have some super cool fast track knowledge where everyone juices but it's nothing but the product of internet retard echo chamber shit. Stop acting like you know what other people are doing or what the deal is with shit you don't know anything about, internet people. It makes you look dumb."
nattyorjuice,36vwko,dssssd,0,Sat May 23 02:52:10 2015 UTC,Do you take steroids?   My guess is no. My guess is that you think if you took gear you'd magically become superman.

Reread my post and realize you were wrong and are like 8 steps behind the discussion here.

nattyorjuice,36vwko,SwordfshII,0,Sun May 24 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Gonna be my last comment.  Sidebar:    NOTE if the person you are submitting makes a living off their physique you can near guarantee that juice is involved   Anabolic steroids and other substances, such as Clenbuterol, are not magical powders, as it seems you know. They also require sleep, resistance training and nutrition in order to maximise their effects. Even so, they only speed muscle growth and fat loss up to, and beyond, genetic potential.   Most models, an example being Wahlberg in this post, require keeping a fitness physique (unlike Mr. O competitors or even physique competitors) all year round as it's their career. Even though his muscle mass is not at his genetic potential, this DOES NOT mean he isn't on steroids. Steroids make it MUCH more simpler to keep their BF low whilst maintaining muscle mass (next to impossible being natural without bulking/ cutting phases). Why would they gruel over bulking then cutting in time for photoshoots etc. when their career/ finance is on the line when they can ""just"" take steroids?  HOWEVER, this does not mean Mark Wahlberg had to have been on steroids. He may or may not have. Not being at his genetic potential isn't a sign. Thus, on this sub we have to guess. He could have taken this photoshoot being natural. But seeing as his career centred around his body why would he? It's like going into a power lifting competition against someone wearing a bench shirt and you not wearing one just to prove something to yourself for no reason, even knowing you're going to lose."

nattyorjuice,36oa48,Longyard99,5,Wed May 20 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"Looking at your recent pics you have a lot of bloating and what seems to be water-weight, which is probably why you weigh as much as you do. And you're also not 13% bodyfat in those pictures IMO. Little to no vascularity, you most definitely do not have abs showing, those would be your ribs.   150-155 at the same height. I bulked for a year and grew INSANELY fast and got to 220 at probably 20% bodyfat, and cut to 190 at 12% bodyfat approximately.   Did you bulk to 220 (from 150) and cut to 190 in the same year? Not only would that imply you put on 35 pounds of muscle in one year (probably doable) but it implies that you also cut down 20-30 pounds.   If the bulk was done in 1 year and the cut another, you can be natty. If not, not a chance in the world that is ""natty progress"""

nattyorjuice,36oa48,goudendonut,2,Thu May 21 13:30:49 2015 UTC,It put me at 13%
nattyorjuice,36oa48,Lemon_Destroyer,2,Thu May 21 14:25:35 2015 UTC,Sounds plausible then man.
nattyorjuice,36oa48,120poundstud,1 point,Thu May 21 17:27:08 2015 UTC,Yeah absolutely. By the time I'm legitimately below 10% bodyfat I'll probably be 185 lbs or so. Those are good numbers but not too juicy (unless you consider my age) but I can't wait until next bulking season so that I can hopefully improve those stats.
nattyorjuice,36oa48,goudendonut,3,Thu May 21 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"That last pic looks more like 20% body fat at least. Abs barely visible. Need a body composition scan to say for sure, but its definitely over 13%."
nattyorjuice,36oa48,Lemon_Destroyer,1 point,Thu May 21 07:52:00 2015 UTC,Like I said I have sat in a tub and gotten it professionally tested before at a slightly higher bodyfat than this and it came out to 13.2%. The reason I look that way in some of the pics is that my bathroom has insanely bright lights that point straight at you (taking away all definition basically) but I know for certain that I'm nowhere near 20% bodyfat. I doubt my waist measurement would be what it is at that bodyfat measurement. I look significantly leaner IRL or in a decent picture but I was just curious as to what the community thought. Thank you for the feedback though!
nattyorjuice,36oa48,Lemon_Destroyer,2,Thu May 21 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"200 pounds at 5""9... you really telling me it's possible to put on 40 more pounds of muscle OP?   Either you're juicy, or you're way more than 13% bodyfat, judging from your pics it's most likely the latter."
nattyorjuice,36mxov,lenattygawd,7,Wed May 20 15:44:29 2015 UTC,This sub is just filled with do you even lift jelly loses ;p
nattyorjuice,36mxov,playah8rz,11,Wed May 20 18:03:15 2015 UTC,It's like driving; 'who's faster than me is crazy and who's slower than me is an idiot'
nattyorjuice,36mxov,neutraliser1,4,Wed May 20 18:32:42 2015 UTC,"Not all but yeah, pretty much true."
nattyorjuice,36mxov,m4xc4v413r4,5,Wed May 20 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"the usual way for these morons to perform their mental gymnastic goes like this:   ""I have no information about his stats but he looks too full"" -> roids ffmi > 25 -> roids cause not possible ffmi < 25 -> roids cause capped delts ffmi < 25 -> roids cause good traps ffmi < 25 -> roids cause too lean ffmi < 25 -> roids cause too young ffmi < 25 -> roids cause he looks to big for his height ffmi < 25 -> roids cause he looks better than me"
nattyorjuice,36mxov,gengar62,6,Thu May 21 13:23:59 2015 UTC,Seems like if you have an instagram account and work in the fitness industry you automatically get a juice label here. Or if you have any kind of build with visible abs. I honestly get the impression most of the people here don't know how to properly lift or diet thus don't see any progress and assume everyone else is just juicing.
nattyorjuice,36mxov,tetrajitsu,-5,Wed May 20 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Not  at all accurate , especially in here."
nattyorjuice,36mxov,goudendonut,-3,Wed May 20 16:01:29 2015 UTC,Not really

nattyorjuice,36oz1z,funnerno1,2,Thu May 21 06:45:08 2015 UTC,"nothing. he's only 180 lbs (at 6'), that's well within the realm of natty.   he's very aesthetic and look big but he's not huge by any means."
nattyorjuice,36oz1z,mrvega,1 point,Thu May 21 15:00:01 2015 UTC,"again with the misconception that roids=huge.  learn to accept not everyone on steroids is ronnie coleman.\  guzman is definitly a juicer. stats are often made up to, never even look at weight or weight/h ratios."
nattyorjuice,36oz1z,goudendonut,2,Thu May 21 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"lots of people on this sub don't even seem to fathom the phenomenon of jumping on gear while having little to no training knowledge. like with most things in life, most juicers are retards, and are not going to reap the full potential rewards from using ped's either. it also seems like most people are completely unable to spot an unnatural look if the subject is small or isn't on tren/mast. oh well, had too high hopes for this place i guess"
nattyorjuice,36oz1z,niceandfull,1 point,Thu May 21 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"he's not big, ripped or anything, i don't see how you can be so sure he's on gear. he lean bulked for a year and only gained a couple pounds of muscle, definitely not the kind of progress that someone who does a cycle or a blast makes (his training and nutrition are on point, so it's not that). if he really was on gear i don't see him being on anything more than TRT levels of test year round."
nattyorjuice,36oz1z,mrvega,-1,Thu May 21 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"skinny phag who only deadlifts at the gym, stays on low calories year round and cycles on and off the jooce. thats my verdict."

nattyorjuice,36lzfd,niceandfull,1 point,Wed May 20 16:24:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. It has Come to my attention that the most dyel guys on here scream natty the loudest.
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,niceandfull,2,Wed May 20 02:33:08 2015 UTC,he is small and lean 14.5 inch arms at 78kg. Height is over 6ft and yea. natty bro + his not 6% b.f
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,ershy,4,Wed May 20 09:05:03 2015 UTC,Go out on a limb and say natty! The last part was good lighting!
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,krisperioyu,2,Wed May 20 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"At first I wanted to say natty but after a close look not so sure.  He's 16, but he can incline bench 225 and squat 265. Then if you compare him to Ronnie he's about 6ft.  This picture hmmm yeah, good lighting, good pump. But this one makes me doubt. A 16 yr old who's 6ft with those lifts and that body. Tempted to say juicy"
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,are_u_natty,2,Wed May 20 08:42:11 2015 UTC,"lmfao that picture makes you doubt?  Oh lord, I pray for you.  He's not even big, vascular, full, dry etc.. list goes on.  If you think those lifts are an achievement, then you haven't been in the gym for even a year."
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,slashfroz3n,1 point,Sun May 24 10:48:47 2015 UTC,"Around 4:58 these buds are a clear sign what's going on here. At this age I would not do what this guy has done. Let your hormones cope with your growth, otherwise the risks outweighs the benefits."
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,windwalk2627,0,Wed May 20 15:03:45 2015 UTC,He doesn't have any zits... Except for that huge field of giant zits on his back. Imma go with roid acne.  One more thing: his biggest gains by far were within the 3rd year. Natural bodybuilders have the best gains in year 1. In year 3 the gains you can make are typically around 1/4 of the gains you made in year 1.
nattyorjuice,36kqfg,eXXaXion,2,Wed May 20 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"While true that most gains come in the first year, he's hitting the peak of his teens years now, the same rules don't apply to adolescents as they do adults."

nattyorjuice,36ine7,eXXaXion,-2,Tue May 19 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Juicy. Too lean while having quite a bit of mass.  Also, not to be racist, but he's apparently Asian and very few, if any, Asians have the beastly genetics needed to achieve this naturally."
nattyorjuice,36ine7,slashfroz3n,1 point,Tue May 19 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"That's some racist bullshit, Asians actually do have beastly genetics in both the olympic and powerlifting rings so why wouldn't it translate?"
nattyorjuice,36h4e4,Nikelu,4,Tue May 19 10:19:56 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell from the pose and angle, but I'd say juicy. People will say that he isn't that big, so is possible natty, but there's more to it than sheer size."
nattyorjuice,36h4e4,modernbenoni,5,Tue May 19 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"True, but his leanness is achievable natty, and neither delts nor traps look juicy in any way. Of course it's possible that he's on something, but what makes you think he is based on this picture?"
nattyorjuice,36h4e4,tomyt94,5,Tue May 19 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"Fair question. The pose isn't great for delts or traps so I didn't want to base an opinion too strongly on them. To me though the delts do look like they could be quite a bit more swole than they look here. The guy is 6ft though, so the slightly smaller size is understandable. His arms are big though and to me have a juicy look about them, that could be low insertion points on biceps, but I think it's more than that.  He said he's natty here, but the winky face makes me think he may be saying that he isn't. There's too much ambiguity in text!  It's his 6th show though and he wants to go pro. He's at 4-5% bf here according to this. You can see in the other pic of him that he's quite a bit more cut and swole than he looks in this pic.  He also said he was natty here, and it sounds more sincere, but again is followed by a winky face...  /u/Garbage_At_Best I must confess that I've been doing some major creeping. I think it makes it less creepy if I alert you to this myself."
nattyorjuice,36h4e4,modernbenoni,3,Tue May 19 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"Excellent points, thanks for replying! You're correct that he definitely looks bigger and leaner in the other picture.  Also, I don't think he'll see this since he doesn't have gold."
nattyorjuice,36h4e4,tomyt94,2,Tue May 19 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Ah well, I tried."

nattyorjuice,36gobh,Neosovereign,4,Tue May 19 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"Mike Dolce?  I know of him because he gets paid 1 grand per day for bringing ufc fighters down to their weight. I still remember his drama with Bj Penn, even got 1 grand on top as tip at the end of the three week camp.  That said...He is a famous diet coach for people who need to lose weight fast and quick before a competition. You don't pay for diet advice but his drug advice.  He may not be on aas but I'm sure he has a cabinet stacked with stimulants"
nattyorjuice,36gobh,KennethGloeckler,3,Tue May 19 10:20:38 2015 UTC,"Dolce obviously knows s lot about nutrition so I'm sure that helps his physique. But,  I don't think he is natural.  He's put on a lot of size since he retired from fighting and it's in his best interest to look his best in order to sell himself to his clients. He's all about optimization of physical performance in the cage and weight manipulation. It doesn't help that his case that mma has a huge ped issue."

nattyorjuice,3693i3,funnerno1,0,Sun May 17 13:49:32 2015 UTC,Meaning?
nattyorjuice,3693i3,funnerno1,2,Sun May 17 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"Could be natty with excellent genetics    How can you tell his genetics are excellent? His physique actually looks pretty bad, in relation to how much muscle he's carrying."

nattyorjuice,3693i3,JakeyG14,10,Tue May 26 22:15:15 2015 UTC,His channel is nothing like Chang's bullshit. Jeff actually backs his shit up with science and he has a beast of a resume.

nattyorjuice,3679at,are_u_natty,3,Sat May 16 22:29:07 2015 UTC,Benching 345 at 185lb is difficult but not impossible at all without juice. His physique says juice though.
nattyorjuice,3679at,Neosovereign,4,Sun May 17 06:39:24 2015 UTC,yea easyjuice. one of the very few whp actually makes me one to take gear to. his size looks like this might be his first or one of the first. decent size but looking shredded at that bodyfat whit the shoulders is not doable natty.
nattyorjuice,3679at,goudendonut,2,Sat May 16 21:52:56 2015 UTC,doesn't look like a professional gamer to me boys..

He lives in a country where you can buy gear at every single 'pharmacy' and fights with zero testing.

nattyorjuice,366sd6,krisperioyu,-5,Sat May 16 22:51:12 2015 UTC,He has great definition but isn't particularly big. I'm gonna say natty.  Edit: Although other people are saying he's a Muay Thai fighter (and therefore 99.9999% probability of being on gear) you could probs get a similar physique naturally.
nattyorjuice,366sd6,Tom_The_Human,0,Sat May 16 18:44:00 2015 UTC,yeah. i think the sweat makes him look a lot bigger lmao

nattyorjuice,35xdqb,snorbie,-4,Thu May 14 15:50:27 2015 UTC,Natty. I'm 20 and have been lifting for a year and a half. Just started taking creatine a month ago

Poultry are farmed in great numbers with chickens being the most numerous. More than 50 billion chickens are raised annually as a source of food, for both their meat and their eggs.  Chickens raised for eggs are usually called layers while chickens raised for meat are often called broilers.  In the US, the national organization overseeing poultry production is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the UK, the national organization is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

I must have low T and I need steroids!"", which is an absolute bullshit excuse for people looking for free or scripted steroids. As a negative feedback loop, the loss of a testicle means that the other testicle will sense the lack of hormone and pick up the slack. Losing a testicle does not automatically halve your testosterone output, and if you have low T with only one testicle, you likely would have had low T with two testicles."

He more than doubled his body weight in the span of a few years (He was 260 at his peak).   http://i.imgur.com/pN5BjnA.jpg  He also has tons of moles from Melanotan usage, and I'm almost positive that he uses GHRP for his eating challenges (since it profoundly boosts your appetite).

nattyorjuice,358trv,Cleglaw,4,Fri May 8 02:59:59 2015 UTC,"Last time someone asked this, I said he probably bulks on test/tren/EQ. Total guess though, only he knows what he runs. Might cost him 250 bucks US a month, plus AI.  EDIT: Those prices are at the doses he would likely run. Add some GH and maybe insulin too, though I doubt the latter."
nattyorjuice,358trv,UrGoing2LuvMyNuts,2,Fri May 8 04:10:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like test tren and eq. Let's say 350/700/1000  Is he american? Test propionate is ~$25 for 10ml at 100mg/ml. Tren acetate at same dosage is about $50 right now. EQ, I can't fucking remember how much it goes for.  So he's using 3 vials of tren and 1.5 of test per month so that's right about 185 by my estimates. Prolactin control, estrogen control, let's say 200.  That + however much EQ is these days."

nattyorjuice,358trv,tetrajitsu,-1,Fri May 8 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"I actually wondered the same thing about this guy today.  No doubt he's on a ton of anabolics (and he certainly blasts and cruises or just blasts non-stop), but it's hard to say which because they're all very similar. Testosterone is the only steroid that really differs from the others in that it converts to DHT and produces profound androgenic/masculizing effects (most other steroids are primarily anabolic and usually have fewer masculinizing effects than test -- yes even tren,; animal studies confirm this).   The more interesting question is what kind of ancillaries has he taken. Given his genetics, I doubt he could have reached his size with just anabolic steroids (https://instagram.com/p/1J1ox4qM7t/?taken-by=bradleymartyn). He doesn't look like he's taken insulin since his waist is very narrow. Also, I doubt he can afford to spend tens of thousands on HGH. My guess is that he takes the GHRP-2 and CJC-1295 stack at least 3 times a day to dramatically boost his HGH levels as well as his appetite.   I believe he uses Melanotan 2 to give him tanned skin with minimal sun exposure. I believe this because he's much more tan now than he was before his transformation and because he has those pitch black moles that are a telltale sign of Melanotan usage.   So my guess his cycle is something like this:  long-ester testosterone: 200mg weekly, year-round  trenbolone: 500-2000mg weekly (if he's cutting)  deca: 1000-3000mg weekly (if he's bulking)  CJC-1295 and GHRP-2: 100mcg 3-5 times a day  Melanotan 2: 500mcg once a week before tanning"

nattyorjuice,34pn53,KennethGloeckler,2,Sun May 3 20:17:14 2015 UTC,Might very well be natty
nattyorjuice,34pn53,wordsoundpower,1 point,Mon May 4 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"If he isn't, it's a perfectly good waste of juice."
nattyorjuice,34pn53,Cleglaw,0,Mon May 4 17:15:48 2015 UTC,Does he make money off his physique?
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,funnerno1,11,Sun May 3 11:41:50 2015 UTC,Nah I think he's natty. Take a look at his physique in Bad Neighbours. Definitely natty in that but you can tell he lifts. And that was probably filmed some time in 2013 so over a year of training in between? Totally doable.
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,friestogo,3,Sun May 3 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. His physique doesn't really change from film to film and is like that all they time, which is doable with a good diet and cardio.  Plus, as you said, the time span between his last film to now is doable."
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,Vantius,9,Sun May 3 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"The guy is 1.73m tall and weighs around 75kg. Nothing that wouldn't be achievable natty. Once again, doesn't mean he is. I just noticed his arms are almost the same size as his legs lol."
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,ThuurHaelt,2,Sun May 3 12:03:55 2015 UTC,It looks naturally obtainable.
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,wordsoundpower,2,Mon May 4 17:18:58 2015 UTC,Natty. I lifted with him and his brother a couple years back because I went to college with his bro. He's a really nice guy and they both have really solid genetics.
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,AestheticConor,5,Tue May 5 02:52:46 2015 UTC,Of course juicy. Why wouldn't you juice for a role to make $$$$$.
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,Cleglaw,6,Sun May 3 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't take juice if you don't need to get very big. I mean, if Effron is taking juice here, then he must have just started because he is pretty small."
nattyorjuice,34pk5i,Neosovereign,2,Sun May 3 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"maybe he doesnt want to be big but save some time, with juice you build muscles faster."

nattyorjuice,34m8q7,wordsoundpower,-1,Tue May 5 17:55:53 2015 UTC,Maybe Karl and Mischa are natty. But the rest of the crew is juicy as hell. Except Ralf Sättele :)

Watch his reaction to getting manhandled by Jeff Seid:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSuwKwFmTOQ  I guarantee you he thought he was going to win lol  Jeff Seid, on the other hand, is truly gifted and probably uses a fraction of the amount of roids that Alon uses and still achieves better results."
nattyorjuice,34m8bt,knorg,6,Sat May 2 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"OP, did you see this picture?  He said it and even put a picture, he's 100% natural orange juice"

nattyorjuice,34m8bt,good-looking,-4,Sat May 2 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Uh I'd say this guy is natural. His story is incredibly similar to mine, as are his results.  I did drugs all my life then I was like fuck that, got clean and started lifting. Lifting isn't a hobby it's my life.  This guy isn't overly big, isn't overly vascular and has truly dedicated himself.  Maybe instead of calling everyone who is bigger and more cut than you are unnatural you could try gong harder and pushing your body to the limit"
nattyorjuice,34nruf,knorg,11,Sat May 2 21:23:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for showing how pointless this sub is. This guy is obviously juiced to the gills.
nattyorjuice,34nruf,collegiateballer,-3,Sat May 2 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"He deadlifts 560, squats 415, and benches 275 at a BW of 165. How many guys can get those strength to weight numbers naturally?"
nattyorjuice,34nruf,collegiateballer,3,Sat May 2 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"Probably quite a few people I'm sure with good programming. His last total I see on his youtube is 1175. While his numbers are definitely good for his size, he's not exactly an ""elite powerlifter"""
nattyorjuice,34nruf,BCFtrip,5,Sat May 2 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"I got near there in 2 fucking years at 190bw as a highschool student. A 495 Deadlift is usually considered a 2 year goal, pretty similar to a 275 bench. Those numbers are not high and neither is his muscle mass. A 1250 total isn't unthinkably high ffs  And learn how steroids work, when he's restricting his bodyweight that low, he'd be shredded as shit if he was on anything thanks to recomposition."
nattyorjuice,34nruf,goudendonut,1 point,Sat May 2 22:35:22 2015 UTC,275 is pretty facking good in 2 years. weighting 190 or not.
nattyorjuice,34nruf,BCFtrip,-1,Sun May 3 17:51:18 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate what's wrong with weighing 190?
nattyorjuice,34nruf,goudendonut,2,Sun May 3 19:18:52 2015 UTC,nothing. i ment that it is easier benching 275@190 than it is at@155. anyway its still impressive if that only took 2years of lifting
nattyorjuice,34nruf,BCFtrip,0,Sun May 3 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"Ah I thought you said ""weighing 190 is not(good)"" I missed the 'or'"

nattyorjuice,34nruf,collegiateballer,-3,Sun May 3 00:34:49 2015 UTC,"Tim's lifts blow yours out of the water (given that he's 45 pounds lower body weight). Even if you don't control for weight, his total is still higher than yours. Most guys won't get anywhere close to Tim Thebodeau's strength without roids, which is why it's a legitimate question to ask whether he's natural or not."
nattyorjuice,34nruf,BCFtrip,1 point,Sun May 3 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"Some people just have genetic predisposition to be good at powerlifting. It's not like his numbers are out of this world. Sure they're impressive, but they're not world class. Dude's just grinding making sure to keep a close eye on his programming."
nattyorjuice,34nruf,BCFtrip,1 point,Sun May 3 06:09:29 2015 UTC,"My Deadlift is pretty god damn low, erectors keep getting spasms and then my form breaks down. Anyway, this is what this guy does. He trains hard and gets precise with his programming, and some people just have more potential (I'm terribly unathletic).   All that aside, my point about his body composition stands"
nattyorjuice,34mp1y,krisperioyu,6,Sat May 2 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the answer was given by the man himself"
nattyorjuice,34mp1y,are_u_natty,1 point,Sat May 2 16:36:29 2015 UTC,Question is does he exhibit signs of roid usage?

nattyorjuice,34mp1y,Khandakerex,7,Sat May 2 17:09:34 2015 UTC,Why would anyone become a professional body builder without juice? It's like using a bike in a sports car race lmao
nattyorjuice,34mp1y,badcat_kazoo,1 point,Sat May 2 16:11:26 2015 UTC,I think that's the point of the sub! Is to deliberate and debate if this person is truly natty!

When I saw him with his shirt on and he flexed his arms I thought juicy but turns out his arms are just way more developed than the rest of his body so now I'm thinking natty.   Also I do not like the guy at all, he has a video making fun of furious pete for getting cancer and attributes it 100% to his diet. So yeah, typical indignant vegan."

His deltoids aren't exactly what I'd call ""huge"", especially compared to his biceps. His vascularity is something that alarms me, but I think I can safely say it's because of black genetics and a good diet.

Don’t F***ing waste it!!!  Forget your job, your friends, your significant other or anything else in your life and just concern yourself with moving iron. I find it helpful to induce myself into a psychotic mindset before a workout (especially leg workouts)."

nattyorjuice,34g4sr,bicureyooz,2,Fri May 1 01:15:36 2015 UTC,You can achieve that size natty but the size alongside the vascularity would indicate at least some assistance - even if it's only something like clen which isn't technically a steroid but would still still be 'not natty' to a lot of people.

nattyorjuice,33oq6h,knorg,-7,Sun Apr 26 06:00:37 2015 UTC,Not natty based on his transformation in terms of both strength and appearance. His face also looks bloated in some videos (despite having low body fat).  You guys are idiots if you think a guy needs to be jacked and veiny to be on steroids. Whether a guy is on steroids or not is determined by whether his physique matches HIS genetics. Omarisuf doesn't have the genetics to support his physique or his lifts (he has bird-boned arms and legs). Jonnie Candito has a much better case for being natty since he actually has large bones and a naturally thick musculature.

nattyorjuice,33qh8n,Cleglaw,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:27:43 2015 UTC,He is apparently 5'9 and weighs 175
nattyorjuice,33qh8n,are_u_natty,0,Fri Apr 24 20:15:30 2015 UTC,rule 37  Unfortunately he was featured over there  (not serious)  EDIT : Natty arms don't look like this and this guy is at a low BF year round
nattyorjuice,33qh8n,SuperNath98,-3,Fri Apr 24 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"You can look like this natty. However, people on this sub are too scared of lifting weights so don't bother asking them."
nattyorjuice,33qh8n,tetrajitsu,-4,Sun Apr 26 15:25:43 2015 UTC,is he really short? could be natty if thats the case. Some black guys just have the genes to look big and lean without much effort.
nattyorjuice,33qh8n,knorg,-8,Fri Apr 24 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"He could be natty. He has insane muscle bellies (which is something you're born with and can't change with steroids) and probably naturally low body fat. He probably doesn't even weigh that much -- his muscle bellies give the illusion of size. I know lots of black guys who are naturally ripped with capped delts, six pack abs, and veins everywhere, who eat whatever they want and do nothing physical. These guys blow up if they put even an ounce of effort into their physiques."
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,snorbie,19,Thu Apr 23 10:19:01 2015 UTC,"He's a pro rugby player, and a boxer. You decide."
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,dantefu,2,Thu Apr 23 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, I just thought this photo of him would be a good one to discuss as the obvious tell tale signs aren't here."
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,dantefu,4,Thu Apr 23 16:45:23 2015 UTC,True. Something like this could be achievable with  a great frame as his. Sonny is one of the genetic lottery winners.
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,knorg,12,Thu Apr 23 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"He could certainly achieve his body naturally and possibly better if he dedicated his life to powerlifting/bodybuilding. Samoans have some of the best genetics in the world. However, as a real athlete, he probably takes PEDs to help with recovery and conditioning. So I doubt he's natty because of his profession but he obviously has some insane genetics -- better than 99% of self-proclaimed bodybuilders and powerlifters"
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,drayeseez,2,Thu Apr 23 15:58:37 2015 UTC,Are you implying he is Samoan? Did not know that.
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,siddnayak,3,Thu Apr 23 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"He's half Samoan, yeah"
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,Kwizkey,5,Sun Apr 26 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"You gotta understand that just because he doesn't have veins popping out his neck and abs doesn't mean he isn't on juice.  The guys gets an absolute battering in his sports, he needs the size and recovery.   The guy probably does the most basic of weight training and has never done a lateral raise in his life but he's still got great shape and aesthetics, is lean and will look a LOT bigger in real life.  Sometimes there's no point even asking because the answer is obvious."
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,Kwizkey,2,Thu Apr 23 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Let's take a step back here then and pretend that he isn't a pro rugby player, what would your answer have been? Personally I would have said he was on juice, but I wanted to see the reaction of people that didn't know who this guy is.  Edit: I should confirm that I meant, personally, knowing who this guy is, not basing it off the photo alone."
nattyorjuice,33kvwg,badcat_kazoo,2,Fri Apr 24 08:04:32 2015 UTC,"Still stand by my statement. The guys got fantastic shape, lots of good size and still looks very big while lean."

Hey I could be wrong, I'm no expert, and I've learn not to put to much trust in fitness pros. However, according to Nicolas Cole he's 5'11, 175lbs, and ~7% bodyfat. That well within the natty range"

nattyorjuice,33k5ab,Mr_W4yne,3,Fri May 8 02:11:21 2015 UTC,Obvious juice. It's not in this guy's genetics to be anything but a skinny twig.   And for you people who say he's not that big: It's about how big you are for your FRAME that determines whether or not you are conceivably natty. Some big-boned men can hold 200 pounds of pure muscle with minimal effort while skinny guys like this need huge amounts of PEDs just to reach 200 pounds of total body weight (think Zyzz). Compare wrist size to overall muscle mass and that will show you who's natty or not.
nattyorjuice,33k5ab,knorg,3,Thu Apr 23 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"Obvious juice. It's not in this guy's genetics to be anything but a skinny twig.   wat. being skinny doesn't mean you have bad genetics, it means you don't eat.   Compare wrist size to overall muscle mass and that will show you who's natty or not.   Wrist genetics have nothing to do with your frame, it just means is whether or not you have bony wrists. You think the hodge twins have a small frame? I have a pretty wide frame, and my wrists are tiny, but my shoulders and shoulder blades are a lot bigger in comparison."
nattyorjuice,33k5ab,knorg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"Shoulder width isn't that important. Bone circumference and density are what matter. Also, ectomorphs often have the illusion of wide shoulders because their arms are so skinny.   Someone like Michael Phelps has extremely broad shoulders, but it's obvious is you look at him that he has relatively slim bones (even his face is long and narrow). There's nothing Michael Phelps could do if he wanted to bulk up to play football or fight in heavyweight MMA. He'll never be a hard-hitting person due to his small bones. Compare him to someone like Cain Velasquez, who despite having relatively narrow shoulders, has bones as wide as tree trunks. Even without any training or working out, he'd still be exceptionally strong and powerful. Bones are almost everything when it comes to real world strength (not gym strength, as anyone can train themselves to become decently strong in most lifts. I'm talking about the strength you're born with).  The Hodgetwins have ectomorphic frames with long muscle bellies, like most black guys. That's why blacks dominate bodybuilding (big muscles + small bones)."

His stats say that he's 5'9 and 170 lbs though and at ~5? percent bodyfat I would say this is achievable natty for some but with a IIFYM diet I would be doubtful.

LMAOOO
nattyorjuice,32q0nz,F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8,8,Fri Apr 17 05:04:41 2015 UTC,He looks natty as fuck without good down-lighting...
nattyorjuice,32q0nz,Randgruppenleiter,2,Wed Apr 15 23:45:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I had to keep going down to his other pictures. Unfortunately he's definitely on juice. But this is pretty dam achievable otherwise. The lighting is shit but if you looked like that always I'd be willing to say natty. Someone on here said his traps are huge compared to everything else. But their flexed so what do you expect? My friend is the same height and almost weight. He trains his traps pretty well and at the right angle you'd say they might be kinda close. I'll ask him for a trap pic tomorrow.

nattyorjuice,32q0nz,cirocinmycup,-1,Thu Apr 16 19:10:52 2015 UTC,I think this is achievable natty.  He is very muscular but not overly lean.

nattyorjuice,32q0nz,montagematt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"Well I would consider someone extremely lean to have visible muscle striations which this guy doesn't have.  He has clear muscle and ab definition but the lack of extreme vascularity and muscle striations leads me to believe his physique is achievable natty.  That being said, the guy may be juicing but i certainly think his physique is achievable natty."
nattyorjuice,32q0nz,montagematt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but he is simply too lean to be that muscular.  Consider his age and the amount of time it would take to achieve this look.  It would easily take 5+ years of perfect dieting and consistent lifting to achieve this look, and I'm being generous with 5 years..  EDIT: Also you can see in a few of his pictures where his delts are looking very very round and cannonball like.  I think his old-school Arnold style body shape plus the fact that he has very few shots that expose his shoulders is enough to show this guy is juicy."
nattyorjuice,32q0nz,montagematt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but he is simply too lean to be that muscular.   Only his traps stand out to be ""very muscular."" He says he weights 176lbs and looks around 5""10 which aren't really juicing stats but he may have just started."

nattyorjuice,32o2lo,bicureyooz,5,Thu Apr 16 10:40:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely achievable naturally, also taking the time frame into account. His body fat is well above 10%, I guess he would lose quite some volume if he tried to get below that. Amazing work though!"
nattyorjuice,32o2lo,bicureyooz,-5,Wed Apr 15 11:17:17 2015 UTC,"He's probably near 13-14%, I wouldn't say ""well above""... we're talking MAYBE 10lbs lost to achieve 10% and thats not a loss of ""quite some volume"" at that weight thats not even 8 weeks of cutting.  Im just suspicious of those 3d shoulders"
nattyorjuice,32o2lo,Kezas,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"im the guy he responded to actually. you know i was kinda on the fence for a while on this guy. while he does have crazy stats for somewheone who lifts for a year he does not look shredded at all. the fact that he has nearly full 3d shoulders at that high bodyfat was the indicator for me though. the guy tried to shuff it away as a shoulder pump , but u dont get those 3d shoulders after 4 years of lifting let alone 3. look up some guys like scott herman and the guys who are maybe nattys like christina guzman and chris jones. they have smaller shoulders than him and have been lifting way longer."
nattyorjuice,32mule,Khandakerex,5,Wed Apr 15 01:32:31 2015 UTC,I think it's doable natty but extremely hard and it would take a really long time.  I don't think this guy is old enough to have done it naturally.

nattyorjuice,3202v5,bicureyooz,4,Thu Apr 9 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"Anavar. A very expensive but very safe and effective oral steroid. I basically take things that allow me to reach my goals but have few if any side effects. Most other orals are DHT based, so can result in hair loss, or are liver toxic, or are only temporary in their effects. Other injectables can be more difficult to manage sides on when compared to straight testosterone. That's why I take what I take. The var is not a permanent thing. I've just started and will take it for 6 weeks. The test is year round."

I immediately wondered if he was juicing, and the conclusion I came to face to face was that he did, but probably not to extreme levels because he is a huge and pretty cut, but doesn't have the full 3d look that extreme 'roid use gives you.

It is a lot easier, you don't have to eat a shit load every day for 5 years, only like 1 or 2. Unless you are ronnie coleman.    He looks like he has had some time to put on the weight.   Except he hasn't, he has to focus on Judo instead of bodybuilding. And compete with others who are juicing.    Its not like he is 20 years old right?   I'd believe if it more if he was 20, he could have used his testosterone boost from when he was 16 and train for 4 solid years, but the fact he is older makes it even less believable because I doubt he's trained nonstop since he was 16."

The closer someone is to puberty the more testosterone they have in their system, it is more likely for him to be 20 years old and has just been training for 5 years straight than to be 30 and training for 15 years straight imo.

nattyorjuice,31lgfw,KennethGloeckler,2,Mon Apr 6 05:29:50 2015 UTC,He's doing calisthenics for fitness? I thought he's a gymnast...would make lots more sense then
nattyorjuice,31lgfw,Frankie91,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:15:34 2015 UTC,He is a gymnast and during the season he mostly works out gymnastics style (whatever that is) but during the off season and summer he does a lot of calisthenics
nattyorjuice,31lgfw,bicureyooz,7,Tue Apr 7 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the censoring, just trying to protect his identity a little bit. Some people at our school think he's juiced, other disagree. He says he's natty and I believe him. Just looking for some other opinions."
nattyorjuice,31lgfw,Lemon_Destroyer,6,Mon Apr 6 04:35:44 2015 UTC,Natty with tons of hard work. Incredible work.
nattyorjuice,31lgfw,usmc757,3,Mon Apr 6 05:28:13 2015 UTC,I can't even iron cross. Impressive pose.
nattyorjuice,31lgfw,Coma-,2,Mon Apr 6 06:51:01 2015 UTC,"From this one picture I'd say natty, but extremely impressive. Has he always been this muscular or is it a sudden thing?"

nattyorjuice,31hjaj,FindTheFishyFish,30,Sun Apr 5 11:40:16 2015 UTC,This is possible without the use of steroids (which doesn't mean that he isn't using). Keep in mind that the lighting is great and that he has probably done a weight cut for this photo shoot.

nattyorjuice,31hjaj,snow_reefer,0,Sun Apr 5 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, afaik it's doesn't matter whether you've trained 10, 20 or 30 years natural.   There's a limit as to how much mass you can grow naturally. If done right you can hit it after 4-5 years naturally. Afterwards it's more about definition and vascularity you can still gain.  I mean you always grow a little bit of muscle, but if you are natural this will decrease drastically with every year of training.  I think this dude is juicy mainly because of his traps which I think are bigger than naturally doable. Also, delts."
nattyorjuice,31hjaj,eXXaXion,3,Sun Apr 5 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"Regarding his traps, I agree that they are pretty large; however, I've been training for only 6 months, and my traps already are starting to have that grotesquely-large appearance when flexed. The lighting also helps him look more muscular. I think the verdict could go either way."
nattyorjuice,31hjaj,FindTheFishyFish,0,Sun Apr 5 17:37:27 2015 UTC,Easily one of the nattiest things posted on this subreddit.

nattyorjuice,31hjaj,JayRaow,12,Sun Apr 5 05:30:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. It just means he is pragmatic and knows how common steroids are now.
nattyorjuice,31c4g7,are_u_natty,7,Fri Apr 3 18:22:53 2015 UTC,Looks natural to me. Small legs. Small shoulders. No veins. Not particularly lean. Flexing and favourable lighting.

nattyorjuice,31c4g7,SuperNath98,15,Fri Apr 3 18:30:56 2015 UTC,You think that looks good? My first thought was that his hips were unfortunately wide.   Plus he's only got little legs.
nattyorjuice,31c4g7,friestogo,8,Fri Apr 3 20:49:29 2015 UTC,His hips are awful but I guess what /u/SuperNath98 was trying to said is that his hips remind him of ancient greeks statues cause they too have big hips
nattyorjuice,31c4g7,lsaz,2,Sat Apr 4 06:26:12 2015 UTC,Yeah he's right. Looks good on a statue... Not so much on a person.

nattyorjuice,30x22c,goudendonut,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:29:46 2015 UTC,no kinda obvious that he used actually.
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,jellyfish98,5,Mon Mar 30 00:12:25 2015 UTC,"probably used some prohormones, highly doubt he is injecting anything. What do I know though.  He isn't really too big or lean, but that is some impressive vascularity in his football pic."
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,Neosovereign,2,Mon Mar 30 01:06:36 2015 UTC,thats what I was expecting... his shoulders and traps aren't really there in any pics and tbh his arms aren't that big
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,friestogo,4,Mon Mar 30 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"He's in college now, he's in 2 grades above me. He's been accused of roids a lot, so I just figured I'd put it on this r/ to see what u guys thought as he's never denied or admitted either wat. but i do understand your point and yea i respect his arms haha"
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,badcat_kazoo,3,Mon Mar 30 02:42:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd say juice. Pretty common with football players I should think.
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,UrGoing2LuvMyNuts,3,Mon Mar 30 03:39:01 2015 UTC,Shoulders and traps don't pop but the kid is 17 so I would say probably tried a beginner cycle just because of the age.
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,goudendonut,5,Mon Mar 30 15:54:39 2015 UTC,Juicy juice.
nattyorjuice,30r4ci,remotec0ntrol,5,Mon Mar 30 18:34:32 2015 UTC,i think he is on something. never seen a guy aged 17 look close tot that.

nattyorjuice,30p0kr,KrakatoaSpelunker,5,Sun Mar 29 12:40:49 2015 UTC,My guess is natty + good lighting + airbrushing.
nattyorjuice,30p0kr,do2,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:39:25 2015 UTC,What's airbrushing? Is it the makeup used in 300?
nattyorjuice,30p0kr,parco-molo,10,Sun Mar 29 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"It's when you take a air brush (it's like a reverse vacuum, kinda like a leaf blower) and then blow at various parts of the person's body. The temporary compression from the gale force winds generated by the machine creates a sort of spot reduction that makes the actor look leaner or dryer in that area. Apparently chronic long term usage is linked to certain melanomas though, so kinda dangerous."

nattyorjuice,30nxdr,parco-molo,2,Tue Mar 31 04:25:10 2015 UTC,It doesn't look like he juices all year round but when he's competing perhaps. He looks average in a shirt.
nattyorjuice,30nxdr,Vantius,0,Sun Mar 29 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much professors are paid in the UK, but if it's anything like in the US it is at least 6 figures.  IIRC steroids are legally allowed to be used in the UK so there is a strong chance that he is using and can afford it."
nattyorjuice,30nxdr,Cleglaw,5,Sun Mar 29 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"He's not actually a professor, he's doing his PhD, so he would not be getting paid that much at all, which is why he has his modelling career, for which he needs to juice to keep the contracts coming in."
nattyorjuice,30nxdr,tetrajitsu,2,Sun Mar 29 22:53:16 2015 UTC,I want to say not natty.  He's full and lean all at once. Seems just a little too good to be true natty wise.

nattyorjuice,30ihh7,dismorfik,21,Fri Mar 27 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"No actor ever gets physically fit for a role naturally, it would just take an absurd amount of time.  They normally just get a 12 week heads up which is only enough time for a big body recomp on a decent cycle."
nattyorjuice,30ihh7,badcat_kazoo,5,Fri Mar 27 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"I agree.  This becomes especially true when they have to go from one end of the spectrum to the other in little time, or just to recover from a role.  How do you think Matthew McConaughey returned to a normal (by Hollywood standards) weight?"
nattyorjuice,30ihh7,Vantius,11,Sat Mar 28 15:13:52 2015 UTC,Probably juice. He was a skeleton in Nightcrawler.
nattyorjuice,30ihh7,friestogo,2,Fri Mar 27 19:33:42 2015 UTC,He purposely lost 30 pounds for that role.
nattyorjuice,30ihh7,parco-molo,-10,Sat Mar 28 08:43:28 2015 UTC,He's really not that large... You'd be surprised what a couple months of intense training can do. He's just really cut.
nattyorjuice,30ihh7,Jakewadewood,24,Fri Mar 27 20:58:14 2015 UTC,You'd be even more surprised what a few weeks of juice will do.

nattyorjuice,30eij4,parco-molo,12,Fri Mar 27 14:37:41 2015 UTC,He was only 200 pounds. Also if its 1940 its fucking absurd to think he's on anything besides genetics
nattyorjuice,30eij4,BCFtrip,0,Thu Mar 26 21:59:40 2015 UTC,Juice has been around a long time before the 40's. The 40's were when Dbol among others came around
nattyorjuice,30eij4,SwordfshII,2,Fri Apr 3 00:44:23 2015 UTC,Dude no. 15 seconds of googling would tell you you're wrong
nattyorjuice,30eij4,BCFtrip,3,Fri Apr 3 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"Which part?  Test was developed in the early 30's and put into use at the same time frame http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/steroids.asp  I was a bit off with Dbol but that was developed in the 50's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bosley_Ziegler  Various sources show use was widespread in the 40's   Paul de Kruif wrote a book about anabolic features of testosterone, methyltestosterone and testosterone propionate in 1945. The book has the following title: “The male hormone"". This work promoted increasing popularity of testosterone and other anabolic steroids among West Coast bodybuilders in 1940s and 1950s.  http://www.medinform.org/steroid-use-by-bodybuilders-in-1940s-and-1950s.php"
nattyorjuice,30eij4,SwordfshII,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"Ya got me. Dianabol was the part I knew you were wrong about for sure.   Back to this, the picture was taken in 1940. Testosterone was only synthesized in 1938. Isolated in 1935. And became noticeable in athletics in 1956. It remains that steroids weren't commercially available at the time."
nattyorjuice,30eij4,BCFtrip,3,Fri Apr 3 13:11:56 2015 UTC,You guys can't be serious thinking he is/was on steroids... Seriously i would like to know how much lifiting experience you guys have. This look is EASILY achiveable natty in lets say about 5 years of consistent hard training and proper dieting. http://www.quickmeme.com/img/65/654a9f61253745eeb5624c0ed4da054f553c940e2a1574e2841d36cf7eec0264.jpg)
nattyorjuice,30eij4,WordHarderHateLess,2,Thu Mar 26 23:05:45 2015 UTC,Photo taken 29/03/1940.  Man looks natty. The girl however...
nattyorjuice,30eij4,Cleglaw,2,Fri Mar 27 03:11:38 2015 UTC,I'd like to see abs to be honest. Easier to judge.
nattyorjuice,30eij4,themanwhowasfriday,2,Thu Mar 26 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"Something's a little fishy. At first I didn't think it was really from the 40's, and still don't, but I found the source too that says it's from 1940. It just seemed strange that everything in the background is out of focus, yet the foreground is so clear with perfect lighting. Nothing really in this photo that can prove the time period, and I can't find anything else about Wayne Long online.   Here's a pic of Bob McCune on the beach between 1940-1950 for reference. http://i.imgur.com/fNZyS2j.jpg"
nattyorjuice,30eij4,Cro-Magnon524,3,Fri Mar 27 05:58:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, its real. Just seems to be a remastered photo. Here's a  newspaper clipping showing the photo. George Wayne Long was a wrestler with a short career. Here's another rare photo from 1951 where he doesn't look much bigger."
nattyorjuice,30eij4,Cleglaw,2,Fri Mar 27 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"seems kinda juicy to be honest, same as the daughter whit that strenght. kinda confusing if this photo is actually from that year because i think steriods were not realy a thing back then."
nattyorjuice,30eij4,goudendonut,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"That's what confuses me, too. According to a Google image search, he's a bodybuilder named Wayne Long. She is an unrelated girl giving an exhibition of strength. Separate googling reveals that steroids were only discovered around 1935 so it's hard to see how somebody would use them effectively just a few years later."
nattyorjuice,30eij4,BCFtrip,3,Thu Mar 26 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"The first time testosterone was reportedly synthesized was 1938 iirc. That's not even steroids being discovered, its just a hormone being synthesized. They really didn't have much to go on as far as what it did."

nattyorjuice,2zhs8s,tetrajitsu,-6,Wed Mar 18 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"How can you even tell with all the photoshop/HDR shit. Most of their photos look pretty unimpressive to me honestly. Their biggest pics are of them actually working out and have a pump. I of course didn't look through all their pics, so I could be wrong.  EDIT: Just looked through even more pics. I'm going to go with definitely natty. If you think you can't get as big as these guys you are SEVERELY underestimating people. They aren't THAT big, and they aren't really super cut either."
nattyorjuice,2zhs8s,Neosovereign,2,Thu Mar 19 04:12:35 2015 UTC,"You're setting yourself up for disappointment if you think they aren't on gear.   I'm not an expert, but you HAVE to be considering this with anyone making money off ""expert advice""  They are huge, don't be fooled by your evaluation of their pics. If they are natural, they would be among the biggest and best natural physiques on the planet. Compared to other unnatural builders, they seem to be rather tame, but that doesn't qualify them as natural. You HAVE to look at them compared to proven natural builders, and LOOK at the numbers.   Their numbers are on par with Arnie, who was 7 time Mr. Olympian and self admitted roid user. Hard to imagine you can hang with that on a natural program.   The numbers are the strongest evidence in considering these things, as they can't be hidden by judgments of photos.   I'm not saying they are on anything, but I'm skeptical given the information.   It's particularly difficult in this case, because these guys are so like-able, relatable, and appear genuine with a humble ""natural"" and normal looking approach. I was instantly drawn to them and have seen a lot of their videos.   I don't think they have bad advice either in a lot of their tips, and they have other non-training related videos that are entertaining.  Again, you just have to look at what you know 1: They are huge... definitely buff dudes 2: They are making money  3: Their numbers 4: Hudson is a physique model  5: Hudson was a competitive body builder   You might see these and jump right out and say, ""Well not all bodybuilders pin"" or ""So, fitness models can be natural""  Research it. It's easier to just consider the obvious, which is that those two points are absolutely possible. Sadly, it's highly unlikely. Models that are used to sell plans, magazines, products, etc are on roids.   The golden rule in not getting scammed is: Are they making money? They are on roids.   I would love it for them to be clean, because I do really like them. My word of advice is to be realistic and look out for yourself. None of us are ever going to look like the ""Buff Dudes"".   This is a great article on them: http://nattyornot.com/buff-dudes-natural/  TLDR - http://nattyornot.com/buff-dudes-natural/"

nattyorjuice,2zhs8s,Cleglaw,2,Thu Mar 19 11:48:15 2015 UTC,"""They are as big as Arnold"" is a ridiculous argument. They weigh the same as him at the same body fat percentage. I weigh more than most of the fitness models we know to be on juice but I'm not anywhere near as full as they are at the same bf%. Nor do I look as good. Why? Cause gear makes you fuller. To illustrate this point: http://imgur.com/a/1kDyq <Same height and weight. So if you're argument is ""because they are as big as Arnold, they must not be natural."" you don't have the firmest grasp on what steroids do. That being said, They make money, They look fantastic. It would require Fantastic genetics to achieve what these two have achieved. But then again, Their dad is quite buff too: http://imgur.com/4oax5Fa and he's just a carpenter. The truth is I can't say either way. Only they know for sure."

nattyorjuice,2zbefr,badcat_kazoo,5,Tue Mar 17 08:57:06 2015 UTC,Guy looks dense as hell I would love to have his body. why is it that at even relatively high BF some people look so thick while some super shredded body builders just don't?
nattyorjuice,2zbefr,Fradyo,4,Tue Mar 17 22:33:21 2015 UTC,I think it has to do with the training.This is a physique built from heavy lifting most likely. Thick and strong core etc.  BB'er aim for a small waist which makes them look less dense.
nattyorjuice,2zbefr,JukkaG,2,Thu Mar 19 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of height, bone structure, and having a large amount of muscle, and a decent amount of fat."

nattyorjuice,2yg6sm,Neosovereign,2,Tue Mar 10 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"EC is an effective stack and semi-legal. It's still sold otc as bronchaid in some places. That's where you get the ephedrine from. Caffeine is very accessible.  Then you have clenbuterol which is also a very popular fatburner. It's illegal but you get it from the same dealer you get your steroids from.  Then lastly there is DNP which is a very harsh drug. It fucks with your cell's ability to generate ATP. People have died from overdoses. It's one of the very few things a steroid user might get in contact with that can kill him short term. It's also the 'magic pill' of fatburning. With the others, you can still fuck up with a shitty diet but dnp will work.   Your run of the mill dealer won't have it. You have to order it from either domestic or international sources. You're lucky if you live in the US."
