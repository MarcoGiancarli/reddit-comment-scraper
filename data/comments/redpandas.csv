We have the cute adorable side and unfortunately the side where we have to deal with hunting and how to manage it. Nether the less I agree that you should have been made aware.   Cheers Emma

redpandas,3cat30,Cyklotimik,5,Mon Jul 6 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"So, I have some (possibly ignorant) questions:  What are red pandas' temperament like?  Pretty much all the pictures and videos that I've personally seen depict them as playful and silly, are they like that in the wild as well? or is that a product of being raised in zoos?  are they aggressive or more friendly?  As far as exotic animals go, could people potentially keep them as pets?  Surely that could help the population, right?    Pretty uneducated in the subject, just curious."
redpandas,3cat30,VoltStar,8,Mon Jul 6 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Certainly there is no such thing as an ignorant question and in fact yours is one that I am asked a lot. This reply may be a little long :P.   Ultimately the Red Pandas you see in videos and on the internet are as your said raised in captivity. Whether that be via their own Dam or via human intervention if necessary. Either way they in turn become habituated with Humans, especially because they will generally get day to day contact with keepers and/ or visitors (for things like keeper for a day or wild encounter experiences). In turn they see humans as important to attaining food. So they will be less inclined to behave aggressively. In the wild I have never heard or myself witnessed a Red Panda actively coming closer to a human juvenile or other wise (which is very much a good thing as their main threats are anthropogenic). However I have seen young cubs playing very much like you see in many viral videos of Red Pandas. As in many animals Red Panda cubs learn by playing, trial and error almost. And so to answer that part of your question yes they can act playful and silly, however during the adult part of their life they rarely behave in such ways (I believe that this is probably due to their diet of bamboo, their digestive system can only absorb around 15% of the potential nutrients available to them from the plants because they actually have a carnivorous digestive system, and therefore have to spend nearly 13 hours a day just looking for food- they are pretty busy little critters).   Finally to talk more about the use of pets in conservation. The view that the Trust has formed on this is one that is grounded in wild research and conservation so that is really the only side of this debate that I can comment on. While I have worked in a captive facility I am certainly not an expert in that field. Captive Red Pandas in Zoos today any way would have a difficult time being released due to what I mentioned above about the habituation. That said there have only ever released two captive Red Pandas into the wild which was successful for a period of time however both did not survive the release. That was quite a while ago and the scientific community has gained experience and knowledge from other projects- so maybe it is time to try again.   The Red Panda probably wouldn't make a fantastic pet. They have really, really sharp semi retractable claws so say good bye to that furniture you love! In the wild they can have a range of almost 4 km squared (so you'd need a really really big back yard!). Also to get them to the point of domestication you would need to perform selective breeding over generations which would make them suitable for a house environment but probably not the wild. Meaning they wouldn't be seen as potential candidates for release and thus probably wouldn't aid their conservation in anyway - they may still well go extinct in the wild.  I do really believe that wild animals should for the most part be allowed to remain wild and I am not an advocate for keeping animals such as Red Pandas as pets (please keep in mind my view of Zoos is very different and I am aware of the vital part they play in conservation and education).   Ill leave it there because this was a small essay (We are pretty crazy about Red Pandas over here!)   Thank you so much for your question and have a wonderful day :)  Emma"

Red pandas are reported to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, so you have the best chance to see them active in the morning, in the afternoon, at night and also when they are being fed. Some zoos have the times when the animals are being fed on their website. If you can't find it just give them a call. Oh and kind of offtopic, but you should also absolutely book the lemur encounter that they offer! At one of the zoos that I visit a lot they have an open enclosure with ring-tailed lemurs and those little guys are just a TON of fun to hang out with! That would really be worth it, trust me! :D"

If their natural habitat wasn't so small in area, and it wasn't in China, I wouldn't be surprised if there was breeding and domestication programs. They are cousins of raccoons, are no larger than a small dog, and have been shown to be some what capable house pets. One of the only difficulties would be supplying enough bamboo for their diet."
redpandas,338ri3,TrixieMisa,2,Tue Apr 21 14:54:54 2015 UTC,Also (according to Wikipedia) they don't tolerate temperatures over 25C.  But Taronga Zoo in Sydney has a thriving red panda colony (https://taronga.org.au/album/seba-cub) and it gets way hotter than 25C in Sydney.  Maybe they keep somewhere cool for them on the really hot days though.  They are adorable and seem to enjoy interacting with humans; if there were more of them around I think they'd make great pets.

redpandas,31sqhf,LesbianDildoJesus,3,Wed Apr 8 03:13:45 2015 UTC,!!! How do you arrange for something like this?
redpandas,31sqhf,Elpoca,10,Wed Apr 8 00:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well LesbianDildoJesus, the Calgary Zoo offers Behind the Scenes access (for a price).  You can check their website for info"
redpandas,31sqhf,Elpoca,3,Wed Apr 8 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"I've been considering doing this; it's very expensive, though. Would you mind telling me how you got to interact with the red pandas? Was the experience worth it?"
redpandas,31sqhf,LesbianDildoJesus,7,Wed Apr 8 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"You meet up with the keeper and they escort you behind the scenes where they store the red panda's food, treats, etc. in a attached shelter next to the red panda enclosure.  They tell you some interesting info about them and about the set up they have that people normally don't see.  Then we were handed a bunch of bamboo branches for the red pandas.  Unfortunately, due to the male being older and not as friendly towards humans, and the female being new to the zoo, we were told we were not allowed to hand feed or pet the red pandas (as tempting as it was) because they were prone to swiping at you if they didn't agree with something.  The female, Sakura (pictured) hissed a few times at the keeper because they weren't giving up the pears fast enough.  Our job with the bamboo branches were to replace the already stripped branches around the enclosure for them to eat which after investigating for a few minutes, they finally deemed it good enough to eat.  Then we just hung around taking pictures of them and asking minor questions till the grumpy old red panda leered at us to leave so he could take a nap.  We probably stayed for about 30-40 minutes.  Overall, my experiences with red pandas before it was seeing them from a distance sleeping like 95% of the time.  To be able to see them in action and get much closer to them was worth it, granted it was quite pricey but you know the money is going somewhere worth it and it's something you don't get to do all the time."

redpandas,2x20by,PandasInternational,2,Wed Feb 25 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"In warm, humid climates, cubs may often suffer from dermatophytosis. Early diagnosis and treatment with itraconazole is effective in curing the condition. Left untreated, the infection may result in necrosis of tails and ears and in the death of the cubs. Concern over this and other medical conditions will require that cubs are checked at least once a week in the nest, and so a strictly hands-off approach to nest management would not be suitable. Interestingly, Australian zoos report little problem with dermatophytosis despite the climate there (personal interviews with zoo veterinarians). Again, however, one finds a circular argument with this condition, as the development of dermatophytosis in cubs may be associated with the mother’s over-grooming and carrying her cubs about more than normal. The excessive saliva on the skin of the cubs then sets up an environment for the fungal disease to take hold. So, once again, one is at the question of the husbandry and environmental conditions that potentiate maternal stress and consequent medical problems which then require greater human intervention in the nest.

So they've never grown to live in most areas of the planet, and have mostly lived away from us  edit : and of course they need a bamboo supply , and it doesnt grow everywhere."

The two pandas share the same parents, but they're different ages. They don't recognize each other as siblings, so the older one tends to harass the younger one.   In the wild, red pandas are forced to live on their own before mating season. Living with a younger sibling is not normal for them.  It's a little sad, and something I kind of wish this zoo would stop doing. The mother is in the same enclosure. She's always on edge to intervene any fights, and defend the younger cub. She still recognizes both as her children, and both her children recognize her as mother, but the two siblings don't see eye to eye. It was just over a year ago the mother was protecting the older one from an even older sister."

There are very few fences or glass to separate humans from the animals. So I get a great shots of any animal in the Singapore Zoo. Check out his site here on how proper zoos should be designed.  http://bernardharrisonandfriends.com/  There is nothing seperating me and the red panda other than a chest high fence, a little drain after it provides another deterrent to the red panda. The enclosure has trees. One of the tree branches/trunk connected to a wall overhead the path we walked. The red pandas constantly walked over to investigate us as visitors.  So there is no barrier between me and the red pandas. The photography equipment certainly helped. I used a manual focus Tokina AT-X 50-250mm f4-5.6 (for Canon FD) coupled to a Samsung NX1000 through an adapter. Incredibly good reach.
