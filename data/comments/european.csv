If Britain, France, and the USA would have just let Germany and Poland duke it out, there would probably have been no WWII as Hitler would most likely take back the former Prussian territories along with Danzig and then would have no further territorial claims in Europe with the exception of Alsace-Lorraine.

(gypsies). Prostitution here is mostly done through internet so its not like you will pick up a slut on street (gta style) and it isnt illegal so there are hardly any forced-prostitution cases. (we arent really profiting country so)  i live in western slovakia and i travel through whole republic to see my grandparents, and from the many times i traveled ive seen just 2 prostitutes in like.. 15 years standing on side of road.  but sure, if you will go to bratislava near slovnaft.. you gonna see a lot of ugly sluts"

Maybe someone should investigate it before you can claim it doesnt exist.   Maybe the one asserting it exists on a large scale should provide proof.

If your ancestors didn't live there then your parents have to go through elaborate process to obtain citizenship. In Lithuania its a bit different.

Roughly 15.   which probably increases the further one moves from Moscow or Saint Petersburg.   It's generally the other way around. Non-Russians tend to flock to Moscow and Saint-Petersburg while most of the non-major Russian cities remain at least 90% Slavic, even in the Far East.   The fertility rate is 1.75, below the 2.1 replacement rate.   It's certainly changing for the better. It will be near replacement level in the next 10 years, i believe. Russia has the opposite process of what other European countries have but it might be still not enough to support the huge amount of old people from the Soviet population boom.   Russia has the highest abortion rate of any reported country   Soviet legacy.   with the exception of Chechens and Afghans   There are hardly any Afghans there. You mean Dagestanis.   Russia doesn’t conceive of herself as a Western power anyway, just ask Dugin.   In the 90s and 00s, Russian nationalism was off the charts and even Dugin considered himself to be one. Now, with all the anti-Western rhetoric, Russians gave in and Putin started to promote Eurasianism which is just a less degenerate version of multiculturalism. My point is that It's more of a political necessity than a genuine belief. Russians are still ethnocentric."

They have a list of users whose comments they will always downvote: u/meteorblade u/tls5164 u/CIKAFIUMPH u/iluvucorgi u/AerionTargaryen u/Amos_Quito  they pay you $5 if you manage to dox someone saying anti-Isreal stuff. Its unclear what they do with that personal information. The fact that they are heavily financed (paying $1 for 10 up/downvotes will add up fast) might suggest external funding, perhaps from the J1DF itself (replace '1' with 'I')   EDIT:  More sources: from the /r/conspiracy thread here: https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsifv/a_user_has_inflitrated_and_exposed_a_prozionist/   I'm messaging the moderators of this subreddit to let you know that r/worldnews has been the target of a pretty elaborate vote scheme that I discovered a few days ago. I discovered this when I saw this thread on the Warrior forum, an internet marketing forum that I am part of. Here's the thread that was posted, offering to pay people to vote on reddit threads.  https://www.warriorforum.com/showthread.php?p=10170952 I joined mainly out of curiosity and thought they would be using it for marketing their articles, but it turned it was just a huge Israel support group. There were close to 80 people in the group and it seemed like it had been going on for a while, and they are basically posted threads and telling people to downvote and upvote them. hey were being super secretive as well and had all their ""rules"" in a separate web hosted text. I honestly don't really give a fuck about Israel or Palestine but what pissed me off was how obsessed they were with this and how they were trying to get personal information from the users they didn't like. Not sure what they intended to do with the information but it seems like they had nasty intentions. I was going to message the users they ""blacklisted"" and tell them that their personal information might be getting collected, but I figured it's better if I just alert the mods here. Anyways, I got banned from the group for threatening to tell the mods lol. I did find their rules in my search history on here if you want to see how they are doing this:   archive link to warrior forum post: https://archive.is/Ujd72  Another Source and further discussion: https://np.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/3dsp59/wow_a_user_has_inflitrated_and_exposed_a/"
european,3dv1yx,vladskandermagne,3,Sun Jul 19 23:11:47 2015 UTC,I guess all social media can be manipulated. You can shitpost forever on 4chan and slide important posts off the board. You can upvote approved opinions and downvote unapproved opinions. Do this early enough and you dictate the narrative or least disrupt your opponent's narratives. Facebook pages can have thousands of inflated likes. It's not really surprising that Israel is one of the industry leaders but Chinese and Russian governments have similar programmes - though I feel they're more limited than as engrossed in the rather personal social media like Reddit or 4chan.   What will the internet look like in even 3 or 5 years?
