Jokes,3e2uld,SamwiseGamgENT,3336,Tue Jul 21 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a Texan who drunkenly wandered into an Irish pub at the age of 20.  For some reason, I was under the impression that you could float a coin on the head of a Guinness.   The bartender had a good laugh about it, but I was totally convinced that I could do it, no problem.  He told me he'd give me the beer for free if I could make it happen.  I very carefully held the coin even with the foam, then watched it drop straight to the bottom.    All I remember after that is the bartender laughing hysterically and screaming in his thick irish accent, ""YOU THOUGHT THE FOAM WAS DENSER THAN THE METAL? HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU DRINK THAT SHIT?!""  Edit: grammar"

If I had to pick a beer to drink a large volume of quickly, Guinness is an obvious first choice. Low alcohol content, low calories, not gassy or filling, smooth and fairly mild tasting (unless the roasted flavour bothers you, not that you taste that chugging). Better than even say bud light or another light beer with little flavour or alcohol because those have a crap tonne of carbonation that makes them hard to chug and bloats your stomach."

Jokes,3e2uld,Edmoerrday,67,Tue Jul 21 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, Guinness is probably one of the easiest beers to down-in-one.  My buddies and I would all order a round of beers (various brews), and one guy and I would always order a Guinness as our first round.  When the waitress passed them out, we'd try to get our first, then while she was still passing the others out, we would down ours fast enough to finish them before she finished passing out the rest of the drinks... we'd then chastise her for bringing us empty glasses and demand we get our first round soon!  Please note: We were regulars there and were harassing a friend who was the waitress, not someone we didn't know who would take serious offense or worry about genuinely upset customers. In the end, everyone smiles."

I couldn't drink 10 pints of water back to back, but if I had to drink a ton of beer quickly, Guinness is the way to go. Even American light lagers would be more difficult due to the carbonation and lower serving temperature."
Jokes,3e2uld,WDoE,18,Tue Jul 21 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"In college we had a huge St. Pats celebration every year. One of the games was the Quarter Barrel Chug. They'd set around 30 7.5 gallon kegs out in the field, let them sit in the sun for a couple of hours for extra fun, and then your 8-man team would go to your keg with solo cups and await the go signal. Several thousand spectators gathered round. Once started, we'd form a circle and trade off filling the cups, pumping the keg, or drinking. As fast as we could get the beer to come out, we'd drink it. Got third place one year, downed the keg in just under two minutes. Oh, and you couldn't spill any (within reason) or puke. But right after the Quarter Barrel Chug, they had an event called The Hop, Skip, and Puke. You can only imagine how foamy this beer was. It worked out to about 8 full 16-oz beers per person, but that didn't include the about equal amount of foam you had to drink. You really needed to be ready for this event, it was pretty brutal."
Jokes,3e2uld,golfrinserepeat,24,Tue Jul 21 17:58:55 2015 UTC,10 pints of Guinness would be the equivalent of 13 shots of vodka in terms of alcohol content. But you're also drinking 5.68L of creamy fluid as well. It doesn't seem all that doable for the average college kid.

Jokes,3e2uld,guitarstix,375,Tue Jul 21 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"Reminded me of this one:  An Irishman walked into a pub for the first time and ordered four pints of Guinness. The bartender brought the drinks, and the man drank them without commentary. Once a week the man would do this, and the bartender's curiosity eventually got the better of him.  ""Excuse me, but may I ask why you always order four pints of Guinness whenever you come in?""  ""Oh, my three brothers and I used to go out for drinks all the time, but I had to move. As a way of holding to the tradition, I order one for myself, and one for each of my brothers.""  Satisfied with the answer, the bartender went back to work, occasionally letting other patrons know the story. Eventually, all of the regulars knew of the man and his three brothers.  After a few months, however, the man ordered only three drinks. The other patrons noticed, and the mood in the pub turned somber. As the bartender brought the drinks, he said, ""I'm sorry for your loss."" Confused, the man asked for the bartender to explain. ""Well, all this time you've ordered one drink for yourself, and three for your brothers. You ordered three today, not four. Doesn't that mean you've lost one of your brothers?""  The man laughed. ""Oh, no, not at all. I've just given up Guinness for Lent."""

If I ordered a Pizza, would you assume I'm Italian?""  — ""I didn't...""  ""And if I ordered a Bratwurst, would that make me German?""  — ""No, but...""  ""So why the hell do you think I'm Irish then?""  — ""Well sir, this is a book store.""    A nun was out in front of a pub in Dublin preaching to the passing crowd about the sins of alcohol. A man entering the pub stopped her and asked her if she has ever had a drink. — ""Good heavens, I wouldn't let that vile liquor anywhere near these lips."" — ""Tell you what,"" the man says, ""I'll buy you a drink and if you don't love it, I will quit drinking forever."" — ""Well, I suppose if it were to save you from the clutches of the Devil, I could tolerate it just this once,"" agreed the nun, ""but put it in this coffee mug so I may hide my shame."" The man walks in and orders two double whiskeys, asking for one to be poured into the mug. The bartender sighs and says ""That damn nun's out there again, isn't she?""    Paddy had been drinking at his local Dublin pub all day and most of the night celebrating Ireland's football victory. Mick, the bartender, says ""Don't go drinking any more tonight, Paddy"". Paddy replies ""Okay Mick, I'll be on me way then."" Paddy spins around on his stool and steps off. He falls flat on his face. ""Shite"" he says and pulls himself up by the stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls flat on his face. ""Shite, Shite!"" He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to the door and some fresh air he'll be fine. He belly crawls to the door and shimmies up to the door frame. He sticks his head outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the sidewalk. He falls flat on his face. ""Bejaysis... I'm tanked,"" he says. He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door and shimmies up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. He takes a look up the stairs and says ""No way!"" He crawls up the stairs to his bedroom door and says ""If i can just make it to me bed."" He takes a step into the room and falls flat on his face. He says ""to hell with it"" and falls into bed. The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of coffee and says, ""Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night?"". Paddy says, ""I did Jess. I was tanked' pissed. But how'd you know?"" ""Mick called. You left y'wheelchair at the pub.""  (edit: added)"

We arrived around 6 am local time with a couple hours to spare during our layover. I wanted to say that I had enjoyed a beer while in Germany. The problem was we weren't going to be there for more alcohol appropriate drinking hours. Well, on our long walk between our two gates I kept a watchful eye for beer drinkers at every restaurant we passed. Lo and behold I did not see a single adult without a beer in front of them. Even the McDonald's was serving alcohol to all of its patrons.   Outside of alcoholics and tailgaters I don't think I have ever seen or heard of such drinking behavior in any part of America, but I've been wrong before."

Jokes,3e405e,dusmeyedin,6,Wed Jul 22 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"This joke is funny because of the pun created by using multiple meanings of the word ""imaginary"". One meaning of the word implies that she cannot be seen. This joke is a simile,  in which the writer's girlfriend is compared to sqrt(-100). This mathematical expression is equivalent to 10i, where i is the imaginary number equivalent to the square root of negative 1. (Side note,  imaginary numbers are written in the from a+bi, where a is the real part and bi is imaginary). The writer is saying that their (imaginary) girlfriend is a ""10"", which likely derives from some sort of rating which uses a scale of 1-10. So, the second meaning of the word imaginary comes from the comparison to the mathematical expression sqrt(-100)."

""None,"" replied Johnny, ""cause the rest would fly away."" ""Well, the answer is four,"" said the teacher, ""but I like the way you're thinking.""  Little Johnny says, ""I have a question for you. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one was licking her cone, the second was biting her cone and the third was sucking her cone, which one is married?""  ""Well,"" said the teacher nervously, ""I guess the one sucking the cone.""  ""No,"" said Little Johnny, ""the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you're thinking.""   And   Little April was not the best student in Sunday school. Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ""Tell me, April, who created the universe?"" When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.  ""GOD ALMIGHTY!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""Very good"" and April fell back asleep. A while later the teacher asked April, ""Who is our Lord and Saviour,"" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.  ""JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question.  ""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?""  And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.  This time April jumped up and shouted, ""IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ASS!""  The Teacher fainted."

Everyone has made it very clear that the raid was just to be safe, but many people don't bother to get the facts, so he's getting the Michael Jackson treatment. Jared has lost his spokesperson job, and either he's had to distance himself from his foundation, or the foundation has had ties cut by other organizations.

Jokes,3e0mo7,NomadicCupcake,59,Tue Jul 21 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"This is funny because of the pun, resulting from the multiple definitions of the word ""weight"". This joke stems from a popular riddle, following the format of:  ""Which weighs more - x pounds of Substance A or x pounds of Substance B?""   in which Substance B is generally less dense than Substance A (with equal volumes substance A would have a greater mass). In this case, 200 pounds of bricks and 200 pounds of feathers have the same mass (even though equal volumes of the same substances would probably have different weights).   However, though both have equal mass, this joke claims that the feathers would be heavier, using a pun to cite their reasoning. This answer is contradictory to the reader's expectations, as the reader would expect that they weigh the same/have the same mass on earth.    The pun in this joke uses two meanings of the word ""weigh"". Firstly, weight defined as an object's relative mass (usually to earth's gravity), and secondly, the emotional value of something (eg. someone with a heavy heart is sad). Though in reality the two weigh the same, the morality of obtaining feathers from several birds (it's implied that this would probably be done inhumanely) would cause the feathers to have a greater emotional ""weight""."

However, the person you're replying to is wrong, since Mass1 = Mass2 if and only if Weight1 = Weight2.  Mass is independent of object's surroundings and only depends on the object, while its Weight depends on the gravity affecting it too.

Predators run to catch prey, and prey runs to escape, but silk worms do not run. They aren't predators, and their defense is simply camouflage.  So racing is not something that they would naturally do. If they did though, they probably would tie."

Jokes,3dyqyx,RogueDM1214,53,Mon Jul 20 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"Better Formatting + Top Comment (/u/RogueDM1214):  A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the bishop how he had done.   The bishop replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. if I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""  So next Sunday he took the bishop's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:    There are 10 commandments, not 12. There are 12 disciples, not 10. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. We do not refer to Jesus Christ and his disciples as J. C. and the boys  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey,don't say he was stoned off his ass. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T."" When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me"" The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,"" The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God.

It's a pun, because it relates closely to both parts of the question: ""blood vessel"" is related to vampires (what they like to bite into), and ""vessel"" is another word for a boat. Notice the entire answer must relate to one of the items, while part (or all) of the answer can be interpreted another way to relate to the second.  The only USB I know is a computer connector. It has nothing to do with the United States other than sharing some starting letters, and it has nothing to do with bees. Therefore it is not a pun--you are simply adding two words together."

So one time he called another friends mom hot and the guy replies are you serious she's 200 pounds and 50+ yrs old why would u say that? so friend with hot step mom replies: Your right your mom's gross I would rate her a 4/10, throw in your grandma and sister and theres another 2/10 x2, now we have a solid 8/10 i can work with that! lol"

Jokes,3dyqew,LikelyNotSober,0,Tue Jul 21 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"Republican here. Can say with absolute certainty, Trump is a blabbering idiot. Granted he could probably help us with the national debt. But the US is a melting pot and world wide trade leader, and foreign affairs are clearly not his strong suit. He does one thing well, and that's money, and even that's questionable with his bankruptcy. We need a jack of all trades, not a master of one."
Jokes,3dyqew,bigfudge48,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"No, he's a risk-taker. That's fine if you're in business for yourself and willing to jeopardize your net worth for some far-fetched hunch or opinion.   I would want somebody much more level-headed and prudent running the country. If America fails, you can't just shut it down and get another round of venture capital funding to get it up and running again.  Also, he's a loud-mouth, ego-centrical douchbag. He'd be worse than having Putin or Berlusconi as president."
Jokes,3dyqew,LikelyNotSober,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:39 2015 UTC,He has never made any money so  him fixing the debt problems are very unlikely.

Jokes,3dyqew,cATSup24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yes he has filed bankruptcy, tons of people have. But how many of them then turn around and have a net worth of 4.1 million? He clearly knows what he is doing from a business stand point. He would never make a good president and is a self righteous douchebag, but even though he has filed for bankruptcy you can't deny he is a hell of a businessman."
Jokes,3dyqew,bigfudge48,0,Tue Jul 21 23:39:00 2015 UTC,You might as well write   Mentally challenged here...
Jokes,3dyqew,_Ball_so_hard_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"So you call someone mentally retarded solely on the fact that their voter registration says republican? I'd understand the judgement if I went on some crazy rant about how abortion is murder, how if you aren't Christian you're terrorist, or stated some racial ridiculousness. I've had to raise myself from my bootstraps and carry my pistol at my side, that's a large part as to why I decided red when I registered. I voted to legalize gay marriage in my state in 2012 because every human has the right to marry who they love. So often republicans are deemed close minded, due to the actions of the radicals. So how is profiling someone because of the radicals not close minded?"
Jokes,3dyqew,bigfudge48,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"Except that your ideals don't matter as much when you vote. At the end of the day, you're voting for republican candidates. These are the people whose party boycotts marriage licenses to keep their religious base, the people who criminalize marijuana to prolong the profitable war on drugs, the people who see gun regulation as castration. You can say you're conservative, I lean both ways on different issues, but saying you vote republican? You are as blind and ignorant as can be."
Jokes,3dyqew,_Ball_so_hard_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:09:44 2015 UTC,I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. Just because that's how I'm registered doesn't mean that's how I vote.
Jokes,3dyqew,bigfudge48,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:14:19 2015 UTC,Why are you even registered like that then? If it's a cancerous party why even register under them?
Jokes,3dyqew,_Ball_so_hard_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"By that logic, why does it matter at all? The party system itself is cancerous and broken. It's those who are guided solely by their party and not their own morals and views that causes a lot of our political battles."
Jokes,3dyqew,bigfudge48,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:09:27 2015 UTC,"Republican here...   Do you have a short memory or is this another personality or wtf. You support a party you think is broken?  Then again, the base Republican can say more autistic things."
Jokes,3dyqew,_Ball_so_hard_,4,Wed Jul 22 03:14:37 2015 UTC,I am a fairly conservative libertarian and I can't believe anyone supports this knucklehead.  I can only surmise that he's the distraction candidate to draw media attention away from the serious candidates until later.
Jokes,3dyqew,mjfleck34,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:05:08 2015 UTC,"I can totally believe that he has support. Lots of Americans agree with what he's saying. Trump is a business man, he made those remarks about Mexicans to speak to the American right. And they ate it all up."
Jokes,3dyqew,QuarterOztoFreedom,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to the more recent comments about John McCain and prisoners of war.  As to the illegal immigrant comments, he may have struck a nerve to try and distinguish between immigration and unchecked, unenforced illegal immigration, but setting substance aside, he lacks even a shred of diplomacy."
Jokes,3dyqew,mjfleck34,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:11 2015 UTC,He also talked about bring jobs back from china and mexico. That seems good.

The simpler the joke the better, and adding ""already"" doesn't make it funnier and doesn't add to the clarity of the joke enough to make it worthwhile.

Since very few people enjoy math jokes I'll add one to the party:      A physics professor and a mathematics professor are interviewing for the same job.  Unable to decide between the two they decide to give each the same test.  They bring the physics professor into a room that has a sink and faucet, an empty pan on the counter, a self striking wooden match, and a gas stove and ask him how he would boil the water.    He replied: ""I would take the pan to the sink, fill it with water from the faucet, place it on the stove, light the stove with the match and wait for the water to boil"".      They then bring the mathematics professor into an identical room and give him the same task, to which he gives exactly the same answer as the physics professor.  Unable to break the tie they decide to give them one more test.    They bring the physics professor into the same scenario except this time the pan is already full of water and they ask him to describe how he would boil water.  He answers ""I would place the pan of water on the stove, light it with the match, and wait for the water to boil"".  They then bring in the mathematics professor and give him the same new task to which he replies:      ""That's easy I'd just take the pan to the sink and pour it out thereby reducing it to a problem I had already solved""      I'll see myself out..."

Basically any religious person is religious because they were taught to be as a child. But people deconvert all the time because they learn about the contradictory evidence. I mean the Western world used to be primarily creationist, right? And then evidence showed up and now there are plenty of non-creationists, religious or not. Obviously people were reasoned out of an unreasonable belief.   Edit: Not getting the disagreement. Matt Dillahunty and Seth Andrews (both former evangelical creationists) have callers and writers who regularly talk about being creationists due to indoctrination and then learning about evolution and the scientific method and then not being creationists anymore. Some people are literally shunned for this kind of realization. Saying that people can't be reasoned out of an unreasonable belief isn't just wrong, it promotes a completely undeserved resignation.   Edit2: Holy strawmen and semantics, batman!"

Basically any religious person is religious because they were taught to be as a child.""   This is so untrue. You are only presenting the fact that creationists ""deconvert"", however it is also true that millions convert from non-creationism to creationism. I have a good friend that was not religious at all and is now a Muslim. This was his own choice, and he took it despite it creating issues for many years between him and his family. What this shows is that despite the side-effects of his family relationships, he still chose Islam out of his own free will without any kind of pressure.  In short, you assume nobody converts to creationism. This is entirely wrong. In fact, I would argue that this joke applies more to non-creationists in my own experience."

Jokes,3dsj6l,holben,6,Sun Jul 19 07:37:46 2015 UTC,"You're right. But I don't think it's very difficult to live within this medium - even for people who are scientists or otherwise apply critical thinking in their work for example.  Any contemporary Christian faith - except from a few extreme fundamentalist positions - needs to selectively interpret the teachings and of course the interpretations change along with society and culture (and interact with both actually). You can't really take the stuff literally, although some try.  Some people are also more comfortable with holding personal beliefs that are not provable by the scientific method. In this case it is probably easier when the opposite possibility (there is no god) is also unprovable (at least with any kind of evidence).  I think any rational person will acknowledge that there can be ""truths"" that one holds to be ""true"" also outside of the scientific method and corpus of knowledge. People build their subjective knowledge on their experiences and beliefs all the time. Think of food bloggers - shudder.  As another illustrative example, if you only considered scientifically proved knowledge to be the only ""truth"" or knowledge - then you could probably never ""know"" your friends names or that you love your wife, as the ""legitimacy"" of these claims has likely never been assessed in a peer-reviewed, scientifically rigorous process. The scientific method isn't necessary for that kind of ""personal truths"".  Now, I'm not trying to say that this subjective or personal knowledge will or should hold up as any kind of argument or proof in a rational debate. But I assume many people who hold these personal beliefs about god are not necessarily looking to prove them in a rational debate - but to rather hold them for their personal value.  I'm sure you agree and I'm not trying to argue with you. Just felt like expanding with my thoughts on what you said. Have a nice day."

Like the Big Bang made absolutely no mention of anything causing it, a modern Christian however would say that God caused it."

Faith is like a person squeezing their eyes shut, hands clapped to their ears screaming ""Nah nah nah I can't hear you!"" whereas science is a person who is shown what they thought is wrong, and says ""You're right - the evidence presented shows this earlier model of how this works was incorrect.""

However, Creationist mindsets cannot exist in the cycles they have created by ignoring evidence, as you want to say they do. If you spent any time in an evangelical church (which, why?) you would quickly realize that the hard evidence against their tenets of faith bring them closer to their beliefs both as individuals and closer to each other as a community. In fact, in a secular and increasingly scientific world, these communities are perhaps stronger than they ever could have been before people like Darwin came along and started rewriting the public consciousness. Which all is to say: they love to debate and think about the dissertation-thumpers; they love to hear why their stance could not possibly be conceivable by conventional (read: human) wisdom. This is a guarantee of the divine working of faith within them."

There's an unneeded tangent there.. Anyway, bananas evolved into existence, early primates found them delicious, primate ""hands"" evolved to better grasp the banana, all while the banana evolved to better fit the primates.   I'm quite tired, and that made little sense to me.. If someone can decode that, I'd be thankful..."

Often extremely intelligent. An example in line with the topic example is a flower. Very intelligently designed apparatus created to attract another type of organism, get it to buzz around in your pollen (sperm), and deposit it on the structure which contains the egg.

Is that bad? No. Why do we have to try and hurt each other? How about Christianity as a philosophy? It promotes peace and goodwill towards men. Arguing with an atheist means you have already lost and the atheist has won. No one feels good about that, because in the end we are all losers for that. I say be curious. Ask a Christian about their religion and understand their thinking personally before saying their teachings are criminal. And inversely, ask an evolutionist the same thing. We are all humans and brothers and can learn a lot from each other. It would be terrible for anyone to not invest time with a fellow human before that soul is gone."

The belief you're describing is called ""agnostic atheism"", and the vast majority of atheists are agnostic atheists.   People seem to conflate atheism with a definite, 100% belief that God definitely doesn't exist, which is called ""gnostic atheism"", and I'm sure that kind of atheist does exist, but I've never actually met one.

Jokes,3dppir,GetTheeBehindMeSatan,22,Sat Jul 18 14:20:48 2015 UTC,Because having 4 legs makes an object both more durable (weight is distributed over more legs) and more symmetrical if placed in an otherwise square room. Add to that the fact that a tripod is most stable if it's supporting an object with roughly equal width and length rather then say a rectangular table. This has to do with the fact that a weirder shape allows objects to be placed outside of the bounds of the legs (the area you can create if you draw a line between the legs). This causes such a shape to be unstable.

Jokes,3dppir,securicorscares,20,Sat Jul 18 12:21:00 2015 UTC,"While a three legged stool is will rock less on an uneven surface, as explained above due to the three points on a plane, that does not necessarily equal more stability since it is easier to tip the three legged stool when you shift your weight to a side between the legs.  If a table only had three legs, the tabletop would cantilever farther away from the apron between the legs, leading to easy tipping when you put a heavy object down on the edge of the tabletop. (Think of a pedestal cabaret table at a bar and when you lean on it to impress a lady, causing it to tip and spill her drink. Whoops!) The milking stool avoids these issues because it is so low to the ground, lower center of gravity, and the milker has his legs to assist him from tipping."

Jokes,3dppir,RadiantSun,10,Sat Jul 18 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"The form and weight distribution of a table is different then that of a 3 legged stool.  A table has 4 legs, one on each side, so no metter on which sight someone would place something heavy, there would be something below to make it stable. So no metter how you place weights on it, the table doesn't fall over (or atleast it shouldn't).  To have the same effect with 3 legs is difficult, since you've 4 corners, and the length/width of the sides may not even be the same.  Here my imba paint skills:  3 legs, round (Legs are green, red is the area it will fall down if the center of mass is in it)  Since it has 3 legs, it won't wobble. But if you sit on the corner without a leg, the stool might fall over. But for a small stool, the form like this is good. But if you were to make it a big table, and with 4 corners, the red area would be bigger, and if you place something heavy on it your whole table may end up crashing down.  4 legs, 4 corner (Legs are green, red is the area it will fall down if the center of mass is in it)  You can see that the red area is smaller, and on all sides just as big. You could even completly remove it if you place the legs right at the corner of the table. But if there is a difference in height between the legs, the table may wobble.  edit: when there is too much weight on it if the center of mass is in it"

Jokes,3dppir,boxingdude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"Most tables aren't round, because of that I used a table with corners.  Though if you used a round table, 3 legs would still fall down easier then with 4."
Jokes,3dppir,justarndredditor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. You can't compare a 3-legged table to a 4-legged one by putting the optimal tabletop or a 4-legged table and saying the 4-legged table holds it up better. The optimal number of sides for a 3-legged table's top is a triangle or hexagon while a 4-legged table holds up quadrilaterals or octagons best.  Circular tables are most stable with a nearly infinite number of legs, though. There's nothing special about 4, they just benefit from more legs until they interfere with seating."

How many tables have more then 4 corners?  I'm using the most used form of a table as an example, ofcourse if you use a variant of a table that isn't used that often, a different number of legs may be better, but that's not the point. The question in the beginning was why we don't use 3 legs for tables, and the answer is, that for most tables 3 legs would be bad."

Jokes,3dppir,karnyboy,2,Sat Jul 18 12:59:22 2015 UTC,"rectangular objects fit better in homes than triangular objects becamse rooms are usually rectangular, or at least the walls are parallel and perpendicular. Of course you could also make a 3 legged table that has a rectangular surface instead of a triangle, but then a large portion of the tables surface would be outside of the area defined by the legs, and placing heavy items there would cause the table to tip over.  also a rectangular table seats more people than a triangular table."

Jokes,3dppir,Shod_Kuribo,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:02 2015 UTC,More legs is more stable on a flat surface.  Having a three-legged thing on an uneven surface works great so long as you're not too concerned about how level it is.  People usually like having level tables and chairs.

Jokes,3dppir,quatloo999,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:01:11 2015 UTC,"My guess is because of their shape. If the table/chair has a round surface, they'd work fine with three legs. But if they're square/rectangular, like most are, it's awkward to balance the shape on three legs, plus it's really easy to make them tip over (eg. by putting your weight on your elbows on a part of the table between two legs)."
Jokes,3dppir,FeltMountain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:26:36 2015 UTC,i think its because 3 legs may be more stable on uneven surfaces however for something like a heavy table or a large chair that is higher off the ground than a stool there would be a chance that due to the legs being longer when weight was put on the center point they would splay out and the chair or table would collapse were as with four legs weight would be pushing straight down and into the floor so it can hold more weight and hight is irelivent hope this answered your question

Circular table, sure 3 legs would work, but most tables, I think, are ovular or rectangular in shape. There isn't a way to make the legs equidistant to ensure a proper distribution of weight on the table. Meaning, you'll always have one leg have more force on it than the others. And considering tables are meant to hold up other things, an unequal distribution of weight is asking for failure over time."

As for tables, I'm no engineer, but am guessing the tripod thing only works when you've got your weight on all of it, or something like that. You don't put weight on tables that way, which would probably make it unstable if it only had three legs."
Jokes,3dppir,holycrapolaness,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Because there's more involved in building furniture than a couple of people arguing on the internet? A stool has no need of evenly spaced rear legs to support a back the way a chair does and a stool isn't enevenly weighted the way a dining room table often is, you sit your ass pretty much in the middle of a stool because that's the only place your ass will fit. A table on the other hand can have heavy foods near it's edges, or elbows leaning on it that could unbalance it. There are three legged tables, but they're usually smaller end tables and such to minimize the potential for eneven weighting. Milking stools are what they are because they were made by practical people for practical reasons, three legs are quicker to make from scratch than four and are less intrusive under your feet than four while working just as well as four for the purpose."
Jokes,3dppir,ItIsOneCrazyWorld,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"The stability is also impacted by the center of mass of the object and the area of the space between the legs. If you took a square 4 legged table and replace two of the legs with one leg that would be between the other legs, the area between the legs is halved.   area of a square: : L x W  Area of a Triangle  : 1/2 x L x W  This means that the table with 4 legs will still be stable if you load it unevenly, whereas a table with three legs could tip over if you stack stuff on it wrong.   Of course, for  circular table, 3 points will not be terrible, due to the geometry of a triangle placed within a circle, the ratio of the table/footprint size will be fairly close to 1. However, for a square table, the ratio of table/footprint size is 2, which means that there is more area on top of the table that is not supported by the legs. If you put too much weight on those parts of the table, it will fall over. a square table with 4 legs can have a table/footprint ratio of 1, which means you can put a bunch of weight anywhere on the table and it will not tip over."
Jokes,3dppir,Ducktruck_OG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"3-legged stools and tables are not necessarily more stable when standing on a flat surface.  Any portion of a stool's seat or table's top that extends out past the legs will be unstable if pressure is exerted down on it.    That means, a rectangular table with 3 legs, for instance, might tip over if you put too much weight on certain corners.    If the rectangular table has 4 legs, one near each corner, that isn't a problem.  The tradeoff is, the table must be used on a flat surface.  Edit: You could make all the chair seats and table tops triangular, of course, but most people would prefer a shape they want in a piece of furniture, though it means it would be best used only on a flat floor."
Jokes,3dppir,BrazenNormalcy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"If your table is round this makes sense. If it's a square or a rectangle your going to come up against balance issues and you won't be able to put loads on specific point, unless you have it as a tripod meeting in the centered weight of the table, but then you wouldn't be able to have fold-out leaves without significant engineering.  Four points of contact solves a lot of those problems."
Jokes,3dppir,transmogrified,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"Four legs is more stable than three - But, it is the difference between flexible and specialized that matters here. It is not that three legs is more stable, per se, just more flexible. They can be put on many different surfaces and adapt to be pretty much stable, on those surfaces, which is what a tripod needs. It sacrifices stability for flexibility. Your table does not need that flexibility. It is specifically designed to be placed on a flat, level surface, so it can have 4 legs and be more stable. It sacrifices flexibility for stability. Both are pretty stable though."

Jokes,3dppir,whybother292,2,Sat Jul 18 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a go.  Imagine we're standing in a room. I can put little dots anywhere I want and they'll float.  I put one in one part of the room, then another dot somewhere else. Now say you have a strip of very stiff, very stretchy rubber. You can stick it to one point, and pull it over to the other dot, which you join the other end to.   Now, you pull one end of your strip in the same direction as this line for as long as you want. This defines a line that we can carry on through the whole universe, if our thing is stretchy enough.  Now say, we put a third point somewhere. You grab the side of the elastic strip, and pull it so the edge touches this third point. Now if you pull the side in the direction you were just pulling it, you've defined a plane.  Now add a 4th point. If you don't put this point on the plane, you have to warp the sheet with a bump to make it touch. It's not even.  The stability comes from knowing that if we have a 3 legged stool, the ends of the legs will make a plane. We imagine the ends of the legs as our points.  If a surface is level, i.e another plane, we can just rotate the stool so our plane lies parallel to this one. for instance, we'll be able to turn or lift the stool around until it sits on this surface (these are called rigid body motions), and it won't rock when we push down on it.  The 4th point is the end of the 4th leg. Now unless the surface has this bump in, there's no way to orient the stool so its legs are all touching the ground, and it'll rock. We'd have to add a lump of newspaper or take a hammer to the ground.  For the uneven terrain, I think you use the argument about placing the points anywhere. This is much easier to visualise if you imagine smooth, sloped surfaces though."

Jokes,3dppir,TheScamr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:03:26 2015 UTC,The best way to scam people is to be honest the vast majority of time then set people up at the end.  So you can trust this as a set up that builds trust for a bigger scam.  Like how Littlefinger set up Ned.

Jokes,3dppir,agoatforavillage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:06 2015 UTC,Maybe if the milker was blonde that would make it funny. Or Irish.
Jokes,3dppir,SimpleCoalMiner,0,Sat Jul 18 17:07:51 2015 UTC,This sounds like nonsense.  The four legged stool has 4 sets of legs taken 3 at a time it is clearly more stable.  Any extra stability from the 3 legged stool comes from the center of gravity being directly over the center point of the 3 legged triangle the feet of the chair make.  Adding a 4th leg to a 3 legged chair will not make it less stable.
Jokes,3dppir,Psandysdad,0,Sat Jul 18 16:12:33 2015 UTC,3 points don't necessarily define a plane in two dimensions. All three points can be in a straight line.  Severely unequal legs would render a three legged stool unusable. The plane of orientation of the seat must be parallel to the plane of gravitational attraction for the stool to serve any purpose.  A four legged stool has four points of contact on the gravitational plane and is thus inherently more stable. Consider which stool would be easier to knock over to see this.

Jokes,3dppir,Low_discrepancy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:36:48 2015 UTC,Well it's kinda difficult to define a parallel surface to earth if earth isn't a plane surface. Even a 3 legged chair would have that problem.

On the other hand, if your mother and law ""gets it twice"", that means she will be beaten half to death, then beaten half to death from her ""half to death"" position, making it actually 3/4ths of the way to death."

You see, genie magic is instantaneous. Therefore, having been beaten half to death, the mother-in-law is then beaten fully to death (1/2 death x 2 = 1) If the man wished for half of a pizza, the mother-in-law would get a whole pizza (""half"" meaning of the original whole)."

Also... the joke is sexist. It has a sexist message, the same as if i were to say something sexist in a non-joke context.
