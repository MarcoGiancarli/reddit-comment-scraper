StonerEngineering,3dsrl6,isitplastic,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"""After a hole is burned in the bottle""  Dont burn a hole in the bottle, that will release toxins.  Also the fact you have dyed plastic (as in not super clear like a Poland Spring water bottle) is also a big no-no. Basically you take what is already a no-no, and make it a lot worse. Clear plastic burns somewhat clean, but is still not worth the future alzheimer's.  The heat from the downstem after being lit could be enough to degrade the plastic into the water. Also in response to what you said up there, 460F degrees is close. Weed is usually found between 300-500F, and a standard Bic is above 1,000F and can be as high as 3,000F."
StonerEngineering,3dsrl6,obsidianchao,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, resin code 7 is reserved for ""other"" plastics.  From various acrylics, polycarbonates, nylons, and polylactic acid.  And yes, some of those things (acrylic and polycarbonate specifically) are reasonably safe to pass smoke through.   The kicker is all plastics have a viable solvent. Meaning some chemical/s out there will break them down chemically.  Glass has one. Molten sodium hydroxide. And I don't readily know where to get any of that."

StonerEngineering,3dsrl6,eraserhill,2,Sun Jul 19 03:47:23 2015 UTC,The only good tip I can give you about this bottle is to lightly screw the cap on cause if had like three of these bottles and the caps always break. But if you really want to make a bong out of this which is a bad idea and no one recommends you could try to make it like a hookah type thing. Use a slide/downstem and drill a hole in the clear top and attach a hose. Good luck and make the right choice. Toke on.

Both parts are 100% brass which I sanded smooth and cleaned to remove any harmful substance or residue.

The whole rig: http://i.imgur.com/Z2CqSbT.jpg  Yeah yeah I know plastic bottle. I need your guys help on this one so I don't need to use a water bottle. Since this nail is just an airsoft barrel it doesn't really fit in any glass. I stuck it inside an aluminum downstem that's glued into a bottle, that's the only way I've been able to use it so far. I'd like to put a 14mm adapter on the end of the nail so it can be used with common glass but I have no idea how to do that, or at least how to do it safely.   I am really satisfied with this nail. It's robust, heats up nice and quick and works the way you'd expect a store bought nail to work. Bonus was I created it because I created my own oil out of reclaim from my vape mouthpiece.

StonerEngineering,3dkj59,M1RR0R,9,Fri Jul 17 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"As there ought to be. Soak it in water with soap and baking soda - steel can soak up a surprising amount of oil into it, and more expensive fittings can have coatings on both in and outside."

StonerEngineering,3dkj59,Cdresden,9,Fri Jul 17 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"Stainless is fine for pipemaking.  Wash the fittings with degreaser/detergent to remove any traces of oil or grease.  Aluminum is, also, though it's misunderstood.  You don't want to use foil, because the thinness of the metal can cause it to disintegrate in the flame, releasing metallic vapor.  And you don't want to smoke out of an aluminum beverage can, because the inside is coated with a thin layer of resin, which you'll end up inhaling.  But thicker aluminum parts don't have those issues, and are fine for pipemaking."

It would get very hot if you were putting a lot more heat into it.  But for the purposes of smoking weed, you're not.  It's the same as with any type of metal pipe, steel, brass or aluminum; the metal may warm up a bit if you're smoking out a large group of people, but not uncomfortably so."

It looks like you have the hose going onto the stem of the Büchner flask and just have that glass stem as a mouthpiece. Is this correct? If so, the Büchner flask is just acting to connect the tube to the stem and only increases the volume of smoke to be inhaled. You should turn that stem upside down, connect the hose to it, and use it as a downstem to make the the Büchner flask a second bubbler. Attach another hose to the stem of the Büchner flask for a mouthpiece and you can just pass the hose without having to move the entire setup."

However, it would never collect enough resin to hold a screen in it because it was so smooth on the inside.

StonerEngineering,3d4jes,liamc99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm confused where the aluminum is but it depends, it mostly isn't the best thing but it should do if it doesn't oxides. Do u know if the aluminum is galvanized, if it is its not very safe. Also what's your downstem, if its plastic you should be more concerned about that."

My understanding is most vapes built for herb heat up the coil prior to airflow. Some (mflb) are quick, others (g-pro) take time. To my knowledge, none use an on-demand coil firer. Separating the coil from the herb chamber with a one way air flap should be good enough to keep the herb only warm (not warm enough to vape) until you breathe through. This is the part I could be most wrong about, I haven't torn down a vape either.   For the heat control, a bang-bang controller ( threshold circuit driving a flipflop driving a relay ) based on a thermisters feedback reading should be more than sufficient, but might be difficult to tune exactly. Something like an attiny45 driving a relay might work more consistently, but I know you said you wanted only circuits."

With that being said, a standard flower set up would be male to female. The bowl is male and the downstem is female.

StonerEngineering,3cz4xx,austinhix,6,Mon Jul 13 02:44:26 2015 UTC,"Sadly there is not much you can do with these bottles that utilizes both necks. If you have a really long glass drill bit you could drill the bottom of the top neck/inner glass, and then that would be the downstem, where the bowl goes.  Or you could drill a hole on the outside glass and add your own glass downstem. The neck on the side of the bottle would be the mouthpiece. Then you could use the inner glass to hold decorative liquid or perhaps freeze water beforehand to use as a coolant.  There are a few more things you could do but they would require more work, more time, and the correct tools."
StonerEngineering,3cz4xx,Pass_the_joint,3,Sun Jul 12 07:58:06 2015 UTC,That's a great idea for the inner chamber to be for cooling. I'll try it and post if I'm successful.  EDIT: Spelling.
StonerEngineering,3cz4xx,KJHazed420,6,Sun Jul 12 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"If you go that route, use glycerine instead of water in the inner tube.  It gets colder and withot freezing so you avoid issues relating to ice expanding"
StonerEngineering,3cz4xx,KJHazed420,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"I have an idea. You could turn this into a shisha type bong. The bowl would go on the neck at the top. Then, you use the other stem for the hose. The neck being too high up shouldn't matter as this does not have to be in the water. The bowl has to have something that extends into the water to filter the smoke. You could use a thin tube. If the neck is too small I'd just cut it off, and still put the bowl there."

The grinder is useless, and using the pipe by itself it isn't the best, very hot metallic tasting smoke. If you do get it, keep one chamber empty and use that to clear it and to switch between air and dank. It is also great at shooting fiireballs down your throat, it works much better when used to build a bong."

Put a carb and a hole for the socket in the far side of the bottle and throw the bottle away after each use. The socket is small and easy to hide wherever you want, although I'm sure the plastic isn't the greatest for you to smoke out of its served me well."
StonerEngineering,3cxo9v,randomredditor24,-5,Sat Jul 11 20:16:45 2015 UTC,Grab an empty soda can and indent the middle of the can. Poke some holes using a needle into the bent in portion. Putting the weed on the holes portion and putting your mouth up to the drinking spot on the can you have a recyclable pipe. Not good for your health though.
StonerEngineering,3cyg29,KushyChussy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:33:29 2015 UTC,I just made this today and have a quick question about the downstem. Do the diffusion beads still work if the downstem only comes to about the top of the beads? Does the downstem have to go all the way to the bottom of the jar in order to utilize all the beads? Thanks!
StonerEngineering,3cyg29,prollynotadrugdealer,2,Sat Jul 11 22:33:56 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure but I think you'd want it to reach the bottom so the bubbles diffuse more as they rise through the beads
StonerEngineering,3cyg29,Xeeroy,2,Sat Jul 11 22:45:11 2015 UTC,Yes you need the downstem to reach the bottom to utilize all the diffusion beads.
StonerEngineering,3cyg29,omfglolzords,2,Sat Jul 11 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"Because it rises smoke never makes contact with the beads below the downstem, only the beads above the downstem. This means that if the downstem only goes to the top of the beads then the beads do nothing."

StonerEngineering,3cy9tn,mchammer223,2,Sat Jul 11 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"It's possible.....I think. You can put a downstem that goes from the top, down Inside the bottle, then have the nail connect to the down stem (may have to get an adapter for the down stem to the nail because most downstems are female pieces, at least to my knowledge). You can then have a glass tube come out the side at an angle to use as the mouth piece, make sure it is way above the water line. If this works you should definitely post some pics on a separate post."

StonerEngineering,3clu4f,mystic-sloth,6,Thu Jul 9 00:53:59 2015 UTC,If you have the right bit a Dremel is an easy option they make bits expressly for that purpose.
StonerEngineering,3clu4f,RexFox,8,Thu Jul 9 04:56:29 2015 UTC,To make the whole hole with a dremel you end up sanding in a circle like catwoman for a long period of time and then your lucky if your hole is circular. I can pop circular holes out of bottles in 5 minutes with this thing on a portable drill and they the perfect shape and size every time.

StonerEngineering,3clu4f,KidPinkman,5,Wed Jul 8 22:30:05 2015 UTC,How do you get an angle when drilling ?
StonerEngineering,3clu4f,rickyhatespeas,5,Wed Jul 8 23:39:14 2015 UTC,Getting the angle is easy as its just a matter of drilling in at an angle and then using sides to sand it down a little. The harder part is that this creates an oval shape that won't fit a downstem or grommet well. I've used plumbing epoxy to make a good fit before but this doesn't look very classy. These days I find bottles with angled glass if I can to avoid that problem. If anyone has a way to fit an oval whole (oval grommet?) I'd be glad to hear it.
StonerEngineering,3clu4f,Cdresden,3,Thu Jul 9 00:29:22 2015 UTC,"I have seen another solution to this. A little harder to find..

StonerEngineering,3clu4f,Cdresden,3,Thu Jul 9 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"The best way is to ask around and find someone who owns a drill press who will let you use it.  Brace the bottle in a chock at your desired angle.  Have one person use a squirt bottle to lubricate the bit with water while another person drills the hole.  Otherwise, if you're just using a regular drill, you want to brace the bottle firmly and drill slowly.  It's best if you can duct tape the bottle to something so you can hold the drill with both hands."

StonerEngineering,3clu4f,randybanks_,3,Thu Jul 9 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"I've used it, the trick is to have it underwater so it doesn't overheat. Overheating causes diamonds to strip off the metal and smooth metal isn't great for sanding."

StonerEngineering,3cdmf3,Astroturf420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:43:02 2015 UTC,Some sort of cognac bottle I found in the recycling bin of a house I was house sitting for hahaha.
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,CaptainJackers,6,Tue Jul 7 13:51:06 2015 UTC,What I recommend is that you run cold water over the glass to stop heat from cracking the piece. Next place your piece onto a folded cloth for cushioning. When you begin to drill start at an angle to make a small notch for yourself to work with then slowly angle into the glass till you are flush with the side. Don't push the bit into the glass with force just let the bit grind away at the surface and eventually through the piece. If you follow these instructions you should make your carb with no problems.
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,RosaParksStoleMySeat,5,Tue Jul 7 14:45:50 2015 UTC,It is also probably a good idea to practice this technique a couple of times on some glass bottles you have laying around that are about the same thickness. This way you can get some practice and become more comfortable with the process.
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,trumpetguyy13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:47:50 2015 UTC,thats a pretty smart idea I would not have thought of that.
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,stellarguymk,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the going slow thing, but instead of just running cold water over the piece submerge the piece in water. The water will still keep the piece from overheating and the water will help cushion the piece from the inside to help prevent unwanted cracking"

StonerEngineering,3cfbos,frezner,2,Wed Jul 8 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"It seems like it'd work alright. It'll be a gamble as to whether or not the glass cracks, but it's up to you. Just be really gentle with it."
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,frezner,2,Tue Jul 7 14:31:24 2015 UTC,It'd be helpful to see a picture. The shape is a pretty large deciding factor in if and how you drill it. Is it a pull bowl bubbler?
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,frezner,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"here are some pics. with mflb for scale, was planning on drilling the carb on one of the sides near the bowl  http://i.imgur.com/VYpnVo1h.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/9QfojXZh.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/IB1URR9h.jpg"
StonerEngineering,3cfbos,lMayback,2,Wed Jul 8 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, it looks like you may be able to drill one on the side of the  chamber, where it's flat below the  sloped part of the bowl. keep in mind the level you fill it w water and how high the water splashes when you hit as it could come out the carb. You could probably counteract this by making the hole small.  To do this get a small diamond drill bit and a good strength drill. Put a piece of duct tape over the spot you want to drill so the tip doesn't slide.   Put the piece in a sink and run cool water over the spot, not directly on the duct tape not so it's flowing over. This keeps the glass shards and heat down start slowly drilling it so as not to take the tape off w the rotation of the bit and so you don't crack the glass.   Once you have a little divet in the glass you can start to increase the speed slowly. Do not push on the piece much, if at all, just keep enough weight on it in order to have solid contact between the piece and the bit. Be really careful because the glass is probably kinda thin bc it's a little bubbler. Drill bits are like 10 bucks for a 3 pack so if you wanted to you could practice first bc it can be kinda tricky not cracking or chipping the glass at first."

The top of the top mason jar would also have holes poked through the metal lid to act as a second percolator. I would drill a hole through the side of the bottom jar to add the bowl piece.  I have all the glass collected, and I just got a nice glass drill bit set in the mail. I have never drilled glass before, however have been doing lots of research.  I know to have a spray bottle while I'm doing it and what not. What tips can you give me for this process?  Also, I plan on using superglue to bring everything together... will It work?

StonerEngineering,3c6q4g,mole67,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:53:17 2015 UTC,Look into a silicon sealent. Heard those work well but I'm not too sure. Be sure to drill slow and have water running over the drill spot. It will be wet so don't slip and break the jar. Also drill at an angle for the downstem hole so it will aim the downstem into the water.

I managed to find this study from 1993 on the filtering of smoke. http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/~cozzi/maps4-4-93.html   In summary, it appears that water filtration can be effective in removing components from marijuana smoke that are known toxicants, while allowing the THC to pass through relatively intact. The effectiveness of toxicant removal is related to the smoke's water contact area. Specially designed water pipes, incorporating particulate filters and gas dispersion frits would likely be most effective in this regard; the gas dispersion frit serves to break up the smoke into very fine bubbles, thereby increasing its water contact area. While individuals vary greatly in their smoking technique, state of health, dosing regimen, and so on, it seems that many patients could benefit from the use of water pipes to deliver THC. This would allow patients to titrate their dose easily while reducing the health hazard associated with smoke."

StonerEngineering,3buzfc,livin4donuts,3,Thu Jul 2 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"why? I grew up in Denmark, you always use a cardboard filter for that.   you fold it a few times in a MW shape then roll the filter around it till it's round and about the size of a cigarette filter. Then you take the paper and roll it around the filter, THEN you fill up the cone from the top and then you close it off..   Makes perfect joints that way and a delight to smoke."

StonerEngineering,3buh6v,JewishGangster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"Cool idea, thanks! I saw in your thread that you can't get into a head shop so you're using a lot of plastic; if you can, just get a mason jar (about $2.50 or less at any craft store like AC Moore, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, etc.) and you can make a bubbler pretty easily with a couple drill bits, the BBQ lighter, and just sucking the air out through the top of the jar. The toke seems urgent, but waiting a couple months or paying about $10 for some safe hardware can save you a good amount of time/money later."
StonerEngineering,3buh6v,JewishGangster,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:07:28 2015 UTC,Yeah we decided to just buy a bottle of apple cider and get a diamond drill bit to make a hole in the bottom. I think the only thing we need now is a longer downstem. You know a place to find long glass tubing?

Just put the little 14mm bowl inside of the top of the 18mm test tube and it fits pretty snug. It actually worked better than any downstem i ever bought from a store"

StonerEngineering,3blcen,WhiteNinja94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"Not so sure about how a wooden bong would last as it would probably get pretty nasty inside pretty quick. A pipe on the other hand could be cool. If I was you I'd make a sick stash box with multiple compartments, maybe a built in tray that lifts off to reveal secret layers underneath. You could burn some crazy patterns on it with a soldering iron too. A grinder would be possible too if you used nails for the teeth. Maybe craft an ashtray with a joint caddy and lighter slot, or a built in bowl poker, it could have a dish to the side with a hole to slot bowls into for packing. Thinking about it, I'm going to go get some wood."

My fellow frients, I beg of you, please STAY AWAY FROM NITROUS  Edit: And he died after unsuccessful resuscitation.

StonerEngineering,3bcxha,sirvapesalot,4,Sun Jun 28 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"NO does not combine with haemoglobin, but is carried free in the blood and excreted unchanged through the lungs. The risk of hypoxia (suffocation) comes not from the interaction between NO and O2 in the blood or brain, but from not inhaling oxygen often enough to combine with haemoglobin and deliver oxygen to your cells, including brain cells.  The problem is, when one does enough whip-its in a short period of time, trying to get real high, you may inhale so much that you develop hypoxia. The lack of oxygen quickly effects the part of your brain that says, ""take some fucking breaths"", AKA the medulla. This structure tells your diaphragm, located underneath your lungs, to ""contract"", which ultimately leads to a change in the pressure, and natural inhalation. You take your fucking breaths for granted.   You're not any different than the rest of the human species. You obey the same laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. I just hope you get educated before you do something stupid and upset your loved ones.  edit: trying to help you understand."
StonerEngineering,3bcxha,modernbenoni,6,Sun Jun 28 03:39:00 2015 UTC,I said essentially the same thing you did in fewer words. The crux of the issue is that someone goes overboard trying to get too high and doesn't inhale enough air. It not complicated. Just watch your intake. It's not hard to use nitrous safely. Period.

StonerEngineering,3bcxha,Infernoherpes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"nitrogen poisoning   Yes, but you clearly haven't the slightest clue of what it is. Nitrogen narcosis is a danger while the body is exposed to elevated pressures, meaning almost exclusively while SCUBA diving. All breathing gases outside of Helium and Neon have a narcotic effect at these pressures.   N2O is already an anaesthetic gas, and has no bearing on the subject of Nitrogen Narcosis, especially since OP isn't hotboxing in a hyperbaric chamber or doing whippets while SCUBA diving.  Here is an idea: Next time, before you try to sound authoritative, condescending, and patronizing; confirm that you at least know what you are talking about before you make an ass out of yourself."
StonerEngineering,3bcxha,vlttt420,0,Sun Jun 28 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Nitrogen narcosis can be caused by changes in pressure, however it can also be caused by directly inhaling nitrogen. All nitrogen narcosis refers to is an elevated level of nitrogen in the blood which doesn't allow the blood to move oxygen properly. (That's the important part. It doesn't matter how much you breath in fresh air your blood is full of nitrogen.) So next time you try to sound smart do a bit more research than reading the first paragraph of the wiki.

And you can't accidentally smoke too much weed. You can have too much heroin and too many pain killers, just like you can have too much Nitrous. It's the fact that it can hurt you when you're not using common sense that makes me wary, not worth the risks imo."

This site said: http://avogadro.chem.iastate.edu/MSDS/CaCO3.htm  Inhalation of Calcium Carbonate: Low hazard for usual industrial handling. Excessive inhalation may cause minor respiratory irritation.   So it seems quite safe.

The days will grow longer your breathing will slow, once it gets this far the only escape you will have is in your dreams during the 3 minutes you are actually able to fall asleep.

You just bend it until it comes off the top of an old can.  Once you have the tab off, you just stab it into the top of the apple, slightly offset from the middle.  Put it in about as deep as you want the bowl, and just twist the apple around it, the tab should make a perfect circle (even though it's flat, the spaces in it make it tend to go in a circle, it becomes a chord and follows your twist).  Once you've gone the full circle, pop up the top like a lever. You need something to make a hole (or holes) with, we used to use toothpicks and make multiple holes, or just a pen to  make a big one or whatever."

The most reliable and the one I recommend is an inline fan and filter. That may seem overkill for a bucket but it will work great. There are also some DIY filters that may need some trial and error. A useful material is ONA Gel which blocks strong smells.  Cheers!

StonerEngineering,3aykh4,markshoplak,3,Wed Jun 24 17:56:25 2015 UTC,I love marijuana. I love that it's finally coming out into the open just like I'd dreamed of over 15 years ago when I first smoked it. I just don't smoke it much these days!   I'm actually more excited for this set up to grow some other plants. I'm renting and probably will be for at least a few more years and I don't want to invest time and energy in a garden box if I'm going to be moving around. But these I can take with me! And I can grow some weed in it!

StonerEngineering,3aww4q,BonneMaman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:56:57 2015 UTC,If that's a wine bottle and it has that deep indentation on the bottom that might create issues if you place a downstem at an angle. So take that into account when making this. Also I'd say dark glass like that is not ideal because it's hard to see how much smoke is filling up the bottle before you clear it when taking a hit.

Not trying to be a bummer, but chances are when you try to widen the hole, or try to feed anything solid through it to function as a stem, it's sooner than later just gonna shatter or crack in a big way. You really need to do these things with a specifically glass-cutting drill bit. If you have anything like a tool library around you you can probably borrow one for free."

StonerEngineering,3akh4o,Caesar619,3,Sun Jun 21 02:15:35 2015 UTC,You could try drilling into the shoulder of the bottle to save the hassle of drilling an oval. Tend to lead to cracks if you play with the hole too much. Also if you can get some spare wax from the lid you can melt it to make a pretty sick seal around the hole

Some people think because of its lustre it reflects more heat back into the bowl.  Honestly I'm not too sure about that, but I can't think of any reason it'd be unsafe. Besides, you're probably not going to be smoking out of gold pieces every day, it'd be like once in a blue moon for most people, so even if there were assosiated health risks, most people wouldn't do it enough or with enough consistency to get sick.

StonerEngineering,3a6u7p,Oggel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"I was under the assumption that (with a low temp, of course) dabbing dry helps with the taste. If you use a high heat, then it wont taste as nice and will be harsher. I could be completely wrong though. Plus with the smaller chamber, it would mean smoke/vapour gets into the mouth quicker, thus having less time to ""decay"" in a sense. Like when you take a bongrip but dont finish the chamber fully and have to go for round 2."
StonerEngineering,3a6u7p,RifleTower,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:06:50 2015 UTC,You're correct! The fact that this is dry is gonna make for a hot fucking dab. I wouldn't hit this piece if there was something available with water.

When i was introduced to dabbing, my friend handed me a rig, and held the torch onto the nail until it was glowing hot. That's how i learned it, and while i enjoyed the high, i never really enjoyed the taste/experience."

Maybe I'm not understanding what you're saying exactly, but I still don't see the appeal of hitting it dry.   My early dabs were off red nails, too.

StonerEngineering,3acrzw,TheCowfishy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I probably over-engineered this a bit, but I like it.  The bottle is one of the new, weird shaped Gatorade bottles.  The downstem is the metal tube from a long nosed lighter. Like this thing .    The holes in the end act like a built-in perc. It's nice!  I sealed the downstem to the bottle using JB Weld. It's fucking airtight as hell, something refreshing from a DIY Bong.   The bowl is a stainless steel 9/16 inch socket. Steel is okay to smoke out of so I went with this.  The carb hole was made by heating up the plastic, poking a hole with scissors, then using my thumb to shape it perfectly. Now, I can hold the bottle while covering the carb with one hand and hold the lighter in my other hand.  I sanded then burned the metal tube from the lighter to remove the paint and any potentially harmful chemicals (although it doesn't see any direct heat so I don't think it matters tbh). Then I wrapped the bottom 3/4 of it with electrical tape, stopping where the holes began. Mainly to prevent it from getting rusty.  I used a single layer of electrical tape to bond the bowl to the downstem then a few layers of paper medical tape. The paper tape isn't going to see direct heat either, but I didn't want to risk any fumes."

StonerEngineering,3a176t,thecountvon,8,Tue Jun 16 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"Upon further research (googling your exact question) I found this:   Sugru will bond just fine to glass, withstands temperatures up to 180 degrees Celsius (~356 degrees Fahrenheit), and cures to an inert, tough, flexible silicone rubber.  It should not be used in an area that will come in direct (or nearby) contact with open flame, and while it is chemically inert after fully curing, it is not certified food-safe, so it shouldn't go anywhere where it might end up inside the mouth until further notice from Team Sugru's testing endeavors."

Long story short, they employee was trying to sell me on something he couldn't make happen. He has since been fired and the owner has been super helpful but unable to find some one to fix it for a reasonable price.  So did a bit of research and came across this stuff. It says it is safe for drinking water and can withstand temps up to 500F which I cant imagine my piece would ever get to. My main concerns with it are any level of toxicity getting into my lungs and also what happens when I clean my glass with ISO. Here's a link to the amazon page for more info on it.  My plan is to just use it to reform the missing pieces. Is it safe to do so?   EDIT: So I visited the local shop that was holding it for me while they looked for an artist. They actual chipped it a bit more. So I found the original artist on FB and they said they can fix for free as long as I pay for shipping. I am planning on going that route. Thank you everyone for your help and advice. I didn't/don't really know much about what can and can't be smoked out of so I just air on the side of glass so I appreciate your guidance on the issue."

StonerEngineering,3a176t,leiferslook,3,Tue Jun 16 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah if that bowls not very tight you'd totally want to hold it in tightly. A rubber band or a ziptie would probably work if you're trying to avoid chemicals.. if not that steel stuff or jb weld both will hold stronger than new, I'd still recommend the little glass extension though because if any of those glues seep into the joint your bowls won't fit/seal properly.. Good luck."
StonerEngineering,3a176t,leiferslook,2,Tue Jun 16 15:25:59 2015 UTC,Actually zipties may work pretty awesome. Do they make those extenstions to be 18 to 18 or is it just to convert one size to another?  EDIT: Found them because internet. I'm thinking this may be the best way to go.

StonerEngineering,3a176t,leiferslook,3,Tue Jun 16 15:31:11 2015 UTC,Yeah then if you ever want to take it out for cleaning or whatever just cut the ziptie.. they totally make them 18 to18

StonerEngineering,3a176t,FUCKS_FOR_ORANGE,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:38:43 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking one of these, with a clip and possibly a zip tie or 3 for added stability will be the exact cheap fix I was looking for."
StonerEngineering,3a176t,toixic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"don't glue your tube! even if it says it is safe after it cures you'll always taste it which means you are inhaling SOMETHING. i'm no chemical expert but i'd never hit a bong with any kind of sealant/adhesive involved. tough break for certain. not sure how much shops are charging you but i know Kind Creations out of Fort Collins CO has been the go to for repair by a lot of my friends, not sure if you still can but you used to be able to ship them a clean tube and they'd repair it! that looks like it should be a simple repair, with so many blowers in CO it should not be expensive, however if you are in the midwest or east coast i can see how people would want to charge a lot. give Kind Creations a call and explain your situation they might be able to help!"
StonerEngineering,3a176t,turtleman777,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"also in the end it might be cheaper/easier to just look up a cheap straight tube with the same gauge glass on glass. if you're willing to poke around/wait for shipping/not buy a ""name brand"" bong you can probably get something similar for as much or less than it'd cost to fix it."
StonerEngineering,3a176t,LooneyDubs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"Its not really a glue, its more of an epoxy. But that is worth looking into."

StonerEngineering,3a176t,funtsunami,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:55:49 2015 UTC,Lighters often reach Temps well above 500 farenheit I don't know the exact temp in F but most Bic lighters will reach Temps of 800 to 1000 degrees Celsius
StonerEngineering,3a176t,vlttt420,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"I read that somewhere else. While I don't think I am going the route of epoxy anymore, does it really matter? The glass itself stays cool enough to pull the bowl (the piece in direct contact with heat) by hand. I find it hard to believe that any part of the glass ever reaches a temperature much above 150F and even that would be an extremely small localized area."
StonerEngineering,3a176t,jkohl,2,Tue Jun 16 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"I use this stuff all the time for work. Epoxy putty will work for your bong but, the two-part liquid epoxy will work way better and leave your bong looking nice. Jb weld has a clear kind that is specifically for glass, that is what I recommend"
StonerEngineering,3a176t,prosdod,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"Use a diamond wheel to cut off the broken edge. Should fit snugly after that and will look better and still be easy to clean. Plus your have a diamond wheel you can now use on glass, pretteh sweet."

StonerEngineering,3a4d7s,BakedGritz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:33:37 2015 UTC,Just go to your local smoke shop and buy an ash catcher/perc for your bong.
StonerEngineering,3a4d7s,FlatulentToaster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"I bet you have to pull pretty hard to get that to work! If you really wanna do this, I reckon you should use a shorter hose, that would probably make it easier to pull.

StonerEngineering,39yjma,kindasortanerdy,3,Mon Jun 15 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Water tight!  fun jokes aside, from personal experience, a mouthpiece diameter of at least 1 1/2 inches, but no more that 4 works best (but i'm a big mouthed guy, so take that into account), perhaps grab some vinyl tubing and make a slice down the long way and place around the mouthpiece for a O-ring around the mouth type effect if not airtight. Down stem wise all i have to say is this, smoke is traveling through here, you make it too small, it's gunna clog quick and be hard to pull, and the opposite is true too, too big and good luck finding a bowl that'll fit and the draw will be fast and harsh.  I'm not a fan of a carb on my bong either, so a sliding down stem/bowl is nice to have. A small bowl can be bought cheap online or at your paraphernalia shop, the king they use in store bought plastic bongs is nice and cheap for stoner engineering. Other than that, it's all up to you to make it personalized, anything special and one of a king a stoner can smoke out of is always special to them. :) happy engineering.  edited for guy dimensions."

StonerEngineering,39qdv9,Deriksson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:21:54 2015 UTC,The perc is attached to the mouth of the bottom bottle and that unit slides through a hole in the bottom of the top bottle
StonerEngineering,39qdv9,Deriksson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:17:06 2015 UTC,It's a pre made perc I found online for like $6. It's an inch and a half in diameter so I got a 40mm drill bit so it has about 1.5mm of clearance from the wall of the hole. It slides right over perfectly.

StonerEngineering,39qdv9,Yolo420SwagM8,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:52:17 2015 UTC,I drilled a big hole in the bottom of the bottle so I could just slide it over the perc and it sits perfectly on the neck of the other bottle. Right now I have a big hookah grommet on it that holds it together really well and I can still take it apart to clean. You could glass glue it down for a stronger seal but it'd be permanent after that.

StonerEngineering,39ikum,originalityescapesme,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:59:18 2015 UTC,It's not about what the JET is made out of but the turbine op made is made out of plastic which people seem to think is instant death in a smoking device even if nothing hot is ever even near it. So what op made is fucking awesome and because the smoke will have already gone through the interior workings and water of the JET it will be 100% fine because the JET is literally known for it's smooth cool hits.
StonerEngineering,39ikum,nerdbomer,-1,Fri Jun 12 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it's one of the less heat resistant plastics.  It can melt at pretty low temperatures.  It's not a proven carcinogen or anything so it;s not the worst;  just by nature the plastic responds very quickly to heat, so I was curious the kind of temperatures you actually get."

It hits fantastically and is practically indestructible (friend dropped it on concrete and it didn't even get scratched). My only complaint is cleaning the base and downstem can get bothersome. The way it's designed there's a lip that allows for the cycloning of water, but getting your hand in there is a major pain. It's a pretty nitpicky issue, but I like to keep my pieces really clean. That's really the only complaint I have with it. Well worth the $217 when compared to glass pieces of the same price."

StonerEngineering,39ikum,gaben911,6,Fri Jun 12 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"Actually they're billet aluminum. I don't have any personally due to the price, but I've heard from everyone that has them they don't restrict draw too much and are well worth the investment. Also if you plan on getting 3 or more, just go for 5. The price is only like a $20 or $30 difference at that point, so it's well worth it to just get the extra few. Plus even if you don't end up using all 5 you can get a couple different colors, so you'll never get bored of the setup. I plan on getting some myself in a month or two."

StonerEngineering,39bd88,Frostiestone,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:29:21 2015 UTC,Simple GonG- Used an 18mm Male-to-Male adapter and put the regular stem in one side and used a rubber band to seal it and make it stay on tight.
StonerEngineering,39bd88,WAMZL,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"so basically, you're using a male to male adapter as a mouthpiece?"

StonerEngineering,39bd88,playitme,3,Wed Jun 10 17:51:21 2015 UTC,Yeah it isn't a mouth piece but allows me to equip any 18mm glass with my Air. All i did was mounted the adapter to the stock stem that came with the Air plus a rubber band.

StonerEngineering,39bd88,playitme,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:50:25 2015 UTC,I never had the solo but I have an air now and it works great. I don't know if it's worth the upgrade from the solo but you can buy them for $169 on puffitup.com I got a free shipping and a grinder too.
StonerEngineering,39bd88,200pcd14,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"I actually only got it monday but so far it is exactly what i expected. further use will determine how the Air is best used IMO.

StonerEngineering,38xvsy,2hardtry,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"I don't really know the kind of wood it was. It was just a piece of scrap wood I found at work. Since I had a bandsaw and a sander at my disposal, I figured I would just give it a shot."
StonerEngineering,38xvsy,ThatRealNiGga42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:51:32 2015 UTC,"If you're making a wood pipe, it's very important to know what type of wood you're using.  Specifically, you need to stay away from softwoods (conifers) because the tars are toxic.  Also, lots of milled lumber, softwood and hardwood, is treated with preservatives or other chemicals which are toxic.  Basically, any milled lumber is probably unsuitable for pipemaking.  Here's a pdf list of some woods used for smoking food.  Any wood safe for smoking food is safe for pipemaking.  Near the end of the chart is a short list of woods that are not safe."

That's hot enough to melt most plastics and certainly the insulation on your wire. How are you going to hold it? How about the battery? Is it designed to withstand 600°F? Most aren't.  None of this is an issue, though, because your 9V battery won't deliver nearly enough power. A foot of 30AWG wire has a resitance of ~0.1ohm. That will try to draw 90A at first, which the battery will express its extreme displeasure at by getting warmer until it catches fire."

StonerEngineering,38w9yb,BonneMaman,2,Mon Jun 15 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah the grommet would fit normally along the narrow sides of the hole but there would be space above and below the grommet because of the oval shape of the hole. But when you insert the down stem at an angle, if you've shaped the hole well and if the grommet is flexible enough and snug enough it should conform to the shape of the hole. What I do is make sure the down stem is long enough to touch the back side of the bottle to keep it from sliding back up into a horizontal position. Check my album on imgur i have a lot of examples. http://imgur.com/a/Clb7W  If you want to have the down stem at an angle and not have it touch the opposite side of the bottle then you'd need a specialized rubber grommet for angles but i'm not sure where you'd find those."

StonerEngineering,38sscq,opossum420,2,Sun Jun 7 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"Gravity bongs are my favorite way to smoke so me and my friends have tried to get it down pat. First off I recommend making a fountain by making small holes in the bottom of your bottle. This lets it still fill up like a gravity bong but it allows you to pull it completely out of the water with no smoke loss. My other recommendation is to use a small bong slide and put it through the cap of your bottle makes it a lot easier to take off to hit. Those are the two main tips I have and can be done with about any bottles, lately I've started to make glass ones. Hope that helps."

Then I took an 18mm bowl I don't use often, heated a cap to the liquor handle, and pushed it through to make a perfect 18mm seal. I have a Roor size large bowl that fits ~1g, fill that up, fill the whole thing with water, and let it drain. Burns 1g in less that 10 seconds. Bonus, you can hook up an 18mm ash catcher"

I would not recommend a lead spoon.  As far as the more resistant ones go, it's extremely hard to get a straight answer on whether or not they are safe to smoke through because lung cancer is extremely common in smokers (so statistics are skewed). However, if it's used for smoke, odds are it's on the safer side, because they'll pick plastics known for being heat resistant. Generally if you go scientific grade you're better off."

StonerEngineering,38kcdc,omfglolzords,2,Fri Jun 5 09:31:46 2015 UTC,"Sure thing!   Mason Jar ($1.50 at hobby lobby) 2 Rubber grommets (can buy in multi packs for $3-4 at home depot) 1/2"" ID to 3/4"" ID lead free bronze pex coupling ($5) 1/2"" ID 5/8"" OD Silicone tubing - My PC is liquid cooled, I just used some extra I already had but you can order it off amazon, frozencpu, newegg, etc. 3lb glass filler of your choice. I got 3 little bags of glass gems at dollar tree. Have some fun w/ it, I think the blue looks cool on my piece personally.   All you do is drill 2 1/2""in. holes opposite each other in the mason lid, then seat the grommets in the holes. These are to help keep an air tight seal for maximum rippage. In one hole, push the 1/2"" end of the coupling through and slide your hose with clamp over the barb. I pressed down against a table really hard with the hose to push it all as tight as I can get it against the grommet to keep it air tight, then just tighten your hose clamp down. Use the other grommet hole for a plain 7$ (for me) slide. I found a slide with a 1/2"" OD that BARELY, and I mean BARELY fit the whole I made. It took some coaxing, but all the better, as I know that side is as air tight as can be. A lot of the mason bubblers I've seen use 14mm bowls as well and all of mine are 18mm, so I went with the larger slide. 14mm will work as well, just don't get as long of one as it will go a lot deeper in the jar than mine, which stops at the taper."

The minimum time to let it sit is like a week with that, and that's using the absolutely strongest proof alcohol they can find and agitating it daily. A 10 second bong rip wont be affected at all."

StonerEngineering,38jegu,TobyHensen,6,Thu Jun 4 16:48:37 2015 UTC,About an inch and a half to two inches of airline tubing or some type of hose should do the trick. It's low enough that it shouldn't get to hot.
StonerEngineering,38jegu,pasher71,2,Thu Jun 4 18:50:02 2015 UTC,This was going to be my suggestion.  Just get some tubing of an appropriate diameter and use it as a coupler.

StonerEngineering,38jegu,obsidianchao,2,Thu Jun 4 20:17:06 2015 UTC,"You would have to put a grommet on the end of the bottom pipe, then file the top pipe and/or get it to seal. Has to fit water tight though. Might need a smaller little pipe too."
StonerEngineering,38jegu,obsidianchao,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:20:42 2015 UTC,What if i just used an epoxy? I used an epoxy to glue the elbow into the glass.
StonerEngineering,38jegu,obsidianchao,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah but smoke won't hit that epoxy. Didn't know you could arc weld. Arc welding just involves electricity melting them together, yeah? Or is there an adhesive/chemical being used at all?"

StonerEngineering,38jegu,marsh-a-saurus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you can do that without breaking the glass, that's the best way for sure!"
StonerEngineering,38jegu,h4mandcheese,2,Thu Jun 4 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"just a thought. If you could find a slightly bigger piece (sleeve type thing) that almost fits over then you could heat it, put it over the join and it would shrink to fit when cool, holding them together."
StonerEngineering,38jegu,purpleepandaa,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:35:49 2015 UTC,That's a good idea. Is there a term for how much a metal expands when heated? That way I can google how much brass expands.
StonerEngineering,38jegu,h4mandcheese,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:19:57 2015 UTC,I think he is talking about shrink wrap cool stuff you should look it up.
StonerEngineering,38jegu,obsidianchao,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:12:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't thinking of shrink wrap. If you Google thermal expansion there's quite a lot. The wiki page has an equation for the change in volume but I think trial and correction might be needed to get a good fit. I hope it goes well anyway! Good luck.

Light it then remove the bowl and take the hit through the downstem (or remove the plug).

StonerEngineering,38f9qj,zsrqpooha,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:11:05 2015 UTC,"The top bottle has two small holes in the bottom. The jar is full of water. The water is just below the holes in the top bottle. When you draw in, the water splashes up trough the holes, with the smoke. As the smoke comes up through the holes, the water filters it. The down stem has a few hole drilled in it too, to break the smoke into smaller bubbles.  I used jb weld to attach them."

When I first bought it and my tolerance was low, it was cool, but eventually it just takes too much time and effort to get high. I can carefully pack and vape 3 or 4 trenches from the MFLB (over like 10 minutes) or I can just rip a bong a couple times and be at the same place.

At first I thought a glass stem, but that'd probably break in the stones when you twisted, so now i'm thinking m to f adapter hot glued in with some silicone wedged onto it like a barb, but idk how i'd weight it down so that it's easy to push through the rocks to the bottom.

StonerEngineering,386p71,JCRob2,2,Tue Jun 2 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"What I do is put the downstem into the jar and then fill it up with the stones, no shoving the downstem through the stones required. The flexible downstem then allows me open and close the lid without uprooting the downstem.  You could do this without the metal part at the end of the downstem, just use silicone tubing for the entirety of your downstem. In fact, find some silicone tubing with a 1/2"" internal diameter and your downstem can double as your bowl holder (fits standard 14.5mm glass bowls). Check out the bowl holder in this older version of a design of mine. It's simple, just some rubber tubing with a bowl shoved in."

StonerEngineering,383791,WorkHardBlazeHard,3,Mon Jun 1 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"IR detector that if it reads over a threshold limit will engage a servo that clicks on a kitchen lighter? Can perhaps have a secondary sensor to check if the lighter is lit and if not then keep relighting until lit. Any kind of microprocessor would be able to do that for you but the arduino or pi's probably a good place to start.  I doubt you'll get far with a fully mechanical system, you're going to have to use some kind of processor."
StonerEngineering,383791,TheAlmightyD,3,Mon Jun 1 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely the kind of response of was looking for. I am actually planning to pick up an arduino for a laser engraver project i saw on /r/DIY ,so this gives me a great excuse to pick up a pi too. I would also probably go with one of the click button bic style lighters instead of a kitchen lighter to keep things compact. Or maybe one of these, http://linselighters.com/. A buddy of mine showed me these, you can adjust the flame angle for superior bowl lighting capabilities."
StonerEngineering,383791,TheAlmightyD,3,Tue Jun 2 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I reckon that would work, you're gonna need to put a bit more time into the enclosure for that lighter though. A kitchen lighter's good because you can wrap a piece of string around the button and just pull on it, on lighters where the ignition is exposed without walls either side you'll have to make sure nothing is moving so you can get a good press on the lighter. If you have/know someone with a 3d printer then this shouldn't be an issue."

StonerEngineering,381d2c,zebrastrip,4,Mon Jun 1 03:28:02 2015 UTC,I have made a couple dugouts from walnut lately and today I made one out of a solid block of aluminum and a steel one hitter. I smothed the matting surfaces so when you closed the lid it would cut paper. It makes this one pretty air tight. I made the whole thing using a drill press and some files and sand paper. I did get the wall a little thin on one side and rubbed a hole in the side I wrapped it in electric tape later to cover the hole. Hope you guys enjoy!

StonerEngineering,37x2sf,onFilm,3,Sun May 31 09:31:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, keep in mind that only the alcohol needs to vaporize and not the water that makes up the wine, so it's really easy. Even without heat, the alcohol aerosols as you create bubbles in the chamber.   Careful though, try to mix half water with half wine, otherwise you can get dangerously drunk, fast because there is nothing for you to throw up."

StonerEngineering,381xbl,LordGimp,5,Mon Jun 1 06:57:24 2015 UTC,It also displaces water which makes hitting a piece with a lot of airspace easier. It's also great if you keep it in the freezer because the glass marbles stay cold forever and don't melt like ice.
StonerEngineering,381xbl,Anthonymarks132,8,Mon Jun 1 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"Uhh diffuser beads?? They break up the bigger bubbles into smaller bubbles thus more surface area of the smoke is touching the water..as for them getting dirty, that's kind of the point, most of the filth gets stuck to the stones instead of your peice.

I've been using this thing for a few weeks now and with it I can take huge, cough free hits.  And everything below the water level seems to stay clean. All my tar build up has been up top.

On a THC/dollar ratio, It seems like you can get weed that looks shitty, and may be a little weaker, but buy more of it for the same amount of money.   So that's how we do it.  In terms of Alcohol, Go with the highest alcohol content you can find. Everclear, etc. I just use two dropper fulls, because she doesn't reduce the tinc after it brews. You can reduce it, and boil off a lot of the alcohol and water, but I don't care.   I mix mine with coffee, orange juice, soda, Gatorade after soccer. A little off taste, but shoot it and be done."

StonerEngineering,37wbuy,rad_as_heck,2,Sat May 30 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"A glass downstem that long is an accident waiting to happen, and finding a way to attach it to the coil will be tricky too. In the design pictured the copper coil has a brazed connection to the stainless steel downstem, it's a solid connection.  With glass you'd have to attach the two with some kind of clamp or rope. I'm not sure if such a glass part exists, you'd likely have to get it custom made.  Brass is much more difficult to bend than copper so making your own coil will be very difficult and I doubt they can be bought anywhere with the correct dimensions. Brass costs more than copper and doesn't transfer heat as well anyway.  The mouthpiece in the pictured design? That's silicone tubing.    Check out the FAQ section of my site, I give a materials list and give a brief justification as to why each is safe. If you want a more in depth explanation of any material I'd be happy to provide it. I've got a degree in polymer engineering, I assure you these materials weren't chosen at random."

From there, you could probably use some o-rings on the bowl's base (one standard ring near the top of the bowl, and something wider near the bottom to keep the bowl steady) to create a seal. It may not be the prettiest solution, but you'd probably be able to pull it off reasonably well. I would probably advise against copper, especially for a water-based piece, as it tends to oxidize pretty quickly.  No matter what you go with, good luck!

StonerEngineering,37sahq,spvceshxp,3,Sat May 30 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"If your willing to put in a little time I would suggest using bees wax and some hemp twine. Clean everything the best you can, place the two broken pieces back together and rub warm wax on it to create a seal. Easiest was I've found to do this is to use something like a cheap pan or crockpot, allow it to heat up, and rub chunks of wax on the heat till it melts. Make sure to make a nice thick seal. After that take some chop stick or Popsicle sticks to use as a brace, using the bees wax as a ""glue"" to hold them in place. After that run twine over the broke, now waxed , area. Make sure to take time on this part so that it looks good. Nothing looks worse than a quick sloppy wrap. After that, if you would like, melt wax over the twine. This helps to keep the twine from unraveling, but if you prefer not to go this way make sure to secure the loose ends so your work doesn't go in vein.   TL:DR Bees wax is safer than chemicals."

It's just hard seeing it done now that I know better/have the means around said situations."
StonerEngineering,37gtm5,rickyhatespeas,2,Thu May 28 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"A plastic bong or aluminum can/foil is no where near the same as inhaling exhaust fumes, but I get you're point."
StonerEngineering,37gtm5,livin4donuts,1 point,Thu May 28 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"It's not even close. The plastic isn't going to release any fumes unless the bowl is actually made of plastic, in which case, the person smoking it has got to be borderline retarded. Using glue or duct tape isn't bad as long as it's not coming in direct contact with the high heat in the bowl. Sure, the smoke is warm, but not enough to get all worked up about. If it was, just imagine what the heat is doing to your lungs by itself.  In either case, generally people seem to use quality products, and only make stuff out of monster cans and bic pens when they're in a real pinch, so it doesn't really matter. Any bad stuff from the plastic/metal isn't likely to be a regular thing.  Also, I was just making a joke, since this grinder OP made is ghetto as fuck."

StonerEngineering,37fgrm,martinum,2,Wed May 27 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"Nitrile rubber:       Nitrile rubber, also known as Buna-N, Perbunan, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, and NBR, is a synthetic rubber copolymer of acrylonitrile (ACN) and butadiene. Trade names include Nipol, Krynac and Europrene.  Nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is a family of unsaturated copolymers of 2-propenenitrile and various butadiene monomers (1,2-butadiene and 1,3-butadiene). Although its physical and chemical properties vary depending on the polymer’s composition of nitrile, this form of synthetic rubber is unusual in being generally resistant to oil, fuel, and other chemicals (the more nitrile within the polymer, the higher the resistance to oils but the lower the flexibility of the material).  It is used in the automotive and aeronautical industry to make fuel and oil handling hoses, seals, and grommets, since ordinary rubbers cannot be used.  It is used in the nuclear industry to make protective gloves. NBR's ability to withstand a range of temperatures from −40 to 108 °C (−40 to 226 °F) makes it an ideal material for aeronautical applications. Nitrile butadiene is also used to create moulded goods, footwear, adhesives, sealants, sponges, expanded foams, and floor mats.

StonerEngineering,37fgrm,RexFox,1 point,Thu May 28 04:24:58 2015 UTC,The tubing itself is 1/4in the pull is slightly tight but I think the length compensates for the diameter. Its like 4ft of tubing so you get a nice big hit! I'm going to drill out some defusing holes at the opening of the tubing hopefully it allows for more air flow! A few buddy's commissioned my cousin to make them some so we're going to try different diameter tubes. But other than that it's actually pretty solid! I'm way surprised!

This is just something I would use for shits and giggles if I was hanging out with my high school/college friends that used it with me.  Like I said, it's a really sentimental piece to me so just being able to have it in some form would mean a lot.  You have me interested in the possibilities of professional work.  What kinds of work would a professional be able to do? Would they just be able to attempt to weld pieces back together, or would they be able to melt it down and make a new pipe or some kind of statue with it? What kind of price comes with something like that?"

Im not sure if that jar will work or not due to its size. seems like a cool idea but, a little impracticable having to get water drained on you every time though.   As for materials, id go with a rubber stopper on the bottom, some food grade tubing though the lid for your bowl (i think the ash will go though if it doesn't the bowl will be too deep i think) maybe you could try mesh screens.   the real trouble is getting the lid to seal on top of the opening when it is filliped upside down. glass on glass isn't a great seal.  Also keep in mind if you make this is is going to be heavy for a good hitting grav bong.  Love the ingenuity though!"

Pet Supplies Plus, Petco, etc. You buy charcoal for water filters. You take said charcoal and rinse it in a strainer and let dry fully. You then take a desired sploof structure and a few dryer sheets. I recommend a large pill bottle with holes drilled in both ends. Put dryer sheets in to cover the bottom seamlessly. On top of those dryer sheets put the now dry charcoal leaving a small amount of room at the top. Fill in this room with more dryer sheets till it is seamless. Put top of pill bottle or other container back on to secure the dryer sheets and charcoal. The dryer sheets are optional with the right containers you just have to make sure charcoal isn't leaking and you have good air flow. You can also make a pod of charcoal by using dryer sheets to wrap it like a hard candy. If you have any questions or tips pm me and I'll make a post when I have time.

OK, I Have done this with A Sobe bottle and it has been good for me for a whole year until my brother dropped to bottle and broke it :( . If the bottle you're using is like the picture (with the spirals and stuff) then this might not work as easily. With my bottle i wrapped the bottom third of the bottle with Duct tape, then cut a cirlce out of the tape in the location of the hole. what you get is a bottle wrapped in tape with a circle of no tape. Then get a file or something sharp and trace the circle a few times to give it a fracture point. Then I wet my fingers and got the tape around the circle a little wet so it wouldn't catch fire. Then take a lighter and really heat up the circle. when it gets nice and hot dip the bottle in cold water. For me it didn't break out completely but it made a nice circle that i finished with a Ball peen hammer and some patience. As for the rest of the water pipe. I used a guitar slide for the tube, a thimble with 5 holes in the bottom for the bowl, and a paperclip (bent to match the thimble and to provide a handle) to lift the bowl to clear it."

Otherwise you'll have to widen the holes, make sure to clean out all the dust from the chamber before smoking out of it."

StonerEngineering,372wti,RealLifeFry,2,Sun May 24 14:38:03 2015 UTC,I'm actually really glad this was posted. I have a complete idea for this GB but I need help to actually doing it. I have this waterproof box (http://blog.laptopmag.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Lifeproof-life-jacket.jpg) that's similar but mine has a top with 4 screws in the corners and has a different actual base. My question is what I would need to do to cut and seal this with a water dispenser (http://www.hydrationdepot.com/images/P/Replacement-Spigot-for-Gatorade-cooler-lg.jpg) in the side and for the water release. Also what I should do for the bowl itself. I'll probably post a pic of it today on here.
StonerEngineering,372wti,rad_as_heck,2,Sun May 24 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"Its been a while since you posted that but since no one replied, I'll tell you what I'd do if I were you. I'd say the best way would be to get a piece of plastic, cut it to fit the top, and then use glue or epoxy to attach it. Then I'd buy a downstem and bowl from a tobacco shop, and drill a hole in the top piece for that to sit in, and to fill it from. Then I would drill a hole pretty close to the bottom on one of the skinny sides for the spigot, so it can hang off of a table. You might also want to add a hose of some sort to the top to inhale through. (P.s. I believe you're thinking of a waterfall, not a gb. If not then every thing I said is useless)"

StonerEngineering,36ztfw,mr12321,6,Sat May 23 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"The bowl is attached to the copper tubing, which coils up to above the water line, then straight back down to the bottom of the bong (apparently via a plastic tube), which is open.  Water is going up the copper tube to the water line, but can't flow down the coil because the top of the coil is above it.  Summary: 1. Because the bowl is attached to the copper coil. 2. Because the top of the copper coil is above the water line."
StonerEngineering,36ztfw,WrigleysGibblets,2,Sat May 23 18:31:51 2015 UTC,ahh ofc. silly me :)
StonerEngineering,36ztfw,Caesar619,2,Sat May 23 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"OP, are you sure it is the coiling of the tube and not the fact the tube rises above the fill line before submerging to meet the stem? I don't know but you should find out. If you are correct, then I imaging tighter coils would further allow you to raise the fill line."
StonerEngineering,36ztfw,Caesar619,1 point,Sat May 23 18:25:35 2015 UTC,I meant the coil structure. It's definitely because of the coil reaching above the bowl.

I realized this weekend I didn't have anything to smoke out of, so I had to get creative. I ended up remembering I had some bamboo around and went to work. I used a pocket knife to saw off the segment and create the larger socket hole along with the two carbs. Before adding the grip and socket I sanded down the entire piece for feel and look. The original piece had some ugly pattern. I used a socket because I didn't have time for a bamboo bowl. I wedged the socket in there and wrapped the string around the bottom. I burned the string and put some wax on it and repeated a few times. Then I added the grip and resanded the mouthpiece for a smoother surface. That's it! First creation and I am extremely proud of myself."

StonerEngineering,36ornq,logman13,1 point,Wed May 20 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"i used regular chisels, polishing cloth, and drill bit. had to turn the bit with my fingers because the soap stone would split if it was drilled fast. Also drill just a little then empty the dust, it packs in there and can cause pressure cracks. Ask a local art store where to get soap stone, ive found some at Michaels before. have fun, experiment. onec I drilled a V in a flat spoon so the two channels met at the bowl, loved that piece.."
StonerEngineering,36ornq,stew5462,1 point,Thu May 21 20:52:32 2015 UTC,My girlfriends dad is a former smoker and one of his friends from back in the day carved him a pipe with his face on the end. Was super cool. Used soapstone so it's really easy to carve out and make decent designs. Soap stone is really soft stone so it should be great for a try if you ever consider it. Could probably lacquer it too (except for the bowl of course) and have a lasting and shiny finish on your pipe. Hope that helps!
StonerEngineering,36izyz,lFrylock,59,Tue May 19 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"I was making a marshmallow stick out of a reasonably green branch that was all bendy and didn't look happy on the tree. Cut rings around the twig and eventually got some chunks peeled off. Cut the chunks down to doobie paper size and experimented. Scraped bark off some, dried some in a mesh hotdog thing over the fire, played around until i got it. I hammered it kinda mushier with an actual hammer, scraped the loose outer bark off so i was left with a good whiteish looking paper. Rolled one into a sizeable cylinder and then filled it after it was kinda dry. Took a pack of zigzag slow burns and cut the glue strip off one and glued it to the wood paper, and stuffed a big filter in there. Lit with embers from the firepit because it took a lot more to burn than just papers. Very natural experience but it was a heavy smoke. Super worth the work"

StonerEngineering,36izyz,Espe71,10,Tue May 19 23:00:25 2015 UTC,Eh you're alright. Smoke inhalation kills by depriving you of oxygen so unless you didn't take a breath between hits it's not much more harmful than breathing campfire smoke. Just more concentrated.

StonerEngineering,36c981,DiggingforPoon,6,Mon May 18 06:45:01 2015 UTC,that flavor is Ozone...  Do not recommend
StonerEngineering,36c981,xtrememudder89,3,Mon May 18 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"lol exactly. thing is, i honestly cannot get a solid understanding on how to look at ozone.  we have ozone generators and some people swear its safe. then we have evidence ozone has caused serious health problems to people back in the day. either way there is definitely a flavor and idk how to feel about it lol."

StonerEngineering,367roi,Eccelias,1 point,Sun May 17 16:11:08 2015 UTC,Seems like you can't buy the downstem alone anymore. Guess it got bundled with a bowl  and grommet as well.
StonerEngineering,367roi,EvansCantStop,1 point,Mon May 18 03:55:31 2015 UTC,For 25 bucks though not bad. I feel like a simple bowl like that one and normal straight downstem in a head shop would be right around 25 so thats not bad.

StonerEngineering,363uhm,theBob1986,2,Sat May 16 02:34:50 2015 UTC,if you you use them every day SUPPOSEDLY they constrict the veins in your eyes permanently and dry your eyes out. just use them in moderation and you'll be good

I always had a suspicion that the amazing coolness and instant effectiveness of Rotos was too good to be true...  Also if you wear contacts, most eye drops will dry you out and make it uncomfortable.

StonerEngineering,363uhm,modernbenoni,4,Sat May 16 02:43:05 2015 UTC,you only need to hit a one hitter once with a lighter. maybe twice at most.

StonerEngineering,363uhm,hockdapuck,3,Sat May 16 02:54:15 2015 UTC,jeez you get 5 hits out if a pipe like this?? the reason i chose a zippo is because its pretty close to the same height as the other two things. and im much less likely to lose a refillable than a disposable.

Most repairs i have done have been below where the water sits in the pipe, so even IF the sealant is exposed to heat, the exposure will be extremely limited (the duration of your pull) and will be almost immediately countered when the water rushes back and covers the area. If you're super concerned about fire and heat, just stick with clay. You can mold whatever shape you want wherever you want and then let the clay harden (or fire it. your choice)."

Workers breathe in fumes from chemicals such as zinc oxide (ZnO) or magnesium oxide (MgO), which are themselves created by heating or welding certain metals, particularly galvanized steel. Other common sources are fuming silver, gold, or platinum metals.  Chromium  is also a hazard, from stainless steel.

StonerEngineering,35z0u8,project89,12,Thu May 14 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"Well I first tried to just twist it around a cylinder but if you do that it like crunches up, clogs the tube, and weakens the metal. So there are a few ways to do it but the best way I found was to take a funnel and fill the copper tube with salt or sand and then coil it around a cylinder. The salt creates internal pressure which keeps it from collapsing."

StonerEngineering,35z0u8,dr_bong,4,Fri May 15 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is the way the coil is. The copper, if bent will crunch up and break or block the flow. So as I'm bending it, a large amount of the salt, providing the outward pressure to ward off collapse, popped off the tape and begun to spill out. The coil collapsed and this was the best I could do without burning a new length of copper."

I've made a similar design, here's the blueprint if you want to copy. Also, I'm not sure how well your smoke gets cooled prior to reaching the vinyl tubing (probably plenty cool as long as your bong water is cold), but be aware that hot vinyl can release BPA and chlorine, both of which are bad."

If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all, prick."
StonerEngineering,35vw6l,goingbezirk,-2,Thu May 14 10:13:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a mean person, but everybody doesn't always need a pat on the back. It was great to hear that you are going into cabinet making. This only makes my point 10 times more important though. You are going to be a craftsman. All you will have is the quality of your work. You must hold craftsmanship above all else. Explain to me though, what exactly you are going to school for. Building cabinets isn't a job that requires a college degree. If you have other ambitions, such as, design, engineering, or business management, then you definitely need to further your education. If you happen to live in Lubbock, TX, you can start working here tomorrow.   As far as the box goes though, throw it away and start over. I imagine that you would show your friends and family this box. If they know that you are going into woodworking, then you need to blow them away. Take this opportunity to prove to everybody that you have a real future in this profession. But more importantly, take this opportunity to prove it to YOURSELF. Take your time, work out a plan, draw a detailed diagram with detailed measurements before you start cutting. In woodworking, when you add or subtract on the fly, it really shows. More isn't always better either. Lots of people mistake gaudy woodworking for quality woodworking. Great design and quality craftsmanship beats the gaudy carpenter any day.  There are tons of YouTube videos to learn different skills. Practice what you learn. Subscribe to /r/woodworking. Read books. Look at architecture. A shitty carpenter just thinks about the design of his cabinets. A great carpenter tries to get a feel for the house as a whole. Your cabinets should compliment and complete a house, not stand out on their own. That's what furniture does. Most of what I'm talking about now is the design side, but if you want to be great at what you do, then you need to be well rounded. Whenever you go anywhere, you should be looking at, criticizing/admiring (to yourself, nobody likes to hear how shitty their cabinets or trim in their house is), and taking notes about the woodworking around you. Ask why. Most people are stuck in their ways and only do something because that's how they were taught. You think 3 generations ago figured out the best way to do everything? HA! Embrace technology.   I cannot stress this enough though. Bud has no place in the shop. This is a very dangerous profession. You must have your wits about you when you are in the shop. It will be hard to hold that joint when you are missing fingers. You will learn and progress so much faster without it. Use it as a reward for all of your hard work at the end of the day.   By the way, you're age means nothing. Know that you are better and be better. Take great pride in your craftsmanship, but always listen to criticism. It will only make you better. Lastly, PM me if you have any questions. You picked an incredibly rewarding profession to pursue. Mentally, physically, artistically, and financially. I wish you the best."

My shop teacher is the only red sealed cabinet maker in my province of New Brunswick and said I had a natural touch, he also said further in my life I could use him as a reference. Absolutely when I get older and have my own tools and equipment will I put more time and effort into things I create. I made my mom and dad a coffee table for Christmas which I will put a picture of at the bottom of this. Honestly I don't know much about this trade but I never knew what I wanted to be when I was younger and my shop classes made it clear I wanted to do something working with wood. I fully understand the dangers of the trade I already could of lost a finger if my school didn't have a saw stop, my shop teachers shown me his scars and I fully plan to have all 10 of my fingers when I'm an old man. How much roughly do you make starting out as a cabinet maker if you don't mind me asking.

StonerEngineering,35w3ku,89ers,2,Thu May 14 00:26:32 2015 UTC,"Materials: diffuser stem 6"", bowl, 66 of russian standard, glass tile drill bit (dont use the hole saw looking one! The regular one is better for ovaling the hole) drill, mask, wet towel, dry towel. Use dry towel to hold the bottle in your legs on the floor and drape it so it doesnt get glass on you. Wear a mask cause it gives off ALOT of dust and silica particles cause cancer. I did this outside to avoid getting it in the house. Use the wet towel to wipe off the bottle so you can see where you need to drill/mod the hole. Buy your stem of choice with a grommet, i had to trim my grommet so that it will bend and angle the way i wanted. I may switch to high temp RTV silicone to hold it as the stem is TIGHT in the bottle. Basically wash it after to remove glass, i used 99% iso but orange chronic or whatever works. Assemble, toke, dank. If anyone wants more done i will be doing a bombay sapphire bottle next and a cap mo private stock cork top."

This makes a watertight seal.  The bowl is just any brass hose fitting tht you see fit for a bowl size and just bellow that is a t-joint which acts as a shotgun because  the bowl does not come out.

StonerEngineering,35n2y6,Infiniloop,4,Mon May 11 23:40:10 2015 UTC,I'm going to risk being captain obvious and say that this design is only safe if the water level in the bottle is higher than the copper. If it's lower then a portion of the copper will be directly exposed to hot smoke. Copper is a great material but only safe if kept relatively cool.

Unless you have a personalized plan of what you want/need in a stashbox, it's not really worth the effort to build a box from scratch. I'm a novice woodworker and definently plan on making a stash box eventually, but my advice to you is to just find a cigar box you like and modify it to your needs (foam, sections, etc). Then after you know what you want, you can create your own with those modifications built in!"

StonerEngineering,35nu6z,TheCowfishy,2,Tue May 12 00:56:32 2015 UTC,Use pill bottles. The orange ones work great. If you buy 1/4 inch tubing from a hardware store you can poke 1 hole in the center of the bottle and if you make it the right size the tubing will fit snug and air tight. Then poke 6-8 small holes around the outside of the cap. You can put it in a mason jar bong as a perc down stem.

StonerEngineering,35ec99,vlttt420,1 point,Sat May 9 21:45:20 2015 UTC,There is so much misinformation about aluminum...  Corundum inhalation is toxic. Ingestion not so much. A butane lighter doesn't meet the melting point of the metal but that doesn't mean that level of heat doesn't cause a few stray aluminium atoms to detach from the primary mass. That is just basic kinetic molecular theory. The amount of aluminum that detaches in this way is very very minimal and is probably harmless. I will say though that my understanding is that people who routinely smoke heroin off of foil typically have respiratory issues that people who smoke it out of glass don't have. Maybe that is drug specific but maybe not. I would personally never use an aluminum pipe but chances are it does not pose a danger. Either way this bong is way safe so don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The heat is nowhere near the metal. I would hit it for sure.

StonerEngineering,352773,Haatsku,2,Wed May 6 18:22:03 2015 UTC,its very easy to control what type you roll based on how much you wanna smoke.
StonerEngineering,352773,jophes,2,Wed May 6 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometimes you just need a joint then and there. Furthermore, no dusty fingers and a perfect J every time. Also, it looks just like a cigarette so you can be much more discrete if you're smoking not in the safety and comfort of your own home.  Admittedly though, your rolling technique goes out the window after a month of the machine."
StonerEngineering,352773,Martient712,0,Fri May 8 07:06:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's imperfectly ok to not want an intimate relationship with a dead plant. I can see several reasons to, and plenty I agree with, but not everyone wants to use this for semi shamanistic reasons, or have any desire to view the plant that way.

(you can also throw some dryer sheets in either of those bags to ensure that no bad smell will get out.   the way most people get busted smoking at home is not the smell, but the sound of a lighter flicking: to fight this, inhale through your nose right as you flick your bic to obfuscate the sound.   make sure you put away everything before you leave the room, or fall asleep because when you start cutting corners or getting lazy, that is when you get caught. you"

Hence the ""self-contained."""

StonerEngineering,34x3os,NotMyRealName432,1 point,Tue May 5 20:33:10 2015 UTC,This is awesome! I thought of making something similar when I saw the same thread but never actually planned it out.
StonerEngineering,34x3os,LordGimp,3,Tue May 5 15:57:19 2015 UTC,Hang on. Wait a minute. How does this even work? The vortex allows for faster water transfer because it allows for air transfer during liquid transfer. Meaning it doesn't pull a vacuum. So why does it work?
StonerEngineering,34x3os,Chem420,3,Wed May 6 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"This would not work. The reason waterfall bongs work is because as the water flows out of the bottom of the bottle, the only way air can get through to replace the lost volume is through the bowl. Thus, air (smoke) is drawn through the bowl and into the chamber. Now let's say you have your vortex setup and open the valve without swirling to create a vortex. The water would slowly ""glug"" down into the bottom bottle and big bubbles would form in the top bottle as air from the bottom bottle is replacing the lost volume (of water flowing into bottom bottle). Now when you do swirl it and create a vortex, it smoothly drains into the bottom without glugging. This is because there is a stream of air going from the bottom bottle to the top through the middle of the vortex. But there is still air going into the top bottle from the bottom bottle. Because the lost volume (water) is already being replaced with air from the bottom bottle, there is no need for air to be pulled into the chamber from the bowl piece. In order for this to occur, volume has to leave the closed system (both bottles) to allow volume to enter the system (smoke through the bowl). In order for your setup to work, you would also need to remove the plug at the bottom and allow the water to drain out the bottom bottle. This would defeat the whole purpose. The only new thing this would do for you would be allow you to get a 4 liter chamber with only 2 liters of water."

StonerEngineering,34sccx,MentalWarfar3,7,Mon May 4 14:09:11 2015 UTC,it would be difficult to contain the smoke within the balloon as it would be trying to push out. If you are smoking weed inside it will smell regardless of if you use a sploof or blow the smoke outside as the weed will smell still(it is more obvious than you think to someone who knows). Sploofs are plenty effective if you are vaping or dabbing and you get nearly all of the smoke.

Coffee filters work best for containing the activated carbon when you rinse it and when its in the bottle. Once you build that just hook up the balloons to the mouth of the bottle and let it pass through the sploof. Do this where neighbors can't see and should be less noticeable. Also invest in a glade wax warmer or something like that as well and start snubbing bowls by covering it. A bubbler or bong makes it easier as you won't have to cover a carb or the mouthpiece just the bowl. Also a vape hooked up to that doesn't hurt also close the a/c vents because that shit will travel. None of this is guaranteed. I did most of this minus the balloons and vape but had a window open and a fan blowing out it (shutters made it so others couldnt see in) and my dad still noticed."

I like bongs, but they tend to hit me real hard, and joints/blunts are nice, but I'm too stingy to let all that smoke billow away while it makes its way around the circle (or into nothingness if Im by myself).    I've made a bong out of a 1.75 of Jack before, and it was fantastic.  I loved that thing, but it got traded around between a few friends and I have no idea where it resides now.  I used a 1/2"" diamond hole saw to make the hole in the top, and then just a 1/2"" rubber grommet to make the seal against the downstem.    A few words of advice! 1. Drilling through a glass bottle is insanely loud.  I strongly recommend doubling up on ear protection as in plugs and muffs.  a lubricant of some sort might also help cut down on the noise.  Obviosuly recommend all other PPE such as glasses, gloves, etc.  2. Find a way to secure the bottle to a fixture.  If you need to drill at an angle, look into a drill press if you can, otherwise I would suggest mocking up a jig and taping the bottle to it.  If you wiggle around too much while drilling, you will crack the glass.   3. pay attention and go slow, and you should wind up with a pretty decent product."

StonerEngineering,33x8uj,bunnykittyhamster,2,Sun Apr 26 18:26:32 2015 UTC,This is perfect!! I can use this until I am brave enough to drill into it!
StonerEngineering,33x8uj,cyranix,16,Mon Apr 27 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"The general rule I go by is to remember that your downstem needs to go in perpendicular to the angle of the glass (e.g., it will go straight in, not typically at an angle; this is not ALWAYS 100% true, and there ARE ways to put a downstem in at an angle other than 90°, but its significantly more difficult and requires other resources besides just a drill and grommet, etc).  First things first, you need to go to the hardware store and get glass drill bits. High carbon/carbon tipped bits are okay, but if the glass is particularly thin or of low quality, it will easily catch and can shatter the whole thing if you try to drill through it too fast. Diamond tipped bits are significantly more expensive, but they WILL drill faster and cleaner and have less likelihood of shattering the bottle. I would recommend a set of 5 or 6 of them, making sure that the largest one is at least close to the size of your downstem. You will also probably want to get a dremel (or similar high speed rotary drill tool) and a few diamond tipped glass bits like http://www.dremel.com/en-US/Accessories/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=663DR  Since you've never done this before, the MOST IMPORTANT thing you need to remember is that GLASS DUST IS VERY DANGEROUS. And you will be generating quite a bit of it. A very simple face mask to cover your nose and mouth is sufficient to prevent you from breathing the particles in, however I don't think you can overdo eye protection. One little tiny particle of glass in your eye will cause you more grief than I can possibly relate in the context of this post. FULL eye goggles that surround and protect your eyes from any and all dust is an absolute necessity.  With all that being said, take the bottle and hold it up to your mouth as if it were already a bong and figure out what the most ""natural"" angle to hold it is, and then use a sharpie to mark at what is the ""uppermost"" part of the bottle at that angle (so e.g., if it were already drilled, your bowl would be sticking straight up while you hold it). Then, I usually make another mark somewhere lower on the bottle than that, again keeping in mind the angle that the downstem needs to go in, and then considering how much water you want to put in the bottle as well. It takes a good bit of eyeballing to determine the proper place to put the final hole, but I think in general, about a 15° angle up usually gets the job done on these really round bottles (for comparison, when I drill chambord bottles, I usually end up with the downstem going in about a half an inch above the ""equator"" of the bottle).  Once you've decided where you want to put the hole, use your dremel first to ""score"" the glass at the point where you're going to drill. In particular, you want a good ¼mm-½mm cavity to rest the tip of your glass drill bit into (without the scoring, trying to get your hole started will be an exercise in frustration). Once you have that scored, use the SMALLEST glass drill bit to then widen that cavity a bit and get the hole started to about halfway through the glass. Then keep moving up one drill bit at a time and just keep widening and deepening the hole SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY until it finally ""punches"" through. This becomes the most dangerous part of the drilling, because once the hole is all the way through, its VERY easy for the glass drill bits to ""catch"" on a spur of glass, and that can and probably will shatter the bottle if it happens, so you want to be very careful to drill STRAIGHT down in to the glass, and do not use a lot of pressure. The BEST way I know to do this is using a drill press with the bottle in a vice so you know that the angle will be consistent and the bottle will not move, but in the absence of such equipment, I've used a hand drill, just be very careful about pressure and the speed of the drill. Patience is your best friend for this operation.  Once you get the hole wide enough that you're close to being able to fit your downstem in, bust the dremel back out and use the diamond bit to widen the hole to just a little more than large enough for the downstem to fit comfortably through with a little bit of wiggle room (hopefully you're able to keep the hole MOSTLY round, a perfect circle is not necessary, but avoiding ""flat"" curves will make fitting a rubber grommet easier and facilitate sliding the downstem through it a little easier and less dangerous as well).  A rubber grommet is the easiest and best way to secure your downstem in your hole. These are easy to acquire, wherever you go to buy your downstem, you should probably be able to get a fitting grommet, if its not already part of a ""kit"" which also comes with your bowl... If you don't have a rubber grommet, then you're going to have to secure your downstem using material like liquid rubber. There are a lot of different ways to get this, and you need to be careful because theres a LOT of toxic or flammable rubber caulk and sealant out there which you do NOT want to use (example: stay away from flexseal, which is both toxic AND flammable). The best stuff you can find is medical grade tube sealant, but thats unfortunately very expensive and not generally something that you can buy individually as a consumer (typically its sold in bulk to contractors). The second best material I can recommend is aquarium silicone sealant, which is less expensive and easier to get, but the downsides are many (you'll realize this pretty quickly, I couldn't possibly list all the issues, everything from bad smell to poor lifespan), and its much more difficult to apply... Basically, you'll want to put a big glob of it around the outside and then push and pull the downstem in and out to ""encourage"" the sealant to reach the inside of the bottle and then you'll hold the whole thing upside down and ""force"" some more of it through the outside in through your hole between the downstem up into the bottle, so hopefully it cures without any bubbles in it and forms a tight seal... Its much easier said than done, so you should really try to go with the rubber grommet method first and practice with sealant on another bottle you don't care about some other time...   Best of luck, look forward to seeing a picture of it when its complete :)  P.S., if you happen to live in or near Colorado, theres a head shop in Englewood off Broadway/Florida called Smoke Signals, they sell the downstem, grommet, bowl and retaining ring in a kit for $7.00 for a small one or $15.00 for a large one, which I highly recommend if you want to make this job as easy as possible :)  edit: P.P.S., to make sliding the downstem through the grommet into the bottle as easy as possible, use KY Jelly (not vaseline, because its petroleum based, whereas KY is water based. There's a few reasons why this is important, but for our purposes, suffice it to say, your grommet will thank you, and clean up will be a lot easier)."

Normally, as smoke is pulled in through a bong, it get's bubbled through water, which cools it down. Fancy downstems and honeycomb percs create more bubbles, which increases the surface area of smoke interacting with water. This allows for more efficient heat transfer between the hot smoke and the cold water. Smoke traveling up through the middle of a vortex would minimize the interactions between water and smoke since most of the smoke is traveling up through the vortex and not even touching the water. Thus, your smoke would essentially be uncooled/unfiltered by the water in the bong."

StonerEngineering,33qzh7,Blastmeaway,6,Fri Apr 24 23:52:13 2015 UTC,It took me a while to find enough pill bottles. Honestly I just used a heated element (woodburning kit or soldering gun) to heat and shape the plastic. All you gotta do is make a hole big enough to pass through the stem and for the rest just heat a hole through them big enough for the smoke to pass through. If you scrape the inside inner lip of the bottle it allows for them to connect easier.  I tested it this morning and it's quite effective.
StonerEngineering,33qzh7,nothas,4,Sat Apr 25 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"So get a lot of pill bottles that are the same size and cut a hole in the bottom of them,  hot glue them together and insert a stem at the bottom bottle?"
StonerEngineering,33qzh7,bran_dong,3,Sat Apr 25 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"Sort of, they're not glued or permanently fixed together, they're held together by friction. Each bottle fits snug into the next."

StonerEngineering,33ug8m,danketree,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:39:11 2015 UTC,It's only dangerous if it gets too hot.
StonerEngineering,33ug8m,omfglolzords,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:50:30 2015 UTC,smoke is hot. PVC reacts with heat. unless the smoke going through has already been cooled by like 3 water chambers it is going to react and the chemicals are going to end up in your lungs
StonerEngineering,33ug8m,danketree,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:52:31 2015 UTC,I'm just saying if the smoke is sufficiently cooled before it gets to the PVC then PVC can be safe. The danger line is 175°F.

StonerEngineering,33ug8m,omfglolzords,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no problem. The vapor will not be as hot but but still 200-300 degrees. For perspective the flame on a lighter is around 2000 degrees but it doesn't feel that hot going into your lungs when smoking out of a pipe. Vinyl is a terrible material for humans to interact with; low melting point and cancerous, not a good substance to use for anything above 72 degrees."
StonerEngineering,33ug8m,Mr_Weiler,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"Dude 212°F is literally boiling. Not saying it's 100% safe, but I think you're vastly overestimating vapor temp. Think about the last time you made spaghetti and how hot the steam coming off the boiling water was.  Just looked up the melting point for PVC and it's 284°F; polymer melting = decomposition, so this is the temperature when PVC's chlorine is freed. Chlorine is certainly bad for you, but at lower temperatures will stay put.   The real potential danger of PVC in this application is the plasticizer, BPA. Heat the PVC up enough and it will have the opportunity to leach out. What temperature the BPA will be released at is hard to say (varies with the polymer's molecular weight and the quantity of BPA), but the ""FDA-approved PVC suitable for food and beverage applications"" PVC tubing that I linked to earlier is rated up to 175°F, and I'm assuming that the engineer threw in a factor of safety on that number too. Personally, I'd trust PVC tubing for any temps below 175.  So what temp does the vapor get to? I can't find any info on it but I'd guess below 175."

StonerEngineering,33u4zt,LordGimp,5,Sat Apr 25 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"Epoxy is cool beans, but silicone sealant is better. You can pick up a tube of clear silicone gel for like $3 at home depot. 30 minutes to set, 24 hours to cure. The real advantage of this stuff is that it's flexible. Your pieces will have a little bit of movement in them, which will make them more likely to flex than to break. Epoxy would certainly put your bong back together, but it would be as brittle as always. Just dont try to smoke your pieces while your epoxy/silicone is curing. Until it's fully cured, adhesives tend to gas out nasty chemicals while the curing reactions is happening inside the material."

StonerEngineering,33otsh,SatyrMex,9,Fri Apr 24 07:38:06 2015 UTC,"Powdered Brewery Wash (or any percarbonate salt you can find cheap)  + Alconox (what we clean glass with in chem labs) if you wish. My goto is to run hot alconox-water through, let it sit for a few minutes, then run hot PBW through and let it sit for 10 minutes. You can even add a little feldspar (the old style red can of Bon Ami is perfect) as an abrasive like how we add salt to ISO. You will not be able to tell that your glass is not brand new. If over time you get a white layer on your bong, this is calcium deposits from your hard tap water and any acid (vinigar) will do just just fine"
StonerEngineering,33otsh,Methyl_Ethyl,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:20:19 2015 UTC,This is exactly the kind of knowledge I was wishing to get from asking this question. Thank you very much.
StonerEngineering,33otsh,3FiTA,5,Fri Apr 24 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"Acetone is your best bet for heavy duty cleaning. It's really not as dangerous as you seem to think. I mean, don't drink it, don't inhale it, don't touch it, but if you have a bottle of that and some rubber gloves, you'll have a hell of a clean piece. It's not dangerous."
StonerEngineering,33otsh,CharlesXavierWalks,3,Fri Apr 24 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"""rubber gloves""...""not dangerous"". Those words don't go together very well. If you are worried about that stick to Isopropyl - otherwise this guy is onto something."
StonerEngineering,33otsh,RustyCatalyst,5,Fri Apr 24 17:40:32 2015 UTC,Yeah. 91% alcohol. Its 2 dollars a bottle and it cleans that shit out. What more do you want?
StonerEngineering,33otsh,SapperBomb,5,Fri Apr 24 11:38:16 2015 UTC,Isopropyl or acetone mixed with sand or salt. Good for getting at the places where a brush can't reach.
StonerEngineering,33otsh,deer_island,3,Fri Apr 24 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"I've traditionally used 91% alcohol (super cheap at Walmart) and it works pretty well. However, you should only use this on thick glass. I recently had a little bowl break and I was told that it's because alcohol is corrosive and can wear down thinner glass."
StonerEngineering,33otsh,CharlesXavierWalks,3,Fri Apr 24 12:19:03 2015 UTC,"Isopropyl Alcohol and salts work wonders, is relatively cheap, and very easy to find. Every pharmacy I have visited has ISO, and the salts can be anything that doesn't dissolve immediately in the Isopropyl, mainly there for friction while shaking the shit out of it."

StonerEngineering,33otsh,Ambrosia21,2,Fri Apr 24 18:58:44 2015 UTC,The best thing I've found for cleaning pieces is grunge off. It costs like $15 but you're supposed to reuse it. You just put it in the piece and wait a few hours to a day and it comes out as clean as it was the first day you bought it.
StonerEngineering,33otsh,Warcrazy01,2,Fri Apr 24 14:11:35 2015 UTC,"As bad as it is, I use good ol gasoline to clean my pieces. It dissolves everything weed related and even gets the smoke stains off. But of course I make sure to get 104% of the gas out. I run dish soap through it a few times with hot water to get the gas out. If done right, it will be sparkling and won't taste of gas. Plus gas is cheap if use this way. A gallon of cleaner for 3ish bucks. Woo!"
StonerEngineering,33otsh,omniamorous,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"Totally going to try this next time.  Have never heard of the method, but makes great sense."
StonerEngineering,33otsh,Warcrazy01,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:01:00 2015 UTC,Do you use it for bongs or just small pipes and bong pieces?
StonerEngineering,33otsh,Deusetsuo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've used this on my bongs, pipes and even nectar collector. The gas just dissolves any resin or smoke residue and it washes away but I'd assume that gas probably isn't too good for glass. Use at your own risk.  That being said, it's all I use. Works wonders."

StonerEngineering,33lbox,luseferr,5,Thu Apr 23 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"Cool concept, but I think there are a few other products like that (one I've been seeing around I think is called WaterPuff).   Also, website could use work. There is absolutely 0 information about the product, beyond ""turn a bottle into a bong"". There is a single picture.   Tips from a web designer:   add some more pictures, maybe a gallery page   add a few in-action shots (you may want to use Tobacco in the pictures for the website, for legal reasons). People want to know what it looks like when you use it   Add more information about the product - how does it work, instructions, where do you put what pieces add specs (how long is the downstem? what size bottle(s) does it fit on? What sort of customizations can you make, if any? How many turns does it take to become tight, if possible? add pictures - never enough pictures. the more they see the more they want it please please please have more than one page. There is no better way to give out less information than to have only one page. are they available now? if not, when? how long does it take to ship? How much does shipping cost? on that note, how much does the product cost? what sort of guarantees do you offer, if any? what material is it made of? why is your product better than the competition? on the ""subscribe"" note, how often do you send emails? What are they about? do you share information with 3rd parties? what is your privacy policy? what's included with the package? What's not included? try adding some pictures   I would add a Gallery page, an About / What Is Byba page, and a Contact Us page.  The homepage looks neat, but could definitely use some improvement.

StonerEngineering,33lh3f,MrHotSocks,5,Thu Apr 23 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"Get a cordless drill, I've used 18v but something more powerful is way better.   Go to the hardware store and get diamond tipped drill bits. Get a pack because they wear out quick depending on how thick your glass is.   Put a piece of duct tape over where you want to drill so the bit doesn't slip.   Put your bottle in the sink and have a thin layer of water moving over where u ou are drilling. This keeps the temp down so it doesn't break and keeps glass shards from flying.   Drill a pilot hole with the smallest drill bit and keep drilling it out until you have the hole the size you want. If your smallest drill bit looks too big, get a smaller one. If you drill it with a big bit first you really raise the risk of cracking it when you break through.  If you want an angled hole drill the hole first then angle the bit against one side of the hole to wear it down more in that direction."

StonerEngineering,33gtre,GoodLookingAZN,3,Wed Apr 22 14:56:37 2015 UTC,If you're worried about toxins and have some fruits or vegetable you could always do the old apple or carrot pipe till you can get something cheap.    Can't you also just use the hole in the wood for a bowl and ditch the metal bowl and tape?
StonerEngineering,33gtre,justinhatguy,9,Wed Apr 22 20:40:01 2015 UTC,Ruined a pretty piece of wood and turned it into a toxic unsmokable mess.

StonerEngineering,33hvgx,Xeeroy,14,Wed Apr 22 17:26:21 2015 UTC,Just realized I should probably say what it is. It is a fully functional bowl for my bong made out of hash and it also has a bit of hash nuggets in it in the picture that I've already smoked. The bowl still works pretty well.
StonerEngineering,33hvgx,LordGimp,28,Wed Apr 22 17:27:59 2015 UTC,Dont bowl the hash. Smoke the hash. Make a bowl of hash in your bowl and put hash in it so you can smoke your hash in your bowl of hash while you smoke your hash bowl in your bowl full of hash stuffed hash bowls.
StonerEngineering,33hvgx,LordGimp,6,Wed Apr 22 18:01:47 2015 UTC,I'm way to high for inception stuff right now? It only worked for 3 bowlfuls and now I've smoked it in my regular bowl and I'm way up there.
StonerEngineering,33hvgx,Mrsbobdobbs,4,Wed Apr 22 18:11:33 2015 UTC,you need to make like 3 bowls and stack them up so you smoke your bowl in your bowl in your bowl in yo bowl in yo bowl on the stem

StonerEngineering,33ig88,LavanTheAlmighty,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"'tack' is a non-specific term. Do you know the specific chemical composition of whatever it is that you used? Epoxy would be fine, but glue or some sealants can be toxic."
StonerEngineering,33ig88,LordGimp,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't know the chemical composition. It's just your everyday average sticky tack. The wiki page for blue tack says ""the material is not flammable, but emits carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide when exposed to fire or high temperatures"" which has me worried but I'd imagine the smoke wouldn't be heated by the time it reaches the peculator."
StonerEngineering,33ig88,LordGimp,2,Wed Apr 22 20:28:49 2015 UTC,if that's all the wiki says then you dont have any problems. combusting the weed produces oodles of CO2 and CO all by itself. You tack isnt going to make a noticable difference.

StonerEngineering,33d972,KickAssIguana,6,Tue Apr 21 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Serious question: Is there a way to seal the pores in the plastic on a piece like this? Like how you would glaze a ceramic plate to make it usable.
StonerEngineering,33d972,Falafelofagus,7,Tue Apr 21 18:36:20 2015 UTC,If it's ABS you can do an acetone vaporbath which smooths it right up. I would still be warry of using it though because abs is not food safe.
StonerEngineering,33d972,KickAssIguana,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:03:00 2015 UTC,My dad has a makerbot and we havent really had any success with acetone other than leaving behind white residue.
StonerEngineering,33d972,Falafelofagus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Are you using ABS or PLA?  Edit: I'm almost positive you're using PLA which is the default material for the more recent makerbots. For PLA you can use tetrahydrofuran I believe, thorugh I have never tried it."

StonerEngineering,33d972,zildjiandrummer1,2,Wed Apr 22 11:02:09 2015 UTC,Acetone only works with ABS. For real though neither should be used for making a bong.

StonerEngineering,33d972,nastdrummer,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:46:46 2015 UTC,My first thought was that the bowl is pretty close to the plastic. When the glass heats up around the bowl it will also heat up the plastic. Just some thing to be conscious of.
StonerEngineering,33d972,Falafelofagus,2,Tue Apr 21 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"There's no bowl in the picture, just the down stem. There shouldn't be too much heat transfer from bowl to down stem, unless you're doing dabs."
StonerEngineering,33d972,FannaWuck,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:23:14 2015 UTC,Depending on the material it's totally safe to inhale the plastic smoke. My dads makerbot uses corn based plastic.

This looks like a sweet work around.  Is the X at the bottom of the tube supposed to act like an ice catcher?  Do you have any kind of o-ring or gasket? How air tight is it?"
StonerEngineering,33d972,Dirty_Socks,2,Tue Apr 21 18:57:08 2015 UTC,I didn't use any gaskets or anything except for on the bowl going to the downstem. This setup stays pretty air tight seeing as everything is relatively flat. The x on the main tube is for sure an ice catcher that I threw on it just for fun!
StonerEngineering,33d972,fifty2imeanfifty4,3,Tue Apr 21 23:37:35 2015 UTC,How do you have little to no warp on that piece? A lot of my prints come out warped and I want to try to fix it.
StonerEngineering,33d972,oscarvilla556,2,Tue Apr 21 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"If he's printing with PLA, that would explain it. PLA has very little warp compared to ABS."
StonerEngineering,33d972,Tomtron2277,3,Tue Apr 21 20:21:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that's exactly it I'm printing in PLA on a heated bed and it hardly ever warps. I think the heated bed is more crucial then the type of plastic.

StonerEngineering,334jq2,Rant_Raver,-7,Sun Apr 19 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Many Holocaust revisionists point to Jewish support of Hitler (and Stalin) as a reason to deny the ""senseless"" murder of millions of European ""Jews,"" Gypsies, and Armenians in the early 20th century. I believe they are barking up the wrong tree.  I am Jewish. I was adopted by a Jewish family as a baby. I was circumcized (against my biological mother's wishes). I had a Bar Mitzvah. I was a member of the ZBT fraternity. I was on the inaugural Birthright Israel trip. I spent my entire professional career as a real estate investor and private equity advisor. I personally know several powerful Zionist billionaires. I am as much of a Jew as anyone.  There is a reason Jews supported Hitler: Hitler was right.  I know genocide is a scary concept, but try to look at it this way, if you will. In the early 20th century, Ashkenazi ""Jewish"" bank scams, media lies, and collective economic terrorism nearly destroyed Europe. Then Hitler and Stalin woke up, repaired their economies, and slaughtered 90% of the European ""Jewish"" population (excluding the authentic German Jews).  The result was a century of peace and prosperity on the continent. But some survived, reproduced, and a century later their descendants repeated the same atrocious usury and have again brought Europe to it's knees. Not to mention the havoc raged by the phony Satanic ""Jews"" that fled Europe to America.  Imagine how much better life would be for everyone if Hitler killed them all. Sometimes the truth is a hard pill to swallow.  These animals are not Jews. They are really just a cooperative and educated band of Gypsies (descendants of the Egyptian Pharoah) otherwise known as ""The Seed of Amalek."" These ""people"" are a subhuman devil species incapable of the emotion ""love.""  In exile, they converted to Judaism to shelter themselves from the genocide God commands. The Holy Torah (and Bible, and Koran) commands God's real children to wipe their entire race from existence because they ALWAYS repeat these same crimes against humanity.  It is simply in their DNA, and so long as they are allowed to exist, they will repeat the same atrocities. Today, genocide violates international law, but most men and women understand that God's word supercedes the Geneva Convention.  None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who care not who makes the rules. It is Time.  ***For educational and discussion purposes only. I do not condone violence or unlawfulness. There are legal and peaceful solutions to the Jewish question. I only intend to spark this very necessary discussion."

I've now found this super awesome vinyl tubing that works just as well as a mouthpiece and a downstem. fun stuff.
StonerEngineering,3346p2,LordGimp,6,Sun Apr 19 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer this as best as possible.   The brass you have for your bowl should be fine, it won't give off anything toxic but the aluminum isn't the best option. Granted if it's just your down stem then it shouldn't get hot enough to give off anything harmful but it still isn't the best. I'm not entirely sure as to what you meant by gluing the bowl and down stem together, the outside diameter of the bowl should match that inside diameter of the down stem, so it just slides inside of it.  Taking all this into consideration if you've got $20 just got to a local head shop and they have all the glass pieces you need, which is probably your best option. Hoped this helped!"
StonerEngineering,3346p2,Lexow,2,Sun Apr 19 14:20:01 2015 UTC,"Do you have a rubber grommet?? If not, pick some up (come in a variety size pack)at home depot for cheap and match the grommet size to hole size for fitting.

StonerEngineering,3346p2,theBob1986,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:09:45 2015 UTC,If the aluminum is relatively good quality and not annodized it shouldn't be an issue. Generally the bowl slides into the downstem so you can pull it out to clear the bong.

StonerEngineering,32vs99,the_sixhead,12,Fri Apr 17 06:17:20 2015 UTC,"How?   I gutted the internals of the Zapper, leaving only the trigger mechanism intact. I used a butane tank, spark generator, plastic tubing, wiring, and stem from a refillable, long stick lighter. After 3 blisters' worth of cutting and sanding plastic in the trigger assembly, barrel, and handle, I superglued the sparker into the trigger, replacing the spring that gives the gun its distinct click. I superglued the tank into the handle, refillable end down, and ran the very small butane hose and spark wiring up through the iron sights, wherein I mounted the tip of the lighter (again, superglue). Picked up some pipe parts from my friendly neighborhood smoke shop (The Mighty Quinn, this place is dope) and made a long, skinny, right-angled pipe to fit the length of the barrel. Black tip on the muzzle is a wooden mouthpiece where smoke is drawn from. It took some doing, but eventually I rigged the trigger mechanism to engage the butane and spark simultaneously.

Yes because it's the same principal as combustion bubblers and bongs. You stack the hit with vapor or smoke and then get a big hit of vapor or smoke.   wondering if vapor would get trapped in water easier than smoke would or anything like that that would decrease the strength of hits   Water has the same effect it would have on vapor as it would with smoke.

StonerEngineering,32xpqp,rad_as_heck,3,Fri Apr 17 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"You probably dont want the exit to be so close to the entrance, otherwise its gonna go out to fast without filtering much"
StonerEngineering,32xpqp,THE_SHROOM_GOD,2,Sat Apr 18 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"Put the fan all the way to the right corner, and make the part where you blow into on the bottom instead of the top. Hot smoke rises.  Maybe line up the carbon pouches so the smoke will go through all of them"
StonerEngineering,32xpqp,Rev1212,2,Sat Apr 18 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"Fan at the opposing end of where you blow the smoke in. You're gonna wanna do a sheet or two of dryer sheets, then probably as many activated carbon pouches as can fit in the tube. When you get to the actual box I'd do a bunch of drier sheets near the entrance tube, then more carbon, and more carbon, maybe a bit more carbon, then drier sheets and drier sheets. The point is to have it go through as much carbon before drier sheets. But yeah, you want the fan on the other end to force the smoke through as much filtration as possible. Your previous set up would give you like a 45% less yield   Edit: forgot to mention. What I did with mine was I made it a cardboard box, just activated carbon and sheets inside kinda like described, but no fan. I had a surgical tube that lead from the box near the window to my mouth so it was pretty effortless. Blow into it from wherever."
StonerEngineering,32xpqp,sigmar123,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"just wanted to share my idea, while on the subject of sploofs. here it is  The filter consists of two of these babies and between them some carbon or dryer sheets (or both) With the fan being powered by a 9volt, you can't really pack the carbon too tightly or else the fan will just not be able to move the air through it. (Also most fans don't use 9 volts, so if you're going to be really fancy, you can do that part better, but whatever."
StonerEngineering,32xpqp,hightech148,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"I've personally gone ahead and built something very similar to this in the past, computer fans did not provide enough pressure to push air through a bunch of dryer sheets. Even after doubling the fans up, and removing a bunch of sheets, there was zero airflow. Removing the fan leaves you with a regular Sploof essentially, which is a proven design! If I ever attempt something like this again, I'm using an EDF setup from an RC jet. Would be cool, but obnoxiously loud! Ideally you'd have some sort of air pump on the output, rather than a fan."

Its not a bad idea, but it will be unnapealing to this sub where we see this everyday, except yours is being marketed and its only a notch above the rest.  Why not make it so this ""fitting"" , can be attached to multiple cups and jars? And make the neck collapseable?  Make the whole thing out of a flexible material.  I think you can get away with making your selling point about being  compact and discreet. If you can make the bong neck collapsable and show people how small it can become. That would be perfect."

For what this dude is charging (probably about 30 after s&h) I bought a full glass bong, with a diffuser downstem, dome perc, and ice catch. Its not worth that much. Especially when you can buy a roll-a-bowl for a similar price and it compacts to maybe 1/5 of that things size, if not more. And they don't need crowdfunding."

Yes there are posts regarding glass drilling and work on glass bottles that people can look at but they may not find the answer they're looking for, don't discourage people from posting by saying something like that.

Being an experienced smoker, I cringe when I see people do this. The amount of trees you can save and attain by being conservative is astonishing when compared to careless smokers. That's why I'm not necessarily partial to blunts and joints; because most of the smoke is not even being ingested and you are literally throwing away over half of the trees you are using. Don't get me wrong, I love a blunt/joint or two once in a while, but it's not difficult to realize how much substance is actually being wasted. And trees are too valuable to me to just waste most of it during every single one of my smoke sessions. Plus, it seems so typical of an inexperienced smoker to tell us that we're wrong instead of sitting back and learning a thing or two."
StonerEngineering,32p56l,creepy_hawaiian,0,Wed Apr 15 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"I have enough history to know none of that stuff works. No matter how fast you cover the bowl, some smoke will escape. Add on top of that you aren't removing the smell, but covering it up.   When I used pipes, back in my youth, I was the one with the callused thumb from covering bowls...  ...but I gained experience, and a volcano. So should you and OP. Don't smoke. Dab or vape."

StonerEngineering,32p56l,zebra-specialist,2,Wed Apr 15 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"That's why I, personally, ensure there is no exhaust from the trees being burned. I mainly use a bong and pack in just enough to amount to one hit. I burn all of it and make sure 100% of the smoke goes into my lungs and out through the sploof. The only remaining trees smell should be the miniscule amount of residue that is heated whilst igniting the hit. That's why disguising the smoke coming from your lungs is so crucial, because you want 100% of it to be masked by the sploof. And the more ""excessive"" the sploof, the better it is masked. I always see inexperienced/ignorant smokers let too much exhaust come off of the burning bowl, at which that point using a sploof is relatively pointless. Yes, there will always be a miniscule amount of odor while burning anything, but when done right can be masked to the point where the sploof does just good enough of a job to the point where the residue exhaust is too small to notice against the sploofed smoke."

StonerEngineering,32p56l,theBob1986,4,Wed Apr 15 18:57:31 2015 UTC,Blow smoke into straw and it comes out the top which is filled with dryer sheets. The liquid is laundry detergent

StonerEngineering,32p56l,Rhnea,2,Wed Apr 15 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, just a tip to help improve your device, go by Walmart and pick up some activated charcoal from the fish section. Its 6$. Activated charcoal will absorb and neutralize the odor. Activated charcoal is one of the main ingredients in a Smoke Buddy, so if you want to build a superb sploof use activated charcoal."

StonerEngineering,32kmqx,DOCTOR_JUSTICE,3,Wed Apr 15 01:25:24 2015 UTC,He's talking about a flame adjuster on the cheap lighters. Not the safety on bics. You can break the flame adjuster so it shoots out a 4 inch flame.
StonerEngineering,32kmqx,GOOMH,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:19:18 2015 UTC,Because I don't need a flame the size of Justin Bieber's cock to light my bowls.
StonerEngineering,32kmqx,GetOutOfBox,2,Wed Apr 15 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Child safety is not the little lever to control the flame.   Child safety is the metal part over the flint wheel that makes it impossible to light the bic without using a little amount of pressure which most kids cant figure out.  Also, are you saying Justin Biebers cock is big? Because you can make some big ass flames with a modded lighter."
StonerEngineering,32kmqx,Tomatentom,2,Wed Apr 15 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"I originally said the safety valve. DOCTOR_JUSTICE is the one who seems to have the words mixed up (because the child safety is not a valve). The safety valve prevents excessively large flames, some lighters make it adjustable while others do not.  And in general I've not seen a ""de-valved"" lighter put out a flame taller than maybe 3-4 inches, which according to my understanding of cock size is pretty tiny. Bics are the common lighters where I am."
StonerEngineering,32kmqx,GetOutOfBox,2,Wed Apr 15 23:33:32 2015 UTC,Can confirm. A friend of mine removed the safety valve of one of his lighters entirely.  It literally just shoots liquid flame. He has to be careful not to confuse it with others while he's toking.

StonerEngineering,32lkk2,pineapplemikel,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:58:11 2015 UTC,If I were you I would get a glass drill bit and figure out a way to drill a hole in the bottom of a jar and find some way to attach the bowl to said hole. Then put a mouth piece on top of the jar and you're golden. It would probably look pretty weird however. Sorry if none of that made sense I'm at an (8) right now

StonerEngineering,32f13c,david0990,3,Mon Apr 13 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"The dryer sheets mostly just make the air smell nice. The real kicker comes in with the activated carbon. Activated is just a fancy way of saying they treated it with oxygen in order to open up millions of tiny pores between the carbon atoms. These millions of pores allow for other particles (i.e. cannabis scent particles) to bond to countless sites in the carbon, trapping them. This process ""eliminates"" (traps) the smell.  ELI5 TLDR: Treated carbon has countless bonding sites for particles to get caught in. The ""scent particles"" get trapped in these bonding sites, and never make it into the room. The few stragglers that do make it into the room are scented by the dryer sheets."

StonerEngineering,32e5tb,voucher420,3,Mon Apr 13 07:02:31 2015 UTC,"Uhh looks like you will be buying a new ~70$ piece instead of a 20$ nail, you need some sort of adapter or even a regular nail which doesn't rest directly on the glass will work. Seriously if this worked once don't  try it again"
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,Zmiller23,2,Mon Apr 13 12:56:49 2015 UTC,This was just an experiment. I wanted to see if it would work. I got the rig for free because it already has two hairline cracks in it so I don't expect it will last very long anyways. I understand that large temperature changes in the glass can break it and I will gen an adapter soon.
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,Zmiller23,2,Mon Apr 13 15:24:54 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks for the explanation didn't mean to sound like a dick just seemed so obvious that it was wrong i thought you were trolling

StonerEngineering,32e5tb,JimTrivial,3,Tue Apr 14 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"i dont understand the purpose of this, how does this work?"
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,LordGimp,3,Mon Apr 13 01:58:02 2015 UTC,its a titanium bit im guessing and hes heating it up and dabbing it to it with the magnet holding it on the other side of the glass.  Could be a bad idea though and be too much heat on the glass
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,LordGimp,22,Mon Apr 13 02:07:19 2015 UTC,it's not titanium if a magnet (no matter how strong) is holding it there. Magnets only effect ferrous materials. The bit is probably carbon steel with some sort of weather resistant coating. very unsafe for dabbing
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,JimTrivial,-5,Mon Apr 13 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"Haven't got to use this setup yet, but I will post and tell how well it works."
StonerEngineering,32e5tb,shawkolate,19,Mon Apr 13 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"if you havent dabbed this set up, please dont. That shit is some form of ferrous iron or steel.

Especially if the bowl is an extra $7.  On the other hand, I love that a cleaning brush comes with it. That was my very first concern.   Now I'm gonna offer some unsolicited advice, that I hope helps you conduct your business in the future. My first thought that was that your product is similar to the mflb. I personally haven't bought one, but I don't consider their price of $100 as outrageous because it comes with so many cool extras. It comes with a padded carrying case, extra batteries, etc. Maybe you could come up with a lot of cool custom accessories to make your product more complete. I'd pay $100 for it of it came with the flex brush, 2 bowls (in case one breaks), a couple of 'glasslung' lighters, hemp wick, Mason jar neoprene sleeves, etc. You could also sell a barebones glasslung without a jar, brush, etc. And market the accessories for large profit margins once they buy a cheap startup jar. People will splurge and buy all the accessories/package deal merely for convenience, but you could avoid the initial sticker shock and make your profit off the accessories.   Edit: Also, a lot easier said than done. Either way, I hope you find a way to make it work because this really is such a cool idea."

Here you could maybe add microfilter ti the pipe to catch extra junk.. ect.. Overall I really like it and will be doing something similar..

And basically, this is what you do - you buy some jars/pipes, bend them, and put it all together using clamps... First, you should acquire better looking jars. Don't use jars that are available at every shop... Second, join all the things using welder or something like that, make everything look smooth.

Part of the value of that device, to me (and many others), is it's lifetime warranty with outstanding customer service. With a similar offering for your piece, I think the price would be more than justified.  I do have one piece of advice about some verbiage on your website:   The upstem and downstem are made from type 304 stainless steel. Outdoor grills are another application of type 304 stainless steel; they get really hot and make direct contact with your food. Type 304 stainless steel = safe.   While 304 may still be safe in this application, the logic of this statement isn't exactly outstanding. Food grade =/= Medical grade. Food grade must be safe for ingestion, not necessarily inhalation. I applaud you for addressing concerns about materials choice, but I would suggest finding more scientific evidence and stating it in a more official and mature manner."

Hell, it's not even a true 'grade', it's a finish and temper. People assume that, for some idiotic reason, a material grade automatically means one is better than the other. Not the case with metals. Hell, 'food grade' means nothing. It's 304 stainless. Period. You're asking for something you know nothing about. 304 is chemically stabile to 675 degrees without gas shielding.

StonerEngineering,32alc1,Linkisdoomed,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:37:50 2015 UTC,Part of the way through your hit lift your bowl so it isn't resting on the glass. It sticks because the glass expands as the bowl heats up. If you lift it a tiny bit so it doesn't touch when it expands it won't stick.

StonerEngineering,3291be,TheVicSageQuestion,3,Sat Apr 11 19:46:34 2015 UTC,He did bro lol are you looking for a walk through? In that case   Buy glass stem and bowl or use socket and the tubing everyone on here uses (it's safe to use) get drill.  drill hole into base big enough for stem or tube.  put stem in there.   *attach bowl    smoke weed    The mouth piece up to you. You could cut it so you don't have to stick your entire face to smoke. Just sand it so it's smooth and not jagged.

StonerEngineering,3291be,astrozombie53,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:20:07 2015 UTC,how do I seal off the hole for the stem and what size do I get? Also how would I add an ice catch and/or perc to this?  Thanks for the help
StonerEngineering,3291be,ProfessorSnatch21,2,Sat Apr 11 19:58:54 2015 UTC,You can use a knife to make a hole also I have a bong exactly like that and to seal it get one of those rubber rings they sell at home Depot
StonerEngineering,3291be,Parker97,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"You can use a grommet to seal the hole. Now the size of the hole and grommet depend on the size of stem you choose. A lot of the time they are sold by gauges, so find out with the millimeters are of whatever gauge you get. This will help when finding a grommet.   You could use quick steel which I think this subreddit said was cool to use (if I'm wrong let me know guys)   As far as perks go, I don't think you can put one on the inside. You'll have to use an adpater or external perk that you would get from a smoke shop. If you want to make one, just YouTube it because that one is a little trickier to explain.   I just had an idea for a perk ice catcher thingy-ma-bob.    Take a piece of something that is safe to smoke. Cut it into a circle that is the size of the mouth piece.  get stainless steal pipes that are small in diameter. I was thinking like 5 pipes.    *cut or drill 5 holes into the material to fit the pipes.   *get grommets for the pipes. Place them into holes.    place perk/ice catcher Frankenstein thing into mouth piece and enjoy shitty perk ice catcher combo!    I'll try to make a diagram of what I'm talking about."

StonerEngineering,326rlq,bigpookey,2,Sun Apr 12 23:27:48 2015 UTC,MFLB recommends that the bud be ground almost to a dust before using it. They made the finishing grinder because other grinders don't usually grind fine enough. It's just a little wooden grinder that grinds material into smaller pieces.
StonerEngineering,326rlq,Kcry,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:00:21 2015 UTC,Find a little container like a film canister. Put ground up dry bud in it with a few coins. Shake Shake Shake till you have powder.

StonerEngineering,325zs9,AsylumPlagueRat,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:11:56 2015 UTC,I did some research on it and found a couple other pipes carved in walnut though its not one of the classic pipe woods. People should be careful though some woods are very poor choices as they will release toxic fumes when burned or heated.  I couldn't find anything to suggest walnut was one of these woods. I choose it because it's one of the hardest woods which means harder to burn and harder to carve.

StonerEngineering,31wpd9,SX23,19,Wed Apr 8 19:19:46 2015 UTC,Get a screen
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,holololololden,3,Wed Apr 8 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"We do have a screen in there and it holds the weed perfectly and whatnot, but i find that i need to start slowly pulling air while very carefully putting the flame near the bowl a little bit from below so it can actually light something. Is this normal or did we fuck something up? Also, where should we drill a carb? We dont know wether to do it at the top of the bottle or just above the water. OH, and about the water, how much should we fill it? Thank you all for your comments, sorry i think i cant answer again for 5 mins or so so ill just tell u all here ahahaha ty!"
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,GanjaLogic,3,Wed Apr 8 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"That's normal, it's got a different pull than joints. It's a slower steadier drag."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,SouthTampon,3,Thu Apr 9 01:41:06 2015 UTC,add one or a few more screens.
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,abductee92,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:31:33 2015 UTC,Put the carb wherever its convenient but definitely above the water line. The water line should be above the bottom of your intake stem but not higher than where the stem meets the side of the bottle.
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,iamreddify,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, you've got pull slow at first to light everything up & then suck it all in.  A choke would really help 'save' weed without having to add more screens. Have it 10-15mm above the water line.  Fill till the water line is halfway between the bottom of the stem and where it is attached to the bottle."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,theBob1986,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:18:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need a tighter seal
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,W_Edwards_Deming,-1,Sat Apr 11 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need a torch lighter! Go to the cigar store, mine has four torches. I think this is a different brand, but is much the same. A single torch would be sufficient, methinks."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,rollinindaroyce,12,Wed Apr 8 22:45:56 2015 UTC,The best way to fix this is to add some drag or pull to the piece. The air flow goes through so fast is just sucks up the flame. Your not using a torch so its almost like blowing the lighter out when you inhale too hard. Basically if you put marbles into the piece this will cause the smoke to break more which means more smoke touches water ie cooler hits. Also the marbles will cause some drag so you just don't inhale too hard. Try taking it a little slower too when you inhale. Just slowly milk her dont try to just snap the bowl on the first hit! Hope that helps!
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,s3rk,2,Wed Apr 8 20:12:53 2015 UTC,Could try a homemade version of a diffused down stem too
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,rollinindaroyce,2,Wed Apr 8 21:06:04 2015 UTC,It def would add some needed drag i just dont think its gonna be enough for the user. Guess well see what happens... or not
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,juksayer,2,Wed Apr 8 21:33:48 2015 UTC,Could try packing the bowl tighter too.
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,Fleto,15,Wed Apr 8 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Joints waste more weed than a bowl. The paper continues to burn the weed and let the smoke trail whereas a bowl will either keep most of the smoke in, not continue burning the weed, or you could cap the bowl and put the fire out."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,modernbenoni,3,Wed Apr 8 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need the lighter to be lit throughout the hit. If you're dragging then the weed will continue to burn (like, embers) and it won't taste like gas."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,iamreddify,3,Thu Apr 9 02:05:21 2015 UTC,"This! I've never needed to use the lighter all through the drag. Just a little to get it going.  We have a habit to smoking entire (small) bowl with every 'shot' and sucking the burnt weed into the bong to settle with the water. This dirties the water a lot, need to change after ever ~7 shots. But, it is a LOT of fun, gets you High as fuck with a rush, sorta like a dab.  Because we smoke the entire bowl, we just circle the lighter around the bowl and let the embers burn. If anyone is giving this method a shot & is having trouble maintaining pressure, then keep using the lighter till you pull it all in, it's faster."
StonerEngineering,31wpd9,nucleardread,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"Shot.. Thats different aha, here in australia we use the term sink. But shot seems better."

StonerEngineering,31wpd9,twistedgrit,2,Fri Apr 10 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"I would swap the bottle for a larger container. You need more resistance when you draw and one way to do that is to use more water. The draw hose and bowl are very large compared to the bottle, this is why it tends to suck up the flame. Use something at least twice as big and, like others have suggested, put in some kind of DIY diffuser like marbles."

StonerEngineering,31wpd9,DerpyDan442,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:46:41 2015 UTC,Your tube is too large in diameter. Your needing to consume alot of air before you start using your vacuum to burn the weed. If you get a thinner tube it should help.

StonerEngineering,31ylmy,ChormNomsky,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:07:52 2015 UTC,"Can you give us a little more details on how you're going about building your box?  Specifically, are you using the same relative design as the MFLB and using copper(or another low resistance metal) as a conductor to create a pathway to the trench? Or are you just using the mesh directly in contact with the battery?  How is the performance of your box as is? Are you getting any heat at all?  But to answer your question, the thinner your mesh is, the higher its resistance will be, and the more heat it will give off. That second mesh in particular looks a little too thick. Stainless is your best bet to stick with because copper is going to rapidly oxidize and start to give you problems with heating and potentially a strange taste.   Keep us updated and we'll be glad to help you problem solve!"
