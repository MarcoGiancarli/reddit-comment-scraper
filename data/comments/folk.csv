Coming to grips with the above issues does not mean we have to be anti-male in our attitude. It doesn't mean we can't be funny. It doesn't mean we have to stop singing the songs.

That's not really a Feminist fantasy.  This one they might like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g0KFB2JZA because it is the fair maid who takes an active role in pursuing the man's peg.  And she stands up for herself and asserts herself, over her parents wishes.  On the other hand, the Feminists might prefer a dumpy, middle-aged wench to be the protagonist, rather than the pretty fair maid, who always gets the male attention.  And, they would probably take umbrage at the thought of a man offering to protect a woman--a woman doesn't need a man's protection--that still sounds too patriarchal."

And if you're just looking for songs that might leave you tearing up a bit, but maybe in more of a sweet way than a sad way, I recommend the songs Lies and Forty-five Years, which is sad when you know that he wrote it for his wife and then tragically died at a young age."

This list is going to go for the artists that cleave a little closer to tradition, or at least operate a little outside the typical pop spectrum, which is why I haven't listed Peter, Paul and Mary, etc.  Give a listen to Alan Lomax's Sounds of the South if you want to go really deep.  Early/Delta Blues:  Robert Johnson  Rev. Gary Davis  Sister Rosetta Tharpe (!)  Leadbelly  Blind Willie McTell  Lightnin Hopkins  Muddy Waters, esp. the early stuff  B.B. King, early and otherwise  Mississippi John Hurt  Acoustic Folk Revival:  John Prine  Pete Seeger  Bob Dylan  Dave van Ronk (who I see you've already picked up)  Country Blues / Gospel:  Doc Watson  Nitty Gritty Dirt Band  Old-Time String Bands:  Carolina Chocolate Drops  Haints Old-Time String Band  Black Twig Pickers  John Hartford  Brian Vollmer  American Primitive Guitar:  Jack Rose  John Fahey  Robbie Basho  Modern Folk of All Stripes:  Charlie Parr  Jake Xerxes Fussell (real old country-blues stuff, with some psychedelic editing)  Daniel Bachman (american primitive banner-holder)  Ryley Walker  Hiss Golden Messenger  Phil Cook and his Feat / Megafaun (my college favorite band)  William Tyler  That's about as good of an early list as I'm going to be able to do.

folk,3cndrk,skadipress,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:54:31 2015 UTC,"The word ""vätte"" is hard to translate. It's related to the English word ""wight"", and it essentially means ""(unearthly) being"".  ""Vättar"" lived underground near human homesteads, and it was considered courteous to warn them before pouring out hot water through the window or taking a piss in the lawn. If they got scalded or pissed on they would take revenge by invading your house and fuck shit up.  But if you were friendly with the vättar you could be richly rewarded. There is a story from Värmland about the vättar asking a young girl for help as a midwife, and then giving her a gold chain when she helped with the delivery of the vätte child.  I'm not sure what the English equivalent of the Vätte would be. Gnome? Hobgoblin? Elf?"
folk,3cndrk,ArrantPariah,2,Thu Jul 9 08:10:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, it's a beautiful song beautifully sung.  I think the english/scots equivalent of such a house-creature would be a hob or a brownie. But the trouble is that people are not as familiar with these terms as people in Sweden are with vätte or (hus)tomte. There are disadvantages with using ""Wight"" as a translation, much as I love cognate translations --- it is not a word that is in common use in english except for the occasional tolkienesque. Plus the OE (i.e. anglo saxon) use of this word was essentially identical with modern ""creature"" and could be used equally well for humans or even for inanimate objects (in riddles, famously) and not referring specifically to supernatural creatures."

folk,3amzim,Arnold5127,5,Sun Jun 21 20:34:52 2015 UTC,very poorly recorded all the timbre is off. voice is theatric in a bad way. good song writing but sounds like needs more practice before recording
folk,3amzim,seanmm31,3,Sun Jun 21 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"woof. I hope I don't come across as rude and unnecessarily critical but there's a difference between sounding grunge and sounding like you just wrote, practiced, and recorded a song all in one day. The mix was real rough, and the beats were all off, especially the guitar, didn't even sound like it was trying to mesh with the rest. At the risk of sounding too critical though I certainly appreciate what this took, I just don't think you're at the recording stage yet."

From the description:   One of five films made from footage that Alan Lomax shot between 1978 and 1985 for the PBS American Patchwork series (1991).  It offers songs, dances, stories, and religious rituals of the Southern Appalachians. Preachers, singers, fiddlers, banjo pickers, moonshiners, cloggers, and square dancers recount the good times and the hard times of rural life there.   I'm lucky enough to be seeing a screening of it next weekend at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, accompanied by a curator's discussion and a conversation with banjo player and folkie Sam Amidon."

Just saw the Full English at the Cecil Sharp House in London, dark and lively, and a lot of fun, and full of tradition. June Tabor is about as dark as you can get.  The American Band, Low Anthem.  Johnny Cash.  Robert Johnson.  Anything T-Bone Burnett produces, as well as his recordings.  Just saw Martin Carthy and his daughter Eliza Carthy; a great concert.  I love her stuff.

""Dingdorum"" is the genitive plural of the Latin ""dingdus"" which transmuted over the centuries to the the more modern ""dong"".  Of course, it is immediately obvious to any Latin scholar than the use of the genitive plural case is grammatically wrong, and that the line in ""Maids When You're Young"" should read ""He's got no phallum, he's lost his dingdum"" (ie. the accusative singular case would have been more correct)   Ah, well, I guess that the originator of that song wasn't really up on his or her Latin."

Here's a quick list - mostly traditional stuff, mostly minor-key and all medieval sounding:   Fairport Convention - Fotheringay Fairport Convention - Crazy Man Michael Fairport Convention - Nottamun Town Pentangle - Let No Man Steal Your Thyme Pentangle - Hunting Song Sandy Denny - Geordie Sandy Denny - Fhir a' Bhàta Trees - Garden of Jane Delawney Shellagh McDonald - Dowie Dens of Yarrow Fotheringay - Winter Winds Pentangle - Yarrow Marianne Faithful - Scarborough Fair (others mentioned S&G version, but this one's nice too and quite unknown)   If you like any of them,  here's a more comprehensive list that I posted ~1 year ago. If you like one thing in particular, just leave a message - I ca try to find similar ones."
folk,370dof,RayLomas,1 point,Sun May 24 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Best freaking list ever!!!   Yes, yes, yes. This is exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. Freaking bowled over right now. Thank you so much.  Those two Sandy Denny songs you linked above, ""Geordie"" and ""Fhir a' Bhata""... What albums do those appear on? Did a search on Wikipedia and Amazon and couldn't find anything... I definitely want to track down copies of those.  So glad you posted the Marianne Faithfull ""Scarborough Fair"" version. Hadn't heard it, and I'm definitely looking for some lesser known stuff.  Your above list is definitely in the vein of what I was looking for. I definitely like folk in the vein of Heron and Incredible String Band, but for some reason I was really struck by that song from Mad Men."
folk,370dof,RayLomas,1 point,Sun May 24 05:36:28 2015 UTC,"Glad that you like them! Actually Sandy Denny is one of my favourite artists.  Regarding songs - Fhir a' Bhàta is probably is a recording from a BBC (live?) session, almost certainly from 1966 or 1967. It was probably her first recording ever, and afaik it was never released.  Geordie is one of her early recordings (pre Fairport) - I think from 1967. It was forgotten for long, but lately it's been remastered and released on ""She Moves Through The Fair"" album. I'll brag a bit - I have a vinyl copy, and it all sounds incredible (especially Geordie and She Moves Through The Fair). Another similar release is ""19 Rupert Street"" - it's made from forgotten home recordings by Alex Campbell, I think from 1967 too. It's worth mentioning that this one has a first recorded version of her Who Knows Where The Time Goes - the quality (at least on vinyl) isn't great though - well, it was a home recording still...  Other her early recordings are ""It's Sandy Denny"" - but this one is mostly in the American/Country spirit, rather than medieval-folky. Another interesting one is her stuff recorded with The Strawbs - they released one album when she was their vocalist, before moving to Fairport...  Ok... enough on that. Heron / ISB is a different animal - I can't recommend anything, but I guess you know them a bit. If not, the whole Hangman's Beautiful Daughter and The Liquid Acrobat are a ""must listen"".   Other mediaevally sounding stuff that comes to my mind... Heaven Heath by Mellow Candle? Steeleye Span  Cam Ye O'er Frae France...?  Unfortunately I don't know about anything else equally good from Marianne Faithful - you can check whole North Country Maid album, but I didn't like it much honestly... later, sadly she took a different direction.  Jethro Tull had a lot of medieval influence, but calling some of this stuff folk would be a stretch. Maybe Velvet Green, Songs From The Wood...

Woah, that last one is a deep cut especially. I had no idea there was so much British folk that sounded like this in the late-'60s. I guess everyone who was pissed at Dylan decided to kick it up a notch. And then of course they went electric...  I especially like that Heaven Heath track. Listening to the demo of ""She Moves..."" now... Really awesome. Thanks for that recommendation. I'll look for that album."

folk,370dof,bstebs,1 point,Mon May 25 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well, electric folk bands sometimes border metal stuff. Sometimes, their songs could have been just called metal, if that was a thing in 1970s... Take for example, completely unknown Tom Of Bedlam by Trees. Some of these ""folk"" authors would release stuff that's impossible to classify at all - for example Stargazer by Shelagh McDonald... Incredible, incredible period - it upsets me that people who talk about folk think only about S&G and some other upbeet ""twee"" songs..."
folk,370dof,Pasta_With_Jam_Sauce,1 point,Tue May 26 08:27:20 2015 UTC,These are great. It seems to make a lot of sense to me somehow that folk would verge into metal like this. Especially in Britain.

I wonder if it's intentional, the song and video give the impression of a relationship, that was once full of excitement and potential, now turn stale. it could be a play off our Hollywood expectations, for there to be some climactic point before the end to bring it all home. to make the journey to that point meaningful, when often times we are left wanting, waiting for that cathartic moment that never came."

folk,32a0jm,mindokiller,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"I wanted to let you all know about my newest tribute project. I decided to create folk arrangements of my favorite death metal songs/artists. It’s called:  Guardians of Acoustigaard – A Celebration of Folk  By Annex Texas  Track List:  1)  Twilight of the Thunder God (by Amon Amarth)  2)  Battle Hymn (by Annex Texas)  3)  Guardians of Asgaard (by Amon Amarth)  4)  The Sadistic Motives Behind Bereavement Letters (by Arsis)  I’m posting this for two reasons. I’ll admit there is an element of shameless self promotion; I want people to hear this. However, a big part of this is coming from my desire to reach out to the artists who inspired me to make this. If Amon Amarth or Arsis has any problem with me uploading my covers of their songs, I would remove the songs if asked. That being said, I think it would be neat if they heard my folk versions of their songs. I thought it would be quite a challenge to arrange death metal songs in a folk style. It was more rewarding than it was challenging and I’m pretty happy with the results. I hope that anyone who finds this will listen and enjoy for themselves. Let me know what you think. As of this moment, the songs are unavailable for download. If it’s alright with the original songwriters/band/label whatever, I will make these songs available for download."

One of the things that I love about them is they are very interactive with the audience at their concerts, they pass out books of lyrics for people to follow along, invite questions & tell stories.  Brandi Carlile - NPR Tiny Desk - If you really want your heart to break, skip to 8:49, but the whole thing is worth listening to.  She tours with a full acoustic band - I've been lucky enough to see her twice - spot on every time.

I can find a lot of vague assertions online that the song is traditional (some of which tie it to Cecil Sharp's scholarly activity; this is nonsensical, as neither the poetry nor tune are anything he would have been cared to collect, much less publish) from folks clearly not in the know. Allan Brown's Inside the Wicker Man, which appears to be at least slightly reputable on the subject of the film (and is probably the source for Melvin's claim up-thread), writes that Giovanni ""manufactured"" the song [link] from an older piece, but is again short on details. From my own expertise, I can state that the tune is modern (turn-of-the-century music hall at earliest), and so is the poetry. I can't find a trace of it in the Ralph Vaughn Williams online collection, or in the Santa Barbara English Broadside Ballad Archive, or in the Bodleian's digital broadside collection, or in the Jack Horntip collection of bawdy songs or in any of the older texts it hosts.

Sarah Organ Gunning was a Kentucky (edited- thought it was WV) ballad singer who made a lot of great anti-mining songs.  There's a great 60's anti-vietnam ballad called ""Penny Evans.""  You might find Mexican ""narcorridos"" interesting...not strictly political or rebellious but they sort of glorify violence.

Anyway, there are lots of other anti-mining/pro-Union ballads singers from that area like Florence Reece, and ""Aunt"" Molly Jackson.  The Narcocorrido comes from a much broader tradition of the ""corrido"" (or Greater Mexican Corrido, as a broad category), which as you mentioned includes songs about the Mexican Revolution (Corridos revolucionarios) and bandits like Pancho Villa, as well as cultural heroes like Gregorio Corez and conflicts on the Border."

folk,2ym0b3,erodisi,2,Tue Mar 10 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool song!  makes me want to go camping or on a roadtrip.  There's definitely a high-frequency in everything overall (not much mid or bass).  I'm not sure if that's really a mixer or masterer's job but the high-end hiss is apparent and overall every take/track is pretty high-frequency. Dropping/tweaking EQ, low-pass filter and bringing out the bass/mids might even it out and get rid of a lot of hiss."
folk,2ym0b3,browsing_in_jail,2,Tue Mar 10 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I'd say about half of the hissing is the room he was in was noisy as hell, and the other half is my fault during the mixing."
folk,2ym0b3,browsing_in_jail,2,Tue Mar 10 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wall of text, but it's been a few years since I worked on recording so I'm remembering little notes I had forgotten, but it might help.  Thanks for letting me rant.  If you can't go back and re-record you have to work with what you have, and filtering can be a great way to turn a noisy original recording into something else.  Filters and EQ can help you ""hone-in"" on nasty/noisy frequencies and essentially mute them (or at least drop them to a level that isn't quite as jarring).  If you're using physical mixing equipment I'd suggest getting a software package that lets you really test out some fine-tuning.   One of the hardest lessons I learned was mixing/mastering on headphones that weren't flat-response.  What you hear isn't necessarily what other people will on a different stereo system.  Flat-response (monitor) headphones and speakers are pretty damn expensive though, so it's trial & error unless you have thousands upon thousands to get better equipment.   Here's a 5 year old test I recorded/mixed trying to get the mix of pan & bass/mid/treble figured out.  Volume suffered so you'll have to turn it up, but let me know if this makes sense:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cosxGfkGiVg&list=UUT_RuU3kz7MJeBGCjcKO7Dg&index=8 .  They're all live instruments on crappy equipment but I was able to get rid of hiss.    Overall, enjoy and keep tweaking!  I wish I still had all the software I used to, but the computer crashed last year and I'm back to square 1."

folk,2wzydl,secretsalad,7,Tue Feb 24 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from with that. It's not his traditional sound that people usually expect from him.  But if you follow the progression of his albums from the very beginning, the production increases with each album. Shallow Grave is bare-bones, the Wild Hunt has some double tracked guitar and some auxiliary banjo and piano, and There's No Leaving Now starts with ""To Just Grow Away"" that has some percussion, more layers of guitar, etc.  I agree it's not what I'm used to.

Sometimes, that gets gloomy - the Mustard's Retreat song ""Part of Me Remembers"" is about a divorce that doesn't feel fresh anymore but still hurts, for example - but sometimes it's the most delightful thing there is. ""Lock-Keeper,"" by Stan Rogers, reacts to the cliche of the sailor with a girl in every port by embracing and celebrating a sedentary married life; ""Hilda,"" by Si Kahn (recorded on Aragon Mill: the Bluegrass Sessions with the Looping Brothers) does a great job of presenting a man who just plain feels good about his love for his wife. ""For Me and My Gal"" is one of those songs I learned from my grandfather, and is all about getting married and how delightful it feels. And Great Big Sea do a great song called ""Sea of No Cares"" about how your friends might find your love corny, but to you when it's going on it subsumes everything else."

A beautiful soul and incredibly humble musician who travels around with a thick binder (that's an understatement) of positive and uplifting lyrics and poetry that he freely shares with all! I was lucky enough to capture some of his soul in a few videos when he organized an ""artists corner"" at a Mandala ceremony in my home city. The videos are posted on my Sound Library! Hope you enjoy! I have played his music on repeat for hours - because they do just that - uplift and make me happy! :) http://soundlibrary.synaesthetique.net/mandala-of-compassion-2014/"

He said that he had got some positive feedback and that some people asked for a social media page. Unfortunately the best I can offer right now is just a soundcloud page. Thanks again.
folk,2wwkxb,blazicekj,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"I wonder why this didn't get more attention. I probably wouldn't listen to most of these daily, but Setting Sun if pretty damn good. It has a Tallest Man on Earth feeling and the higher position very much suits your voice. The guitar is awesome too.  The rest of the songs sound too countryish for my tastes which I am not much of a fan of, but definitely not bad.  Thanks for sharing!"

I don't know why but I just can't get into their newer stuff as much as that raw acoustic sound they used to have.

folk,2vt07c,GreenyLFC,4,Fri Feb 13 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Apparently this is the one episode of Rainbow Quest that never aired on TV. The story goes that Pete Seeger wasn’t willing to let it go out, because he didn’t want to make Johnny Cash look bad by showing him wasted - but also because he wanted the show to show musicians as good role models, which obviously wouldn’t work here.  I’ve been trying to track down all of Rainbow Quest - there’s what’s on YouTube, but other than that only 8 episodes are in print on DVD. There was supposedly a VHS release of all of them in the 80s, but I can’t find a copy of it."
