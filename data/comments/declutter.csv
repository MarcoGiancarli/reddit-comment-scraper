declutter,3e5fra,BadLuckNovelist,-6,Wed Jul 22 02:53:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like recluttering to me homie
declutter,3e0ymp,ddashner,37,Tue Jul 21 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"I've found that with konmari that I've had to add a second criterion to my decluttering process, otherwise I'd also get rid of 99% of my stuff and then have to go out and buy more.     In addition to ""Does this item spark joy?"", I ask, ""If I got rid of this item or it otherwise went away (broken, stolen, whatever), would I replace it?""     This way I can declutter things like my overabundance of drinking glasses. I think I have one drinking glass that truly 'sparks joy' because it was a gift and has a logo on it that I particularly enjoy, and I enjoy the conversations it sparks when I am using it around guests. All others? Meh. They are just your basic liquid-holding devices. But if I got rid of them all, then I'd be in a pickle because I'd have no drinking glasses. So I get rid of just enough where I don't feel like I need to go out and immediately buy more because I don't have enough.     I find this covers the 'essentials': things you need but aren't 'joyful' without stretching the meaning of the word 'joy'. I don't find any joy in plungers. They are gross and using one is a gross experience. Sure, maybe plunging a clogged toilet is ""more joyful"" than not being able to unclog a toilet, but it's certainly not an experience I look forward to having on a daily basis, so stretching the word 'joy' to include plungers in any way doesn't work for me. However, if I got rid of my plunger, I'd certainly have to replace it, so it does not get decluttered as it's bucketed into my essentials lists.     Applying this criterion has another side benefit: it helps me look at the things that I think give me joy in a different light. That video game that's sitting on my shelf? Of course that gives me joy! I can't get rid of it! It was fantastic! It defined who I am as a gamer! It sparks discussion every time I show off my collection! It's fantastic! Would I buy it again if somebody stole it? Well ... no. I never play it anymore, I've already experienced it, and now it's just a manifestation and reminder of a good memory. It was a 'nice to have' but not 'essential' joyful item, so I don't stress about sticking it in the next garage sale box."

declutter,3e0ymp,KimberlyInOhio,6,Tue Jul 21 15:52:33 2015 UTC,I totally relate to your last paragraph and it's why I've been so skeptical to get the konmari book.  A fair bit of the stuff I was holding on to a 'love' but it just doesn't suit me or my lifestyle.
declutter,3e0ymp,shrinking-woman,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"I like the way you've laid this out. I tried the Konmari method, starting in the bathroom, and never made it further than the closet. It was fill of things that I actively disliked but didn't feel I could get rid of (eg plunger, tampons, cleaning supplies, etc.)."
declutter,3e0ymp,Aleriya,41,Wed Jul 22 01:04:52 2015 UTC,"I wish people would stop taking everything so goddamned literal. If you have something which is a key piece of wardrobe at the moment, the spark of joy is the realisation that you can wear it instead of going naked, staying in bed or having a wool sweater in sweating weather."
declutter,3e0ymp,emk2203,21,Tue Jul 21 09:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think she also said something like that in her AMA. That you should start appreciating objects for the necessary function they provide."
declutter,3e0ymp,peccorina,3,Tue Jul 21 12:01:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I feel that some people took a very straightforward concept and turned it into this new age-y, inner light thing. The Konmari Facebook groups a full of people who don't have time to read the book, yet talk endlessly about all of the oh so important ""joy sparkers"" they are keeping. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the original version of the book doesn't even use the Japanese word for joy to illustrate the author's keep/don't keep concept."
declutter,3e0ymp,Arietty,13,Wed Jul 22 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"Well maybe instead of choosing items that spark joy, you could try to determine the AMOUNT of clothes that would bring you most joy to have, if that makes sense. Like X number of things from each category, or one drawer of shirts, or whatever. Then  maybe knowing that you have a compact organized wardrobe with only things that are very useful will itself be a source of joy. I think her target reader is someone who struggles with having way too much stuff so it may not all apply."
declutter,3e0ymp,thesoundsyouknow,6,Tue Jul 21 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"Love Duluth! I didn't like most of my clothes either, so I slowly replaced them with things I do like, as my budget would allow. I don't think it's counterproductive. Now I love all my clothes, and they're a much better quality that will last for years because of their durability."
declutter,3e0ymp,541933,4,Tue Jul 21 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way with my husband's clothing. I got rid of a bunch of mine and my side of the closet is so neat and pleasing to look at but his is exploding with t shirts and shit he doesn't even wear, I've convinced him to get rid of some but he's still refusing to let go of much of it. Sigh! Along with all his old computers/parts and game consoles."
declutter,3e0ymp,LexiLucy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit counterproductive but my wife and I gave away close to 98% of our stuff, bought a new place, and we are using that as a vehicle to visit people who truly touch our lives and somehow incorporate the 'essence' of our relationships into the things we buy going forward.   This may be putting too much thought into it, but we want each item to truly have a story about the item.  We are still on this journey."
declutter,3e0ymp,linuxlearningnewbie,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:56 2015 UTC,that sounds amazing!
declutter,3e0ymp,goat_smuggla,3,Tue Jul 21 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"I interpret the phrase ""spark joy"" a little more open-endedly. For each item I look at, I just ask myself how it makes me feel, and see what emotions come forward.  If it's excitement, pleasure, joy, happiness, gratitude, or anything else positive, I keep it. My thermal longjohns don't ""spark joy,"" but they do spark gratitude for keeping me warm and cozy. No reason to get rid of those. But a lot of items just sparked ""meh."" To me, ""meh"" was something that took up more space than it was worth, something that's a chore to wash and dry and store. Meh had to go.  On the flip side, some things sparked joy but also sadness. My favorite coat from 7 years agos parked a thousand good memories and made me smile when I held it. But now it's pretty old and worn, and it's time to thank it for its service and let it go. I still love it. But love isn't enough."
declutter,3e0ymp,yeah_iloveit,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:23 2015 UTC,"I was just saying this the other day.  If I kept only things that spark joy I wouldn't have any clothes left.  I'm not much for fashion, I'm fairly utilitarian with my wardrobe.  My criteria to keep items became ""which clothes do I dislike less"", which has worked out better than I expected."
declutter,3e0ymp,stinkfut,9,Tue Jul 21 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"And yet if all your clothes were gone,  you would probably be a bit unhappy about having no clothes. I think fuctional items provide a different sort of joy than nonessential items. Sometimes for fuctional items it's easier to ask ""would losing this item would take away joy?"" If yes, then keep it."

declutter,3e0ymp,lilfunky1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think you need a personal stylist or personal shopper or do lots of Google searches (my approach as I also didn't have the means). I know you said you don't have the means or desire to do it, but when you know what your body type is, what colors look good on you, which types of clothes look good on you, etc, it makes a HUGE difference. I've learned this through trial and error (and $$$) and although I still have some items in my closet that don't bring me absolute joy, I think I can say that 40% looks great on me and makes me feel stylish."
declutter,3e0ymp,goat_smuggla,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"For clothes, if you can manage it, mark them somehow (like turning hangers backward, or place in a box) and when you wear it, mark that (turn hanger right way around, or remove from box) to see what actually gets used.  If you don't wear it, pitch it.  (Special occasion dresses and stuff like that is a different story, but for your everyday clothes, it can be helpful)"
declutter,3e0ymp,FreyjaSunshine,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"""joy"" should not be the only indicator to keep an item. You need clothes, you don't dislike them, so keep them."
declutter,3e0ymp,Mysterious_X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"I do wonder if ""spark joy"" is one of those terms that doesn't fully translate. The term ""sparking joy"" evokes that magic feeling you get with something you truly love and are attached to, so when she's telling you only to keep things that truly spark joy it's pretty intimidating. Really it also includes things you simply appreciate. My raggedy old jogging bottoms aren't sparking any joy, but I appreciate having them as my warm PJs.   So long as they aren't sparking ""anti-joy"", for example items you don't like but feel obligated to keep, and you use appreciate them and use them then sometimes that's what ""sparking joy"" is.   I'd really recommend continuing with the whole process. Don't cull too much if you're uncertain now, because as you progress onto the other sections you'll get a much stronger feeling for this and be able to re-assess the things you were unsure about with confidence!  As Kondo mentions, the best way to get others to de-clutter is to do your own stuff. I'm only just onto papers, and without me saying anything my brother and mum have separately appeared with bags for the charity shop/bin :)"

declutter,3e0gcl,cLaunnn,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"One clothing decluttering strategy is to optimize for outfits.  So maybe you look at your pants first and decide that you have 5 pairs of pants that fit well and are in good repair.  Get rid of all of your other pants.  Now look at your tops.  Only keep the tops that actually go with one of your pairs of pants.  And then only keep the accessories that go best with your established outfits.    Also, with clothing you could break it down into categories.  Maybe you have 15 dressy tops and only really need 7.  So compare the five black dressy tops and keep the 2 best ones.    A good metric for the other stuff is: how hard will this be to replace?  There is a lot of cheap used furniture out there.  Most cords and gadgets are readily available and not that expensive.  If you aren't using it now and it wouldn't be hard to replace it, don't move it.    Try to use up as much food as possible before moving. You should be able to eat down most of your stash in a month."

So the new treasures I discovered found them self tucked away in the garage.   Then I couldn't get to the garage items because of clutter.   I'd want to downsize.  But each individual item I picked up my brain would tell me ""but what if I need this?""       I had an epiphany one day:   I don't own my stuff.  My stuff owns me.   I spend so much time and energy dusting, sorting, searching for, and tripping over stuff.    Enough is enough!   Now I still grab freebies.   But anytime I bring something home, something else has to leave.    Selling online has been great and the little stuff is donated to a charity."

My parents overreacted; my mother threw my possessions she deemed unworthy away, which I would then dig out the trash, and if she found she would light on fire, and my father would tearfully try to clean my room with me, until he realized I was afraid to throw things away. (Parents are divorced). Then he would wait till I left for my moms and ""clean"" my room (throw things away that were reasonable like trash, things I didn't remember I owned, etc.). I got to high school and saw why they acted how they did, and kind of shut down. I didn't get a bunch of more stuff, but I refused to throw anything away because of its  ""sentimental value"". Moving became a pain. Cleaning too. I met my SO and moved in with him to our tiny room and he helped me get through throwing things away. If it had no real value, give away. I could give things away, but throwing things away made me freak out, so he helped me find homes for things, and eventually helped me realize the trash is the home for some things.

A hoarder is much more likely to feel betrayed, at risk, threatened, tearful, and/or angry than a non-hoarder might. This might cause emotional harm to them and harm to your relationship with them.  Not that mitigating the hoarding problem might not be worth it, nor that a ""medium"" hoarder might be on a good day when they find out and not be too upset.

His only notable progress was several years ago when he successfully got rid of all CRT monitors/devices in the house, but again, that's just not good enough).  Within the next 10 years, all of his children will be moved out and it might be impossible or very risky for someone his age to climb up ladders to continually reach those boxes of useless crap and ""clean up"" the house. As mentioned, there are also no cleanup crews or whatever (maybe aside from some foreign workers they hire on the cheap to dismantle your house when it's time to renovate - even those don't do ""cleaning up"").

Not saying it's morally right (I'd be pissed if someone was secretly throwing out my stuff) but in practice it's probably not going to come up."
declutter,3dpmrn,GetMeTheJohnsonFile,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:45 2015 UTC,"A hoarder is much more likely to feel betrayed, at risk, threatened, tearful, and/or angry than a non-hoarder might.   I'd feel that way because someone threw away my stuff. Sure, OP's likely getting rid of actual junk and clutter, but they're likely getting rid of things that aren't.  OP needs to talk to their parents and make sure it's okay to throw things away.  Marie Kondo has a good chapter about this method in her book. OP may think they're helping, but they're really not."
declutter,3dpmrn,DaddyD68,22,Sun Jul 19 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"So you mention psychology, as perhaps Americans know it, doesn't really touch on this subject where you're from, so I'll just add my two cents as somebody from the American Psychology world. 'Forced unclutterings' are by and large unsuccessful in the long term. Think of it as a diet--it might help you short term, but if it is extreme, it is impossible to maintain. Many people with hoarding tendencies might be dealing with a form of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and/or have some large trauma in their lives that manifested the behavior. That's not going to go away just because you throw some of their stuff away. I wish you luck regardless!"
declutter,3dpmrn,temp4adhd,35,Sat Jul 18 06:42:54 2015 UTC,"as the husband of a hoarder, I am really torn on this. I am well aware of the distress it causes the hoarder. I cant even clean anymore without a massive amount of drama and stress.  But constantly tiptoeing around the hoarders needs is also distressing to everyone else in the house. We are forced to live in a depressing environment, cant have our own comfort zones or needs met, and are confronted with emotional terror. Its an incredibly one sided situation, and feels like it is bordering on narcissism.  Why are our needs less valuable than the one individual causing the problem. And it causes issues wether we clean or not. Dont do it and the hoarder feels left alone with the mess and put upon, do it and face stress and emotional terror.  Hoarding reminds me a lot of the emotional abuse I was subjected to as a kid (and yes, the codependency issues I was made aware of then seem to apply now) as a matter of fact, if the same arguments were made for alchoholics, people would call this concern for the hoarder enabling."
declutter,3dpmrn,GetMeTheJohnsonFile,11,Sat Jul 18 11:20:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing this. You have expressed my emotions and thoughts. As we continue on our 40-day declutter plan, it's been an emotional roller coaster and not just for him. For ME! I am experiencing a lot of long pent-up anger. I've typed out lengthly angry vents to post here, only to delete them without posting.  I have even called my beloved hoarder a narcissist, for believing that his hoarding is somehow singlehandedly saving the planet.   His parents were alcoholics. He believes that his hoarding began way back in childhood, when his dad was away in the army, and he was left with his mom and siblings. His mom was not just alcoholic but also schizophrenic, and he recalls being left to scrounge in the trash for food for himself (at age of 5 or 6) and younger siblings.  When he and I first started dating I knew he was codependent type because of all his issues, and I could feel him tugging me into a codependent dance. So I had him read Codependent No More and it made him cry, because it was so on the mark for him. We've been working together ever since and call ourselves ""Codependents in Recovery.""   I guess I could say that the silver lining is that I know his hoarding could be a lot, lot worse. But his improvements over the years have come at my expense. It's been exhausting. Even though I don't have to necessarily tip-toe around him and if he starts in on emotional terror (as you put it) I can confront him, get him to be conscious of it, and shut that down. Still it's exhausting."
declutter,3dpmrn,DaddyD68,4,Sat Jul 18 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, I in no way mean to imply that the needs of somebody should necessarily come before the needs of somebody else, nor would I suggest ignoring the problem (or as you say, enabling). I was just trying to shed some light on why this specifically might not be a successful tactic for the long haul. I'm sorry to hear about your husband, and the position his hoarding puts you in. It sounds like you have identified some co-dependency issues, which is an awesome first step for your own peace of mind. As a counselor and somebody who has struggled with depression and anxiety, I'm a firm believer that EVERYBODY should have a therapist, or at least some neutral third-party to speak to. I wish you and your husband the best."

declutter,3dpmrn,vulchiegoodness,4,Sat Jul 18 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU for this. I see way too much advice that gives far too much consideration to the hoarder and their feelings. I feel the real victims here are the people who have to live with the hoarder - I feel like the social development, people skills and general health of me, my siblings and mum have all been stunted thanks to living with this hoarder.  None of us have EVER had friends/classmates over due to the embarrassing state of the house, and people tend to get all sensitive and think we're an unfriendly bunch, because what sort of friend doesn't have others over, right?"
declutter,3dpmrn,vulchiegoodness,3,Sun Jul 19 10:57:40 2015 UTC,"Hi.  Moderator over at /r/hoarding here.  One of the mods here at /r/declutter mentioned that there had been a handful of hoarding-related threads recently, so I hope you don't mind me popping in to check them out.  DaddyD68, you've articulated beautifully the dilemma that the family members and friends of hoarders find themselves in.  I think for a lot of CoH (and Spouses of H, and Families of H, and even Friends/Roommates of H), part of our struggle is that so much concern has to be shown to the hoarder. To be very blunt, we've been victimized, sometimes for decades, by our hoarders, but rarely is that considered in the advice given for helping hoarders.  In my admittedly-limited experience, CoH/etc. have usually been:   manipulated and/or bullied by their hoarder so the hoarder can get his way shamed/guilted for not valuing the hoard the way the hoarder does pressured to keep the hoard secret emotionally and physically neglected by the hoarder blamed for everything that doesn't go right in the hoarder's life--including the hoard informed--directly or indirectly--that the hoard is more important than ANYTHING.  INCLUDING THEM.   In order to recover from compulsive hoarding disorder, the psychiatric research is telling us (so far, at least) that the hoarder to have a clean-up done in a manner that acknowledges his issues. That usually means an extremely slow clean-out as the hoarder works through his anxiety, recognizes and abandons his disordered thinking, develops new coping skills, works on his control issues, and so forth.  But!  In order to begin their own healing process, most loved ones of hoarders need the exact opposite solution: to have the hoard cleaned up immediately, so we can reclaim our physical and emotional freedom.  Being told that we have be patient yet again while the hoarder's issues are addressed, and that we have to yet again think about our hoarder's emotional needs--when for years the hoarder has pressured/manipulated/forced/bullied us into doing exactly that....  Eventually, at some level, you're going to think ""The hoarder has to come first again? Really? What about me?  Don't I count?""  Most family members have experienced the ""drama and stress"" from the hoarder telling us over and over again that we aren't properly considering what THEY want.  Then when we reach out for help, we hear from both the hoarder AND therapists: your needs don't matter, consider the hoarder, adjust to the illness, accommodate the illness, don't violate this set of rules related to the illness, and in case you forgot, your needs DON'T matter.  I acknowledge that what I'm about to write is an extreme analogy, but to me that's like saying to someone's who's been raped, ""Please understand that the person who raped you is mentally ill and didn't mean to do it; please be patient and be willing to work with him so we can help him recover and not rape anymore.  Oh, and during his recovery, he may rape you a few more times; don't worry, it's part of his recovery."" That very well may be the right way to proceed in order to help the rapist, but that doesn't really help the person who's been raped, does it?  Our needs matter.  We have the right to assert them.  We're not obligated to spend our lives perpetually adjusting to and accommodating the unreasonable demands of a mentally ill person.  We don't need any more voices telling us that we're wrong for demanding--or even forcing--a healthier living environment.  I appreciate that confrontation/intervention/forced clean-up is not the recommended protocol for actually 'treating' hoarders, but that protocol also has absolutely nothing to do with providing support for the loved ones stuck living with one.  IMO, the actual answer is: YOU have rights, too. You don't have be a doormat, and depending on the level of illness your hoarder is suffering from, he/she may or may not be able to live with whatever boundaries you must set. However, you have the right to protect yourSELF first, and consider your own basic needs first. This is legitimate.  You're not a cruel and insensitive person for thinking this way, and you're NOT required to spend your life walking on eggshells and living in a dump just because someone throws tantrums at the thought of anything different.  I personally believe that letting the loved ones of hoarders know that it's okay to say no, to establish boundaries, to say ""I live here, too"" is critical. And I think letting the hoarder know ""Your decisions and actions cause great pain to your loved ones, the kind of pain that many people would classify as abusive"" has got to be part of the hoarder's recovery.  All that said: sometimes the only answer left is to give up on continuing to have that hoarder in your life. It's profoundly unfair, especially when you're also paying on a mortgage, or contributing to rent, or trying to raise children. But mental illness don't give a damn about being fair, so ultimately you've got to do what you've got to do to take care of yourself.  Thanks for letting me rant."
declutter,3dpmrn,temp4adhd,12,Tue Jul 21 18:59:36 2015 UTC,"I am aware of that forced uncluttering is usually ineffective. I still think it is the best approach for my situation, however. My goal isn't to make him stop hoarding, it's to reduce cleaning up in the future by cleaning up now. Within the next 10 years, his age will make it impossible or very risky to be climbing ladders to 'clean up' his stuff and moving heavy boxes of junk around. That makes me the top (and maybe only) candidate to sort and organize his junk.  There's a lot of stuff that WE value buried in HIS crap - I've found money, old childhood photos/toys/items, my mum's stuff, basically stuff that isn't his that he's packed into the boxes that contain his trash.  Right now, I'm not mercilessly uncluttering his junk. A huge amount of the time spent 'cleaning' involves me checking the recency and usefulness of items. I'm not tossing anything 'recent' of his (within the past 5 years) - I'll deal with it when the time comes. But there's a massive number of items from 10-30 years ago that just need to go that he will never miss/need ever - those multiple 286-era computer parts and pieces, floppy disk readers the size of bricks, ""extra"" CD organizers he bought that are now basically broken plastic containers, etc."

And exactly why I have to covertly toss out the crap. For my case, he's already spent hundreds of hours in the past 2 decades ""cleaning up"" - which to a normal person, is really him just sorting and re-sorting his crap in boxes while tossing out the minimal number of items."

declutter,3dpmrn,tekvenus,8,Sun Jul 19 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"First, I completely relate to everything you wrote. Your father's preferred hoarding items and the reasons behind them are very similar to my husband's.    My goal isn't to make him stop hoarding, it's to reduce cleaning up in the future by cleaning up now.   Reality is that when you clear space, it inevitably fills up again with something else.    That makes me the top (and maybe only) candidate to sort and organize his junk.   Yeah, sadly, whether you chip away at this now or you wait until your dad passes, clean up is going to fall all on your shoulders.    There's a lot of stuff that WE value buried in HIS crap   Our situation isn't quite that bad (valuable items mixed in with crap), but I know there are boxes of my stuff, stuff I valued, long buried deep somewhere in the basement and totally inaccessible to me.    those multiple 286-era computer parts and pieces, floppy disk readers the size of bricks, ""extra"" CD organizers he bought that are now basically broken plastic containers, etc   Yep. In this week's decluttering, I found no less than 5 laptops, and a zillion CDs."

declutter,3dpmrn,grandoverlord,15,Sun Jul 19 08:34:18 2015 UTC,"Fuck everyone and their perceived legality/morality of your solution. Bottom line, and I totally get it because I'm in the same boat, is that one day someone is going to have to clean up anyway. Getting to it a little bit at a time is mitigating more dangerous pile-ups and allowing you time to go through stuff but without the emotional attachment disorder of a hoarder. If your dad questions where something is you just feign ignorance. Why would you know? It isn't yours. But I bet he hasn't asked you about anything substantial yet.    My grandfather used to flip out when I threw away old containers, like the ones that hold butter. Damn things were everywhere. Never had a matching lid, just shoved into cabinets all over the damned place. I'd periodically go get some $10 set somewhere, chuck all the old ones and tell him I put them ""in the garage."" That freakin garage in his head must be a Tardis."
declutter,3dpmrn,temp4adhd,3,Sat Jul 18 09:51:12 2015 UTC,"Also, one of the biggest 'breakthroughs' is he now works a job with a reduced chance of 'collecting' items. Most of the junk in the house are from a certain period of time, where his employer/job was basically an 'enabler' for his hoarding behavior - the company moved twice in a decade and both times, they said ""fuck it"" to moving their furniture/equipment, and told everyone they could bring home anything they wanted because the company would be getting new EVERYTHING after moving to their new office. Guess what happened?  He still does horde things like receipts, condiments from eateries, freebies (like plastic figures or bowls) from buying stuff at the store, etc but I don't really mind those because those will be a LOT easier to deal with compared to bulky items like fixtures and office equipment."
declutter,3dpmrn,jelliknight,15,Sat Jul 18 08:36:31 2015 UTC,And if you find a container of them just chuck 'em. Tell him you consolidated all of it. I told my grandfather I emptied 300 ketchup packets into a bottle. He was thrilled.

With the limited interactions I've had with hoarders, this also seems to be a contributing factor--access to junk. However, as you've personally seen, just because they lack access to one specific item doesn't mean they won't soon collect other items! You gotta do what you gotta do. As I said in another comment, I in no way meant to imply that his needs are greater than yours, nor visa-versa. I was just trying to shed some light on why this might not be effective in the long haul, and can in fact make many hoarders ""double-down"" on their habits. I would suggest getting counseling together, or if he won't join, seeking out a counselor for yourself. If nothing else, they might have some valuable resources for you and your family."
declutter,3dpmrn,temp4adhd,15,Sat Jul 18 13:21:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a tidying coach and I have some clients where i have to use the quiet cleanup tactic.

[with the dozens of other ones that are now growing stuff in them]"" and I say ""sure!"" then take a couple of boxes of the nastier bottles out to my car and leave the rest.  They say ""would you like these purple throws?"" and I say ""thank you, i know just the place for this!"" and happily take it away (then drop it at the opshop on my way home.  Most clients I'm 100% honest and ok every throwaway, but hoarders you need a level of deception the ""quiet cleanup tactic"" requires because otherwise they just wouldn't get anywhere.

declutter,3dpmrn,hamster_sword,6,Sat Jul 18 06:30:52 2015 UTC,"I'm finding my hoarder needs a measure of control over how items are disposed. So it's working okay with me bagging/boxing things up, then it's up to him to take them out of the house and determine what happens next.   He gets to sort through the items I've earmarked for trash, and figure out which go in the recycling bin.  For two weeks, he's been putting boxes on the curb for free cycle, then what doesn't get claimed by other fellow hoarders gets picked up by the trash.   Other items he's carted to work to give to colleagues.  I've agreed he could set aside items for a weekly yard sale. He's in the midst of one right now. I told him that was fine with me and whatever small $ he makes are his to keep--  but I was not going to help run the sale.   For 15 years we managed with me setting the rules: keep the main areas and our bedroom clear of crap. I gave over the basement and a guest bedroom for his hoarding, learned to shut the door and not complain. That worked rather well until life stress hit and I lost some control because I just didn't have time or energy to keep on top of what was sneaking into the cabinets and closets. You could walk into our house and the main areas still looked fairly okay -- unless you opened a cabinet or closet, and then things came tumbling down! Then things got even more out of control because I couldn't put away the dishes or laundry or get to the file cabinet to file paperwork.  So new clutter piles -- this time my own-- began to collect in the main areas.  And cleaning became more and more of a hassle so I did it less and less.   He likes to turn this around on me: ""It's not just my mess -- you've gotten lazy and slacked off in the past years."" I can tell you exactly what year things started sliding: 2009. How do I know that was the year?? When I cleaned up the office this week, the files in the file cabinet went no later than 2009. Then on top of the office desk and all around the room were piles and piles of paperwork from 2009 to date, which were never filed. Why? Because there was so much crap in the room that I couldn't access the file cabinet!!!  I used to have a great system, too, which would make it easy to know when it was time to toss out papers and such. It worked great from 2002 until 2009.  Sigh."

I understand your stress. I like to have things very well organised and my husband is much less so. Mess stresses me out, even just having the pots and pans cupboard disorganised (since we moved the new kitchen is really awkward and there just isn't really a good way to organise it it) so things come clanging out when I try to cook is constantly irritating - and that's just one cupboard. I can't imagine having every cupboard and closet in the house booby trapped with junk. I'd go mental!   I think your husband needs to step the fuck up. It's not about being a hoarder, it's about being a goddamn adult. HE needs to deal with HIS issues, and not make them your problem. If he needs a counsellor to help him go through his things, HE should go and find and hire one. His issue is causing problems for both of you. You can and should be supportive but he needs to be the one driving the bus to recovery."
declutter,3dpmrn,hamster_sword,6,Sun Jul 19 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"I hear you but it's more complicated than that.   My first marriage ended because my husband was basically never around. He traveled Monday through Friday. Saturday was golf day. Sunday was lawn day. Not much time to have a marriage. I had two little kids I was essentially raising on my own.   There was this elderly man, probably 70s, who lived around the corner. He was a major hoarder. Tiny ranch house, lawn overgrown, covered in hoards of crap, you knew the inside was even worse. Hushed whispers about his hoarding issues. What an eyesore, in this neighborhood of recently built McMansions.   This man was known all around town because he'd walk everywhere, with a cane that had rubber bands holding receipts, ticket stubs, paper labels, coupons, scratch tickets, and other tiny bits of trash he found on his travels. The stench would precede him as he never showered and probably dumpster dived.  I'd be playing with my toddlers outside on the manicured lawn, and he'd come ambling down our sidewalk, with his cane of trash. Every day. He'd stop and chat with me. And I was so lonely. So we'd chat. He was more interesting to me than my other neighbors, who just wanted to talk about their manicured lawns. He never once left the sidewalk, never came into our McMansion yard, never once crossed any boundaries, never made me feel threatened.   Nevertheless, neighbors would deride me for talking to him. I just saw a friendly stinky quirky man.  My house backed up into a woods, in the Fall without leaves there was a straight line to his house.   One day he came ambling by and he said to me   ""You need to get some blinds. I can see right into your kitchen.""  Did creep me out. But he still never entered my manicured lawn. He was respectful. He said, ""I know when your husband isn't home. You should get blinds on the garage too, because I can see when his car isn't there. Others could too.""  I told my husband. He said he was too busy to put up blinds. I said, I'll put them up. He said, I don't want you using my power tools.  Hoarding neighbor comes by again, says ""why haven't you put up the blinds."" I say, ""my husband won't let me use his power tools and he's hidden them from me.""  I haven't thought about this in years and years. I shared this with my hubby tonight. I think this goes really deep for me. That first marriage was awful. I think that hoarding neighbor was the only one looking out for me, and who made me feel safe. Everyone in our neighborhood had their guard up but the guy was totally harmless, just a hoarder. I knew if anything ever happened, I could flee with my toddlers through the woods and to his place. Because he was the only person back then looking out for me.   Hoarding is not the worst thing a person can do."
declutter,3dpmrn,khattify,8,Sun Jul 19 05:33:08 2015 UTC,"I was one of those hoarders who would have noticed eventually if someone was taking or rearranging my stuff. That would not have gone well. I can't say what's best for you, especially if hoarding has a very different cultural context where your parents live, but it seems like you may be taking a risk with your dad's temper. And what happens if he starts getting more stuff to fill in the space you've freed up for him?"
declutter,3dpmrn,khattify,6,Sat Jul 18 07:55:23 2015 UTC,"I've taken that into consideration but I do think you bring up a very interesting thing (culture) and maybe as an ex-hoarder, you might understand better and/or find it interesting as well. Most people hoard here because they're taught not to ""waste"". Even in schools, kids are taught that you don't really have to ""recycle"" items if you can ""reuse"" them and it really goes overboard to the extent that some of the 'reuse' logic is bullshit that may only be practical to someone like (not to be mean) a peasant in Africa or a remote island living in total poverty and who's never seen a proper plastic container in their life. Like using toothpaste boxes as pencil cases, or putting together a variety of cereal boxes and displaying it as ""art"". Sorry it's not art or creative or pretty, it's CRAP. And they teach this in schools.  Also, World War II was barely 2-3 generations ago, so a lot of people still think they're living in poverty or times where they would suddenly have their access to daily supplies revoked. Anyway, I suspect most people here nowadays hoard out of habit, conditioning from school/the previous generation and because ""everyone else does it"", less underlying psychological issues and such that's common in developed countries.  My dad is really a small-time hoarder/pack-rat for most part who would collect receipts and small items. Most of the junk (particularly the bulky items like printers and computer parts) in the house comes from a specific time period where his job was an enabler for his hoarding (this was when he temporarily turned into big-time hoarder). The company moved twice in a decade and both times, they said ""fuck it"" to moving their furniture/equipment, and told everyone they could bring home anything they wanted because the company would be getting new EVERYTHING after moving to their new office. Guess what happened?  His reasoning for hoarding is basically in-line with the local ""way of thinking"" - if it's free, it should be taken, otherwise the person who was given the opportunity be losing out somehow and regret it later. In those years, we end up with a lot of 'bulky junk' (that takes up room), a lot of which ended up not being used at all anyway, like that marquee scrolling LED signboard (why?!). I doubt he'll be missing the various Pentium II machines, bits of what used to be a toaster/washing machine/coffee maker, etc anytime soon."

My grandmother grew up in the US during the depression. She was a hoarder (though not quite as bad as most) holding on to every bit of trash ""just in case"" or reusing it and yes making art out of it. My mother grew up adopting these practices as well. Nothing went to waste in our household. She was less of a hoarder than my grandmother though, but still, looking back, she was just a more ""organized"" hoarder and kept the house spotless. But I remember my mom and dad arguing a lot, because my mom loved her ""freebies"" and at that point my dad was making lots of money, and was trying to get her to part with the freebies and instead buy new because we could afford to. I also remember it was my dad who was instrumental in driving the ""big clean up's"" throughout my childhood -- not my mom. Hmm. Wow. Hadn't thought about it that way until just now!  My great uncle was even more of a hoarder and it was on my mother's shoulders to clean out his house once he passed. His house was extreme hoarding -- we're talking feces and safety hazards. My mom went through a positive shift at that time, and got her own act more or less under control.  Meanwhile my husband's motto is ""if it's free, it's for me!"""

Its always frustrating to me but at some point I realized I was powerless and they would always be sick, always bringing more trash home. I try to show my support but unfortunately no amount of cleaning can repair the neurological need to collect stuff for comfort."

They were just decorative in bookshelf.   I secretly donated his books to schools. And there was one last set of books. I thought, he didnt realise until now, he might not realise this one too. When the last one went, the bookshelf looked so empty that, he questioned where the books are and reacted very emotionally.   I shouldn't have given the last one. The last set of books should have stayed. I think you should slow down before he realises."

It's kind of controlled in the house. However he has 2 garages and we have 2 sheds. The majority is filled with stuff he's picked up from garage sales. Last I counted he had 12 push mowers. He fixes them up and tries to sell them. We haven't had a single garage sale all year. We normally do. Anyways... he hoards vehicles too. Thinks he's going to fix em up. He's old. It's not happening. I dread when he dies what we have to do with all this stuff.  I digress. I started deciding to do quiet purging of his stuff. Things I know he hasn't touched or cares about. I'm really slow with this because sometimes I'm unsure if we'll need it or not. Also getting access and time to go through the cluttered areas without him being there is hard.   But congrats on the quiet cleaning. I wonder when your folks will start noticing."

declutter,3dpmrn,cleanedge,3,Sat Jul 18 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Few people have suggested it for several reasons. First, if the hoarder is like mine, they just keep acquiring. Taking out small bits doesn't do anything - even a trunk load, which to be honest, I'm not sure how you extract it from the house unnoticed, would not be a drop in the bucket unless they stopped collecting.   So for you, this works because your dad isn't collecting as much as he was. But you asked why more people don't suggest it- that's why.

It's one of those situations where the there truly is no right answer.  Whose needs get prioritized?  Does everyone else in the household just have to tip toe around the hoarder who is both mentally and physically filling every last inch of space in the home, crowding out everyone else's needs?  I also went about decluttering my dad's place while I was living with him.  He was good though and didn't fight me too much on it but he did always refill the spaces and they'd need to be decluttered again in a week or two.  I found it really helpful to identify communal spaces and clarify that I need these areas clear so I can live.  In my house the big struggle was over the kitchen table: I would appreciate if we could keep the kitchen table clear so that I have space to prepare my meals, eat, and do my homework.  It didn't work but I did manage to keep a few key places somewhat usable while I was living there.  I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the children and spouses of hoarders just said NO!  NO MORE!  And set some strict boundaries.  Occasionally I wonder what will happen if my dad dies suddenly or worse, becomes infirmed and I have to deal with his hoard that has been allowed to grow unchecked.  I know it will become my burden eventually."

I was a little kid back then and present at the time. I still remember).  With all due respect, if you read the rest of the paragraph from where you saw ""abusive/batshit crazy"", you'd also realize why none of what you said really matters in this ""jurisdiction"". Maybe in America or Australia or Firstworldlandia it matters, but if we were living there,  we wouldn't have this problem to begin with, would be?

The best way to approach is to store it digitally in silos.  e.g. 1. I put photos that I take for other people on Facebook into albums. Permissions set accordingly. 2. Personal photos go into Google Drive. 3. Office files and etc also go into Google Drive.  The main thing is to aggregate it all into one spot first. It was much easier for me to just get rid of all CD and physical content - since cloud access is easier. Then 'de-dupe' as necessary. I had like 40 different versions of my resume for example, which was reduced to 3.  Music used to be a big thing for me. But I personally chose to just dump it all. With so many streaming services, and Youtube, it just didn't seem worth the hassle to hold onto. YMMV.  When recycling older laptops - be sure to pull the hard-drive out. Your company may have a secure destruction service for the HD. I usually take it apart myself - and use the magnets for odds and ends."

declutter,3dfs36,khattify,4,Thu Jul 16 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"A few things I've found helpful in reducing digital clutter:   Make an organizational system that is easy to maintain and suits your needs, and don't put off putting newly created/downloaded files in an appropriate location. I used to have folders called ""New downloads"" which remained unsorted for years and I eventually forgot what was in them. That later becomes boring and time-consuming to sort. It's much better to immediately decide where the new file belongs and what the file/folder should be called. It saves you time and work later on. I have a lot of photos, and I give all folders detailed names (ex: ""2015-07-16 LOCATION (Jane & John Doe's wedding)"") so that I don't have to waste time searching for what I want to find. A duplicate file finder program to clean out duplicate files. I use Duplicate Cleaner, which is available both in a free and paid version. The free one works well enough for most things. I used to keep backups on CD, but some later turned out to be unreadable. They also took up a lot of space on the shelf. So I transferred all backups to external HDs. It's hugely important to have a good backup system; I learned this the hard way when my main HD died and I lost a lot of irreplaceable files, including photos of deceased family members. Now I use two external HDs for backups, and use backup programs to regularly back up all the important stuff. You can set it to back up all files once a day, week, month or whatever suits you best. Don't repeat my mistake and put off making a good backup system until it's too late."

Go through the main living areas:   donate bin sell bin (could merge this with donate) garbage bin recycling bin (include specialty like electronics and old batteries) not sure yet/have to ask bin   Tips for what to look for:   with the kitchen, get rid of doubles living room has too many knick knacks? Slim down to favorites front door area, any shoe/coat doubles or no longer fits/stylish bathroom, make a bin for extra shampoo, toothpaste, brushes, floss, etc. only one or each/per person is needed out at once. When you run out, you check the bin before you buy. Get rid of any subscriptions to physical magazines/newspapers if you have a lot of little tables everywhere, then you'll have a lot of places to lay random crap down. Get rid of some of them!     Get each child to go through their rooms with those same bins. Say something like if you get rid of 20 things, you get ice cream.  Have a locked chest for when things are laying around the house unclaimed.  If the kid never notices, great, they don't need it.  If they do, they have to complete a chore to get it back.   Don't go shopping as something to do when you are bored, this is how you acquire random shit you don't need.  You can then use the tubs as your moving boxes :)"

If they haven't asked for it after a few months, out it goes.  OP's older kids might be too old for this trick, but your suggestion is great; it's a consequence of not cleaning up after themselves."

OP, I think you need to start with your own stuff and be ruthless. From my experience, that tends to have a domino effect in kick starting others around you to do the same.   I also worry for you that you are going to clean up, move to a bigger space and then fill it up again. You will just have even more room to clutter the next time. It's kind of like yo-yo dieting vs. a lifestyle change. Master what you have before you even think about upsizing! That's just my two cents though."

Then family can take a look. Then I dust the cabinet, and put the keep's back in it, hubby removes the trash, and free cycles the donates. Or I just pick a theme for the day. Today is ""old smelly & outgrown shoe day."" We are going through all the shoes in the house. Tomorrow we'll go through all the books.   Looks like we will not be renting a dumpster after all.

Pretty much everything else left is a book that wasn't good enough to pass along to someone else. That's the reality of my bookshelf! I rarely re-read fiction, and if it's a novel that amazed me, I send it along to my closest friends or family, and instruct them to pass it along to someone else once they're finished reading it.   You know how they say you can tell a person by the titles on their book shelf? Please don't ever do that with my bookshelf. Because most of what remains is the stuff I thought was total crap.   My 21F has a huge book collection which I'm not touching. But she's good at culling her own collection, and she lovingly organizes them (alphabetically by author), and dusts them. She also re-reads frequently. So I'm hands off her book collection -- but it doesn't look like clutter. It looks like a hobby, her number 1 hobby."

I know a number of goodwill stores in my area that take books and also school libraries (elementary through university) who will accept fiction and nonfiction as long as the material's appropriate for them and in good condition.   You should also check with your local library beforehand anyway - even if they don't want to take on your books, they should, (ideally, anyway) have leads or connections to community/national/international literacy groups and other organizations that may be interested."

Then I went through my ""not sure"" pile again.   I limited myself to a certain section of my shelving and only allowed myself to fill that area with books. Anything that didn't make the cut was moved to the ""pass on"" pile. Last step was to scan all of the books with bookscouter (app for your phone) and separate into piles by which website would buy them. Anything that wasn't sellable went into boxes for yard sale."

Use that timer for 20/10s or whatever (work 20 minutes, chill 10 minutes, etc.).

I highly recommend Flylady for you. Konmari is good too, I know it's the ""in"" thing right now, but Flylady sounds to me right about where  you are at now. No time for origami folding your shirts, and expressing joy for things you choose to keep. Flylady is a lower bar, but instills routines, which start with decluttering and some cleaning tasks. More decluttering than cleaning until your house is decluttered enough to make the cleaning worth your time. By then, you've got it down to a routine. Flylady also gives you gentle tactics and attitude adjustments about how to deal with the SO -- whether he's in on this with you, or not."

""Flywashing"" and all that. I might fall off the ""flywagon"" but when I pick back up the routines she taught me over time are still deeply ingrained.  Shiny sink, swish & swipe, weekly home blessing, weekly zone cleaning... and most of all, no need for perfection. For example it's fine if you vacuum / sweep ""only the middles"" of the floor, as long as you do it at least once a week.   Like Konmari it is an attitude and a mindset (Flylady calls it ""gentle flywashing""). Unlike Konmari, I don't think Flylady would have time or patience with origami shirt folding. Striving for ""Good enough"" while instilling routines that are as ingrained as brushing your teeth every day is just as effective over time.  Ages and ages ago, I belonged to a Yahoo group of flylady followers. From what I saw of the community, I can say that Flylady is particularly good for those with ADHD, or with spouses who have ADHD."

Essentially you get rid of the number of items equal to that day of the month.  So on the first you get rid of one thing, on the second two things, until the 30th where you get rid of 30 things and suddenly you managed to get rid of over 400 items in a month.  It starts you off slowly and gets you into the habit of finding things to get rid of.  When I started I thought I might not get very far because I couldn't see that much to get rid of, but I'm on day 14 today and am seeing a difference in my house and still easily finding things to get rid of each day.    Another thing that might help is getting four boxes and labelling them keep, trash, donate, sell.  Whenever you feel like it see if you can find five items and put them in the appropriate box.  Once a box is full you then need to deal with it as the label says.  If it's the keep box then you need to find permanent homes for the items inside."

One thing they had in common was that when I was not happy, my surroundings will often reflect it. When the both of us were unhappy, the house would be a mess.   When you are in a situation that you don't take responsibility for your own life but instead shift the blame on the other (I don't have to clean if they make a mess of everything) you get into this downward spiral, which tends to kill all the remaining love. It's reversible, but it starts with yourself and your own attitude. You can't demand or expect someone to change positively by barraging them with negativity."

I had never had someone positively encouraging me to do what I could. I've never been taught anything about housekeeping. And UFYH gave me just that: positive and gentle enouragement, combined with practical tips. I started slowly, but after a few weeks I could see a difference already.  And while I started out drained at even the very thought of decluttering, that quickly changed. Once you learn how much difference 15 to 20 minutes of effective decluttering makes, it's much easier to bring yourself to do it.  As for your partner, you can go two ways. One is to look at UFYH together and both pick a room to do a 20/10 on (though I'd start with 10 minutes and set a timer). Afterwards, compliment each other on all the things you did and do NOT focus on the things you didn't do.  The other way is to focus on yourself. Let him be. Lead by example, don't force the issue. You guys have argued about this and it's an area of tension now. Try to let go of your expectations of him in the area of housekeeping - for now.   You're in a tough spot.

declutter,3d7tpp,muinamir,8,Tue Jul 14 09:38:23 2015 UTC,"The decluttering process is about letting go of the dead weight that's holding you down. If it isn't improving your life, bringing you happiness, or bringing you closer to your goals, then why are you holding onto it? This philosophy applies to people as well as things.

My recommendation for the feeling of seeing other bits to do is to mentally put on hold and say ""I have had that thought but I will follow it afterward. I am doing this now"" to keep present with what you're doing. Another thing is thst your tasks sound spread across the house which can make it seem less visually different at the end. If you select one room to work on then it looks very different and is more encouraging"

declutter,3d7tpp,Combo_salamander,6,Tue Jul 14 09:08:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! First of all, that is long list of things to accomplish in one day! I would've gotten distracted about a third of the way through, so great job!  Second of all, if you're feeling overwhelmed with the sheer amount that needs to be done, I've found that focusing on one room at a time helps. Do as much as you can to clean one room (preferably one that you spend a significant amount of time in) - Trash all the obvious things, remove all the things that definitely don't belong there (ex. put all the dirty dishes back in the kitchen), pick up everything off the floor (clothes, paper, half-chewed dog toys, books, etc) and place them on a surface (even if it's the couch), then vacuum just that room (I know it seems pointless at this stage, but seeing a clean floor can do wonders to your motivation!). After that, start decluttering everything left in the room (trashing, donating, or putting items in their proper place). When you're done, give the room a proper clean. Then move onto the next room, but make sure the room/s you've already done STAY CLEAN. This process can be slow or quick, depending on where you start and your motivation, but I like it because it gets rid of the ""dear god, where do I even start"" mentality. If you have 10 minutes of spare time, you go to your current cleaning room and work on it."

Not even intentionally, but more like ""I brought stuff for you and your kids and your mom and your sister, give it to them"" and then they don't want it and it just stayed here.   I heard of KonMarie here, and looked into it. I've had good success. My basement is clearing out and I've gotten rid of probably 80% of my clothes and 50% of household stuff. It's so much easier to maintain. There is a Facebook group of 10,000 plus people, and a really common post is that people started to do it and their partners came on board after they started with their own things.  A good app for a cleaning schedule and routine housework is ""home routines"". I also do something that I call a ""done list"" instead of a to-do list. I ALWAYS overestimate how much I want to get done (like, 100% of the time it's completely unrealistic), so I write down all the things I did during the day. Looking at it always makes me realize that I actually get a lot done during the day.   Good luck!"
declutter,3d7tpp,oheythatgirl,5,Tue Jul 14 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic list, you should feel great after accomplishing all that!    When I'm unmotivated, I don't think to myself 'goddamit the dishes need doing' or 'half a ton of ironing; maybe I'll just reddit for another half hour first', I say to myself 'what one thing can I do right now to improve my environment?'  That little motivator gets me off my ass far more than just stressing about the accumulation of tasks piling up."
declutter,3d7tpp,city17_dweller,3,Tue Jul 14 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"great job at doing this much!!! You are making a huge dent - even if it doesn't look like it. Don't lose steam now, and try to find ways to continue decluttering throughout the week. Even if it's as little a 5 or 10 minutes on an especially busy day, it's better than nothing.   If you haven't done so, try reading about the Konmari method. Her book really helped me rethink a lot of the things that I was keeping in my life, and prompted me to do a big purge. Hopefully the mentality of keeping things that ""spark joy"" is able to motivate you to chip away at your house!  Also recognize that we are often our own worst critics. You are bound to notice the mess in your house and it might be easy for you to feel like there's too much or that it can't be dealt with. Continue to work at decluttering, even if you don't feel like you are seeing immediate results. Doing something is always better than doing nothing at all!"

I don't know why you think that's inadequate!     Realize that it took a while for your house to get to this state, so it's going to take a while to get it to the presentable state you want it to be in.  That's not a bad thing - it's recognizing that you are ready to be dedicated to this and put the work in.       To keep motivated, try to make everyday a ""non-zero"" day (learned this on reddit).  You're going to have days when you're motivated to do a ton like you described in your post, and then there will be days when you feel overwhelmed.  On the overwhelmed days, just do one thing.  It could be as little as throwing a bottle in the recycling, but at least you did one thing that day.  The idea behind this is that sometimes when you do that one thing it will motivate you to do more.  There will still be days when you only do that one thing, but at least you can go to sleep knowing it was a non-zero day."
declutter,3d7tpp,leslietheriveter,4,Tue Jul 14 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"OP here, first of all, THANK YOU so much for all the supportive comments, I truly appreciate it! I posted late last night and was kind of afraid to look at what I wrote this morning. (Also sorry about the messed up formatting on my list, I didn't notice that last night.)  I meant to mention that I have read dozens of books on cleaning and organization, and in the past I've read up on the Flylady method, but something about it rubs me the wrong way. UFYH is great, but I think it's a bit too simplistic to really help me with as big of a task as I have. Unless I'm missing something.  I've read The Lifechanging Magic of Tidying Up and it's a system I could really get on board with, but I get stuck from the very beginning, where you gather all of one one like item together. I don't even know what I have, or where it all is, and some of it isn't mine. And I don't have a space to gather it. I feel like I'm drowning in crap right now. I think I'm going to have to come up with some modified approach to that method though.   I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep last night. As I mentioned, I originally wrote a much larger post and detailed all the issues I am having with our lifestyle, how bad the house is, how my partner and I feed off each other's bad tendencies and how much I resent him for not doing his share of the work. My brain wouldn't shut off when it was time for bed. So I have a lot less energy today, but reading these comments has motivated me, so hopefully I can make some progress today too!  Thanks again!"
declutter,3d7tpp,megabyte1,3,Tue Jul 14 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have enough space to get everything of one type together either, so instead from the Kondo book what I've picked up is the idea that I need to pretend like everything is getting tossed: books, clothes, DVDs, toys, furniture, EVERYTHING.  Then I look at each item and ask myself if it has earned a Keep.  Working from the perspective of deciding what to keep instead of what to get rid of has really helped."
declutter,3d7tpp,leslietheriveter,2,Wed Jul 15 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go on a short tangent about your brain not shutting off at night.  One thing that helped me battle this was to write everything down in lists (whether it's a physical list in a notebook or a digital list on something like Wunderlist).  Lists can be categorized into everything and anything: books to read, things I'm grateful for, things I'm worried about, things to clean in the kitchen, things to do for work tomorrow, etc.       By recording these things it helped me stop worrying I was going to forget something, so things were no longer lingering in my mind at night.  I even keep a whiteboard within arm's reach of my bed so I can write things down if I think of them as I'm going to sleep, which takes them off my mind for that night.     What this also allows me to do is visually see the tasks I want to complete, and then I can rank them according to what needs to get done ASAP, what I want to aim to do that day, what can be put off until later, etc.     This system doesn't work for everyone, but it has definitely helped me.  Keep up your progress, and good luck!"
declutter,3d7tpp,kseniadobreva,3,Thu Jul 16 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"Hey,  looks like your fear and panic is not only about stuff, but something in your life as well. Maybe it's a good idea to sit down and think of it. Try to separate your fear of changes from stuff - stuff doesn't deserve to be feared.  Baby steps is the essential technique here. Your house has been like that for some period of time, and it's okay if you need time to find energy, to make it better, to find out what's actually better.  The same comes to arguing with your partner. Very often such quarrels over cleaning and mutual help are not about that at all.  I would recommend starting from things you're annoyed most of all. For example, if there's a pile of stuff near your bed or desk which you see every day as you wake up and fall asleep - start with that. Remove the most annoying spot and feel the energy your receive from seeing the actual result.  Also, maybe you have some friends who could come and help you declutter along with eating some yummy things, listening to music or just talking to make the process more fun. Decluttering shouldn't be necessarily an unpleasant experience."
declutter,3d7tpp,missdawn1970,3,Tue Jul 14 10:13:20 2015 UTC,"As other commenters have said, you got a lot done for one day. Even if it doesn't look like you made a dent, there is now less clutter in your house than there was before. I've been purging for almost 2 years, a little at a time (I've been in my house for 13 years, through a marriage, divorce, and two growing kids; stuff really adds up). I've gotten rid of so much stuff that you'd think my house would be empty, but there's still more to go. So be patient with yourself, and appreciate every little step you take toward a neater home.  Take small steps. Decide that today you'll clean out one drawer or one cupboard. Trying to do too much is overwhelming, and you'll end up not doing anything. Some days you'll be so motivated after cleaning out that one drawer that you'll decide to do another one, and then another. But don't plan on it; just do one thing at a time.  Also vow not to buy anything that you don't absolutely need. Getting rid of stuff won't reduce the clutter if you're just replacing it with new junk.  You can do this. Good luck!"
declutter,3d7tpp,somewhat_pragmatic,3,Tue Jul 14 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"For me decluttering is closer to weight loss.  It is accomplished by limiting what you bring into the house, then learning how to take things out of the house for good.  After that it is just a matter of the amount of energy you put in vs. the speed at which you want it accomplished.  I stopped having near as much attachment to my stuff when I hit the point I couldn't find a certain thing and had to rebuy it.  That signaled to me that my stuff wasn't helping me, but holding me down.  Another hard lesson to learn was the value I'd spent acquiring lots of that stuff wasn't even close to what it was worth today (sunk cost fallacy).  It doesn't matter if I bought item X for $50.  Today it is only worth $10.  It will never be worth $50 again, and if I hold onto it any longer it may even be worth less, or nothing.   Time to part with it."
declutter,3d7tpp,Kiwikid14,3,Tue Jul 14 19:47:41 2015 UTC,"You are not alone. Most people have hoarding tendancies but we keep them in check. Some people don't have that check, especially when they are stressed, tired and feeling vulnerable.  It does get better. A friend of mine who got out of control over the last two years has managed it. They changed jobs and got divorced as these were significant stresses on them. Once happier, they just started plugging away at it, one space at a time. They started like you, with basic cleanliness and then tacked one space in one room. They went at the speed they could manage, at some times painfully slowly.  I did my own declutter, but am not a hoarder and don't have that emotional attachment to possessions. We have talked a lot about not buying stuff as this used to be an issue for me.  Their house looks good now and as things went, it became easier to clean and maintain. And they are happy to have people over and live their lives."
declutter,3d7tpp,Ivegonewrong,3,Tue Jul 14 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"Ok I realised now that my comment actually was affirming but not as helpful as it could have been. First of all, take a look at what you've done and affirm any difference that it's made. Look and see that it can be done.  Then take those washed clothes you no longer want and bag them up. This doesn't have to be all at once. It could be, but an approach I've gone with was hanging plastic bags off door handles and anytime I pick something up and realise it doesn't fit/I don't want to wear it - in the nearest bag. Do this occasionally in the middle of whatever you're doing if you notice, then return to whatever it was.  Same goes if your eye falls on something that's been there so long you barely notice the object. (Hint: Seems an odd suggestion. If you don't notice it anymore them how will you notice to discard it?? Well, taking a Polaroid or a photo on a digital camera of a room tends to shift your perspective and you'll notice more what needs to go.)  After a while of this you'll notice the house opening up and it'll be easier to vacuum or wipe down spaces.  Declutter first before cleaning or storage. DO NOT store things in boxes. Just keep filling the bags and donating when they're full. See if there are charities in your area that send out collection trucks that you can book online, I know this exists in my state and it's a huge help, it prevents bags sitting there forever.  I really don't know what to do about the partner. He seems like he's going to sabotage or undo your efforts. If things can't change with him around, you may need hoarding/depression cleaners. They exist, Google for your area.  But I'm someone who lives with multiple chronic illnesses and struggles to manage a space, and by doing regular small chunks of work when I can the place is already 100% on what it was.   I highly recommend Unfuck Your Habitat's mini-challenges. They get you un-stuck."

declutter,3d9fv7,GetOrganzdAlrdy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing this! I agree there has to be a balance and too much rigidity can be counterproductive.  My personal line to draw is when I can no longer efficiently clean. Because I value a clean house -- which is not necessarily the same as a de-cluttered house. In fact I value a clean house higher than I value a decluttered house.   I value kitchen counters without crumbs. Freshly washed sheets (but the bed doesn't need to be made every day). No gigantic laundry piles in the laundry room. A clean shower without mold and soap scum. Shiny floors with no dust bunnies. No dust piling up on the furniture.   It's just harder to keep a house clean if there's clutter or too much stuff. And, I don't want to spend hours each week cleaning as there are much better and fun things to do with my time.   So for example it's time to declutter the kitchen cabinets when I find myself dreading emptying the dishwasher, because too many cups and plates and tupperware tumble out every time I open the cabinet.   Likewise it's time to declutter my clothes when I find myself avoiding doing the laundry because it's a pain in the butt to put clothing away in already packed drawers.   It's time to declutter my knick-knacks if there's so many that I loathe dusting them, and moving them to dust the furniture they sit on. It's time to declutter the shampoo bottles in the shower if I loathe cleaning the shower stall.   I don't need the environment to be perfect and minimal -- I can live with some clutter piles here and there. As long as the house is dust free and I can run the vacuum because the floor is fairly clear or just takes a minute or two to clear.   And I blame my mother for that, because she kept a spotless house. It had a lot of clutter (knick knacks, books, decorative items, hobby stuff), which she tirelessly dusted around."

I work at a used bookstore, and we have a trade policy that allows people to bring in books to build credit to use against the purchase of our merchandise. We never buy books, and never have in 15 years of business. It's simply not a sustainable business model for most small bookstores.  Every single day, I have at least one customer that is astonished that we will not give them the full original retail of a book in cash.   ""But it's barely used!""   ""But I never even read it!""   ""But these still sell for $30 in Target!!"" etc.etc.  People generally have a really hard time divorcing what an item was worth to them from its actual resale value. I struggle with getting rid of things, and working at the bookstore has been an eye-opener for me. I no longer look at allllll the stuff in storage as investments, or ""collectables."" Stuff is stuff. Very little of the stuff manufactured in our lifetime retains value, let alone increases in worth."

We end up donating most of our stuff to goodwill.  I think as much as they can handle gets put on the racks for resale, and the rest really does get shipped to needier areas.    Goodwill is especially good about putting desinger stuff on the rack for resale.    But right.  Consumerism = too much stuff, stuff no one wants.  shame!"

Everybody brings a bag of clothes (including purses, shoes, and costume jewelry), then we lay them all out and go ""shopping"".  We can take as many or as few as we like, and at the end of the swap (after tea and snacks), we bag up the leftovers to be donated to a thrift shop.  A group of us have done this several times in the last year, and it's much easier to say goodbye to clothes when you're having a party with friends.  We also had a book swap night! :)"

Shoes and clothes purchased for $50 going for 50 cents -- and the buyers would try to haggle even lower! It killed me.   At the time, I had no savings or investments, so all the money I'd made was in those clothes. Now worth 1% of what I had spent.   Until this year, I spent every cent on disposables and consumables. I have been working for a decade, and had only 1% of my entire working income to show for it. I've been putting away a little bit at a time since maybe March, and now I have a month and half's worth of my income nested in a savings account.  Baby steps. I now have 150% of my monthly salary in the bank. Hopefully soon I'll have 50% of my annual salary. Next year, 100% :)"

Staying on top of it is very hard as I'm finding out.   I'm in month 2 of selling stuff on ebay and just starting to see carpet in a corner that was once all boxes of stuff. I have cupboards and shelves to go. Could be a few more months. Will never collect stuff again knowing the time and effort of getting rid of it and how valueless most stuff is.

It's nice for when you are gaining or losing weight instead of holding onto a couple pairs of jeans ""just in case"" you can trade the ones that don't fit for a pair that does, and if you do reach the goal, you can trade again.

declutter,3cyq31,urlefthand,3,Sun Jul 12 01:49:39 2015 UTC,True and our group stipulates that if the recipient intends to sell the item they must disclose that.  Some people want to give away items to those who really NEED them vs. those who just think it would be neat to have.
declutter,3cyq31,MollyTamale,4,Sun Jul 12 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"It is exactly because of people that show up in their truck and snap up everything I'm offering that has made me stop using Freecycle and Craigslist to give things away. I almost feel like I'm feeding some type of horrid addiction (I mean, if they go and sell it, kudos to them for doing something I'm too lazy to do, but I don't think that's generally the case). So, I give it to the thrift stores.  ...Although...that doesn't really solve the issue because I'm sure people just go there and snap up stuff for super cheap and cram it into an already full house.

declutter,3cyq31,OneQuarterKrogan,2,Sun Jul 12 16:04:34 2015 UTC,Yea this has been my frustration with those sites too. I also somehow end up dealing with the people not showing up while I wait for them.

I usually pick the most polite person (so many people don't even use 'please' or 'thank you').  A lot of people do 'curb alerts', but that is a waste of time/gas/frustration for everyone who gets there later (which is anti-environment).   Most items I just leave on my front porch. Once (for a trunkful of formerly beloved items) I met the lady so I could see who would now love my things. (She showed up on time)  I have only once had a no-show, and that was a reasonable explanation. It was a front-porch item so I didn't care anyway."

declutter,3cxz0v,huntersandrabbits,2,Sun Jul 12 08:38:54 2015 UTC,I would sort items by size and of course get rid of everything too big then sort out the smallest sized items and everything that will take awhile to fit and put it in tubs in the bottom of the closet. I personally don't like to have anything hanging in my closet that I can't just grab and put on. I like to only have clothes that fit and are season appropriate hanging up.  Then when I have to get ready it's easier to make outfits and not waste time pulling something out only to find out it just doesn't fit right.
declutter,3cxz0v,vulchiegoodness,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:21:22 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel right now.  I know it's optimal to have some of these items in advance (I've been only buying them on clearance, so it's been a nice savings), but they aren't wearable yet and having over half my clothes not fit is frustrating.  However, I've been so grateful to have access to the new clothing when I go down a size, I just need to come up with a better method of organizing it all.  It will be so much easier when I am finished losing weight."
declutter,3cxz0v,funchy,3,Sun Jul 12 08:41:07 2015 UTC,"First would be to weed through all of the clothes and determine if each item is still in good condition and you would actually wear it today if it was your current size.   After that, sort by size and label it. Live for today but plan for the future. If I were you, I'd keep current size and one smaller in the wardrobe and put the rest of too small clothes in a bin/drawer. It sounds like you are getting overwhelmed with the space and hopefully this will help.    Definitely get rid of the too big items! You've worked hard and it's just depressing to look back on. :)  Keep up the good work!"
declutter,3cxz0v,PuffinTheMuffin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:26:38 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I will get rid of the too-big items as soon as I have a few more clothes that fit.  It's been a constant balancing act trying to keep a professional and tailored wardrobe while losing so much weight.

I unfollowed everyone I don't particularly care too much about - just asked myself ""does this make me feel good about myself?"" since a lot of content (esp on IG) can really make you feel inadequate.   Now, I have enough time to check everything on a semi-daily basis without feeling like I'm chained to my feeds.

I also created folders for Bills and Purchases, so that they were easier to find/access and didn't clutter up my inbox, and they were basically the only emails I kept.

I have about 64 gb to go through but I'm taking it pretty slow so I don't go crazy  I have also gotten in the habit of moving photos on my phone to Drive twice a month.

Bras should not be laundered that way. You are supposed to wear the bra into the shower, soaping it up with gentle cleanser, then air drying. This keeps the shape and prolongs life. And if you have oodles of bras -- enough you can rotate frequently so the bra has a chance to air out -- then they will also last longer.   I have bras that have lasted for several years. High-end bras (Chantelle). I baby those suckers because they are expensive.  From experience I can tell you that Victoria's Secret bras give out way way sooner. Maybe 1/3-1/4 the shelf life of a higher end bra.   As for running shoes, yes, they definitely have a shelf life. It's not even the mileage -- the material will degrade even if you don't ever wear them. How do I know this? My favorite running shoe was being discontinued so I stocked up and bought 5 pairs on major sale. I stuffed them under the bed for future use. Flash forward, by the time I pulled out the 4th and 5th pair, the material had completely degraded and they were useless. I did try to run in them -- and wound up injuring myself.   Anything with elastic -- exercise bras, exercise shorts, etc -- will likewise do the same. Ever tuck away a pair of exercise shorts for the winter, only to bring it out next summer, and discover the elastic has given out? My pet peeve."
declutter,3cq95s,temp4adhd,11,Fri Jul 10 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Some of those rules encourage people to replace items early.   I can't imagine replacing my bras every 8 months.   I replace them when band loosens or there are other signs it doesn't support well.   I've learned that more careful laundering helps them last longer.  For example I prefer to air dry the bras, and in the washer I don't use the hottest setting.     Shoes depend a lot on type of use and how the foot lands.   I retire mine when the padding inside feels broken down and or when any part of the sole looks worn out.   I'll squeeze a bit more use out of them by casually wearing them around the yard,  and then I don't worry if they get muddy.  Make up (once opened) eventually is an issue because bacteria can grow in it.  I'd be especially careful with anything used on the eyes.    Storing in in a cool dry place helps extend life.   The bed you sleep in has a limited life. It depends on the type of mattress, but the manufacturers life rating gives you an idea of how long they think it lasts.  But if you feel it's sagging or not supporting well any more, it may be time."
declutter,3cq95s,funchy,3,Fri Jul 10 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"YES to the bed!  I am convinced that a lot of back pain is caused by a mattress that has expired. Whether it sags or not.  Also, even if a mattress seems fine after so many years it absorbs so much body sweat and other fluids -- not to mention dust mites -- it's just healthier all around to replace it. 10 years should be the max.   Frequent mattress replacement is probably one of the better things you can invest in, for your all around health.   I almost want to include pillows here too -- but pillows at least can be thrown in the washer/dryer. Mattresses can't."

I figure if a manufacture recommends replacing something at X time, keep at least 2X time unless you notice a problem.  I have 6 bras I've had 10 years and wear frequently (my favorites). I wash them on gentle and let them air-dry. I bought them all at one time (all the same brand) when an airline lost my luggage.   These sports bras are just now starting to lose support & get thin. I know I need to replace them, but also feel current products aren't made with the same quality. And why-the-(*&^ are they trying to sell sexy sports bras?   I know nothing about shoes, but weatherstripping around fridge doors, house doors & windows etc deteriorates. If you put a dollar bill between the two pieces of weatherstripping on your fridge, close the door, and can easily pull the dollar out...you need to replace the weatherstripping. Huge amounts of money/energy lost this way."

The only exception is lipstick, which I will reapply constantly throughout the day. So I figure since I'm all clean when I apply the make-up, I'm not introducing contaminants. I think my make up lasts much much longer this way. I usually can get through a whole tube of mascara, or foundation, before it gets clumpy or smelly.   Lipstick (since I'm reapplying all the time) is a different case altogether  -- I never finish a tube.  If it starts discoloring or the odor smells, I discard right away. For this reason, I stay cheap/drugstore brand with my lipstick. It would kill me to have to toss out a $30 tube."

As I said above my bras do last much longer than 8 months, and I gave reasons why (higher end bras; more bras; gentle laundering; babying; airing out).

Even in a cumulative knowledge field like physics, keeping class notes is essentially useless.

Some notes went straight into the recycling because I knew I wouldn't need them again and every semester I would review what I had previously kept to see if there were class notes I could now recycle.  One thing I ask myself in considering what to keep is if the information would be easier to Google than to try to flip through old class notes.       How much you need to keep depends on what you're majoring in (assuming you're in college), if you're eventually taking the next level of that subject, if you might need it for a future job, etc."

Where does he get stuff?    He doesn't buy any of it!!! He hates shopping. It's very very rare he ever buys anything brand new. It's all stuff he finds on the curb for free. We're in an urban area. He bikes to and from work. He passes lots of boxes marked ""free"" with stuff for the taking. His hoarding favorites are half used toiletries and cleaning supplies; expired food; wrapping paper and gift boxes; kitchen stuff; old tools & parts; books he think I might like to read (I decluttered tonight - I had 3 copies of at the exact same Jumpa Lahiri book); decorative items; furniture; beach chairs; towels; linens; etc... basically everything most people declutter when they are moving. IS IN MY HOUSE. And now we want to move.   What's the difference between hoarding & clutter?   To me hoarding is about an addiction -- it is self medicating with acquisition of ""stuff.""   When my hubby is stressed out or depressed, he sees something on the curb that's free and his whole demeanor changes instantly. He cannot help pulling over. It's like he's just gotten a hit of crack.  He's giddy and it lifts his mood. It doesn't matter if we already have 5 or 100 of whatever it is and don't need it.  The letting go later is also different. It's not that he's so overwhelmed he doesn't know where to start, or doesn't know how to start. He doesn't want to get rid of any of it. And has an emotional reaction when others try to sneak it out past him.   He spends lots of time ""organizing"" his hoards too - taking up cabinet and closet space and guest bedroom and basement -- any area that he thinks I won't object to, since my rule has always been to keep the main rooms clean. But it gets harder and harder to keep the main rooms clean and clutter-free because he's packed all the cabinets and closets to the brim. Then he points finger at me and says it's my clutter that's the problem... but my stuff isn't clutter. It's stuff I can no longer put away in a closet or cabinet where it belongs.   I think another difference is that he knows exactly what he has in his hoards, and where it is. Whereas those with a clutter problem often discover they have 3 ironing boards -- one in closet, one under bed, one in basement. Clutter to me is more disorganized and not tracked.  Our house doesn't exactly look like an extreme hoarder on t.v., because I have kept up as best I can with keeping main areas free. But at the expense of ME giving up things I actually want to own and have space for. I keep downsizing MY stuff smaller and smaller and smaller into a tiny footprint. And I'm tired of that, and I can't keep up. So slowly the main areas are starting to get cluttered. And dusty and dirty, because you can't clean around clutter.   Does the hoarding get worse after a stressful event, and better during easier times?   Even in easier times there's been a steady amount of hoarding behavior. But in easier times, I've been able to keep up with it, cheerfully sneaking shit out of the house, being patient while he gets through and past his emotional unconscious reaction to releasing stuff, maintaining my cool so he can work through his issues. But in stressful times, the hoarding increases dramatically, and if I'm stressed too, I can't keep up, so it goes exponential, with too much in and not enough out.   How do you deal with it and stay sane?   It's difficult.   He has so many redeeming qualities. Our relationship is otherwise solid, and we are on the same page about most everything else.  Every marriage has irreconcilable differences; the good marriages simply cultivate so many positives that the negatives seem insignificant.   It was one of our first dates that we saw the play about the Collyer brothers: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2217953/Homer-Langley-Collyer-Hoarder-brothers-killed-clutter-New-York-mansion.html"

I've heard that's getting more common, and would probably be easier for both of you. It sounds like his addiction is minimizing who you are and what place you have in your world and personal space.   If this was any other type of addiction, do you think you would still be with him? Do y'all have kids?   Thanks for the link, and the answers."
declutter,3cllfv,NotShirleyTemple,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want separate living spaces. I don't sleep well when he's not home, and vice versa.   That said, I'm very open to renting for this next phase rather than home-owning, because it'd force us to move periodically, which means cleaning out more frequently, and I think that would suit both of us well. So that is something we're considering, since our life is in flux right now with career and other things going on. We thought we'd retire in this house but with his dad and uncle dying last year, we're realizing that this house -- even if hoard free-- just isn't conducive to our senior years.   One thing we're both on the same page about is that we want to downsize. There is truth about clutter taking up the space you have for it. I've offered to get a storage unit for his hoarding hobby; he doesn't want that either. I do suspect downsizing will contain things even more, naturally -- and so does he. I just don't want to downsize my stuff. And I've made that clear. We're downsizing our overall square footage so he is forced to downsize his stuff.   If he was begging for us to move into a 4000 sf place then I'd be worried!! (we're currently in 1700+basement and are thinking we can go down to 1200 no basement).   If this was any other type of addiction, do you think you would still be with him?    Good question.   I'm an ex-smoker. I have somewhat of an addictive personality myself. My addictions have never really had any consequences (i.e, I quit before I got lung cancer). But I've battled that all my life, so I get how it is, and understand how there can be a biological component (dopamine boost).    Do y'all have kids?   Yes, two college aged & graduating soon."

They have survived every decluttering phase I've gone through. I never even considered parting with them. But this morning I looked at them and felt absolutely nothing towards them. The attachment was gone. I threw them in a garbage bag (they were far too shabby to be donated) without a thought.  Another example: a relative recently passed away. My family decided to let everyone just kind of come in and pick out what they wanted. She was an antique collector and literally had a house full of gorgeous quality furniture, gorgeous decorative items, and framed prints. I picked out a few really lovely pieces of furniture and prints, but when I got home I made sure I got rid of something for every piece I added. I've done quite a bit of shuffling and decluttering due to that recent influx of new (to me) items. I got rid of several pieces of furniture I never thought I'd part with, but I didn't have any sadness or angst about it. I had them, they served me well, but the furniture I brought in 1) reminds me of my relative, which is very comforting and b) is of better quality."

My dad didn't have many things from his childhood either and very few things from his adult, pre-family years.   But, what he did have was stories.  So many stories.   What might help you is to take a picture of the items you want to declutter, but take a minute and jot down a memory that goes along with that object.  Keep a few treasures, to be sure, but let the rest go on new journeys.  As for stuff to be used in the future, how expensive is it to replace that item? If it is less than $20 and you are pretty sure you won't be using it in the next year, let it go.  I did a massive declutter a few years ago.  The only thing I have missed?  I donated some cheesecloth.  And now I want to make some cold brewed coffee that requires- you guessed it- cheesecloth, for straining out the grounds.

declutter,3cljpl,Roy_munson_,7,Thu Jul 9 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"something that I think has helped me when I think about decluttering sentimental objects is that there are some things that are truly precious to us, and some things that are truly unremarkable. As morbid as it might be, I sometimes think about what would happen if I were to die, and my family and friends had to sort through my personal belongings.   For example: I have some stuffed animals that I love because they were given to me by my grandparents when I was first born. I also had a lot of stuffed animals that I didn't love that I had been given as hand-me-down toys and never really enjoyed playing with. If I were to die tomorrow, my parents would have to go through all of my things and decide what to keep and what to give away. If I still had three dozen stuffed animals, they wouldn't know which ones I cared about most. If I declutter and only keep three or four stuffed animals, they know that it is something that I loved and found meaningful.   I think a lot about when I helped my mother and aunts clean out my Grandmother's apartment after she died. There was a lot of treasures - love letters between my grandma and grandpa, old photographs, and even small trinkets and things. But there was also a lot of clutter - plastic bags, partially broken electronics, etc. that we didn't initially know what to do with. By winnowing down everything now, you give yourself the opportunity to live in a home that is filled with only the things that make you happy, and I think that's worth decluttering for."
declutter,3cljpl,wewillrun,2,Thu Jul 9 08:51:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Knowing that someone would have to go through all my stuff when I die was a powerful motivator for me.

declutter,3cljpl,funchy,4,Thu Jul 9 11:50:28 2015 UTC,"I found it useful to keep a ""nostalgia box"" for some years. It had my childhood stuffed animals, pictures, greeting cards, letters, etc. in it, and over the years I was able to reduce the number of items in it to the point that I now have a ""nostalgia envelope"" that I'm working my way through.  Not sure if this could help, but by setting a pre-determined smallish box aside for the most meaningful sentimental items and the items for that nebulous roommate Justin Case, it might help you move past these blocks.  (I know this goes against the theory that if you truly love something, it should be displayed and enjoyed, but I'm not sure that's the ideal solution for everyone.)  Best of luck with your decluttering!"
declutter,3cljpl,Janicia,3,Wed Jul 8 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"I have some of the same feelings.   Reasons I hold on to stuff:  -It has a memory associated with it that I don't want to forget.   Take some photos of it.   That way the photos can jog your memory.   -It could potentially be useful in the future   This is a trick out minds play when we secretly feel an urge to hoard.  Remind yourself that if you need one of those 3 years from now,  there are stores and eBay.    But right now you need the space.   -I am afraid that I will regret not having it in the future*   Limit yourself to one or two bins of things to keep.  Or one big wooden chest.  Or some fixed amount of space.  Of course you will want a few mementos to show kids and grandkids.   But you don't need to keep the entire last few decades to do so.    Think of making a time capsule.  What things would you put in the box that would mean the most when you looked at them in 25 years with kids/grandkids?       *This fear is the direct result a memory I hold of my mom showing me the only two toys that had survived from her childhood and telling me she wished she had held onto more childhood items to show and pass down to me. The feelings evoked by this memory have only been compounded since my mom died three years ago, when I was 21.    Remind yourself the toys are just symbols.  They aren't what's important.   What really matters was the wonderful stories your mother shared with you about those years.   Or a photo album she may have passed down.    Maybe you need to make a scrap book of photos and nits of some of your sentimental objects.  Perhaps even write a few sentences on what each object means to you.   Get rid of the object; keep the memories."

Nobody is going to willingly go through a big box of paper.  But if you pull out the three great letters, you can store them such that they will actually be treasured and remembered.    I also find comfort in holding on to the idea that there is potential harm on both sides of the decluttering equation.  If I give something away, I may regret it later.  But if I have too much stuff in my house, it makes my life harder in lots of ways.  And stuff should be used - if I""m not using it I should send it back out into the world to let somebody else use it.    My grandmother makes quilts.  She got mad at one of her friends for a quilt she'd given up on the wall as artwork.  Grandma said ""that was meant to be useful!"".  I thought of that when I sent a  childhood quilt she made for me back out into the world (not my only quilt from her).

Some people say that's what thrift stores are for. Are you so short on cash that having to buy an item would be a huge burden? If not, you can probably let go of these kinds of things.   You may not even realize the huge burden this stuff is placing on you until you get rid of it.

That said I can also tell you that my life is so much better now that I own less. Let me try to counter your reasoning:  It has a memory associated with it that I don't want to forget You're not going to forget the memory because you get rid of its physical manifestation. The memory will always be in your head. I feel that Hollywood has romanticized keeping old things for the sake of memories. If you can incorporate the items into your lives, keep them, but if they're just going to collect dust in a box in the attic, what's the point?  It could potentially be useful in the future Potentially, but most probably not. Personally I'm a fan of the 20/20 rule: if you currently don't see a use for something and it takes less than 20 minutes and $20 to repurchase it if you need it in the future, get rid of it.   I am afraid that I will regret not having it in the future This is a legitimate concern, but do you really want to have a house filled up with a lot of stuff that you don't use? Real estate is expensive, is keeping a lot of stuff worth it? If you know you want kids, keep some toys that are in good condition. Think about what you can repurpose - can you frame old posters and make them look more grown-up? Sometimes we outgrow things and don't notice they're gone, once in a while we get rid of something we regret, but the risk is worth it IMO.   Good luck :)"

Someone mentioned in another thread that if you think of craigslist & ebay as your HUGE storage cabinet, you can get anything you want with just a retrieval/storage fee. Everyone's closet is there for you if you NEED it.  My mom used to shriek like a dying rabbit whenever I tried to give anything away, especially if she gave it to me. And she used to give me stuff SHE had wanted as a kid, and not stuff I wanted.  I'm 41 and realized a few months ago how much stuff in my house was my mom's, and that I didn't even like it! I was living with her guilt-inducing, judgmental voice in my head. But she didn't want those things, or else she'd still have them. It helps a bit. I'm just now figuring out what I like.   Not sure where I heard it, but supposedly many of our decisions are made out of fear (future, judgement, expense), obligation (I will be a wretched ingrate if I don't do X), or guilt (to the item or person who made it/had it/loved it).

I keep manuals for things I need to do in uncomfortable places, and for things that have lots of decision trees (programming the remote control to master multiple items).

declutter,3cge9z,temp4adhd,8,Tue Jul 7 18:30:38 2015 UTC,Realtor here: You can tell your husband that buyers DO open cabinets. The kitchen should look like you have ample storage when it's being shown - that also means hiding appliances and things you keep on the counter top.
declutter,3cge9z,ArcadiaRhodes,7,Tue Jul 7 19:38:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the validation. I also open closets.   I hope to eventually clear everything from the kitchen counter except coffee maker & toaster oven. Is it okay if those stay on the counter top? Or do I need to get creative and figure out a place to stash them during open houses?
declutter,3cge9z,ArcadiaRhodes,5,Tue Jul 7 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"... also any other staging tips, please send them along...   Quick question for you: our bedrooms are small. I was debating about chucking the Queen size bed in our master bedroom (it's 10 years old and we plan to replace it when we move), and swapping it out for the Full size bed currently in our guest bedroom.   I was thinking that would make the master bedroom look more spacious?   Or do you think buyers will realize it's only a full mattress and deduce the room is small?"
declutter,3cge9z,wewillrun,9,Tue Jul 7 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"The measurements will be in MLS anyways, but you want them to see layout and function in the room. I constantly get asked, ""Do you think my queen sized or king sized bed will fit in here?"" so they'll likely notice the small bed. Having said that, if the size is making walking around hard, put the smaller one in.   A better bet is to reduce other furnishings (no more than 1 dresser, don't line the walls with furniture, etc.). Again, it makes it look more open and gives the impression that there is enough storage in the closet that you don't need superfluous furniture.  As for the counter. I'd at least stow the toaster oven unless it's really fancy and new looking. Also make sure all your grooming supplies are stowed off the bathroom counters.   Also:    Make sure each room has a clearly defined use: Dining, Living, Sleeping, Study/recreation.  Clean your tile grout, sinks and toilet. Also, wipe down the door handles and any grime on the sides of doors, cabinets, walls, light switches and door jambs. People miss them when cleaning and buyers notice.  Shampoo your carpets (you can rent a steamer at most grocery stores). You're going to find all kinds of fun things when you start moving furniture.  Make sure it smells clean. There's nothing more off-putting than the smells of cooking, stale bedding or smoking in the house.   Make sure every lamp and overhead light has a working bulb and leave all the lights on and drapes open for open houses and showings. You want it to feel welcoming, bright and clean.  Keep the yard neat and the lawn mowed.  Finally, try to be flexible with showings, even if that means just stepping outside while they're going through. The house will sell faster if people can see it at their convenience. I know it's a huge pain, and a disruption but the disruption will be over when it sells. When buyers get cancelled appointments, they often find something else to buy instead of re-booking, so it's kind of like losing a customer because the store was closed but the one down the street had better hours.  Finally, if you are home when buyers come through, please, please, please at least step out into the yard. It's hard for someone to honestly assess a property with the owner following them around or within earshot. They want to confer with their partner or realtor and discuss things without having to hold back."
declutter,3cge9z,amoosebooche,2,Tue Jul 7 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is most excellent information & advice!!!    Having said that, if the size is making walking around hard, put the smaller one in.   The room comfortably fits a queen size bed -- not difficult to walk around. But to your later point, the mattress smells. It's 15 years old. I think it smells; my family says it does not. I've febreezed it numerous times and I still think it smells. But, I am super sensitive to smells! I have wanted to replace it for awhile now, but we figured we'd wait until we moved, which we then procrastinated about, so we haven't. So it's going no matter what. The full size mattress is barely used -- and not as comfortable. Yet I do think we may take it into the next life for the next guest bedroom. So I guess I could argue it either way.    Also make sure all your grooming supplies are stowed off the bathroom counters.   That's easy because all the bathrooms have pedestal sinks. Which have been a PITA but also a blessing in that it does inherently enforce minimal clutter free zones.    Make sure each room has a clearly defined use: Dining, Living, Sleeping, Study/recreation.   The only room that doesn't have a defined use is the guest bedroom. Because 95% of the time, when guests aren't in it, my hubby uses it for clutter storage. By agreement we made years ago: I wouldn't bitch at him. I'd just sweep his stuff out of the main areas and dump in the guest room for him to deal with. Then if we have guests over, our deal has been that he has to clean it up. He's never failed in that -- he just bags everything up, dumps it in the basement, cleans the place thoroughly and we have a guest bedroom back for guests. Then the minute they leave, the clutter begins to collect in there again, until the next guest visit.   Our plan is to clear out all the furniture in that room so it's empty, use it for sorting in 2nd half of the 40-day decluttering plan, then when it comes time to list it, either leave it completely empty, OR borrow some stuff and stage it to look like a home office. I'm leaning towards leaving it empty because I don't want to ""borrow"" some stuff from free cycle!    Also, wipe down the door handles and any grime People miss them when cleaning and buyers notice.   This is SO true! I have noticed this when we've gone to open houses.    Shampoo your carpets   Only have area rugs   Make sure it smells clean.   Non smokers but as I mentioned I think the house smells because the mattress has absorbed too many odors. It's not the bedding because that's washed frequently. It's the mattress itself. There's also shoes that smell awful -- hence ""shoe day"" -- you can't imagine how many shoes a family of four collects. And some of us, ahem, have really awfully stinky feet.   Finally, try to be flexible with showings   That's no problem here at all. Totally get that.  Once again - thanks so much!! Your input has been invaluable. Very much appreciate."
declutter,3cge9z,Lilidawn,2,Wed Jul 8 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"Something that a friend told me once (and I'd maybe see if anyone confirms this) is to have a bowl of fresh fruit on the counter in your kitchen. I specifically remember them mentioning oranges, and being almost a little bit insistent on it. Perhaps a bit of vitamin C superstition? :P   Their reasoning for doing it was that it helped to make the home feel clean and healthy. You obviously don't want to have too much clutter in your home when it is being staged, but fresh fruit or flowers helped make their potential buyers feel more at ease with the space in general. Just my two cents!"

declutter,3cfskb,kansakw3ns,7,Tue Jul 7 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think the tshirts are a separate issue from the laundry.  Most of the tshirts are sitting clean in the drawer, they're not preventing you from doing the laundry.  The solution to the laundry issue is to just do it more regularly, and to find a movie or TV to watch while you fold the laundry to make the chore more pleasant.    If shirts are the only thing he hoards, just ask him to go through his shirts with you and box up half of them to store in a closet.  Then in a year, get those shirts out of the box (yay memories) and box up the other half.  One box of shirts isn't a big deal in a closet.  (When the season changes, you could both put away your summer clothing and get out your winter clothing.  Boxing up the excess t-shirts could be part of that exercise.)  And when a shirt gets a hole or a stain, just point that out to him and see if he'll be ok with parting with it then.  Eventually he'll wear some of them out.  And if he gets used to the idea of getting rid of damaged shirts, he might become ok with getting rid of the ones that don't fit.  My husband used to be kind of weird about his tshirts too, but I only ask him to go through them once in a while and I respect his choices.  He's gotten a lot less prickly about it."
declutter,3cfskb,Janicia,3,Tue Jul 7 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"You're right that most of them are sitting in the drawer clean, but it does add to the issue because I have no desire to fold and put away his shirts because I know there's no room in there already. He will also rifle through the drawer to get the shirt he wants which creates a huge mess (which he doesn't clean up) because they're packed so tightly in there. Then I either have to clean it up or sometimes it gets to the point where everything is wrinkled so I have to run it through the dryer anyway (we should get an iron, I know).   Even if something is stained, has paint and holes on it, if it's the teensiest bit sentimental he'll cling on to it. I feel like I need to tell him straight up how much this is stressing me out..."
declutter,3cfskb,Janicia,6,Tue Jul 7 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"You should get him to store a bunch of the sentimental shirts he never wears somewhere else so the drawer only has the shirts he actually wears.    Actually, maybe you could have a photoshoot day where he puts on each shirt, poses, you take a picture, and then you print off all the photos into a little album?  Maybe get him to write a memory on the back of each photo?    Or you give him a folded pile of laundry and tell him it is his problem to put it away because his over-stuffed drawer is stressing you out.    But either way, the tshirts shouldn't cause a break-down in laundry happening."
declutter,3cfskb,NotShirleyTemple,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"He doesn't mind the mess, or the storage problem, because they are your problem, not his.

Until it starts wriggling with maggots, ignore it (easier said than done...but my husband is now the monitor of when he runs out of clean undies).  Like other redditors, take pictures and discard. Or take pictures and box up (just in case of silverfish/moths/mildew...if you're lucky that will encourage t-shirt tossing). Why haven't you 'straight up told him it's stressing me out'? He feels ok being honest with you about wanting them, you should be able to be honest about the problems of dealing with them.  Does he have any space that is exclusively his? Workshop, car, part of the garage? Box them up and put them there. Now they are his problem. Save his 5 favorites & 5 alternates and voila."

declutter,3cfskb,temp4adhd,5,Wed Jul 8 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"Are you not doing laundry often enough because you still have plenty of clean clothes in the drawers? And hate putting away the clean laundry because the drawers are too packed to close?  I'd recommend selecting 7 shirts, and temporarily boxing all the rest. Tell your SO you'd like to try an experiment for a month. Do similar with your own stuff -- select out 7 pairs of underwear, 7 pairs of socks, etc. Only enough for a week (okay could be more than 7 of each item, but you get the idea).  Then commit to doing a load of laundry a day -- no excuses. (These are going to be small loads and that's okay-- set to ""small"" load so you don't waste water). Put the load in the washing machine in the morning before you go to work. Put it in the dryer as soon as you come home from work -- before you do anything else. Then fold & put it away before bed.   During your experiment, it's okay if you or your SO wants to rescue an item that has been boxed up, but you have to swap it out so you are still keeping the number of items the same.  At the end of the month, regroup and talk about what you thought and felt about the experiment. Did it make life easier? Then decide together if you want to continue, in which case, you may find it easier to get him to let go of more shirts."

My husband holds onto his graphic shirts because they remind him of friends and memorable experiences, some are 10+ years old. Any time I try to help him go through them to pare down, he brushes it off.   A few weeks ago, I put all of his t-shirts in a pile in plain sight. Having the shirts in a closet kept them out-of-sight/out-of-mind...since he now has to pick a shirt out of this pile daily it's becoming more apparent to him how few he actually wears.

Don't you realize how ridiculous it sounds to save old license plates for one day when you maybe have a garage so you can...what? Prove you used to own a bunch of cars?

Good luck :)"

declutter,3cd2z0,roboeyes,9,Mon Jul 6 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"If your textbooks are the latest or second to latest version you should check with the ISBN on http://bookscouter.com. All you need to do is click on the buying company, print out the shipping label and receipt, and send it out in a box, and you'll get your money through paypal or check. Otherwise, you should donate them to a library since finding individual buyers is hard. A lot of times, especially for science textbooks, your material may be outdated so there's no point keeping it for your children."
declutter,3cd2z0,YukioAdventurepal,2,Tue Jul 7 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"That site is exactly what I was looking for, thank you! I think I'll likely sell my nursing books there and then get rid of the rest."

For some reason, I saved all my college textbooks for many years. By the time I got around to purging them, they were very old and out of date. Into the recycling bin they went.  Lotions, shampoos and conditioners: Maybe condense all of each thing into one or two containers? Even different brands of lotion, shampoo, or conditioner can still work together. If not, just throw them out. You might feel like it's wasteful, but it's just as wasteful to keep them around unused.  I have a day of the week for each housekeeping task. Dust on Monday, clean floors on Tuesday, laundry Wednesday and Thursday, change sheets and clean the bathroom on Friday. There's still a few things to do on the weekends, but the bulk of it is done so I can relax."
declutter,3cd2z0,PuffinTheMuffin,3,Tue Jul 7 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"For consumables (lotion/shampoo/conditioner). If you know you will use them, keep them. Just stop buying any more in the future until you used them up. If you aren't sure if you will use them, give it to friends/family. Sometimes, if you need to clean something (toilet/bathtub) you can also use your shampoo as a cleaning agent.  I never keep my textbooks. All information I learned at school are online. But then they were really shitty books so that's why. Use Bookscouter or Powell's or Amazon trade in to get rid of your books for little amount of money. If some aren't accepted, I'd just recycle it. Rarely anyone will find textbooks they look for at a thrift store. You can put up a little flyer at your nursing school to give away y our books for free and see if any students there will take them from you.  Having a small house is probably helping you clean already since you notice the clutter quicker. When you have a big house you just have more space to fill shit with."
declutter,3cd2z0,texasflower,3,Tue Jul 7 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"I have kept quite few bottles of half-used up lotions.  Okay, there are 11 of them.  Because Bath & Body buy one get one sale of course.  I decided to use them up before purchasing more.  Turns out they go bad in about a year and you have to throw them out anyway.  Might as well pick your favorites and get rid of the rest now."
declutter,3cd2z0,jacarandaspoon,3,Tue Jul 7 09:04:52 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing for me with cleaning was realising that it's much easier to find the motivation to do small cleaning tasks than big ones.  Now I make sure all of the dishes are washed before bed every night.  I do one load of washing twice a week, dry it overnight and fold and put away before work in the morning.  Surfaces are much easier to clean if you keep them clear so I've worked to find homes for everything that used to live on counters and now it's a 20 second job to wipe down the vanity or kitchen benches every so often.  I also try to make sure I put things away whenever I am finished with them, my shoes and coat go straight in the closet when I get home etc.  Essentially try and build keeping things clean into your daily routine rather than your weekly one and there will be much less to do on the weekends.  All I usually need to do on weekends is vacuum the floors."
declutter,3cd2z0,betnhe,3,Tue Jul 7 10:47:26 2015 UTC,"Nightstand: If you only need one drawer, replace your nightstand if you can afford it. (this is not meant sarcastic, I'm serious)  Lotions and other products: it seems to me you're falling for the sunk-cost fallacy. Perhaps you can save one open bottle and one closed spare bottle of each product, and throw the rest out. And STOP BUYING THE STUFF!!! Only buy it if your open bottle is nearly empty. And if you did buy a new one, just throw the old one out. You're not going to want to finish that old one anyway.  Cleaning: for me [UFYH](www.unfuckyourhabitat.com) has caused a complete change of attitude towards housework and chores. I like the tone of voice of UFYH better than that of Flylady, though that is strictly personal preference :)  Good luck on getting your bedroom in order. If I were you, I'd only move the thigns back in as you need them and leave the rest out. In a week you will know what does not need to go back into that room and can be tossed :)"
declutter,3cd2z0,Janicia,3,Tue Jul 7 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"Catch-all drawers are dangerous because they become junk graveyards.  But if a drawer has a steady inventory - these 15 things that belong in the drawer and nothing else - you can keep on top of it all.  I think the real problem is when you have something in your hand and it doesn't belong in the drawer but you are feeling lazy or rushed so you put it there anyway.  That's bad.    So once you get your bottom drawer organized and decide on logical contents for the drawer, just be rigorous about not putting stuff that doesn't belong in there. You have a small home, you can easily get to wherever the thing actually belongs.  Now that I'm better about putting everything away properly, it can easily take several trips up and down the stairs to accomplish even simple tasks, but I need the exercise anyway and it is so nice to have everything put away properly.    Find a time to incorporate 10 minutes of maintenance cleaning into your daily routine.  Maybe listen to a podcast or music.  That allows you to stay on top of things like sweeping and cleaning the kitchen.  And build up habits of always putting things away immediately so clutter piles don't have a chance to grow."

I too recommend UFYH for help with keeping surfaces clear, also how to use your waiting time to get other things done.  As for the nightstand issue, I try to keep in my bedroom things related only to sleeping or sex.  Granted my bedroom is pretty small but it really helps.  My nightstand (which is really a plant stand on wheels bc tiny bedroom) has a lamp, tissues, outlets and phone charger, books and a pretty box with condoms in it.  There is space for a glass of water, my lip balm and my glasses.   Unless you have an easy way to sell the textbooks, I recommend donating them.  I also have been decluttering my life and I had a bunch of trial size and half used shampoo bottles....I just lined them up in the shower and worked my way through them.  Try to marry any of the conditioner or shampoo if you can.  Since you said you don't  really have space for the lotions, maybe pick the 3 you like most and put one in the car, one in your bag, and one for the home?  Granted you paid for them all but if you're not using them or planning to it's a waste either way and you might as well toss them and get your space and sanity back.  I know I hold onto things way longer than I should because I think they might be useful but when I get rid of it finally I ALWAYS feel better and really never miss it."
declutter,3cd2z0,amoosebooche,3,Tue Jul 7 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"Nightstand: lotion, some reading books and a notebook, earbuds, my phone charger. A coaster for drinks and a water bottle on top. That's about it.  Lotions: Combine them all into one bottle. Seriously. I know you are like: ""The scents and textures will combine weirdly!!"" But they won't. Shake 'em up real good and it will actually be fine. Same thing with the shampoos and conditioners. Also of course don't buy ANY more till they are all used up. You can use shampoo as bodywash and both shampoo and conditioner as shave gel to use them up faster.  Textbooks: Definitely worth selling on Amazon if you have the stomach for it. Do it now because in 2 years or so they will be out of date and their value plummets. (Not the info inside them, but their ""edition"")  Maintenance: I tidy the kitchen every day, either morning or evening. I never put clothes on the floor - either on a chair or hung up or in the laundry. I try to put things ""away"" throughout the day. Other than that, I do most of my cleaning on the weekend. I only do a deep clean 1x or 2x a month really."
declutter,3cd2z0,yamaume,2,Wed Jul 8 00:10:39 2015 UTC,"I try to keep the house clean throughout the week by having a specific place for each item I own. The item either goes back in its place right after I use it, or it goes on top of a table until the weekend. Then on the weekend I wipe it down and return it to its proper place. I think a lot of messes come from things not having one place that they belong in.  I also don't let things pile up. Junk mail is recycled immediately. Purchases get put away when I come home. In the store, I actually think ""Do I want this enough to take it home and wash it(if it is clothing)/unpack it/whatever"" and believe it or not, half the time I actually put it back on the shelf.  About lotions, you may be able to give that sort of thing away on Freecycle or a similar group on Facebook. I'd keep 2 bottles or 2 Frankenbottles full of my favorite scents. I also recommend only ever having 1 extra bottle on hand of shampoo/lotion/conditioner if you live in a small place. When you open the last bottle, then it is time to buy more.  I have never looked in my textbooks since school. Luckily I only kept 3. I recommend trying to sell/donating them, unless there is any information there that isn't available online."
declutter,3cd2z0,NotShirleyTemple,2,Sat Jul 11 04:39:19 2015 UTC,"Nursing books, if recent, are usually easy to sell. I posted my husband's on freecycle because the two methods we checked (amazon & a textbook resale store) didn't want them (they were 3 years old).  What I keep in my nightstand? Things I use IN bed, and a flashlight.   For me, it's chapstick, foot cream, tiny first aid kit (antacid, sleep aids, aspirin, bandaids) hand cream, eyemask, headphones & ipod, reading lamp and my phone/charger.  Every night I put a fresh cup of water (with a secure lid) on the table.   Under my nightstand I keep a lint roller (with cover) and a duster wand.   Occasionally I'll find I start using a certain item IN MY BEDROOM, and then I will maybe add it to a small box in my dresser drawer. This box contains: Hollywood fashion strips, safety pins, small pair of scissors for stray threads, and bra extenders.   If you find yourself getting up out of bed to get the same item several times, add it to the nightstand. Snack bars? Handwipes? Kleenex? Whatever it is YOU need at that time/place, add it in.   One box at a time. After unpacking the post-move essentials,  I brought one box inside (in the A/C, in the good lighting). Looking at all of them was overwhelming. I could do one box during commercials.   Not sure where I read this (I haunt de-clutter websites), but when I go through stuff I have 3 bins: purple is put-away (it goes in another room- I have a few of these); green is give-away, which usually gets transferred to a bigger thrift shop accumulation box; a large, black trash bag/bin. If it's white/clear it can be easy to reclaim items from the bag.   KonMari has a good philosophy on what to keep/toss. Flylady.com is helping me learn how to manage on-going, never-ending chores."
declutter,3cd2z0,temp4adhd,3,Sat Jul 11 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"lotions & shampoos   You don't have space, so get rid of them.   You can combine the shampoos and then save what you have space for only. Otherwise, they are unfinished because you didn't like what they did to your hair, so purge the guilt and enjoy nicer hair.  Okay also you can use leftover shampoos to scrub the toilet & shower stall. Go ahead and be liberal. It works great (shampoo is excellent on soap scum) and the bathroom smells great.    Do you still have any textbooks that you find worth keeping?   I held on to some textbooks all these years (I graduated in 1987). Imagine my excitement when my daughter majored in my same major, and came home with one of the exact same textbooks -- Shakespeare's complete works.   Unfortunately I couldn't lend her my copy as it's been completely buried in the basement for 15 years, and is likely covered in mold by now. Also even if it was easy to locate and not moldy, I filled mine up with lots of highlighters and notes.   The reason it has been buried all these years: see my thread recent thread (hoarding husband). I haven't really missed it and when we unbury it's getting tossed.   Cuz, ya know.... complete Shakespeare works are all online  now....    how do you stay on top of things and prevent the necessity of a full day of cleaning at the end of the week?

I can't seem to figure out where certain things would go.   Do you have a list of specific things that currently don't have ""a place""?

Label in large letters on the front of each, and if you fill one up just get another and label it NAME OF CLASS 2.   Stack 'em up on your desk or in a drawer.  You can also get ones that are smaller, or like this, or stick 'em in large manila envelopes.  Another option would be a hanging file box with hanging folders for each class, but that holds less than folders and in my opinion feels like more work to keep organized. Pick something super easy."

It really helps me, as long as I keep the categories simple (otherwise it's confusing). My office supplies are basically: pens, pencils, highlighter/markers; things I use to keep things together (staples/stapler, paperclips, binder clips, glue, tape); sharp things (scissors, utility knife, etc), and stuff I write on. The ruler just hangs around.   Where to put things? My guidelines are 'where do I use it' and 'what do I use it with'? Obviously you don't replace staples EVERY time you use the stapler, so they don't have to be married. Mouse/keyboard/pc are an obvious grouping. Paper, pen, pencil are pretty obvious (maybe you need a calculator in there too).  Also, as someone with ADHD, I've learned to be ok with multiples. I can spend 30 minutes wandering the house looking for scissors, or I can head to the dollar store, buy 5 pairs, and save hours of my life. I have pens in every room.   And I've learned that I have to monitor my organized stuff. I used to feel frustrated that I had to collect my pens, pencils, whatever from everywhere and replace them in my organized bin. But now I just realize the organized bin is the starting spot for things I use. I take them out, give them a life, and then return them home.   Regarding papers: can you find the same info in a usable form online quickly? Did you work hard on it and just want to keep it for pride (keep it)?   Some research papers I just kept the reference page so I'd have quick access to sources for future papers. Put like things together, hole bunch and bind.

But getting rid of the things kinda strips me bare.    The question is: what can you fill the hole with other than more things/shopping/addictive behaviours.  Can you focus this freed-up attention on hobbies, family, self betterment (classes)?    Something that I'm noticing with my declutter efforts is that I go in spurts.

When you anticipate an event (say your first Comic Con or going to the dentist when you know it's going to cost you a lot of money), your mind reserves space for that anticipation. Even subconsciously, you are putting in a lot of energy.  When the event comes to pass, your mind can stop anticipating. And then your brain cells and nerve ends are tired from working so hard all that time.  Decluttering is rewarding, but especially when you are decluttering stuff you are emotionally invested in, you are concentrating very hard and your brains are working very hard to process memories and experiences that are triggered by the stuff.  When you are done, your brain is tired. And that can manifest as feeling sad and depressed. Your head has worked really, really hard this weekend and it now just wants to sleep.

declutter,3c8dfz,katedogg,7,Mon Jul 6 12:52:28 2015 UTC,"when a person who has hoarder tendencies is made to give up his things, the hoarding becomes worse; he hoards more in future.  So be cautious.  Use some of your resources to get those two into counseling during and after the move.     You can hire professional packers.  What they do is come and put everything in boxes, boxes in truck, truck to new destination.  But you'll need to manage what goes where: The only things that move into your apartment with you to start with is your personal things and basic-daily-use furniture.  (a selection of clothes, toiletries, 1 couch, 1 microwave, 1 bed each, etc.....)  The rest should go in storage until you're settled in a permanent place.    But what I suggest is this:  Each person is responsible for his own storage.  Get three units, one for each hoarder and one shared for the other two of you.  If husband is the hoarder, he has his own unit where all of his boxes go.  Once you're in your permanent new home, he has 1 year to find a place for those items in your new home or get rid of them, then the storage unit is defunct/all items sold at auction, or he can continue to pay the storage fees with independently earned monies."

Idea: What if you get your husband a POD, have it parked outside for the next 4 weeks, and tell him that he can fill it with his stuff -- but ANYTHING that doesn't fit in the POD will be taken to a dumpster/donated. Period. You will need to get him boxes and supplies.   Then after he's done and the POD is sealed up, you have 4 weeks to do the trashing/donating process, run a garage sale, etc. -- but he DOES NOT get to participate. Period.  Getting him to agree to it would be the hard part! You need to take charge and drive this. He doesn't have the mental and emotional skills to do this himself, so you'll need to carry the water here.  I would plan to take at least one week off of work in July to do this.

We also have guests coming here and there this summer, that we need to work around a bit. (Reason we can't clear out the furniture in the guest bedroom quite yet -- two more weeks and we're clear).

If money isn't tight and decluttering is truly a goal then why are you moving out of a hoarder house with the hoarders? Do you plan to live with all of these people for the rest of your life? What's the long term plan?  I hate to say this, but if you're living with active hoarders, then chances are that trying to declutter their 15 year old basement hoard in trash-day based increments so that you can all move together into an even smaller living space is seriously putting the cart before the horse.  That said, your best bet is probably to call up one of those fill-up-a-dumpster-with-trash-and-we'll-cart-it-away-for-you companies. Re:   It's quite likely that most, if not all, of our furniture will not make it into our next life... However, we may wind up renting temporarily for a year before our next purchase, so we will probably want to hold on to our crappy old furniture for that transition year   Don't keep shit you don't need just to fill up space in a rental for a year. That logic is how you wind up with a 15 year old basement hoard in the first place. r/hoarding will have more resources and ideas that may be helpful for you!"

For the last 2 years or so I've chosen to only use one type of notebook.

I've also started including a very rough ""table of contents"" in the front of each one...as I often jump around between things I am working on and ideas for future projects, so a quick glance at the toc and I can generally tell if what I am looking for is in that notebook.  I've also gone to using only 1 side of the paper (because the scans come out much cleaner) and at some point (probably when my box gets full)....will probably have the spines cut off my notebooks and just scan them for archival reasons."

Accept my mind is different. I don't use traditional labels on file, I use stickers. Taxes? Year and a frowny face next to a doodle of the White House. Letters from ex-boyfriends? Hearts and a clock (long-ago love). It's so much faster for me to recognize the symbols.  Fun, colorful, and silly help me. As far as decluttering, I think small. Telescope technique: make a telescope shape with your hands. What you see through the opening is your goal for the day.   Sometimes I have a timer go off every 5 minutes and I think: am I doing what I planned on doing right now?   For big projects, I sit and make an action plan (I usually do this a couple times, and have learned to use pencil). My most recent one is cleaning the craft room:  A. Open the door (harder than one thinks to do)  B. Bring in dustrags, stepladder, dust extension rod, swiffer dust things, broom & dustpan, radio.  C. I've broken down which order to dust (ceiling, then fan, then bookshelf tops, etc).  D. Starting from the doorway and working to the left, I have listed teeny-tiny steps in very specific order. First item: trunk: dust cardboard boxes on top, remove the boxes, dust trunk top, pull out trunk & sweep/dust behind it; take one box at a time to the living room - cull the herd...  The benefits are once I get in there, the decisions of 'what' and 'what next' and 'what do I need' are already done. Reduces the overwhelming amount of mental decisions.  I would drive myself batshit insane if I try to tackle this all at once, so having it in teeny-tiny stages means it is doable, a little at a time. There is nothing time-sensitive in there, not like remembering a cake in the oven or something. I can do what my energy & focus allows.  I use my best time. Morning, after breakfast, after my adderall has had time to kick in a bit. I have a window of spectacular focus then.   Allow myself to have limits. When I get tired (physically or mentally), emotional, judgmental, etc, then I stop. Anything task I work on beyond that point is either going to make things worse (and have to be undone later), or come at such a high emotional/physical cost it will ruin the rest of my day.   As far as your notebooks, they are personal, important & irreplaceable. I keep things like that and I keep the physicality (not the digitized copy). I can scan a notebook and find a thought (note was half-way through, on the left page, near the top and next to a silly bird doodle) in a way which is impossible when digitized.

I am not sure if you're at all like me, but many of my notebooks were only partially filled - either I stopped halfway in to start in a fresh new notebook, or filled up part of my notebook with doodles and to-do lists - so I tore out ALL the pages and put them in binders. Like those massive, ""hold a zillion pages"" kind of binders.   For pages that were significantly smaller than 8.5 x 11"", I put multiple pages in those plastic sheet protector things. For pages that were at least 5"" tall, I hole punched them. Each project got its own divider sheet, so anything related a particular project had its own home in a binder. Then I just stuck all the pages in, repeating the process as necessary.    I refer to paper notes constantly and this has made a radical difference in finding the notes I need when I need them."

This gave them a very giving heart towards it. Another thing that has worked well is giving them a certain container and letting them fill it with things to give away. They can pick whatever they want as long as they fill the box/bin. I find it a bit easier because they don't have to try to pick favorites among a sea of toys. They just pick out things they are fine with letting go of. And it's not like they have to go through each item to see what they think. Just fill the box and you're done.

declutter,3byivr,wewillrun,12,Tue Jul 7 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting boxes as early as you can and start to pack up the non-essentials (like some kitchen equipment, seasonal items, etc.). If you already use it infrequently, it might be easier to part with, which could make it a good first step in the decluttering process.   For example... my parents have a waffle iron in their basement. It has been brought to three different houses over the past twenty some years. It has never been taken out of it's original packaging. I think that it's important to ask yourself: ""how much value do I really add to my home by having this thing that I never (or rarely) use?""  I think that this can be a good metric to use, because there's still stuff that is rarely used that brings a lot of happiness to our family - like our Christmas ornaments. We may only bring them out once a year, but it makes us happy and the boxes only occupy a little shelf space."
declutter,3byivr,lifesodandy,2,Fri Jul 3 06:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think asking yourself that question and then forcing yourself to answer it really puts the stuff you have in perspective. If that item isn't serving you, especially if it's gathering dust in the basement, just toss/donate it! Less weight to carry when moving to the next house!"
declutter,3byivr,Rosydoodles,11,Sat Jul 4 07:22:55 2015 UTC,"Go and find all your important stuff - things you don't necessarily use regularly but can't afford to lose. This is stuff like birth certificates, passports etc. Put that in a safe place, make the box bright, and write ""DO NOT THROW AWAY"" on it. Now go around everything else and look at it, if you've not used it in the last 12 months, you won't use it in the next 6 months and it doesn't have sentimental value you should probably get rid of it. Do 20 minutes or so a day - more on days when you have fewer commitments. Work your way through room by room, stuff you do need to move but won't need before then (Christmas decorations, for example) should be packed ASAP, and labelled. As you've got plenty of time make a list of stuff you've packed, this can be visual - photographing the contents of a box before sealing it is fine. You want this so if you come across something where you go ""I'm sure I packed this already!"" you can check without opening boxes.  Ripping DVDs your best option is Handbrake, it's not super fast, but you have a while - I used to stick one in, set a timer on my phone (with a bit added on), go do whatever and go back and stick a new DVD in when the timer rang. While it's slow and make take 3 hours, you only have to be present for 5 or so minutes.  For audio books try to find a program (such as AudioBookBinder on OS X) which will combine the multiple tracks into a chaptered audiobook file for you. And for music, you can use iTunes to rip it and get metadata (in MP3 format if you're not an iOS/iPod device person). Use the same ""stick it in, set it going, set a timer"" method as above.   If you have kids keep them involved in the process - they can assemble boxes, pack clothes that have been decluttered (which is nice to do with them so you don't have ""WHERE'S MY FAVOURITE TSHIRT?!?"" in a few weeks), and so on.  Remember: some stuff which should be decluttered will make it to your new place. If you have time to separate ""immediate needs"" from not so immediate when packing take your time to go through the not so immediate stuff when unpacking and purge again."

You can swap items, but you can't have more than X number of hangers when you're done.    Bag up the rest for sale on a facebook group or to donate.

Go through the room and put the things you absolutely want to keep in the box.  Too much to fill the box?  add a box.  But hopefully by going around and picking out just certain things to keep, you'll see that there's a lot you don't need to keep.     Could be you can do this in your mind with a virtual box.  I'm looking at a particular shelf I have.  I want to keep my doll, the mighty hooks, the safety pins, and the Zen statue.   I don't want the alarm clock, the stuffed dog, the vase, or the candle at my new place.  The paint brushes are a toss up:  I like my set, but I haven't used them in years.

I'd never get around to converting, though.  How many ware we talking about?  If they're important to you, I'd just find some nice storage boxes, pack them in that, and put them in the closet at the new place until you decide for sure what to do with them.    So, can you think of the thrift store as a rental place?  anything that's common and that you don't use often, drop there.  chances are when you need one you'll be able to ""borrow"" it back for a small fee.      Same with household furniture, lamps, etc:  unless they're sentimental, something you love, or high quality, just drop 'em at goodwill.

declutter,3byssf,score_,11,Fri Jul 3 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of things here:   If you are able to do this on your own, by all means, party on! If you keep struggling, look into hiring a Professional Organizer though. There is an association called the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) that has a website with organizer listings. Setup small blocks of time to complete very clear and well defined tasks. Don't push yourself more than two hours initially. Throw some affirmations into the mix as well! Start with the easier stuff first. Tackle clothes!  Your mental health is so very important in relation to your dis-eases and chronic conditions. Make it your priority to address that! Mental clutter is the root of the physical clutter!    You got this! Feel free to PM if you need to!"
declutter,3byssf,TheStephinator,3,Fri Jul 3 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for responding and offering your advice and encouragement!   That's a great point, sometimes I get tunnelvision and forget that I don't have to do this on my own.  I would go this route right off the bat, but I'd like to try to do this on my own.  It's the journey not the destination right?  I've adopted a minimalist approach to what I'd like to own at the end of this.  There are local charities that I will call once I've sorted through things to come pick it all up.  The one I have in mind for my city is a battered women and children shelter - if anyone knows of an online resource for finding local charities that will come pick up donations from your home, I'm sure that would be a useful link to many here.  Anyway, here is the NAPO link you mentioned:  http://www.napo.net/ I've been pushing it kind of hard today and my joints and muscles are on fire, but it feels good to chip away at the pile. Easiest first is a good approach to achieve small victories early on.  I'm taking a somewhat more challenging approach of taking care of time sensitive things first.  I've heard it said that the things that you're avoiding most often need to be done the worst.  I need to clear a path to my desk and take care of some time sensitive paperwork and things online and I'm dreading it... but those are things that have real deadlines, real financial consequences, and real affects on other people so it definitely is at the top of my list.  Clothes... good god I have wayyy to many.  Fashion used to be a thing I was into, and then with my health issues I went through a 50 pound weight fluctuation, so now I have a bunch of shit that doesn't fit me.  Makes it easier to sort them out I suppose! I'm seriously thinking about adopting a ""uniform"" approach to my clothes.  One less decision to make in the morning and it would open up entire closets worth of space.  Either way I'll have a large pile of new and nearly new clothes to donate, and hopefully someone else can enjoy them and the womens' shelter can generate some revenue from them. You are absolutely right, and I have already taken several steps to tackle this.  I just scheduled an appointment to begin counseling/therapy this month and the therapist has a lot of experience with organizational things, so I'm sure that will be beneficial.   Again, my approach to this is not to organize and consolidate, but to dispose of all that is not absolutely essential, so I feel like that cuts out a lot of the work. :)"
declutter,3byssf,TheStephinator,2,Sat Jul 4 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"Good for you with your awesome start! Yes, absolutely start with the time sensitive stuff! I like to make the analogy of peeling back layers on an onion. You may have an initial round of purging, feel content for awhile and then shed more in subsequent rounds. Heck, I'm still doing it after many years. I totally understand about the clothing. I've gained about 15 lbs. and really have a hard time letting go of certain pieces. I don't want to get comfortable at this weight, but I actually need stuff to wear. I've been phasing out the too small that are styles I don't like anymore, but the stuff I do like and it doesn't fit are really hard to let go of.   I hope you do some good self-care tonight and tackle some more tomorrow! Happy 4th! :)"

I recently helped my SO implement a change in diet to fix his major acid reflux and that has been a key part of it.

I read about a guy who's thing was Hawaiian shirts.  He had, like, 600 of them strung along a pole in his basement.  Each day he'd get one from the left side of the pole and put it on.  Each night he'd hang the shirt on the right side of the pole.  Rotation.  Enough shirts for a fresh shirt each day for 2 years.   But even though he enjoyed his Hawaiian shirts, I can't help but think he would've been just as happy with 150 or 300 of them.    My advice to you: do your own rotation.  Wear everything once.  enjoy your favorite outfits 30 times.  But Rotate!  Get those clothes back out of your home once you've enjoyed them!"
declutter,3byep1,sarautu,2,Fri Jul 3 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"I said the rotating thing in a few other posts. But you made a good point about the guy having enough shirts for 2 years. I almost admire that. haha. (I hate wearing the same thing too often). However at the end of the day, he's still wearing a Hawaiian shirt. And they all just kind of look the same to me. So I'm wearing tons of graphic tees. And those all kind of look the same to everyone else. I need to condense the ones I have. Dear satan let me try to do that...   What I wear doesn't really go out of date. I might have a few items in my closet that do though. So I'll try to sift through those. But I do try to rotate my clothing. So it's all well loved. Obviously I have a few special occasion items: my one dress -works for both weddings & funerals. And my costumes I wear every couple of years.   That's why I buy more clothes. I keep everything in rotation and add more stuff into the rotation but never really let stuff leave."

declutter,3byep1,fire_dawn,6,Fri Jul 3 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"And I know at some point down the road I'll end up getting more clothes.   You need to tackle that psychological problem before getting rid of them. It's pointless and a waste of time if you're just going to relapse and fill your space with new clothes. Think about why you want so much of them. Why would you want 5 items when a single versatile piece would do?   You can also try that method where you put away clothes you haven't worn in a long time in a box, after a while if you forget about their existence, it means you don't actually care for them and then you can try to give it away/sell on eBay/donate them. This is not going to be quick though.  Depends on your style, some people might want your clothes. Besides eBay, there's also Depop and Poshmark to sell clothes with. You may have more luck with Depop."
declutter,3byep1,lilfunky1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:11:53 2015 UTC,I like being costume-y and wearing fun clothes. I have colour coordinated stuff that I can mix and match. When I buy an item I think of the different things I can mix and match with.   But I got in a bad habit of buying graphic tees from places like teefury. Because it used to be hard for me to find shirts I liked. But I'm gonna go through each thing and try to pick out my favs. And then see about everything else being negotiable.   I do wear everything relatively often sans my few special occasion items: i.e. my single dress for both weddings and funerals. I rotate my t-shirts so they all get well loved.   Maybe I could do some sort of excel sheet where I see which ones I wear the most over a course of time. And maybe that'll help me declutter in the long run. I'm not sure. lol.

Thinking that any future partner would not want to have to go through the leftovers of my previous relationship, I eventually shredded/donated/recycled the rest.

declutter,3bofgd,galen42,3,Tue Jun 30 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Local libraries or the school you attended will sometimes take yearbooks.   If by desk trinkets you mean excess pens/office supplies, you might just drop the box off to a local school or Boys & Girls Club or similar.   Incomplete items: throw out or post to craigslist listing the items, stating they're broken/missing things and if someone wants them they need to take the entire box of items. Some folks use these things for crafts or whatever but it's too much to let them fiddle through what they want and don't. They can do that part at home and the rest of the stuff will no longer be my problem."

declutter,3bnpfw,carolinacp,4,Tue Jun 30 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"I'm currently doing this. I have been hoarding pretty much my whole life (I inherited that from my dad, thanks dad!) - I think what has triggered my recent whole-life purge is that my boyfriend is currently buying his first house and keeps dropping serious hints about me moving in with him, and while that's not a proposition I am seriously considering at the moment, I guess I don't want him to realise just how much crap I manage to accumulate. Also, what is the point in moving stuff you don't need to a new place? Am I going to need my old school uniform at my boyfriend's house? No, I'm not (not least because I weigh half as much now as I did when I was 18).  I would periodically throw a couple of pieces from my wardrobe once a year, but it was always very half assed and pretty much just so I could put more stuff in it. Something has clicked in my brain lately and I just don't want 'stuff' anymore. I started again with clothes because I realised I wear hardly any of the items I have and was keeping them mostly for 'just in case' scenarios (how often do I go out to places where a cocktail dress is necessary? Never). Once I developed that little ruthless streak that you need to be successful at getting rid of crap, it was hard to stop. I'm naturally very sentimental but you really need to ask yourself what you actually need and what you are only keeping because of some skewed sense of 'I might need that/want that/have to refer to that someday'.  Do I need to keep my old school books? Definitely not - gone. Do I need to keep my old university work? Well, that wasn't as long ago and because I actually paid for university I kind of feel like I should keep it... But I have my degree now and I'm not even remotely using it, if I ever need to know about Linnaean Classification I can just google that shit. Do I need to keep those ugly pieces of jewellery my aunt keeps giving me for Christmas? I've never worn any of them and she's never brought them up again after initially giving them to me - gone.  It is hard when it comes to my favourite old toys that I have fond memories of actually playing with, but if they have been untouched under my bed for the past ten years, why exactly am I keeping them? Are my future kids going to want to play with them? When they will probably have toys beyond what I can even imagine, hell no, they won't want my old shit. Identify the reason you want to keep it and find a workaround - take a picture so that one day you can show your kids, 'see what kind of toys we had when I was your age?', but then again, that's what google is for. Since I was about 14 I've been collecting favourite CDs in a box for when I eventually got a car, so I could keep them in my glovebox and always have badass music to hand - the second I got my licence, before I'd even looked at cars, I had bought one of those ipod car thingies on Amazon making my CD box redundant. This week, they were all sold.  As for suggestions on why I am decluttering, I don't really have any. My mother is supportive, although I don't think she appreciates the full reason why I am doing it. Plus, as much as she is always going on about tidying and getting rid of stuff, she is probably almost as much of a hoarder as I am (was). I've already told her I don't want extraneous stuff for Christmas, just useful stuff (socks, hair ties, the shampoo I actually use not the fancy one she thinks I want). Explaining that to the wider family is probably going to be hard, but we'll get to that."
declutter,3bnpfw,hann-tastic,6,Tue Jun 30 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input! Actually I really liked your suggestion about taking pictures of the toys I have because I completely agree, my kids won't be interested in my toys and neither am I so the only thing holding me back is my memories playing with them - I have a bad memory so having pictures of everything is very reassuring.  The same thing happened to me: something just clicked and I realized all these objects were holding me back, I felt too attached and that felt like a huge weight for me. Anyway, thank you and good luck, both decluttering and, whenever you feel ready, moving in with your boyfriend!"

Those are the ones to keep. These might be a favorite stuffed animal, blanket, or signed baseball card. Certain items may still serve a purpose, like a baptismal outfit passed down for generations. The vast majority of items from your childhood have already served their purpose and are finished making you happy. The soccer trophy gathering dust? It made you happy when you received it and gave you a sense of pride for a year or two, but now it's decades old. It served a purpose, but it is now no longer a sustainable source of joy or a functional object. It's okay to get rid of it.  Explain what you just told us to your parents.

To get myself motivated, my mom and I watched episodes of TLC's Hoarders.   I went through my closet and dresser where there were T-shirts from middle school, pairs of shoes I had worn maybe once or twice, and cheap jewelry I stopped wearing a decade ago. I donated all clothes and shoes, jewelry, and a few stuffed animals/toys to our local Goodwill (and kept the receipt for tax deduction purposes. I actually saved my parents $1800 from all of the well documented donations). I donated old prom dresses to a local organization that collects them and gives them to young ladies in need. I donated my unused art supplies to my high school's art department.   Everything else crowding my bedroom was like old magazines and other things that could be easily recycled.  It was easy to keep going after I realized how good it felt to get rid of useless things."

When you realize that you do not need it anymore even though you have great memories of it, just hold it in your hands for a moment, thank it for the good feeling it gave you at the time, and het rid of it by putting it in the trash or donating it.

This would apply to a pile of books which you don't really need but not to some of your favorite titles which you come back to regularly.   Also, it depends whether keeping these books bothers you or not. If you don't feel overwhelmed by them (obviously depends on the amount) then I wouldn't make a problem out of it. I still keep a few of my favorite books (less than 10) although I prefer Kindle. And when it comes to buying new ones, I always choose digital version."

Look at it this way: If you own a thing you don't use, it costs ""rent"" in your home by taking up space, both physically and mentally.

Your own stuff, in any spaces that are sort of ""yours"", like your closet, a desk, dresser, etc.  Then maybe move on to the communal stuff and spaces that are pretty low attachment, like the laundry room, bathroom, etc.  Decluttering is often contagious and hopefully by the time you're done with your own stuff, your housemates might start getting sucked in.

Shove all the junk into your dad's room, and if he complains, then tell him it's his stuff, and he has to deal with it. Cut of your grandmother's access to your children (please read the comments below) until she follows your rules about toys. Get your partner on your side. Explain to your kids what's going on and ease them into it.   Clean a little at a time. You're not going to get it done in a day, or even a week. But you can do it. Accept that.   Start by having easily-accessible bins of donate and junk. Drop stuff into them. If you're a packrat, it won''t be easy. Ask yourself if you've used the thing in the past year or two. No? Put it in one of those bins. Keep culling, slowly. You can try selling stuff, but don't try to get top dollar for it. It'll distract you from the purpose of this exercise, which is decluttering.

Children are not pawns to be used in leveraging control. The children can be dealt with by teaching them about their possessions and what should be done with things that are valued or loved anymore. The grandparent can be talked to about the excess of stuff and that it isn't welcome. It should be explained that time and love is what is valued and important, not presents.   I've been that pawn and I've been that cut off person. It causes tremendous hurt to everyone involved. Don't play that game unless it is for the safety and well-being of the children."

I didn't mean stop all contact with this person, but stop letting them show up at your home with stuff in their hands. Tell grandma to leave stuff in the car or visit her instead. It is a lot harder to give something to visitors and have them leave with it than it is to leave stuff behind at someone's home. I guess I sort of assumed the kid would be allowed contact, since that was always allowed to me as a child."
declutter,3bgmwb,Purrplecat,4,Mon Jun 29 09:28:17 2015 UTC,"Cutting off access to the children wouldn't be to punish the grandmother. It'd be to stop the never ending flow of stuff that would be the natural result of the grandmother's disrespect for OP's rules. (Hypothetical since it sounds like at this point OP has not communicated this rule yet. For all we know, grandma is completely reasonable and would totally respect the boundary.) However, it sounds like grandma is spoiling OP's kids on a regular basis against OP's will, and I would be highly shocked if OP hadn't brought that up to grandma at some point - meaning grandma is probably constantly disrespecting OP's parenting. It is totally reasonable to cut off access at that point. Spoiling kids, teaching them that their parents' rules don't matter, and contributing to their living in a pack rat environment hurts them. Grandma doesn't have a right to OP's kids. Like you said, they are not possessions - they are not toys that need to be shared equally so that grandma can be happy! It's all about what's best for the kids. If grandma can't get on board with that, then it's best that she be kept away until she can."

If all his stuff being there causes damages, he is responsible.   Set deadlines for clean-up. Agree with them on these, but don't make it be next month if it can be done next weekend. Be very clear about what you will do if they do not comply and it isn't because of an emergency. Then follow up on it if they don't comply.

Wherever it is easiest for you to start.  The garage?  The hallway/bedroom closet?  A particular corner?  And you need to start setting boundaries with your family.   Horizontal surfaces will be kept free of clutter from now on Everything must have a home and items will return to that home when they're not in use Your family isn't allowed to use your house as storage.  Their stuff stays in their spaces.  It sounds like your Grandmother needs to dial back the gift giving.  You need to give you son the gift of being able to appreciate something new and she's spoiling that opportunity with a deluge of gifts.   I hope that was helpful.  My favorite book for helping packrats in The Hoarder in You.  She goes through the emotional side of hoarding and then gives some good ideas for how to start decluttering."

declutter,3bgmwb,khattify,4,Tue Jun 30 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"How do you say stop giving your Great-Grandson so much shit, but without being offensive?   She treats your home like a storage unit and you're worried about offending her? You need to team up with your life long teammate, make some decisions about how things are going to be run in your house, and then implement them. Take charge of your life. The thing about standing up for yourself is it gets easier and easier the more you do it.   Start small. Pick a desk drawer, or a two foot square space that you want to be clear of clutter. Clear that space of clutter. Everything that you pick up, ask yourself which you would rather have: that item, or a clean, open home? If you're getting rid of it, put it in the trash or a give away every Saturday box. That box get emptied every Saturday, either by giving things away or throwing them away. If it's not worth giving away by either calling someone to get it, or taking it somewhere, then it's worthless, so throw it away. Do it every Saturday, every time. Every. Time.  Guard that new space once it's cleared out. That space is your clean, open home. Announce that it's a clean space and that nothing will be stored there, or it will immediately be thrown away without asking. If someone disrespects you by by storing their shit in your clean, open home, pick their shit up and throw it in the trash. Do not talk to them about it, don't apologize, don't rationalize your actions, don't give them a chance to move it. Throw it the fuck away. If it was important, they shouldn't have put it in the clean, open space. They can dig it out of the trash if they need to.  When are you ready to do more, increase the size of that clean, open space. Don't pick a different area of the house. Clear out another drawer right next to the first one, or make that two square feet into four. Clear things out, announce that it's a clean, open space, and protect it. Dump the Saturday box on Saturday.  Keep growing that space at a pace that you feel comfortable with. You'll probably end up with a room that has a bunch of shit in the corner that you've moved out of your clean, open space because you weren't ready to deal with it. That's fine. But once you get to that point, don't switch rooms. Stick to the plan. Increase your clean, open space into that corner. If other people have their shit in that corner, then it either gets thrown away or put in the give away every Saturday box. After you clear the space and fill the box, give them a call. Tell them that you were cleaning your clean, open space and that you don't have the room for their things, and that those things are now in the give away by next Saturday box, and they'll need to pick it up by Saturday or you'll have to either give it away or throw it away. You can't keep it in your clean, open space. Their shit doesn't go there. You can't keep it in the box. You'll be using that. If they can't pick it up, then it's not important enough for them to bother getting, so it's sure as shit not important enough for you to store in your clean, open space. Throw it the fuck away.  Congratulations, you now have a clean, open room. If you have thrown things away mercilessly, then you should be gaining the respect of those around you, a few feet at a time. Guard that room, but how choose a new area to conquer. If you chose your bedroom at first, try a more intimidating area, such as a room where your Dad's shit get piled up. Pick a two foot square area, put things in the trash and in the box, announce that you have taken new territory, make new laws that must be followed, clearly state the consequences of breaking the laws, dump the box on Saturday, and continue expanding your empire."

I told her that if I say no more clothing in a particular size and she gets it anyways, I'll donate it. I followed through on that once, told her so, and she hasn't done it since. You could do the same thing with toys. Also for the toys, anything MIL buys as a gift goes right back to her house for when my daughter is playing there. This is especially true if the item is large, my MIL currently has an easel, play table and chairs, mini tent with one of those nylon tunnels, and a couple of large sized playsets that I sent right back to her place with her. She has really cut down on the gifts since then, because her house is now crowded with toys too."

Just looking around each room and thinking, ""Does this item spark joy? And if not, does it serve a necessary purpose?""  I have donated boxes and boxes of things that were really important, special or meaningful to the person I used to be (pink used to make me feel there was a hope of happiness in my future) and started thinking about what I like now.   90% of my Hello Kitty collection went at once. I'm holding on to things that are useful and would be expensive to replace immediately (car cover seats, etc,).   I'm not sure if it was from her book or her article on slate.com, but she mentioned most of the stuff we keep is from guilt or fear. I had not comprehended the amount of stuff I kept just because I didn't want to hurt the feelings of the gifter (especially my husband, who has an up-close view of his gifts).   Her explanation of the gift-giving interaction as the actual gift, and the item just being a symbol, was freeing. If I kept every single gift I was ever given, I'd need a warehouse. Glittery erasers, pac-man magnets, rollerblades, dolls & doll furniture...I would still have all those things from my childhood if I hadn't given myself permission to pass them on.   I am really proud- each bookshelf I go through I've gotten rid of at least half the books. I realized I have a pattern of buying books geared toward the person I thought I should be, or expected myself to be as an educated citizen of the world.  So, all my books about depressing ethnic/cultural history - gone; books about important wars in history, biographies of world-leaders, super-effectiveness in daily life strategy...gone, gone, gone.

declutter,3b92r9,zinconinco13,52,Fri Jun 26 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"i just ran into this brain snag lately.  I was thinking about the old license plates my grandpa had up on his garage wall about 40 years ago.  someone came by one time and took 'em without his permission.  At the time, he was just upset about someone invading his space and messing with his stuff without asking.  Today, those same license plates sell at the antique store for $100 each.  That thief probably took (if you actually found someone to buy each plate for $100) about $4,000 of loot from my grandpa.  But how did we know then that they would be worth that much now?    And...  Do you really want to live in a hoarder-type household, holding on to this stuff based on what it might be worth?    Did you read that article posted here the other day about the folks who have been collecting postcards?  The collection is valuable to them, but they can't find anyone ( anyone! ) who wants their collection.  All that time and money and space and preservation and focus on something no-one wants.    Same with my niece's beanie babies.  Let's pretend she has 500 babies.  (I don't know the number.)  What were they selling for back when they were new?  an average of $5 per baby?  That's $2500.  If her family had put that money into a compounding savings account rather than beanie babies, she'd have a pretty good retirement nest egg growing by now.  Instead she's got a few big boxes she's got to lug around with each move and that risk getting damp, mold, bugs, etc.  What a monkey to hang around you neck.    These physical possessions might be worth something, but they weigh us down.  They make us poorer in spirit, more short sighted, more greedy, more selfish.  They enhance the negative tenancies we humans have.      Better to let go.  Whether you're a religious person or not, there's an old saying that a rich guy couldn't pass through they eye of the needle.  Know why?  He's got too much crap to carry around.    You can choose a life where money and/or possessions are not the thing you are chasing.  You have to make the choice what you prioritize in life, and what you want to spend time on.    Your choices will define who you are.  They'll effect the person you become."

Following this logic I have give away things with monetary value - but of no value to me - to people who need it. And the reward of seeing someone's face light up at an unexpected gift is worth more than any amount of money

I put my foot down finally and decided anything ""worth"" under $50 was not worth the effort to deal with Ebay etc. So anything of value I boxed up and took to charities that are for animal welfare. That way I actually feel like those things went to a good cause. Even if the charities get a fraction of the value of them, at least the money is going to somewhere that I have zero regrets about.  TL:DR Totally agree. Same problem here. Find a charity that you believe in and you can part with things with much greater ease."

Well, warm weather rolled around and we just kept putting off the yard sale.  There was always a reason why we could't do it.  So, one weekend I said, 'Fuck it' and took it all to the Goodwill.  It opened up a chunk of space in my garage, and the relief I had about not having to worry about that stuff any more and plan out the garage sale and all that was worth far more to me than the $75-100 I might have made in the sale.

You will quickly find most stuff is not worth near what it was new.  It is really simple to do and free.  There is a high flake factor so I usually make people come to me only at times that work for me.  Another approach is to give it as gifts. We all know people love stuff so next time you visit people or they visit you ask them if they want it.  Just don't be offended if they don't want it or see value in it. Along the same lines you can always donate stuff to various charity places.  To be honest I found that after I gave away stuff of value I had no anxiety about it.  It was really stressful to do it but once it was gone I could care less.  I suspect that my value of the item's worth was the only reason I kept it so long. There was no sentimental value so once it was gone I moved on much quicker than the stuff that wasn't worth anything but had emotional meaning."

Next I'd say to go somewhere else for an hour and make as comprehensive of a list as you can about what to pack for your new house. Go back to your current home and whatever's not on the list is likely not important. Donate it, trash it, etc but think hard about if you truly need to keep it.

I decided I wanted to whittle my clothing down and create a capsule wardrobe. One of neatest things I ever did! I love the color blue, and denim, so now everything can be mixed & matched, AND looks so pretty hanging in my closet :)  One last tip, REALLY watch against using corrugated cardboard boxes to move. Roaches LOVE those things (shudder), especially boxes from grocery stores/pet food/garage. Buy brand new moving boxes if you can, or plain extra strength garbage bags.

Declutter you own stuff first, and live with that for a few months before taking any other steps. You can be a hypocrite telling him to get rid of his clothes when yours are nearly as bad.  Second, don't do his laundry. a) you shouldn't have to deal with someone elses deliberate clutter and b) it will make him aware of what a hassle having so many clothes. My SO and I have separate dirty laundry baskets because I got sick of my things getting lost in mountains of his things.  Third, it's not the number of things that's the problem, it's the space they take up and the organisation of them. If it was contained in a fair share of space and neat you wouldn't have a problem with it would you? Instead of saying ""you have too many clothes and you need to get rid of some"" say ""you need to keep your clothes in your part of the cupboard, not taking over the space for my clothes and spilling out onto the floor."" That will probably mean that he has to get rid of some but he can figure that out for himself rather than you telling him to.  Any clothes that are in boxes or baskets elsewhere in the house, tell him he needs to go through them and anything the he doesn't want to wear you'll take to goodwill for him. If they're just sitting there, they're not getting used and they're taking up space that needs to be used for other things (maybe you want a place to do yoga, or art or something). In a way, they're already at goodwill because he's not using them, and he's going to have to go through a whole lot of things he doesn't want to find one thing he might want.  Put a big bag or box in your closet or next to your drawers for goodwill. That way as you and him go through your daily lives you can put things in it when you realise you no longer want to wear it, rather than having to go through everything at once. Just tell him it's for you but he can chuck stuff in there too."

Even though it's just a boring box, it is symbolic. Like the Pit of Sarlak, nothing that goes in ever returns.  A huge part of the mindset is knowing exactly where the discard items are going. They don't get stuck in little piles all over the house, tempting and begging to stay.   edit: typos from the kindle"

This might be one of the more successful ways to convince him.  Whatever you do, don't make your own decisions about his stuff; you are only there to help. There are few faster ways to someone's bad side than throwing out things they own.  I know it's a tough spot, but if you deal with your stuff first and lead by example he might follow suit.

Might want to look into repair services to recover it for personal use. If not, e-waste recycling is the way to go. There are also certain charity initiatives who accept broken electronics to salvage them for parts or to repair them and give them a second life.   As for cases, keep them with the phone.

Include your kid in the process. Explain what you are doing and what you hope to achieve by doing it. Tell your child about your vision for your life and your home. Little kids never think we're crazy!  Do it during your kid's nap, after your kid goes to bed, before your kid gets up in the morning. Whatever. Just do it. It is SO worth it. I feel so much freer since I've finished. I have more time to play with my kids and I don't always have this gloomy cloud of tidying and housework hanging over my head when I'm trying to focus on them.  If you're having trouble feeling the motivation, start by picking the room you spend most time in. The lounge? Playroom? Whatever. Clear EVERYTHING out of it. Seriously, everything. Maybe leave the couches. But anything you can get out of there, do it. Give it a top to toe clean like you've never cleaned before. Then move the absolute bare minimum of stuff back in.

Keep. Hold the next book - does it spark joy? No? It goes.  Make decisions on first thoughts & trust your initial instict.  The books you said no to - those leave the house that same day.

You do not need to go through things item by item. Start with a small section of the category and go through every item.  You could do a box a day, a genre a day like others have suggested, or a room a day. Look at everything you have left altogether.        This helps me build up to the Kondo method of looking at everything at once without becoming overwhelmed."

That way instead of having a row of unsightly albums, all pictures would be contained in one rather attractive dresser.

declutter,39qlmv,mhende,22,Sat Jun 13 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"We used to live in a house with a damp, spooky, gross basement down rickety old stairs where our washer and dryer were. Needless to say we hated going down there, so for a long time we accumulated more clothes instead of washing more frequently. It felt like we didn't have enough jeans at 8 per person because they were always in the laundry. I'd do one or two loads regularly, but there was always a backup.  Well we finally moved and our new home has first floor laundry (which was a requirement of mine!) but our laundry problems followed. How do you possibly keep that amount of clothes clean when you don't even have the space to put them if they were all clean at once! It was a never ending cycle. There were always clothes in the hampers in the laundry room, and full dressers and closets at the same time.  Finally wised up. Took all the laundry down to the laundromat. 60 bucks later they're all clean. Having to fold that much laundry helps you make choices easy! After hours in a hot laundromat it was easy to say ""no, that is not worth the effort of folding because I don't like it that much.   I've always been big, so I would keep clothes I didn't like because it was hard to find clothes that fit. I've lost a good amount of weight and am still losing so it was easy to get red of anything too big for me, or that didn't make me feel good when I wore it. An epiphany came when my mom (who came to help me decide what to get rid of) told me that she has never liked sleeves with elastic at the bottom on me because they make my arms look pinched and bigger. So I got rid of like 20 shirts that were like that.  You guys, we had 36 pairs of sleep pants... Before I was scared to think about getting rid of stuff, but now I feel free of it!"

Papers, you either need them or you don't. Books, outside of longtime favorites, can be discarded and always borrowed from a library or read electronically so they don't take up physical space. Same with movies. Clothes, however, are easy to accumulate as a person worries about weight fluctuation, seasonal wear, if they want to save pieces to pass on to other family members or if they want to take on DIY or sewing projects, so on. It's crazy how difficult it can be to whittle this group down at times."

declutter,39fzr6,lilfunky1,4,Thu Jun 11 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely seconding u/katelikesgiants' advice. I have only four (five?) cabinets and two drawers and I cook, bake, can and otherwise process foods in here regularly and fairly efficiently. I don't have to store stuff in the oven and I have a complete table setting for four, but enough dishware/flatware to serve up to seven. I wouldn't have been able to pull it off without cabinet organization items. This is what my two most challenging cabinets look like right now. The second cabinet with spices and condiments has no built in shelf (zero vertical storage,) that's why it looks weird.  Aside from this, I have only two under-counter cabinets that hold all pots, pans, bakeware, large mixing bowls and small appliances. I do use a standing lid rack that holds my cutting boards and muffin tins as well as lids, and have found that my few baking sheets/pizza stone/wire racks stack nicely underneath it.   The rest of it is just smart stacking. Little stuff stacked in/on bigger stuff. Stuff that sees near daily use up front/eye level. Not so often used, stored in back/above/below. I have sheets of paper towel between the non-stick items I (carefully) stack together so nothing scratches. Doing it this way allows me to stack saucepans with skillets and griddles (largest to smallest,) something a ""pan organizer"" won't allow. The only things that don't fit in my kitchen are my mason jars.   I also have no pantry, so I have one of these so that large staples don't take up cabinet space. One of my drawers holds my silverware in an organizer, with my knives (and peelers and microplane) sheathed next to the organizer. The other drawer holds everything else. My only advice; have a silverware organizer only and just keep your other drawers neat. (Most) drawer organizers take up more room and are more limiting than you might think.   Wow this got long, sorry. Hopefully it helps!"

My solution was to use 1 upper cabinet by the sink for dishes, cups, glasses, serving bowls/platters.  The lower cabinet below that stored tupperware, pitchers, and (in the back-hard-to-reach area) heavy roasting pans and rarely used dishes.  In the other upper cabinet by the sink I stored dry foods (rice, flour, sugar, pancake mix, powdered drinks) recipes, and spices on a lazy susan.  The lower cabinet was for cleaning supplies and plastic bags.  Under the sink was for canned goods.  Silverware in one of the drawers.  (Oddly, the other 4 drawers were used for tools and junk - spousal sharing, anybody?)  The stairwell that led off the kitchen served dual purpose as a closet, in the sense that there were hooks along the back wall for coats and one shelf up high, and that's where I'd store my Cuisinart, popcorn maker, and bowls too big for the sink cabinet.  I hung my big frying pan on one of the hooks.  Linens (tea towels and whatnot) were stored in one of the bedrooms in a chest of drawers.  Druthers would've been one of the tool/junk drawers in the kitchen.  Hello.    The stove had a storage compartment underneath, and that's where I'd keep frequently used pots.  The pans were stored in the oven itself when off, or on the bedroom dresser when the oven was on."

Maybe skip clothes and move on to something else? I do want to try the folding thing soon though - it caught my attention as something novel, and I think it'd amuse me enough to keep folding clothes, lol. But the next step was books, and honestly, I think I could start there. At this point I'm kinda over my manga collections, and most of my newer books are on my tablet thanks to ebooks and Amazon.  So maybe leave clothes for last instead of doing them first? I don't really know how flexible the process is, but she did say to start with clothes since they're 'easy.' Which for me, they really aren't in some ways.  You're right though, the thought of tossing out all my pre-transition clothes made me smile. So maybe I should look at leaving clothes last as less of a ""I can't do this yet"" and more as a ""Guess what I get to do when I'm done with all this other mess!"""

I'm currently finishing up a job and in 6 months will be moving again and completely changing what I'm doing and how I'm doing it, and I've made a mental note of all the clothes I know I won't be taking with me, and will donate. It's comforting when I look at my wardrobe and think ""man, I'm tired of that shirt, I don't really like it anymore/it fits me weird and looks terrible""  to be able to think ""sweet, I get to get rid of it in 6 months!""  It's delayed gratification that will hopefully not be too detrimental to your mental health in the meantime, but if you focus on other areas, and leave the clothes as a final victory (or even a halfway victory, depending on when you have the money to change your wardrobe).

My big hitch in decluttering are my collections.  I pruned down my Little Mermaid collection a fair bit, which took a lot of willpower - but reminding myself that by getting rid of the cheap trinkets and broken pieces, I was making room for the bigger, more expensive pieces I truly like soothed the pain a lot.

Look at the positive; for example the replacement rug you got, that mug you enjoy your tea out of.. Not at the negative like the stuff you got rid of.  I was brought up to keep everything, even broken things because 'one day I might want or need them' or 'the materials could be made into something new' or 'It will fixed and given to your future children one day'. This made me really paranoid about anything I was given because I felt I had to keep it forever. Now, after getting rid of something I know that I can buy it again, it's just a thing and it's not the end of the world. Tossing something that is broken clears the way for other things to be enjoyed."
declutter,3917nf,GoodNewsIsOnTheWay,43,Mon Jun 8 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid cross stitcher myself, as well as a big believer on Marie Kondo's philosophy of tidying up and living that way (highly recommend googleing her if you havent heard of her.)  You say you ""can't just throw away hours worth"" of your mom's handiwork. It's hard to tell from your words why you feel that way.   If you don't actually like the piece yourself (and you seem to think it's awkward to hang in your home), then your statement is coming from a feeling of guilt. You feel that she worked hard on the project and you want to respect that effort. Throwing it away feels like you aren't valuing her work. To that I would say these things:  1) At least for me, a big part of the joy of cross stitch is the act of creation itself. There have even been some pieces that I totally scrapped after I was finished because I didn't actually like the pattern for use in decorating my own house, and I'd had my fun doing the actual stitching. This birth announcement probably gave your mom a lot of joy just in its creation. That was a big part of its purpose. 2) I believe the other purpose the announcement had was to be an expression of her joy that you were born. It had years of value that it gave her by hanging on her wall and reminding her of the happy event of your birth in her life.   My guess is that even though it's an announcement of your birth, it was never actually created for you. It was created for HER, and it did an excellent job of fulfilling its purpose while she was alive.   So as Marie Kondo would say, you can acknowledge that it was useful and beautiful for many years, and then let it go. It doesn't seem to be something you actually want to keep for yourself, and that's okay, because it was for her all along."

I'm not a textile expert though, YMMV.  The plate is probably one of those things, specifically ordered for you but one of many personalized plates ever produced. For me, a plate wouldn't hold the same value as a cross stitched announcement a loved one made. I don't know if that helps you let go of the guilt a little bit. Good luck."

Just a simple Rubbermaid you can tuck away and won't take up too much room. My rule is no more than two boxes of keepsakes. If it's more than two, then there's probably a few things in there that I really don't need. Do this for your kids too! Save their artwork in a large folder that will fit in the box.  It's all about organization and not just throwing it in.  Make sure everything can fit in a box nicely and the you won't regret saying goodbye.

I would take the cross stitch picture out of the frame and either file it away flat or even ask your mother if she would like to hold onto it for you.   I honestly think such needlework was more for the parent's pleasure than their child's.  My own mother made dozens and dozens of cross stitch pictures, ornaments and embellished clothing items.  There were even clear plastic mugs where cross stitch panels could be inserted, making for personalized drinking cups for the kids.   What to do with such stuff?  Take a picture of the sweet things and donate them, if possible.

I didn't make any of them (I don't cross-stitch). I have them all hanging on the same wall in my home. When my kids finally leave the nest, they will take theirs with them and it's up to them what happens to them. When I kick the bucket, they'll decide whether to keep the ones about me. I wouldn't feel the least bit upset if they decided to toss all of them, even though, yes, they represent hours of love and labor. But they were gifts, not contracts."
declutter,3917nf,funchy,9,Tue Jun 9 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on having kids?   These sound like interesting family heirlooms.  Especially the cross stitch which is handmade.     If you can't keep the stuff, there is a market for many types of cross stitch even if it's just a name and date.    Some antiques collectibles places might spend a few dollars to buy it from you."
declutter,3917nf,kairisika,14,Mon Jun 8 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"I sure as heck don't want my mother's cross-stitch birth announcement.    Most ""family heirlooms"" are just crap loaded with generations of guilt that prevent anyone from throwing them away."
declutter,3917nf,Limberine,3,Tue Jun 9 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"If I didn't want to display the cross stitch I'd take it out of it's frame and store it flat in a ziplock bag, probably in the bottom of one of my clothes drawers. It's safe and taking up no space. I think I would be much less sentimental about keeping the decorative plate, I'd take a photo and let it go."

One of the items I sold was to a man who has been searching for this very thing for years & wanted to give it to his wife as a surprise gift as it had some very special meaning to the both of them. It was an original Simon game, still in the original box. I kept that game for all these years, for why....I dunno. But maybe the reason I kept it was to be the reason this guy to finally find exactly what he was looking for to spark joy for someone else. Either way - it's a win win for all."

declutter,38yevb,Nagaempress,16,Sun Jun 7 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"It's a concept called loss aversion.  Humans are predictably irrational when it comes to loosing something they have.  Give a person a free coffee cup and then offer to buy it for a dollar and they'll say no.  If instead you ask if they'd buy it for a dollar they'll say no.    When the hats got ruined they became ""worthless"" and you were no longer tripped up by loss aversion."

declutter,38yevb,BadLuckNovelist,9,Mon Jun 8 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"My best guess, sunk costs.  If something has obviously turned to garbage (moldy hats not safe to wear) it's easy to accept its demise to the garbage can.  But if something is still usable (that could be donated) you tend to want to keep it because you'll think back to how much money you spent on it and how it would be a waste to not have it anymore."
declutter,38yevb,redshoewearer,3,Mon Jun 8 12:58:23 2015 UTC,This is giving me a lot of insight. I would like to turn that into a let someone else use it and then instead of it being wasted then it has a use and value.
declutter,38yevb,NoranaC,7,Mon Jun 8 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"One reason could be it's quicker.  When you are donating something, you have to figure out if it's in decent enough shape to donate, who to donate it to, bag/box it up, and take it to the donation center - which depending on your area can eat up a chunk of time.  That is in opposition to tossing it, that literally just requires putting it in the bin.  Two seconds and done."

declutter,38yevb,megabyte1,6,Mon Jun 8 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"It is easier simply because it is physically easier - once something is ruined, there's no decision making burden. We had clothes that we needed to go through and were planning to donate somewhere. Then one of our kitties who was sick at the time peed on them. We bagged them up and tossed them. There was no decision left to be made."
declutter,38yevb,megabyte1,3,Sun Jun 7 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"I think that is very true for me. Its like I said before in a comment .

declutter,38yevb,megabyte1,3,Sun Jun 7 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I have better luck selling things on eBay for 99c + shipping than donating them, esp more obscure items. Usually there's a community of collectors that look for these things and happy to get them so cheaply."

declutter,38ugmk,CrAzyCatDame,27,Sat Jun 6 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"purge, purge, purge.  NEVER keep clothing that is too small for you unless you are actively and successfully losing weight, and even then, you will want to buy new clothing as a reward for losing the weight."
declutter,38ugmk,kanooka,5,Sat Jun 6 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, some of them are within 10 lbs and I am working on it but you are right, it would be nicer to get different things once I get to the end of the weight loss."
declutter,38ugmk,ChagataiChinua,13,Sun Jun 7 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"I recently lost a lot of weight, and during that time I had to move through a number of different clothing sizes. I can't deny that it was convenient that I had held onto a lot of things that didn't fit any more, especially since I didn't need them for very long as I passed through that size again.  But if I could go back to when I first outgrew them and make the decision again, I would have let them go.   I've hauled those clothes a couple of thousand miles in several different moves - packed them, unpacked them, had them in storage cases in closets. I've had to think about them - should I just get rid of them? Is it time to take them off the rack in the closet and put them away?  Even now, their style and cut isn't what I would choose and it's not very current. They ""will do,"" but they aren't what I would choose.   So I'd rather have let them go and then gone out and addressed the problem of getting smaller again if and when it happened. When I think about the time, energy, and money I've spent on ""just in case"" for a lot of things, it adds up to more than it would take to just handle the few of those things that actually happen."
declutter,38ugmk,Waeh-aeh,3,Sun Jun 7 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah a few of the items have come on several moves with me. And the fit will probably not be right even when I get to that size again, most of this stuff would fit within 10 lbs. But yeah dragging them around isn't worth it in the long run I am sure."
declutter,38ugmk,idamayer,5,Sun Jun 7 02:42:57 2015 UTC,"When I ran in to this, I decided to save some things because I didn't think I would want to spend the money on a full wardrobe each time the clothes I have hanging up became too baggy. I saved my nicest jeans and 1-2 of my favorite shirts in each size. There were so few clothes that I just folded them and stacked them into a small tub from smallest to biggest and put it on a hard to reach shelf in my closet. If I had more I probably would have used space bags. If I start making more money or stop losing weight I would probably toss the whole lot."
declutter,38ugmk,drekiss,4,Sun Jun 7 20:07:02 2015 UTC,I vote clothing swap with friends - give away what doesn't fit so it gets some love and use. IMO it feels different to give a much-loved item to someone you care about than to a stranger.

declutter,38rkpq,techrat_reddit,9,Sat Jun 6 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"The trick is to deal with it as soon as you get the email.  Whenever you check your emails you need to decide what to do with each one.  Either archive/delete immediately, put events into your calendar then archive/delete, reply to those that need short response then archive/delete.  If it requires a longer response or more time to think about it put it on your to do list and archive/delete.  I also have a ""reset to zero"" on Sunday nights where I have to do something about anything that go left behind and is sitting in my inbox.    Another tip is to unsubscribe from everything that you can."
declutter,38rkpq,jacarandaspoon,4,Sat Jun 6 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer.  I've gone through and unsubscribed from everything, which eliminates most of the influx of email and since most of it is ads, it helps to control my consumer tendencies.  And even better, I'm less distracted throughout the day because my phone is beeping A LOT less with new emails.  If you use Gmail, you can use filters and Google Scripts to automatically deal with a lot of your email.  I have filters setup to automatically label emails to archive when they've been read (ArchiveRead) to delete after 24 hours whether read or not (DeleteLater).  Some get both labels so they're out of my inbox as soon as I read them and automatically purged after 24 hours.  Others are just set to delete after 24 hours.  Automating this way takes the vast majority of the work out of cleaning your inbox."
declutter,38rkpq,ChedaChayz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"This. Also make sure you're only saving what needs to be saved and don't overcomplicate your archive system. I've seen people with huge amounts of custom folders for every kind of bill, receipt, website, etc. I only have three categories: work, personal and accounts. It's more important to make the system easy for archiving emails than it is to make it easy for finding them (because let's be honest, you're going to use the search function for that anyway.)"
declutter,38rkpq,katedogg,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:36:23 2015 UTC,I just leave everything in one folder and use search to find what I need. I've had to find receipts from 2010 and didn't have much problem as long as I had at least some vague idea of what I was looking for.
declutter,38rkpq,MaunaLoona,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"What helps me is creating a number of folders (or labels if using Gmail) and then setting automatic filters. For example, if an email arrives from a certain email address, automatically move it to a specified folder.  This way you can filter out promotional emails from emailed bills, or emails confirming an order has shipped, or emails from a particular person.  You can then give your attention to things you deem important without being weighed down by all the other emails that come in.  Regularly clean out the folders that stack up with emails you've decided aren't important enough to read.  Edit: Let me know if you'd like help setting something like this up."
declutter,38rkpq,Goldii,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:51:45 2015 UTC,Actually one thing  might be to archive everything in a separate archive--so if you delete something by mistake you will always have a copy. See for example Mailstore Home as a program to do this:  http://www.mailstore.com/en/mailstore-home-email-archiving.aspx  Likewise as mentioned set up separate folders for low priority stuff.
declutter,38rkpq,pasttense,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:12:36 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I've been where you are. I went through and batch-deleted promo emails and archived just about everything else.  My system is to forget about inbox zero - it's not sustainable for me. I keep it to one page in gmail, which is 50 emails. I keep between 30 and 50 in there. If I creep above 50, I take five minutes to go through and filter out what I don't need. The 30ish that are in there tend to be shipping notifications of things I haven't received yet and download links I haven't used yet.  Find something that works for you, unsubscribe from as much as possible, and good luck!"
declutter,38rkpq,stancyclops,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:38:02 2015 UTC,Set up filters that throw everything that is not-important into a folder called not-important (things you dont need to read but you sometimes wanna go and check like newsletters) Archive all emails you don't need to act upon for latter reference (you can always use search function to find them) Process all emails requiring an inbox (when done archive them too) and do this every day untill you reach zero emails in your inbox
declutter,38rkpq,Smartare,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:39:15 2015 UTC,"Check your email twice a day.  Your inbox is not a to-do list. You need to empty it every time you check it.  If the email takes 2 minutes or less to do, do it and archive.  If the email creates a task, then create a new task on your task list, add a link to the email in the notes field if necessary, and then archive the email.  If the email creates a document you need for later, file it in your filing cabinet (virtual like Evernote or real like a...filing cabinet).  Your email is not a to-do list."
declutter,38pv0y,semen_drinker,11,Fri Jun 5 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"How about a 'decluttering craft project', where you deliberately start using a good percentage of what you're storing (the things you won't automatically replace)... that way you're both using the stuff and decluttering at the same time.  Without seeing what you've got it's hard to suggest something, but look at the bulkier/multiple items and try to get motivated to use them.  Plan B would be to envisage how you want the space to look and ignore the functionality of everything that challenges that look - doesn't matter if you 'might' use it, it goes because it's spoiling your space.  Get excited about starting the room from scratch and planning it for good use, rather than focusing on individual craft items."
declutter,38pv0y,city17_dweller,4,Sat Jun 6 05:00:32 2015 UTC,"I have one of those craft rooms, too!  Just last week I got out all the scrapbooking markers and pens.  I tested out each one while watching reruns of Big Bang Theory and drinking margaritas.  Turns out a whole bunch of them had already dried up.  Now I have all the good pens neatly stored in a plastic bin and the useless ones randomly tossed in the garbage.  Next week:  acrylic paints.  Stay tuned!"
declutter,38pv0y,texasflower,9,Fri Jun 5 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"I just got rid of  a load of fabric. I've been working on a dress since I was 17 (I'm now 20). I kept thinking 'I'll make this dress, I will' but I never did. I threw the dress fabric but not the machine. A sewing machine is something you can own for life and use and use again. Now I just have a tiny little sewing box and the machine (as well as the plug). I think my trick is: If I want to make something enough, I'll buy the 'raw materials' to make it. Then I can properly choose which colour of fabric to use, or which kind of buttons to use, from the wide selection of the shop, rather than settling for something not so good but just because I've had it collecting dust for 2 years."
declutter,38pv0y,Moolemon,3,Fri Jun 5 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"You have a good point there. I just recently realized that every time I start a project, I buy the materials, so there's not much of a point to keeping a stash.  Maybe someday if I start quilting, but today is not that day!"
declutter,38pv0y,stancyclops,6,Mon Jun 8 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Do you need to use that room for anything other than craft? It's just currently so busy/full that you can't use it effectively? In which case, that's your workshop. I'd probably suggest as much shelving as would fit. My Mum is very arty and has a room just like that. Full of fabrics, an industrial sewing machine and tons of supplies. But with the fabrics, she's got them on shelving, with the fabric boxed (mostly by colour) and it's all pretty accessible and easy to use."
declutter,38pv0y,davewasthere,6,Sat Jun 6 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone. Lots of great advice. I notice several people mentioned dealing with the fabric and maybe I made that too much of a focus but the fabric was not a huge collection. But anyways, I took a little of everyone's advice. I weeded through products that were no longer usable (old paint, dried up glue, etc) and I got rid of things I didn't foresee myself using in the future. I also realized that apparently several boxes I had were just empty. I had forgotten that I purchased extra (photo type boxes) so that all would match and I put them all in the built ins but I realize that was silly. That was valuable space. I condensed the boxes and it made some space so between that and the things I got rid of, I can now say I'm 85% happy with my craft room which is a huge improvement. Still need to perhaps rearrange a bit to make things accessible in a way that makes more sense to me but it's a great start and I want to thank you all so so much!!!"
declutter,38pv0y,PuffinTheMuffin,5,Mon Jun 8 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I box it all up in a plastic bin and stick it somewhere out of sight.  My sewing is stuck in two plastic bins right now.  If you've got more than 5 crafts, I'd suggest you pare down.  Otherwise, you can just store what you've got in bins and figure out how to store them so that they are out of the way.  If your current space is too small for it, well that's just the cost of having a small space, you'll need to ditch a craft or hobby."
declutter,38pv0y,wewillrun,3,Sat Jun 6 09:50:54 2015 UTC,"If I get rid of it, I know within a few months I'll see something I want to sew and I'll regret getting rid of it and it's too pricey to repurchase on a whim.   What I would do is, be very very strict on your choice on raw material (same with all other things in your house, really). If you're into sewing, think about what fabric you love, and only keep that kind of fabric. Sell or donate all other fabric you don't really love. I made some rules for my fabric-hoarding habit.    I will only pay for ""natural"" biodegradable fabric, as in cotton/wool/hemp etc. Unless there's a specific reason not to, maybe I'd buy some kevlar if I need to make a bullet proof stuff toy. Something like that.  I'll be more lenient on the fabric content from free unwanted clothes/fabric for upcycling. But would still only choose the type of fabric I personally like. I like sweatshirt fabric, and most of them are blends. While I will not pay for cotton blend sweatshirt fabric, I will accept it if it's already lying around in my house as raw material.   So if i got an acrylic sweater that I don't want. I pretty much will have no use for it because I'm not interested in acrylic and not too interested in using sweater as a medium. I will reject an old sweater even if it has only 10% acrylic in it. This will either be sold, or be given away, or be donated. In that specific order. But if I have a 100% wool sweater that I don't like, I will definitely keep that as raw material. Because I like wool, and although I'm not too interested in sweater fabric I will find some use for it eventually.  Of course, these are my preference. This is one of the good things about being OCD with your material. You need to figure out yours. It helps to pair down what you put into your raw material pile."
declutter,38pv0y,K80_k,2,Sat Jun 6 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"Besides sewing, what kinds of crafts are you interested in? Different crafting hobbies have different shelf lives - pens/markers will dry out, elastic will stretch, and fabric patterns can go out of style. It can be better to donate or give away raw supplies (like yarn, or fabric) while keeping the necessary equipment to get back into the craft if you decide to do that (like crochet hooks, knitting needles, and your sewing machine).   I've been trying to pare down my craft supplies lately, and have found it to be a long process! Though I've tried to do the Konmari method for my other clutter, it seems like everything ""sparks joy"" when it comes to these hobbies. I did one massive clean out where I threw out things that I was saving for ""later projects"" (half finished dresses, tote bags, etc.) that had just been sitting around for years, and that cleared out a lot of extra space. Since then, my solution has been to put a moratorium on buying new supplies, and making use of all the things that I have on hand. All of the leftover yarn that I was saving from random large projects I had done has been knit into yarn bombs that I've put onto bike racks around my city. I've been making ornaments out of beads and felt - which has also given me a chance to do more embroidery and get rid of excess embroidery floss.   I know that this method isn't the quickest way to declutter, but I have found renewed interest in some of these hobbies as a result and enjoy the outcomes (handmade gifts for friends, or a little bit of whimsical public art) a lot."

When I downsized my own wardrobe, I kept mentally asking myself what was I thinking that made me feel it was necessary to have so many items, and if the answer to each individual item was because I saw it on a blogger I like, or on Pinterest, or impulse purchased - then I got rid of it.  Mostly because I bought it for external reasons & typically I never end up actually wearing those particular items.  I buy it yes, but wear it no.  Well not anymore. Lesson learned hard."

Honestly, it's probably still too much but I haven't bought much the past couple years, it's all old stuff and I've never been good at getting rid of stuff but I'm trying!

As a student, I do like to hold onto important papers for a certain amount of time - tests, final essays, etc. are important for me to keep in case I am requested to provide proof of the grades that I have received. However, I generally find that it's only necessary to keep 1 years worth of material. I think that a similar approach could be taken to some kinds of paperwork. Also look for online alternatives - many instruction manuals, bills, etc. can be found online and you do not need to let them gather dust by physically accumulating in your house somewhere!  For more sentimental things, I really like scrapbooking - smash journals are my favorite. I glue in whatever I want to keep, and store it on a shelf when I'm not looking through it. When it's filled (I generally go through about 1 per year) I get a really beautiful scrapbook that contains all of the sentimental stuff in one place."

declutter,38mwrs,Nagaempress,3,Mon Jun 8 16:28:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, thanks for the clarification!  I think that the way that I approach paper clutter separates regular papers (course work, instructions/warranties, bills, paperwork, etc.) from things that have sentimental value (letters, photographs, etc.). When I cleaned out my grandmother's apartment after she died, I found appliance manuals from 20+ years back for things she didn't even own anymore. I also found the letters she and my grandfather wrote to each other during when they were dating. The letters were definitely things to keep and share with other members of the family, while the rest of it was recycled/shredded without a second thought. For that reason, I think that she recommends tossing everything that doesn't have sentimental value, and then sorting through the things that are kept for sentimental value to see what's actually worth saving."

declutter,38g9ue,modgirl13,3,Thu Jun 4 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"Yerdle ""dollars"" are more like points or tokens than actual dollars. You're basically giving stuff away in exchange for points/tokens. So you sell a cd or whatever for 5 dollars/points, and a wicker basket for 10 dollars/points. Now you have 15 yerdle dollars/points to buy 15 dollars/points worth of stuff. The only actual money involved is the shipping, which is paid to yerdle directly and the seller gets a prepaid shipping label."
declutter,38g9ue,lem0npie,2,Thu Jun 4 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"No, there's never any cash involved except when you pay for shipping on an item you buy.

Moving companies will usually have these, and they can protect your bed from infestations."
declutter,38ea4j,Combo_salamander,5,Thu Jun 4 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"I moved back home across the Pacific from the continental US at the end of my 20s, but first spent about two months travelling Europe. Didn't have much room to ship anything, nor expensive furniture I wished to keep. I sold/gave away all my furniture and kitchen stuff, shipped about 15 small boxes of mostly books and clothes home. I really should have sold the rest of the books and donated the clothes because I spent the next five years doing that. I had someone from the used bookstore come to my house the first time, and she gave me $800 to cart away about half of them. I should of asked for $900 and given her all of it as soon after, everything got all electronic and it got harder to sell books and cds.  Look into the cost of the smallest storage unit first. Do you really want to pay for it? Make sure it is climate controlled and not subject to flooding as you don't want to pay to house mold and rats. Then pack what will fit. Are you sure you are going to come back? What if you fall in love with a new city? Think of what it will cost to come back, unpack all that stuff, rent as truck, and move it.  What would be the cost to replace all the stuff you want to store? Is it less than the cost of a storage unit? I had cheap Ikea furniture and college hand me downs from friends. It was nice to start over with adult furniture  in my 30s. Most of my clothes were not appropriate for the new climate, I grew out of, and went out of style in a couple of years anyway. 15 years later, I have very little stuff from my past life as I had to make room for kids."
declutter,38ea4j,TheRobotRabbit,9,Thu Jun 4 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"If possible (and for a lot of people, it isn't), start with nothing.  By which I mean leave your house/apartment and stay with a friend, in a hotel, or at a campsite for a week or so. Bring nothing with you except the clothes on your back. No luggage, no bathroom stuff, nothing at all.  On day one, make a list of everything you discover you need. Not stuff you think you'll need tomorrow. Not stuff that would make you more comfortable. Only stuff you need to have. Collect that stuff from home and nothing else, and then repeat for as long as you have time available.  At the end of the experiment, the stuff you've taken out of your home is the stuff you really and truly need to own. That's really getting down to the real, up-shit-creek basics. Anything you have leftover are luxuries (no matter how important they feel, they weren't things you had to have while surviving in the woods).  This works as a thought experiment, as well (that's what I did), but it is harder to do, because clutter is more tempting when it's right in front of you. I'm not going to crawl out of a tent in the woods to run home and grab a dozen books to read, but when I'm sitting at home, those dozen books suddenly seem much more necessary.  Once you've established what is really and truly the bare minimum you need to survive, you can make a reasonable decision on how much of the extras you want to carry around with you.  My personal goal is to get down to a point where I can carry all of my possessions on my person - even if that's impossible to actually reach. Having that mindset (What would I want on me right now if I had to run out of the apartment and never return) makes it easier to turn down the temptation to acquire new things.  The other option is, of course, necessity. If you rent the smallest storage unit you can find, you can obviously only keep what fits in it. My wife and I moved cross-country with only her compact SUV for transportation. We had to reduce three bedrooms' worth of things until it could fit into a space the size of a large closet. That was a real quick way to discover what was really important to us."
declutter,38ea4j,lo_dolly_lolita,2,Wed Jun 3 21:44:43 2015 UTC,Staying at a campsite for a week with only the clothes on your back would be pretty difficult.
declutter,38ea4j,TheRobotRabbit,2,Thu Jun 4 10:38:56 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the point.  You show up with just the clothes on your back. When you find out you need something - a coat, your phone, whatever - you go and get it.  It's not about surviving a week with nothing, it's about finding out how much of your stuff is actually stuff you truly need, and how much of it is just stuff that makes you more comfortable, or stuff you bought because you had somewhere to put it.  I'm certainly not advocating that we all get rid of all the comforts in our lives. But if you really want to get down to the bare minimum, it's supposed to be kind of difficult."
declutter,38ea4j,megabyte1,2,Thu Jun 4 15:16:30 2015 UTC,I would keep family furniture that's been handed down to me. I'd probably also keep my futon but get rid of the bed (since the bed is so much bigger to store).  Pretty much everything else could go.

Nursing bras are made in very limited sizes and shapes and you have to have tops you can easily pull down or unbutton without stretching.

Those clothes provide an important service to you, allowing you to care for your children. Even though they don't make you feel attractive, they contribute to your life in an important way. They might not spark joy in the way you would first think. However, you can feel gratitude to them for their service, and keep them because their job is not done yet. That's a different type of joy, being happy for their role in helping you be a good mother."

She has one where she recommends just throwing  away all paperwork, while making storage space for many purses.  ???  Okey fine, but that's not me.  So I have a program to scan-and-shred paperwork, keeping what I really need to have on hand and archiving the rest digitally.   The few purses I have are shoved in an obscure box for seasonal rotation or a special occasion.   Adapt her principles to your personal lifestyle.  Not every little thing she does is a rule that everyone can follow.    The principle is: don't keep clothes you don't really like or that are uncomfortable to wear.   So for now, get rid of clothes you just don't feel good or pretty in.   As you shop for new pieces in the future, don't 'settle', try to hold out for stuff you love looking at or that feel great when you put them on.  Get the one blouse you love instead of 2 that are just okay."

declutter,37z89m,wewillrun,6,Fri Jun 19 04:58:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person. How often do you do laundry? Maybe if you feel you have too much, do that 'hanger trick' but with socks? So have a little box for all your socks, put every pair in there. If you use a pair, after you wash them put them in the drawer. After there are some in the drawer, use the drawer socks before using the box socks. Wash as frequently as you would on a lazy week. Then see how many are left in the box after a month! Does that make sense? I think I explained it pretty badly but not sure how to improve it!   Remember seasons as well! You can always have a shoebox for winter socks under your bed or something.  I have tons of socks because a) I'm lazy; b) I hate feet and c) I wear boots year-round (I live in Scotland.. I was in wellies today, and yes it is almost June! Haha).   If they're all fitting in one drawer then you should be fine though. Do you always fold everything up so nicely? Will you be folding like that in the future? I know future me will have lazy weeks so I leave loads of space for unfolded socks and pants!"
declutter,37z89m,ArcadiaRhodes,3,Sun May 31 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend taking some stuff out of the drawer and storing it elsewhere. How often do you do your laundry? If you do it every week, there's no reason to have more than 2 weeks worth of socks/underwear at a time. Underwear and socks will wear out - but if you are using everything you own it's going to take a longer time for you to wear down and replace, and you'll be stuck dealing with a large amount of visual clutter for longer!"

I can be a little bit competitive with myself sometimes, and always wanting to round up has forced me to go back to piles of things that I've sorted through and ask myself if it is truly worth it.   I'm hoping that once I get into a rhythm of decluttering and know how to identify if something definitively ""sparks joy"", I will be keeping count of what I keep, rather than what I give away.

declutter,37uj82,elduderino260,19,Sat May 30 14:45:24 2015 UTC,"You might be fighting a losing battle.  But what's worked for me is to to repeatedly ask things like, 'how many of this item do you have and how many do you actually need?' 'how long has this item sat untouched?'  'If you got rid of it, how difficult would it be to replace?'  When I've dealt with people who hold onto every little thing, eventually they can't even justify to themselves why they are keeping some things and give in.  I force them to really reconsider if they'll ever realistically fix something that's broken, lose the 10lbs they need to fit into an old clothing item, or take up a long-neglected project.  If they haven't done it in 2, 5, 10+ years, are they really going to do it now?  I've found that gathering up the multiples of the same item can be helpful.  A lot of messy people have items scattered randomly about, so they have no idea how much they actually have.  It's pretty persuasive to pull out a dozen of the exact same item, and show them the pile.  Try to get them to agree to a reasonable number of an item to have.  Emphasize how wasteful it is when they can't find something so they purchase another.  If you're really serious: be persistent and plan on doing most of the work.  I actually try to overwhelm the person a little by just showing them the sheer volume of stuff they have.  I let them make the decisions and as soon as they decide to get rid of something, I do it, immediately, before they can change their mind.  I do all the sorting, selling, recycling, trashing, donating, and then put everything back, since you can't expect someone who indefinitely delays organizing to do it themselves.  I also re-frame the discussion.  So it's not, 'we're wastefully throwing things away.'  It's, 'we're organizing the space so we can more easily find the things we need and use, use the space more productively, or park our cars.'  I explain giving things away as freeing them to the environment so someone who actually needs it can use it, rather than it sitting wastefully in storage taking up space.  Also, inevitably, stuff that's been stored in piles gets damaged.  Water, mice, crushed, etc.  Pull out a few things that have been ruined and emphasize that if these items had been stored properly, rather than in a crush, they wouldn't have been destroyed, which is a wasteful."

Same with screws.  Buy a 50 pack of manila file folders and sort through the papers and group them together and label the folders.  It a mess but it doesn't have to be.

declutter,37uj82,thisisfor_fun,5,Sat May 30 16:06:19 2015 UTC,Best answer. Trying to push someone to getting rid of things is a losing battle.

declutter,37uj82,nightyLEX,2,Sat May 30 16:39:46 2015 UTC,That's why you have to organize on a regular basis. Set aside 2 hours every two weeks (or whatever timing works for you) to put back things that are out of palce where they belong. No different than making your bed every morning.

declutter,37uj82,ratjea,6,Wed Jun 3 08:32:28 2015 UTC,"When you organize, you need an ""Oh, no, I might need this someday!"" category.  Also, you have to validate and believe yourself that yes, indeed, some day they might need it. Work on it & really try to accept it. Then wholeheartedly & enthusiastically get on board when they tell you, ""But I might need this!""  And then you tell them (honestly, truthfully & enthusiastically) ""Okay, this goes in the 'I might need this'"" section. Or call it a ""Just in case"" section or ""Waste not, want not"" section, or whatever it is that they'll identify with.  You can't be condescending, and you can't force your declutter worldview on them. Accept that they have a valid worldview.  The ""I might need this"" section will be big, so you need a big space for this. After you have that space designated, the rest of the storage area can be arranged in practical ways.  Keep in mind that folks like this (folks like me!) don't see the world the same way you do. We don't want our stuff rearranged in a way that is arbitrary to us but makes sense/looks nice to you. You're actually creating chaos for us, so that's why we fight back.  What we value is empowerment. We want the tools & resources to get stuff done (which is why we gather up so much ""I might need this"" stuff.) Think of it like a marketing person who works so hard at building a huge contact list & networks like crazy. It you try to throw away some of the contacts, or organize them in a way that makes sense to you but not the marketing person, they're going to go batty on you.  You need ""themes"" in the garage:   Stuff to garden with Stuff for car maintenance Stuff for decorating on holidays Stuff for home repair Stuff for the model airplane hobby Stuff for recycling etc   But don't use my list. It's just an example. You have to ask them (or observe) what the themes are for their lives. What kinds of stuff do they use & why? What matters to them might not matter to you. The theme areas need to be based around activities they do on a regular basis, or are likely to do at least once a year.  The theme areas have to be easily accessible & not complicated to put stuff away. If you make it difficult, they won't do it.  The difficult-to access area(s) of the garage can be reserved for the ""Oh no, I might need this!"" category, because chances are they'll never actually need to get to it.  The ""oh no"" section might be unruly and have no other function aside from being ""oh no"" and that's fine. What matters is that you're separating out the stuff they do need (and organizing it by theme, and making it easily accessible) so that it doesn't get lost.  You can not put down the ""oh no"" stuff. You have to value it, or they'll see right through you & it will just feel like you're throwing away their resources or tricking them or being condescending, and they won't buy into it.  Hope that helps!"

Personally, I don't buy fiction books because I have access to a great library.  I know books can be a sore point, but they're so hard to move and most people don't re-read much.

People may want to give you free stuff like your parents but don't take it just because its free and nice.  Take it only if you need it.  Avoid storage stuff like racks, shelfing units, bins, etc.  Those are just place to put stuff on.  Only get furniture that you use like a chair, bed, dresser, desk.

When you unpack your kitchen, really think about where things should go and how they will fit. If your cabinets are a jumbled mess, it's too easy to buy random kitchen items and throw them in but if you have a nice setup, you'll think twice before adding to it. Same for pantry/office/etc. Also when you are in a new place you will quickly realize the problem areas so fix them as soon as you can. May be as simple as a key/mail holder by the door to prevent a certain corner of your counter getting cluttered. Or maybe your bathroom is too small, buy an over the toilet shelf/cabinet if needed so that you can get items off the counter. Of course this is assuming that you are housing essentials, not 27 different hair products or something lol  I think fixing those areas soon prevents you from becoming passive about it. After 6 months in a place, a mail pile on your counter may just be standard but if you nip it in the bud early, it won't be."

All started as a five car garage stacked to the rafters with packed boxes. 8 person crew spent 3 weeks unpacking, sorting, and setting up, then we took a couple days to inventory, build a catalogue, and label that shit.

It might be helpful to know at what point all these methods are not working for you. With FlyLady is it getting up and making your bed? Is it getting dressed to lace-up shoes? Shining the sink? Somewhere further on the list? With KonMari is it envisioning what you want from your space that you're getting hung up on? Is it choosing one piece of clothing to start out with? With Pomodoro are you setting goals too big?  Incorporated into a lot of FlyLady's stuff is some self care, and I think that's a good place to start. For example, she talks about changing the inner dialogue, about getting dressed to shoes, etc. Some of the things might seem silly, but I have found there's wisdom behind making your bed each day or shining the sink.  Since you said you've tried every behavior modification program, do you have a better idea of where you're diverting your time? Not sure of the name of the method, but that one where you write down what you do every time you change tasks is insightful. Once you've found out what you're allowing as a distraction, maybe tell yourself not to do it until you've accomplished a task.  For example, say no Reddit [gasp!] until you've thrown out five things.  Finally, I'd say it may be important to look at why you have clutter from a psychological perspective and to take care of that. I mentioned self care already, but it is honestly so important. Make sure you've been eating well, had a shower, had enough sleep, but not too much, taken a break from obligations, etc."

KonMari: I read the book, but I don't have the energy, the space, or the motivation to go through all my clothing at once, for example.  I would need help.  I can easily see pulling down things, creating a huge mess and stopping in the middle.  Pomodoro/UFYH:  I set the timer, but can't suppress my feelings of dislike, loathing, etc. I end up doing something other than the appointed task.  I do as much self-care as I'm able. I don't have a lot of strong, positive incentives at the moment.  If I found it easy to self-regulate, I wouldn't have come to the forum. As I said, I've heard it all and I've tried it all.

declutter,36sf0b,lilfunky1,10,Fri May 22 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"1) Don't refer to yourself as lazy. You call yourself lazy multiple times in your post, and as someone who also used to repeatedly describe myself as lazy I can tell you that you are being unfair to yourself. You have three jobs, you have professional skills in multiple areas, and are obviously very creative. It doesn't sound like laziness is your problem. I think you are more overwhelmed by the task ahead of you and don't know exactly how to go about it, so you put it off. That isn't laziness.   2). I didn't understand konmari's method to do clothes first. All of my clothes hold memories much more than almost anything else in my house. I think I am also going to start with something else that hold less feelings for my declutter weekend.  3). Be careful about holding clothes in a different size than you are. I found that when I finally stopped wearing temporary clothes that were just being used until I got back into my former size and instead had clothes that fit me as I was, I ended up changing my weight back to what I wanted it to be much easier. When you feel good about yourself you are better able to make changes and keep habits that you couldn't before. You can embrace yourself as you are while still considering it temporary.   4). All declutter is good! It's not easy. 2 bags of clothes is huge! Especially when you have sentimental attachments like we do. Keep it up and maybe come back to clothing. The more you practice decluttering the easier it becomes on high emotional items.   Great job and keep it up! I'm am just starting a big purge myself and am using submissions like yours as inspiration. And possibly a little as a procrastination tactic..."

declutter,36rkzc,cleanedge,17,Thu May 21 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a couple of comments I wrote in earlier posts:  I found reading this book to be a breath of fresh air with it's Shinto sourced outlook, and it really has redefined the way I interact with my living spaces. If a ratty old T-shirt from twenty years ago sparks joy, she counsels you to keep it. The core principle of KonMari isn't really about throwing stuff out so much as loving and having an active relationship with what you choose to keep. She frames ""tidying"" as a once in a lifetime event that can take as long as half a year, with the aim of perfection.  One should keep in mind that this was written for a Japanese audience, for whom Shinto is ingrained into the substrate of culture. She was once herself a shrine maiden. When she speaks of the spirits and gods that permeate and inhabit all things and the duties, relationships, and obligation you have with them, this is part of a rich cultural tradition that her intended audience understood as part of their upbringing. Much of this practice has been lost in the modern day, having devolved into festival and ritual. When she speaks of these things, she is just as strongly reminding today's Japanese of the forgotten ways. The hidden subtext throughout the book is treating your home as a sacred shrine that is the home of numerous spirits and gods. This ability to hold things and fulfill duties as sacred is a key to keeping one's promises and resolve inviolate, which is a driver of the life change she speaks.   Go through your items category by category, and hold them one at a time.  Start with the easy stuff like garbage, and save sentimental items for last.  ""Does it spark joy?"", and what she means by this is does it make you happy to have this in your life.  Keeping things unused and hidden in storage is not having an active joyful relationship with something.  You won't think socks or a water heater gives you joy unless you go a month without. Surround your environment entirely with items that bring you happiness. KonMari isn't about throwing stuff away.  It's about loving and having an active relationship with what you choose to keep.  100 pairs of shoes might be right for one person. Once you have your home in a state of perfection, you'll want to maintain it.  As mentioned, this is the hidden subtext of holding your home as a sacred space and having an active fulfilling relationship with everything in it.  The art of tidying up is its own kind of Zen koan.   Here's the AMA she did a few months back."

Smile, ask nicely, etc. or 2) call the main phone #, ask to be transferred to the radiology dept and ask them nicely.   A large modern hospital will have the equipment necessary to do the job. If they don't, try another. Some areas have private imaging practices that may have the equipment too. No harm in calling and asking nicely."

She has you gather up all your stuff by category, lay it out so that you can see it all in one place, then pick each item up to see if it sparks joy.  The ones that you like, you keep.  If you don't like it you toss it.  She has you do this once through all your possessions, starting with the easiest items and ending with the hardest.  By the time you get through clothes you kinda pick up steam and get used to tossing stuff so that by the time you get to mementos you've already had a lot of practice.  The book gives you an order but it doesn't really spell that all out in one spot.  That's where this checklist comes in, so that you don't have to keep going back to the book to figure out what is next.  Plus it should make sure you don't forget to do a category."

I'm going to run down your post and tell you all the methods I attempted.  Some worked for me, some didn't, but maybe one of them will help you.  :)  As far as the chores goes, setting a schedule is one option.  I (try) ti keep two or three calenders - one of my fridge, one in my purse, one on my desk.  I'm actually in the process of trying to create a good schedule for myself post-job, but this might be something to help you. Give everything a set day and time, and  put it in the calenders.  Set up reminders on your phone and your computer that is loud and obnoxious that will steal your focus.  I've also tried just steamrolling through everything, and then spot cleaning/washing/etc as you go - see a spill as I'm on the way out the door?  Grab a rag real quick and wipe it up before leaving.  As far as the yard goes-  we're bad with that too.  :p  One thing I can suggest, considering the yard isn't a priority for you, is discussing possibly having the landlord handle the yard.  Maybe he could add $20 or $30 a month to your rent, and hire someone to mow and weed it.  It's a little extra money, but one less thing to worry about.  As far as the items go - is there a pattern to them?  Do you drop the towels in the same general place, or everywhere?  If they tend to end up in the same spot on the floor, consider putting a hamper or basket in that spot or near that spot that you could drop into instead.  I have a similar depressed feeling of being overwhelmed and stressed by the mess - the best thing I've found is to accept that feeling, understand why it's there.  The hard part is doing the cleaning, though I've found reminding myself that the cleaning will act like medicine for those feelings sometimes gives me enough of a boost to get off my butt and at least get minor cleaning done."

That being said, I'd really like to get a flower garden and a vegetable garden put in. But at this point I feel like it is adding on more responsibilities when I can barely handle the ones I have now, so it's a pipe dream for me. :/    I've found reminding myself that the cleaning will act like medicine for those feelings sometimes gives me enough of a boost to get off my butt and at least get minor cleaning done   I think it will help me to keep this in mind.

Stop relying on defrosting meat and be realistic- you need simpler meal options for those ""can't think!"" moments.   This is a hard truth for me to accept, as I really enjoy cooking and love to put together elaborate meal plans, but in reality being an autistic bachelor it just really isn't that feasible for me to cook most of the time. I think I might try just sticking to lunchmeat sandwiches, soup-in-a-mug, cut vegetables/salads, and easy stuff like that for awhile and see if that doesn't help remove a source of stress. To be honest the one pitfall of my new house is that I really don't have the storage space for all of my pots and pans anyway (I barely have space for my dishes and silverware) which is a major deterrent to me when cooking is concerned.

I'm schizophrenic with OCD, my autistic spectrum boyfriend and I have realized we think a LOT alike. So maybe I can relate? But I've found that I'm good at making rules for myself if I write about them first. I write why this rule will be important, and the scenarios when it'll be used. (""Night time snack, don't think you'll rinse it tomorow, just rinse it tonight"") I have some really odd journaling habits that involve things like that and it helps so much. Then if you approach the whole home problem a few new rules and habits at a time it builds up into natural behavior. It took me this kind of force to even remember to brush my teeth after my psychotic episodes, and it's still work, but structure is my ONLY chance at living well. I'm sure you understand :)   My journaling habits also lead to me having a huuuge notebook collection that I never want to get rid of lol.  My boyfriend also has a large book collection. You could probably benefit from getting rid of some at a sale or donation. Maybe set a goal number to purge so you'll be satisfied once you hit it. We both tend to collect things that hold artificial value. Example; ""owning this book proves to me that I've read it, and that I've read this # of books, and it feels good to collect a lot of single certain item. But I likely won't read it again so it has no practical value"". Maybe you can assess some of your books and notebooks like this. You can have some more closed off storage for books that you may want to lend such as large plastic tubs, and use shelves for books you're going to be reading or displaying for sentimental value. That'll help the whole library situation."
declutter,36jd4r,Sailormercuryaz,14,Wed May 27 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"If you need and like routine, I suggest getting into a habit of checking off items from an already established checklist. There are many programs that detail manageable daily habits and weekly chores that rotate rooms, so that your whole house is getting clean and being maintained on a monthly schedule.  FlyLady has a clunky website but great information. You are supposed to spend your first 31 days building daily habits. They also have a free app that gives you a checklist that you can edit (to include things like watering plants). The site/app tells you what to do and when (looking at it daily is easiest). The app is annoying if you have patchy internet access, as some important parts just link to the site.  I now use FlyLady system that I've put on a checklist app called Chore Checklist (android) that I have adapted for my needs. I work from my daily checklist and ""zone"" checklists that I do one of a week (usually one or two tasks a day). I put easy-to-forget things on there like ""take out recycle"" and ""pick up pet medication"" for anything regularly scheduled, and I have a ""one time task"" category as well. Flylady is aimed towards housewives. The website is terrible and the language is infuriatingly cutesy, but it is also what got me where I am by making house maintenance so much less intimidating.   If you can't get past the language of FlyLady, there is Unfuck Your Habitat that is based on the same idea. People love it, but I found the system harder to understand for some reason. They also have an app.  This type of system has changed my life. I was never taught how to be clean nor tidy, but I now work from a daily checklist that that makes daily progress and maintains the work I've done. I used to dread twice-a-year cleaning marathons and refuse to let anyone come over. Now my app tells me what I need to do and when, so I don't forget.   I hope you find something that works for you. I commend your asking for help. Good luck!"

I'm genuinely curious because I know several people on the spectrum (some with 'official' diagnoses, some without) and it manifests in widely varying ways.

I have always experienced extreme irritation by certain stimuli - people jiggling their leg, chewing gum, clicking a pen incessantly - all these 'little' things which  rarely seem to bother other people. I have strong aversions to smells I find disagreeable - certain perfume profiles, for example. I simply couldn't stand the unisex Calvin Klein fragrance CK One. It was extremely popular in the 90s, and even a lot of everyday toiletries copied the fragrance, except it was always worse. It was like an assault on my senses, and being exposed to it meant I couldn't really think about anything other than how unpleasant I found it.  I'm also a very slow careful thinker, so do better in text conversations rather than face to face. If I don't have sufficient time to gather my thoughts, I'm extremely impulsive about things I say to people, often blurting things out I'd have been better off keeping to myself. I think I get nervous about pauses in conversations, and my anxiety prompts me to fill the gaps with whatever I can come up with at the time. Often, my frank observations have been perceived as a blatant lack of tact, but I never really intend to deliberately offend anyone. It just seems to happen.  My mum always used to harass me to look people in the eye when speaking to them. As a child I was often literally 'painfully shy' around unfamiliar people, adults especially. My voice could fail me altogether, as it just took too much energy to push the air out of my lungs with enough force to make any audible sound. I got better as I got older, but having suffered serious bouts of depression for most of my adult life, I was quite interested to notice that when I was taking a low dose of antidepressants, but started feeling like I needed more, one of the significant signs alerting me to this was my flagging ability to project my voice in social settings. I just couldn't muster the energy to respond in the bare minimum acceptable way to greeting from sales assistants, for example. My voice seemed to get tinier, and tinier, and my eyes increasingly stared downwards.   Once I started taking an increased dose of AD medication, these symptoms were usually the first to dissipate. My more deep-seated mental state of chronic dysthymia is rarely affected by changes in medication, but I can deal with that as long as the everyday grind is taken care of.  Oh, yeah, and my house is in a chronic state of disarray. I can only manage periods of area-specific tidiness before it eventually all comes apart again. I keep working at it, though."

Do you really need a house with a yard if you are never out there? Working with the landlord for help with the yard is a great idea. In fact, in my state, the land lord is responsible for yard maintenance, and it's in their best interest as well.   Get a smaller, cheaper place with less things and no yard. Hire someone to come in and do the basics, clean bathrooms and floors. Maybe a condo? It does require that you unpack things and start at a good base point, but you can ask someone to help.   I don't freeze raw meats much, as I would never cook it. Schedule to Shop on Sunday and Wednesday's, buy enough for a couple days worth of meals. Or just get takeout. There is nothing wrong with that either. TV dinners are getting really fancy these days and keep a long time. They defrost fast, and you can always grab a quick, premade salad or soup to go with.  The schedule idea is great. Automate everything. Pare down clothes so that you are forced to do laundry once a week, and everything fits in your drawers and closets. Automate bills, automate which days you clean. Make a home for everything and make sure it goes back there. If it doesn't fit, out it goes.

I got her to cut down a bit by asking her to buy stuff for my kids instead, as they are constantly growing out of or staining clothes. I think it would be easier if I were a guy, then I would just donate my old things and wear the new things, but as a girl, I'm really not that into wearing lacy see-through blouses she thinks are in fashion, or weirdly colored, too large blouses just because they were on sale so cheap, she couldn't go wrong.

You don't have that, so you're already a few steps ahead.  It seems like your problems are mostly organisational. I also suffered with these things when I was first in my own home, I think most people do, so don't feel bad about it.  I recommend you read unfuckyourhabitat.com it's a brilliant site and helped me. You are not alone! This is a totally normal thing to deal with! She also talks a lot about the depression-messy house cycle which I think will help you.  First, clean for 20 minutes a day, every day. Set an alarm on your phone so you don't forget to do it, and do it every single day. Make sure you use the timer, because 20 minutes is actually a lot of cleaning. Cleaning always seems like it takes a lot of time because it kind of sucks but in reality 20 minutes is enough time for me to wash a sink of dishes, wipe down the kitchen, move a load of laundry through, tidy the lounge room and take rubbish out. If you keep on top of the clutter it can't build up to an overwhelming level, your house will always be company-ready, and more importantly cleaning every day really helps you get used to putting things away as you use them, because you know you're going to be back in a few hours to pick it up anyway. Humans have a weird kind of disconnection where we put our dirty dishes in the sink and forget about them, and then come back a week later being all ""Who left all these dishes here?"". I found that after a few weeks of cleaning 20 minutes a day, every day, i would go to put a dirty dish or a bit of rubbish down, pause, then go and wash it or put it away instead. It helps you subconsciously connect ""I'll just put this here"" with ""shit now I have to clean this up"" in a way that doesn't happen when they're days or weeks apart.  Then, you need schedules and lists, man, schedules and lists. Use your phone, or computer, or a paper diary - whatever works best for you. Make a checklist for:  Every Day:  -Feed Dogs  -Water Plants  -Put away dry dishes from yesterday  -Wash dirty dishes  -Move Laundry Through (1)  -Take rubbish out if necessary  -Move any frozen food needed for tomorrow into the fridge  -General tidying  Do this in order at the same time every day (say 7pm, after dinner) and start at the top of the list and get through as much as you can in the time. I find even devoting only 20 minutes a day I quickly start to run out of things to do, the first few days you'll have a stack of dishes and laundry and random things thrown around but you'll get on top of them quickly. Set an alarm on your phone every day at the same time and have the list printed out and laminated if you like. I can't stress every day enough, I often tried to bargain myself out of it by being all ""well it's not that dirty, i did a few minutes extra yesterday, I'm tired, I'll do more tomorrow"" and had to get really sarcastic with myself like ""what are you going to do with 20 minutes that's SO goddamn important? Watch a Simpsons rerun? Reddit? Get to work."" Now it's just a normal habit.  Weekly:  -Take rubbish bins out (bin day)  -Open mail, sort, put away.(2)  -Grocery Shop (3)  Do these all on the same day if possible, set an alarm so you don't forget.  (1) By ""move laundry through"" I mean I don't do all my laundry in the one day. One day I put the dirty clothes in the washer and turn it on, the next day i move it to the dryer and turn it on, the next day i fold them up and put them away. I only go through one or two loads a week and have my own washer and dryer so this works well - each step only takes a minute or so.  (2) Get yourself some kind of inbox for your unopened mail and things you need to deal with like bills, an accordion folder for any paper work that you might need to keep, and a waste paper bin. Keep them all in the same place.  (3) I wrote myself a standard weekly grocery list. Figure out what you normally like to eat and write a meal plan for 7 days of meals. Then divide it up into ""buy every week"" (things you will probably need to buy every week like meat, milk, bread, salads, etc) and ""check if I have enough"" (things you will need to buy sometimes like cheese, cereal, honey, sauces, etc). Write it up on your computer and save a copy. Print off a bunch and put them on top of your fridge. Every week when it's your shopping day grab the list, cross off anything on the 'check if we have' group that you have plenty of, add anything else that you need, and go. If you notice during the week that you're running low on something you don't buy often (like batteries) you can just write it on the next shopping list.   also just kind of subconsciously drop things wherever to the point that I eventually look up and my house is a disaster area. Wet towels? On the floor. Multiple cups and glasses piling up on surfaces. Dust accumulates. I've tried having a ""launch pad"" to put my keys and other stuff I need to leave the house on because I am constantly losing my keys/phone/charger/debit card and it stresses me out/causes me to have a meltdown, but the appropriate items rarely make it to said station.   Part of this will get better when your daily cleaning makes your subconscious mind realise that it has to pick those things up anyway. Second, make things as easy as possible on yourself. Why not put a dirty washing hamper in the bathroom if you always drop towels there? Or if you drop them in your bedroom after getting dressed, put a hook in there to hang it on. Is your 'Launch Pad' in an odd place like by the door instead of being where you naturally tend to empty your pockets? Work with your natural tendencies. We used to have a mess of shoes being all over the house until I moved the shoe rack to between the door and the couch - the place where we usually take our shoes off anyway. Now it's not an issue 99% of the time.  As for cups and glasses, Do you just have too many of them? If it's just you living there, maybe pack away everything except 2 or 3 cups (and plates, and bowls) so you have to wash them before they pile up? If you're doing your 20 minutes a day you'll never need more than that anyway.   I also forget to do outdoor maintenance because I don't spend much time out there, so my porch and sidewalks will get dirty with dead lives and debris, my lawn gets shaggy, and I have a hard time finding the energy/drive to go out and address the problem.   If you're not out there, does it matter? Can you just pay someone to do it for you once a month (and have it as a standard recurring booking so you don't even have to remember to arrange it)? My lawns get pretty out of control because it's just not important to me.   I have a hard time throwing certain things away - mainly notebooks, papers, index cards, and books. This leads areas of my home to look like something a mad librarian might live in. It's no bueno.   Also not uncommon, and there are plenty of methods for around dealing with this. The Kon Mari method is popular, though I haven't used it. I like to use a 'fixed space' method. I.e. this drawer, and only this drawer, is designated to old notebooks, index cards, etc. You just have to cull the least important ones until it fits the space. Another method is just to shut them away out of sight for a few months in a box. After that if you cant remember anything in it that you actually need, trash it.   I have initiative problems. My second bedroom is supposed to be a library since I have over a thousand books, but over a month into living in the house and I still have a giant mountain of unshelved books and a second bedroom full of unpacked boxes. :/   I currently have several unpacked boxes from a move in August. You're fine. Break it down into little steps. Buy some shelves, then unpack one box a day or week until it's done. Add it to your daily/weekly checklist.   Right now I think the worst thing is the bedroom. I was trying to go through my clothes before I packed them back into my dressers when I moved in, but lost initiative halfway through and now I just basically have a carpet of laundry in there comprised of both dirty and clean clothes. I can't tell the difference at this point.   Here's an easy culling method; Wash all your clothes (dedicate today to washing everything), then throw them in a basket/box/unused corner/spare room. Pull stuff out as you need to wear it, then wash it then put it away in your dressers. After a week or two you'll find you're reusing the stuff in the dressers and not needing anything more out of the box/pile. Take the box/pile to a charity shop. Keeping on top of your laundry will be so much easier once you've gotten rid of the clutter and have space for all the clothes you actually use.  I don't think this is an issue with autism, or hoarding, or that you're a slob. If it is, then I'm all those things too. This is a normal process to go through. You'll get there. Just keep trying a little bit every day and figure out what works for you!"
declutter,36jd4r,KimberlyInOhio,6,Wed May 20 08:09:14 2015 UTC,"other people have provided great advice and suggestions. I just want to add that if focus is the issue for you, maybe you can schedule an alarm on your phone or day of the week that puts your focus on cleaning and tidying. since it's not instinctive, you'll have to consciously schedule the interruption to your normal programming, like we all have to do with things like doing our taxes."
declutter,36jd4r,keebyjeeby,3,Wed May 20 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"Im not gonna lie, I skimmed a little but everything I did read can be solved with a planner. Get a planner with a lot of space and write everything in it. Trash days, pay days, days you want to do yard work, write to check the mail on every single day if that's what it takes. In addition to regular reoccurring things, end every night by creating a to do list (in your planner) for the following day. When you start working, just go down your list. If you get distracted, come back to the list and make sure you are checking off things from it."
declutter,36jd4r,OrlenaJustina,3,Wed May 20 02:40:11 2015 UTC,"Lists are my friends. I have to have everything operating on a system - a solid routine - or it'll break down and stress me out to the point of a meltdown.    I have a list of chores and each day has a different chore assigned to it. So I know that on Wednesdays, for example, I water my plants. And on the first of each month, I fertilize those plants in the summer and spring.    I also had a slight problem with waaay too many things. And that caused a lot of stress and pacing issues (if I get overwhelmed about a single thing I tend to pace back and forth while trying to figure it out). So I ruthlessly chucked many things to the curb and donation centers. It was hard to get rid of it at first, but worth it in the end. I even did that with the majority of my books because there was so much to read that I became overwhelmed by the reading list.   I had a similar problem with clothes, as well. So I threw out everything that wasn't grey/black/brown/jeans (it's easier to have an outfit this way and always have it match and it made my decision of what needed to go much easier). So I have enough clothes to last a week and then I wash them (per the to-do list which is Thursdays ( : heh)  I find that if I own too much or have too many responsibilities hanging over me in one go, it's really hard to function properly without a mound of stress and other issues setting in. By owning less and then streamlining my process with a (somewhat anal retentive and restrictive to some) list and routine, it has made my house significantly more peaceful. It is also, yay, always clean since everything must go in its place per the list.   I hope this (wow, incredibly long and rambling) response was helpful!"
declutter,36jd4r,ruleroute,2,Mon May 25 11:34:26 2015 UTC,"People have made a ton of great suggestions, but maybe something like setting an alarm on your cellphone when you e.g. put on laundry would be a good idea? Our washing machine beeps every few minutes when the cycle is done, until you turn it off/put it in the dryer, and an alarm going off might help remind you to finish off that task.  A really simple point on ""forgetting to defrost meat"" - I often forget as well, but if you package your meat up into individual portions in ziplock bags before freezing, you can defrost very quickly (like, half an hour-ish for a chicken breast) in a sink with cool running water. It's the easiest way I've found and solves the issue of forgetting to meal-plan in advance."

She told me that when she dies she doesn't want me working for a week trying to get rid of all her stuff. But she literally has just a bed, a tv, and a bookshelf. I think she has a towel, and a few articles of clothing.   In the past, we had stuff. She would constantly be moving around the furniture in the house (unemployed) to where when I got home from school the room would be arranged completely differently every day.   She got SSI a few years ago, and upon it being granted she also got a settlement of $10000. She spent it very quickly on brand new furniture and DVDs, going out, stuff like that.   Then the furniture and electronics started disappearing, until my mom even threw her bed away because it reminded her of an ex boyfriend. She was sleeping on blankets for a while and then she got a mattress and a box spring and a bed frame. Then she got rid of the box spring and the bed frame, so just the mattress was left.   My mom has a problem and this is totally a real thing. I have bought her things in the past where I believed it would improve her quality of life, like I bought her a 24 pack of toilet paper and she gave most of it away saying that she didn't need that much right now.   She also used to sell my VHS tapes and stuff when I was younger, and got rid of a lot of my stuff without asking. I think this has contributed a lot to my cluttering problem. I mean, I've been getting on top of it and trying out the rule ""nothing on the floor but the furniture"" and I am also going to try out this ""does this bring joy?"" question.   Sigh."

declutter,36eciv,Kryzilya,2,Tue May 19 12:07:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a time method where anything you haven't used in a set amount of time you get rid of.  For example, reverse all the hangers in your closet as if you had hung them up from the other side of the rack.  When you wear something and return it to your closet, hang it the correct way.  After six months get rid of  anything with the hanger still reversed (obviously excluding something like seasonal clothing).     A way to transfer this to objects would be to maybe put a sticky note on many things you think you may someday use.  If you use it, take the sticky note off.  If you haven't after six months, get rid of it.       Someone on this subreddit also discussed the 20/20 rule: if you ever happen to need this ""someday"" item, can you buy it for less than $20 in less than 20 minutes?  If so, get rid of it now.  You can buy it if you need it someday.     I have trouble with sentimental things to, so I try to repurpose it into something useful or take a picture to hold the sentimentality.  For example, I like a lot of my t-shirts from high school but never wear them so I'm making them into a t-shirt quilt.  Another example was my favorite pair of shoes I had worn for years.  They were literally bursting at the seams, so I decided to take a picture and trash them.     This may seem silly, but I also really like the KonMari trick of thanking an item for its service and then getting rid of it.  When acknowledge your appreciation of the item, it's easier to let it go.     There isn't an easy trick to decluttering, so try to take it one day at a time and enjoy the process and the things you have.  If you only focus on the end goal you'll miss enjoying now."

Elsewhere in the books she speaks of how ""100 shoes"" might be right for a person if they love each and every one of them.  From the book:  Let me be clear. The clothes I wear at home are generally cute and pretty. I usually wear girly things, such as camisoles with layers of pink frills and flower-print cotton ensembles, around the house. The only exception is my Kiccoro T-shirt. It is quite a curious article, shocking green in color with just Kiccoro’s eyes and half-open, full-lipped mouth, and the tag clearly indicates that it’s a children’s size. As the Expo was held in 2005, I’ve been wearing it for many years even though I have no sentimental memories from the event itself. Just reading what I’ve written here makes me feel embarrassed to be hanging on to such a thing, yet whenever I see it, I can’t bring myself to throw it away. My heart starts beating faster as soon as I see Kiccoro’s lovely round eyes.  . . .  To tell the truth, I would not want anyone else to see me wearing my Kiccoro T-shirt. But I keep it for the little joys it gives me, the giggle I get when I take it out and look at it all on my own, the contentment I feel when Kiccoro and I are sweating together as we clean and wondering what to tackle next."

declutter,3681k8,GetToDaChopaa,3,Sun May 17 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"Keep what brings you joy—as long as you think you will actually wear it! Or that it will give you positive feelings whenever you decide to take it out/look at it (as opposed to guilt for having so much, etc...) I am curious, what is it about these clothes that you love? Is it the graphics on the shirt, or the representation of a stage in your life? Is it the physical comfort? Would having a photo of yourself in it during those memorable times be enough?  I have found that for myself, a lot of the clothing I love for ""fashion""—that looks great and put together, etc, for me sometimes feels too much like a costume. I love the outfit, and I put it together myself, yet I think there's something about the pieces that doesn't allow me to fully relax. For example, I love vintage fashion (like mad men style), but those clothes never really feel or look relaxing.   Now I try to focus on both the look and feel of the clothing. I buy fabrics that make me feel comfortable (limited synthetics, pants that are stretchy). A lot of fashionable (not just the trendy, but also the timeless variety) clothing comes in softer and more comfortable fits. For example, a blazer made of jersey without shoulder pads, or a lightweight cotton shirt feel so much better to me than a stiff, fitted blazer and a silk blouse (and I know silk is a natural fabric a lot of people love, but I never feel relaxed wearing it, it's so delicate and easy to stain!). Both can look great and put together, but one makes me a lot more comfortable. I also love the ""jogger""/sweatpants trend. Some of them look more like work pants but are secretly soft goodness.   Also, it's probably possible to have your ""unfashionable"" clothing to look much more fashionable if you pair it with the right things! As someone below said, dressing up a graphic or band tee with a blazer, etc."

I'm not a serious clutter-er or hoarder by any stretch but I tend to over-purchase stuff 'just in case' or because it was on sale or because I wanted free shipping.  I had a few realizations that quenched my acquiring urges.  I got over the fear of not having something and compensating by buying something 'just-in-case' with the realization that literally any 'lack' of stuff could usually easily be remedied by a trip to Target.  There's pretty much always stuff.  Rarely is the problem too little stuff.  The bigger problem is almost always too much stuff.  Too much stuff to move, to store, to clean, to organize, etc.  I moved and went through the process of selling, trashing, and giving away a lot of my things.  It was humiliating to be honest.  But I let myself deal with the bad feelings.  I felt like a glutton.  I felt like it was a huge waste of time and money.  It felt overwhelmingly personal having people dickering with me on the price on the possessions I had so eagerly and thoughtlessly acquired.  Why didn't people want my stuff!  Even just dropping stuff off for donation I often felt really guilty and embarrassed for some reason. I resolved to have less so I would have to do this again.    Lastly, it's emotional clutter that your dealing with with these mini-staplers.  Every time you look at them, you spend time and mental energy deciding what to do with them.  You feel what? Guilt? Anxiety?  Frustration?  Seriously, just make the decision to get rid of them so you don't waste more mental space on them."

That said, the messages and core ideas are key, if you haven't read the book I will sum them up here.    Throw away anything that doesn't bring you joy - even if it is semi useful - basically, only keep things that are cherished, get rid of everything else. (Quality over quantity) Throw away clutter or otherwise get rid of it / Dont organize or clean it. Make the change dramatic.

The reason why it's important to know the above, is because you can join a sub expecting it to be the former, while turning out to be the latter.  In particular, I've found that any subs which are devoted to philosophies, ideologies, economics, or anything else that consists of primarily subjective information, is best avoided; since pretty much their only purpose for existence, is farming karma by reinforcing groupthink.

If you don't wear them anymore, remember it's just fabric with something stamped on it. Get a pen with a team logo, or an air freshener. What I am saying is that if you are not actually using the sweatshirt as a sweatshirt, then all you are using it for is a surface to have a stamp on, and you can have that on anything, even your phone wallpaper, so there's no need to hold onto an item of clothing just because it has a logo on it.    There's a charity called Cinderella's Closet, they take prom dresses and bridesmaid dresses and make them available to teens who can't afford prom dresses. It's a beautiful way to have those bridesmaid's dresses put to use.   I myself have been in 4 or 5 weddings and have never, ever, ever worn the dresses again, so keeping them was just taking up valuable space. As for the memories, I had great photos of the events - why would I need the actual dress? When my own wedding was over, I donated my wedding dress. I had no need for it, and I had no attachment to it. Was it sentimental? Sure. But I had the photos. If I didn't donate it, it would sit in a box on a shelf in the back of my closet for decades, and every 5 years I'd take it out and say ""Oh I remember that day"", and that's that. There's no use to it. So it was really easy to get rid of, and hopefully someone else was able to use it and have great memories of it."

Consequently, I decided to keep 4-6 books on my Kindle at any given time. Any more than that and I'd spend more time looking for what to read rather than reading.

The kindle will help me be able to read in the evening without having a bright light in my face. For me I consider that a big bonus.

Even so, I found reading this book to be a breath of fresh air with it's Shinto sourced outlook, and it really has redefined the way I interact with my living spaces.  If a ratty old T-shirt from twenty years ago sparks joy, she counsels you to keep it.  The core principle of KonMari isn't really about throwing stuff out so much as loving and having an active relationship with what you choose to keep.

The second day we had 2 more truck loads of trash and useless things, and I'm positive we have at least 2 more loads to go. Outside of her guidance that really structured our plan of attack, she is really fascinating to read, as she thanks her socks for working so hard and introduces herself to the houses she visits. Her method is intense, almost religiously so, but is really fun and I got really pumped after reading her book."
declutter,35sijl,theshadybird,9,Wed May 13 05:33:31 2015 UTC,"What I appreciated about her method aside from the ""sparking joy"" bit, was the technique for folding clothes and putting things away. I find that by being more conscious about how I put my things away, I appreciate the things I own more and I'm constantly finding more things to get rid of. I also feel suddenly very aware of the condition of my clothing. When you spend 30+ seconds folding an item of clothing, it makes you painfully aware of whether that item is worth the effort.   What I'm trying to say is, aside from the organizing part, I think the book is worth it for the perspective on being conscious about your belongings."
declutter,35sijl,QuadellsWife,24,Wed May 13 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm one of the few people in this sub that has been critical of her methods. At first, I was basing it off of summaries of what I had read online, but then I actually read the entire book. Here are the reasons why I don't like the book:  -She seems very inflexible in her approach. She criticizes other methods and says why hers is the best and the only way to really do something. It cakes across as authoritarian, not expert, IMO.  -She assigns emotions to inanimate objects. You aren't supposed to disrespect your socks by balling them up and you are supposed to wake up books with a quick smack. I'm never going to dress up to to tidy in order to show my respect for the stuff that is leaving my house as she suggests.  -The whole premise is about ""sparking joy"" with possessions, but it doesn't talk about the pure utility of some items. I don't get joy out of looking at a toilet plunger. You better believe that it is super handy when there is a clog though! HANDY, not JOYFUL!  -She talks about crying or nearly crying over seemingly innocuous events, like picking the wrong organizational solution (the wire basket in the shower, anyone?). Too emotional for me.   -The book implies that clearing up spaces has a ""magical"" effect. That is too simplistic. There is very real research and very real reasons as to why clearing our spaces helps to clear our brain. She wasn't interested in spelling out anything those terms. Magic isn't real, but science is!   -The book is very Eastern themed. The concept of energy in items and in the home may not sit well with some. Her list of things to tidy is as follows: clothes, books, papers, miscellany and sentimental items. Miscellany would include a LOT of stuff for the average Westerner! We have bigger living spaces and often times more things as a result. There was no mention of garages, pantries, sheds, etc. the places that are not common in Japan. So I feel like the book is better suited for certain types of folks, perhaps apartment dwellers in high density population areas.   As someone else commented, all her advice was about throwing stuff out with no mention of donations, recycling, etc. I didn't like that. I have paid clients for space organizing and I actually haul away items that need to be donated or taken to the hazardous waste center. I feel that is the only responsible way of doing things.  I did find some good information in the book though. They were things I already had in practice in my own life and advise others to do. Grouping items is essential. Having categories of items spread all over the house isn't helpful. Get them together and THEN make decisions about what needs to be kept and what needs to be purged.   I would say it could be a helpful book for those new to the idea of decluttering, but not for people that are pretty advanced with letting stuff go. There are some clients I wouldn't recommend the book at all to because of the high emotional energy in the book. It just really depends on your personality as to whether this speaks to you or it just sounds like a coming of age decluttering book written by an overly emotional girl in a cutesy Japanese-kawaii manner."
declutter,35sijl,TheStephinator,30,Wed May 13 13:42:02 2015 UTC,"One should keep in mind that this was written for a Japanese audience, for whom Shinto is ingrained into the substrate of culture.  She was once herself a shrine maiden.  When she speaks of the spirits and gods that permeate and inhabit all things and the duties, relationships, and obligation you have with them, this is part of a rich cultural tradition that her intended audience understood as part of their upbringing.  Much of this practice has been lost in the modern day, having devolved into festival and ritual.  When she speaks of these things, she is just as strongly reminding today's Japanese of the forgotten ways.  The hidden subtext throughout the book is treating your home as a sacred shrine that is the home of numerous spirits and gods.  This ability to hold things and fulfill duties as sacred is a key to keeping one's promises and resolve inviolate, which is a driver of the life change she speaks."
declutter,35sijl,cleanedge,31,Wed May 13 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"I frequently see the objection that useful items may not be joyful, and I think it's a misunderstanding of the method. When you pick up your plunger you don't feel joy as though you've picked up a puppy, but you do feel happy on some level that you're prepared for potential clogs. Unless it's a crappy plunger, in which case you feel nervous that it might not handle clogs, which is a sign that you need to pitch it and replace it with one that does give you that sense of safety.  I think that's what she's getting at. Not ecstatic love for every possession, but a sense that owning it makes your life better, not worse, and an awareness of that on an emotional level. It's a very subtle joy, which is why she has her order, because it takes practice to be able to notice it."
declutter,35sijl,eukomos,3,Wed May 13 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"She does talk about items with utility, and how even though they may not inherently ""spark joy"", the goal is to appreciate the usefulness they bring."

Then, when I started doing it myself, I took it as a way of lessening any feelings of guilt (as an American).  That is, if I communicate with the thing and thank it for doing its job, then I don't feel guilty about getting rid of something that could potentially do something else."

declutter,35sijl,MollyTamale,16,Thu May 14 14:39:26 2015 UTC,"I listened to it on YouTube to see if it was for me. Think about what you're paying for, one person's expertise developed over years that is regimented and well explained. There's much more to it than sparking joy, there's an order of doing things, and a reason for that order. Absorbing that info is like training, teaching you how, why, when, where and what. She tells stories of clients she's had, I'm sure many can relate and see themselves. As someone who comes from a childhood hoarder hell house I appreciate the depth because it's a deeper issue for me than just tidying up."
declutter,35sijl,drivers9001,7,Wed May 13 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"I recommend reading it. It's not a long book. I found it very motivating. I got through decluttering clothes, books, and papers. Actually for papers I set aside some of that I still need to work on, and some that are actually memorabilia, the last category in the book because it is the hardest. Looking forward having time to do the ""komono"" category which is basically everything else (misc items)."
declutter,35sijl,lampcozy,7,Wed May 13 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"I spent a lot of time trying to get started on decluttering and it never seemed to pick up momentum for me.  I tried getting rid of one thing per day, spending 15 minutes a day tidying up, trying a month of getting rid of however many things matched the day of the month.  None of them really stuck because the problem with clutter is the amount of time you spend on it.  Asking yourself to spend extra time on top of that to spend even more time removing clutter always seemed like a waste of time.  That book helped me get rid of a bunch of stuff fast and when I was done I could stop worrying about it."
declutter,35sijl,papercranium,3,Wed May 13 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. I tried various methods without success.

I actually find it easier to treat my belongings well for their own sake, rather than for my sake. If I think of them as friends, I take care of them. And if I can thank them for their service and let them go be what they were meant to be for someone else, I don't fret over their sentimental meaning to me personally. I don't believe my shirts have feelings. But by pretending they do, I actually enjoy working to keep them tidy. It's not something I can motivate myself to do for myself."

While her folding style takes more time (and i don't do it with my socks!) i love being able to find all of my clothes quickly & easily.  And knowing everything there is something i want to wear.  I feel like i can find things faster and easier, and it is easier to maintain my home since everything has a place it belongs.    I have definitely previously been a person that if my clutter was well organized it was all OK, but this has encouraged me to question that line of thinking.  Now the things i have are things i want.  I don't empty my purse daily, but it now has a home, which is making life way easier.  Although i don't subscribe to a shinto style belief system, i do find find myself appreciating my belongings more and even occasionally thanking them.  it's silly, but brings a little happy to my day."

declutter,35sijl,erik__,3,Wed May 13 10:53:14 2015 UTC,"If you already declutter based on what makes you happy, I dont think there's much difference. I hadnt ever considered this so it made a huge difference for me.  The other big ""aha!"" moment for me was reading the order she suggests for decluttering. She starts with what most people are less attached to (tshirts, pants etc) and then moves on to more sentimental items."
declutter,35sijl,starrynightgirl,3,Wed May 13 17:15:51 2015 UTC,It worked wonders for me.  If you don't have much of a clutter problem then you'll probably won't think she's a big deal.  It's also a translation from a Japanese book.  Some people don't get how toilet paper can spark joy.  I don't really understand that point of view.  I'd be miserable if toilet paper wasn't in my life.

declutter,35sijl,Limond,2,Wed May 13 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"That was my biggest question with the book. She does mention it (barely), but only in passing, and never discusses how to donate, recycle, etc. I guess there's a difference between being tidy, which everyone wants, and being environmentally conscious, which is more rare.  My other big question was how to clean a place that you share. It seems like all her clients were single (female, mostly). She mentions that if you start to minimize your stuff, the other people will follow, but bullshit on that, I say. And what about shared items?"

declutter,35pt1i,alexisdr,1 point,Tue May 12 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"I found out recently that you can look up junk removal services that provide options for working with hoarders.   My sister and I decluttered many years of our junk from our parents house, and we had no way of disposing well over 30 huge and heavy bags/boxes/appliances etc. After dropping off whatever we could (books at the library, clothing at good will, so forth) we ended up calling a junk removal business to come over just last weekend to pick up the rest. We had presorted and preboxed/bagged all our junk for them to simply come and remove (which they did in less than half an hour!) but we did ask them about how they would deal with something like our garage, which was just full of unorganized clutter. The guys explained that, when working with a hoarder situation, they would handle all the labor of taking EVERYTHING out of the garage and laying them out on the driveway, from which you would point at what you want to keep and where to put it; As for the rest, they would pack up and take away all the remaining junk in an astonishingly fast and efficient manner. (Edit: And to help ease your conscience about the environment-- choose a junk removal company that sorts, recycles, and donates your junk!)  The service can cost quite a bit (at least several hundred USD), but especially if you and/or your parents are getting old, the task of cleaning everything up is really mentally overwhelming and time consuming (not to mention physically taxing!) And renting your own truck truck and paying disposal fees really adds up as well, to the point that it may be worth just getting full service junk removal.   I also second the suggestion of having your dad read ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up"", which has been an amazing inspiration for me. Coming from the book, I do believe that the mindset is crucial in keeping a tidy place, so I also believe that your dad needs to want to be a part of this decluttering process, otherwise whatever progress you make in organizing things will just be quickly recluttered by him.   Good luck with your situation!"
declutter,35pt1i,dolphinesque,5,Wed May 13 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"If your Dad is on board with decluttering, I'd get the book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up and do that program.  It's pretty simple and effective and you get done with everyone in one shot instead of dragging it out over months.  You could be done in a week and for some people visible change is a lot more motivating than small changes that add up over time."
declutter,35pt1i,Wait_Procrastinate,6,Thu May 14 04:25:41 2015 UTC,"Is he a hoarder or is he just depressed and lazy and likes decor items? There's a difference.  As everyone else has said, you can't aim to clean the whole house just your bedroom, the kitchen, and ideally a communal space. BUT be very careful that you also don't turn into his personal maid. Once it's cleaned up he has to if not actively help maintain it, then at least not actively destroy it.  If any of his stuff has to be in your space stack it neatly away and throw a nice sheet or something over it as a visual barrier, make your space not just clean, but also visually appealing.   Keep the kitchen benches empty - clutter begats clutter. A plate that you left on a totally empty counter is obvious and begging to be put away. A plate left on a counter with an old breadmaker that's never used, a stack of letters, a coin jar,and a few dusty decorative items blends in and gets forgotten. Put everything that doesn't get used every single day away in a cupboard.  Be aware that once you have a beautiful functional space to be in he's might start using it too, either to hang out in (and probably leave rubbish in) or to store more stuff. Be firm, draw clear boundaries.  Good luck."

Without going into too much detail, as a child she went through a loss of a family member and some financial hardship, repossession, etc.  As far as putting them to a better use, we do have a daughter and she will love some of these items.  Others things are much less timeless (1980s encyclopedias, etc.) or just not even in good enough condition to be worth keeping.  I think that's the hardest part for me.  Of course, I love keeping things from childhood that my own kids may enjoy - I have my full collection of Legos, as well as a few other absolutely sentimental items - but not EVERY toy.  Or things that were not preserved well enough to play with or display.  And as you said, SOMEONE will need these things, even if our family doesn't.

declutter,35ltqs,Limberine,6,Mon May 11 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"Take pictures of all the things. And not just a dark picture in the cupboard, take a picture in good lighting and focus. Upload them to the cloud so they can't be lost or deteriorate like the item itself. As someone else said, this will also give her a record of the book titles if she wants to replace them at some point for her own kids. You can do this without her input then show her that you've got a record just incase anything happens, and that she can look at the pictures and reminisce without having to go through the boxes.  Then, as a sentimental thing, frame it from the toys point of view. A toy wants to be played with. A book wants to be read, I'm sure if they could talk they'd prefer one last hurrah and then to the bin/good will (depending on condition) than being locked in a box for the next 50 years. Let her reread the book or cuddle the teddy then ditch them (her ditch them, not you).  Also, as you said, you have a few sentimental items. Designate (or better yet, have her designate) exactly how much space you're each willing to dedicate to sentimental items forever. I mean, if it's sentimental you're planning to never get rid of it and you're going to have to take it with you from house to house until you're both in a nursing home right? What's a reasonable amount of space to reserve for things with no purpose, for ever? Maybe one medium sized plastic crate? Once you've figured out and agrees on how much space the things can take up (or the number of things, if that works better) then she can fill it with her favourite ones and it'll be a bit easier to get rid of the rest, knowing that the best ones are safe for as long as she wants.  I have a little problem with sentimental things too, these are things that would help me a bit. But it's got to be her decision, don't push her, there's no need to rush."

To him, it's an outdated and useless piece of junk, and I can play far superior games on my cell phone. To me, it's Christmas mornings with my family. It's afternoons with my father when I was a kid. It's memories of my mother (now decesased) cursing hilariously at Burgertime and making us all laugh at her creative outbursts. It's the friend this lonely kid had after torturous days in school, where somehow defeating a few games could make me feel confident and powerful again. It's not an ""outdated piece of junk"" to me. It's my friend, it's my album of memories, it's a tangible connection to my mother who has passed away, and something to talk about with my father, who still laughs about all the time we spent playing Auto Racing.    Now, I do declutter a lot, and I have let a lot of old things go. I agree that there is no reason to keep ALL of that stuff. I still have my childhood teddy bear, but I don't have any other stuffed animals from when I was a kid. I still have a few books I loved, but I can get many more from the library so I didn't need to keep them all.    But to your wife, it is not clutter. They are memories, they are tangible remnants of childhood, they are not junk.   Some things of mine were easier to let go than others. Some things I can just take pictures of, and enjoy the photos, because they give me the same happy nostalgic feeling as the item itself. Some things needed some convincing - for example my favorite tie-dye t-shirt with the holes in it - I couldn't bear to give it up, but it had so many holes it was unwearable, and I had plenty of photos of me wearing it, so logic was able to win out with that one (plus, it made space for a new tie-dye shirt I could love AND wear.)   All this is to say that this could be very hard for your wife. It is an emotional decision, not a logical one.  So make the appeal on the emotional level. For example, ""Let's try to declutter a little more. I'd like to have the room to create our own memories, together, but that's hard to do when that space is cluttered up with the past.""   Maybe a better tactic would be to ask your MIL to stop bringing the items into the house in the first place.  Good luck."
declutter,35ltqs,khattify,3,Tue May 12 12:27:53 2015 UTC,I like the idea of taking pictures of sentimental items. Is really the memories attached to the items that are special. I'm ok with letting the item go if I can be reminded in a picture. She could even a photo album of those things.
declutter,35ltqs,addressourmess,2,Mon May 11 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"A photo album is a great idea. I take pictures of things I care about and it makes it much easier to let them go. The idea of having your  childhood in an album is pretty appealing. My parents threw out most of my toys and books, almost all actually, and I'm still kinda bummed about it but I looked up a few of the toys online and seeing pictures of them was very nearly as good as having mine, I just wanted to refresh the memory I guess."
declutter,35ltqs,looking_for_a_purpos,2,Mon May 11 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"Continue to communicate in a clear, kind, but firm manner.   I don't know if this will be helpful at all, but I did want to throw in my experience. Two people in my family have a really hard time with this. He is Not Sentimental, she is (and has some anxiety to boot). The combo of trying to get rid of stuff and having the non-sentimental partner attempt to help her just makes it extraordinarily hard to get rid of anything! She needs lots of hand holding and talking to get through it, and he just wants to chuck the stuff quickly. I'm not at all saying that you aren't being supportive, please understand. I'm just saying that in long term relationships and marriages, there's a lot of other history and pieces going on. To some people, it can feel very high stakes to declutter with that partner. Is there anyone else who could help? A dear friend of hers, a sibling, etc.? Other distraction techniques can be helpful, like a funny movie in the background or a good audiobook. Or making a date of it with favorite coffe drinks and a plan to go do something (non-cluttery, like a walk or visit to a museum) afterwards?  Another thing that works for my family member is to work in short shifts. That makes it easier to declutter with or without her partner present. She goes until the panicky feeling starts to bubble up, and then she takes a break. That break might be an hour or a week, depending on health and mood. The important thing is to get the stuff out once a break happens. No holding on to it! Don't allow the person to second guess. Even she will admit that she never thinks about the stuff once it's out of the house and donated/recycled/thrown away.  I hope this helps. Good luck to you!"

Another option is to try out second hand book stores where they might give you a few bucks to buy your old books in bulk.  Also, I've seen little outdoor libraries outside where it's basically a glass cabinet with some books to let passerby take whatever they want.

However, the need for content creation on-the-go is certainly understandable especially if you're in school.  Buy a cheaper laptop.   a Nexus 9 tablet    Good for content consumption.  Battery life is fantastic compared to a laptop and if you have lots of text to read or digital textbooks then this allows you do consume those at comfortable angles for long hours.  Keep this.   ....(with a wireless keyboard)   I never quite understood wireless keyboards for tablets.  You have to have a flat surface to use both, it takes up more room to keep loose devices together.  You end up with a small screen, and you're limited with what applications you can use.

My PC is a beast and I adore it.   Since you attend college, the laptop is a must for school, so you have to keep it.   The tablet, that one I would consider abandoning. Your laptop can probably do everything the tablet can and much more. Having the tablet with a keyboard is redundant.    But again, if you use it a lot, keep it! There's nothing wrong with having the 3 of them. It's when people have like an ipad, ipad mini, nexus AND note I start getting concerned lol."

declutter,34p6wz,dolphinesque,5,Sun May 3 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's your SO!   My husband and I were slobs for many years. He got a job that required lots of travel, and I got it together and cleaned after myself every day, and boom, problem solved. The place stays very clean when he's not here.   In fact, in all of the years my husband and I have been together, our primary source of disagreements has been housework. Over the years, we have both gotten a LOT better. It took a long time.   My husband loves to cook, but he can trash a kitchen. I mean, TRASH. He never cleans as he goes, he just leaves every pot, pan, dish, and utensil scattered all over the kitchen. He had it in his head that if he cooked, I should clean. I had it in my head that I'd rather he not cook at all because it's way too much work afterward, and I was willing to clean a reasonable amount, but not after he utterly destroyed a kitchen like that, it wasn't fair. We had so many arguments about it.   Now, I do a lot more cooking, and I clean as I  go so there's almost nothing left to clean when I'm done. He is getting better at cleaning as he goes. I make it a point to never let dishes sit overnight. When I'm alone, I wash dishes as soon as I'm done with them. When my husband is home, I expect the kitchen to be cleaned before bedtime. If we do it together, it goes faster.   It's really hard to clean up after another grown adult. It's even harder when you say ""Please pick your clothes up off the floor,"" and they say ""Okay,"" and a day later, it's still not done, so you gently mention it again, and they are like ""I SAID I'd do it! Lay off!"" and suddenly you're the nagging Mom and they're the lazy, sullen teenager, and you DON'T want to be in that role, nor do you want to clean up another grown adult's mess, and you're stuck. I still don't know a solution for this, because when you share space with someone who does not place a value on cleanliness, you either have to clean up after them, which isn't fair and creates resentment, or you have to continually ""Have a talk"", and they promise to do better, and then they don't do better, and they don't see why it's a big deal, and they resent you for ""nagging"" them all the time.   Work all this out as soon as you can, because it's a doozy."

Put us together, and it was like laziness squared, topped by resentments like ""I did the dishes LAST week, it's his turn"", or ""She made the mess so why should I clean it?"" and so on.    The real solution that works for us, basically, is that he travels for work. I clean up after just myself most of the time, and all of the resentment and arguing is gone. I was ready to move out and get my own apartment, I mean still staying married because I love my husband more than I could ever express. But I was so miserable and exhausted from living that way. There are really only three options:  Live with the mess, do all of the cleaning, or nag until he did some cleaning. None of those were acceptable to me but I had no other choices. You can't force a person to change.   I feel for you. I wish they taught classes in high school about how to live as a grown adult member of society.

declutter,34igvu,quicktoread,5,Fri May 1 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting angle on habits.  For myself I believe that changing long ingrained habits permanently rely on fundamentally shifting your worldview.  When you successfully break an addiction, it doesn't happen because you incrementally wean yourself off of drugs or that you desire to not do drugs, but because you set other priorities that drug addiction is harming.  I think one thing that people have lost in the modern world is the ability to hold things sacred.  Your body is a temple.  Your home is a temple.  Honor it as consecrated holy ground and treat it accordingly as the spirit of God (in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic context) or gods (say in the KonMari Shinto/Buddhist context).  In Buddhism, all of its precepts are optional.  When you are ready, and once you find things in accordance with your beliefs, you undertake certain vows.  I vow that. . .  Are you someone who makes good on your word of honor, one that can hold promises sacred?  There's a reason people are traditionally asked to cleanse their bodies, minds, and spirits for some period of time before undertaking these.  The ability to hold duties and obligations sacred is a skill that can be taught."

declutter,34h0ab,organicatheist,9,Fri May 1 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"I manage to make jam every year and the only equipment I have is the jars and lids. I'm considering getting a jar grabber (I'll admit to gently burning myself when improvising this one), but that's it. Do some research to see ways you can make up for whatever equipment you have by improvising with other kitchen tools.  Ask the three kids to decide on three games they wouldn't mind giving away. Repeat this again right after Christmas every year until the games you have fit inside whatever cupboard/drawer/shelf you want to allocate for game storage.  For art supplies I focus on quality and medium variety. Quality: If you have duplicates, toss the version that's in the worst shape. Variety: The 120-pack of crayons seems great, but most kids are fine with 24 (you'll find many colors barely get used when there are a lot to choose from). Also, see if you can gear usage towards using up things that are close to empty. If you have eight good glue sticks but four of them are almost empty, hide the full ones elsewhere so the kids use up the others first.  I have a problem getting rid of office supplies because I know that they are useful, and it feels like I'm giving away money (this is true of art supplies too). My solution was to find a place for the supplies to go. I've cleaned out a lot of art and office supplies by donating them to the Sunday School room at my church. It becomes an act of philanthropy rather than a waste. See if any local schools (including your kids' schools) would take donations. In purging, start by getting rid of duplicates (you don't need four hole punches), then look for items you can't actually picture a use for (when will you actually use a 4x6 envelope?).  Finally, it's good to remember that games and art are good things for kids to have around - if they use them. If they aren't using them, look for what the barriers are. Do they just not like them? Then you probably don't need them. Are they hard to get to? Put them on lower shelves. Is there never any space? Work on clearing off tables. Engage your kids in the purging process, see what they would be willing (or even happy) to part with."

I am an artist so I understand the need to create, but I also know my kids habits and likes. I kept a small set of crayons, colored pencils, paints, scissors, and paper out in a small basket on their shelf in a closet. They make things all of the time and still have plenty. They use recycling to supplement their supplies if they need something, and I did the hide the gluesticks until one is used up and it works really well. Personally, I think having less makes them more creative.   We also have a deck of cards, dice, and two board games we have gotten down to, and we actually play them regularly instead of watching TV.

If it's not that high of a priority to schedule, then get rid of them.   With puzzles, you just need 2 or maybe 3. That's it. Puzzles are 3 dollars, you can buy another.    I run a business from my home, so I need office supplies. That said, I do not need a LOT of office supplies. My office supplies consist of files and folders (That hang in the filing cabinet), printer paper (on a shelf for paper, as well as one pack of Avery labels I bought 9 years ago), 2 pen holders - one for pens / pencils, one for markers, scissors and hilighters, and then one shoebox. The shoebox contains one stapler, one hole-punch, one box of 100 paper clips, one box of assorted binder clips, one box of staples, and 2 or 3 odds and ends (pencil sharpener, eraser, flash drive). That's it. Oh, and I have stamps, small and large security envelopes, 2 mileage logs, 2 receipt books, and a 3-hole punch in my desk drawer. That is all it takes to run my business. If I need other stuff (sometimes, rarely, I need a larger envelope), I buy one and use it. I don't want to store stuff in my home. I do have a few binders for documents, but I am also working on getting a lot of that stuff scanned and stored online, so that has pared down a lot. Unless you're running a specialized business from your home where special supplies are needed, you really don't need much more than a shelf for paper and labels, a shoe box, and one desk drawer. (or 2 desk drawers and no shoe box.)    I can't help with the art supplies - I have a lot of these and I can't bear to part with them. :)"
declutter,34h0ab,neanderchimpsky,3,Fri May 1 16:02:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  You're absolutely right, it is a fantasy that rarely happens.  I think we'll have everyone pick one board game and a shoe box of art supplies."
declutter,34h0ab,BlauweRoos,2,Fri May 1 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"For the games: Ok so they only get played with at christmas. This means you maybe need some, but not all. Are there ones the kids never go for? Ones they outgrew? Don't hang onto the ones they outgrew just for visitors. Are some missing pieces?   As a kid I always felt  envious of kids who seemed to have a ton of art supplies on hand at any given time so as an adult I def have a habit of hoarding my craft supplies. For the paint go through and see if anything is dried up. Same with markers. For things like crayons and pencils go through and see if you can identify things you have duplicates of. You probably don't need 2 of the same color. Even if 2 kids are coloring at once navigating that sharing situation is probably more valuable of a learning experience than the learning about art that would happen in those few minutes. With workbooks, are some mostly filled up? Are there ones the kids don't use much or are for too young of an age?"
declutter,34h0ab,GoldenEyedCommander,1 point,Fri May 1 23:49:19 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the biggest struggle is that these seem like aspirational items.  My kids colour a ton, but not so much with the painting (the mess and the prep work make it a rare occasion).  The workbooks rarely get used - I have (again) aspirations of having the kids do them, but it rarely happens. I think I get held back by things like this because they're things that we should be using, but don't really find the time for."
declutter,34h0ab,_niko,2,Sat May 2 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"There's probably a few board games that were played more often than the others. Keep one or two, but donate the rest.  Art supplies are another story. I would recommend finding a way to store them more compactly if possible. It really depends on the type of supplies.  Office supplies? If it's not a specific tool (hole punch, stapler, etc) dump it. You can get more envelopes. You can get more post-it notes and notepads.  Note: by dump it I mean get rid of it however you wish. I usually donate if at all possible or wanted."

After I scan the actual papers, I only have to visit them on the computer when I want to, not because they visually caught my eye when glancing at the table or looking through a file cabinet.  Remember that what you are going through is a temporary unpleasant event. Treat yourself in some way after going through the hard stuff. This past year was really rough for me! I had a lot of unexpected legal and medical bills. I used a point based credit card for paying all those bills (and paying the statement in full at the end of the month).

I find that doing the task in measured amounts of time- say, no more than 30 minutes- keeps me from feeling overwhelmed and discouraged.   I sort by groups- medical, financial, sentimental,etc plus ""discard"".   The discard pile goes to the shredder/recycling and the emotional reward for me is taking the shreds and unwanted paper to the bin.      30 minutes.   No more or it will suck the energy out of the day."
declutter,34fex0,BlueCatIsFat,5,Thu Apr 30 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'm working on going paperless right now myself.  The hard part is definitely sorting everything out to know what needs scanned and what's for the shredder or recycling.  It's easier for me to work it out on chunks. 30-60 minutes of sorting, a break, repeat a couple/few times then call it quits for the day. Basically a pomodoro-type setup.  As far as actually going paperless, I essentially follow this method: http://lifehacker.com/5973033/how-i-turned-three-years-of-paper-into-a-highly-organized-searchable-document-database-in-two-days  I'm using a Doxie Go scanner synced wirelessly to my computer, with an external hard drive. I like to listen to the TV, music or something in the background while scanning.  I also put most stuff into Evernote. If you go this route and have sensitive documents, you can encrypt them. I recommend using a tag-based filing system like mentioned here: http://michaelhyatt.com/evernote-tags.html  Once you get through existing stuff, set up a system to keep new stuff in check.  One tip I'm considering instead of shredding a million papers: #6 here: http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/%E2%80%9Curawaza%E2%80%9D-6-fascinating-japanese-life-hacks.html"
declutter,34fex0,BlueCatIsFat,5,Fri May 1 05:18:02 2015 UTC,"Papers are my nemesis, more than anything else. Don't beat yourself up.  Consider this: look at a book with 400 pages. The book itself is pretty small, so it's misleading about how much is in there. Now imagine if you had to clean a room filled with 400 chairs. The room would be packed, or it would be a huge room, and the physical exertion would be a lot!  For me, part of why I shut down is because I'm beating myself up because it feels like it shouldn't be so hard or take so long. If you sort through just fifteen papers, imagine how much it would have been to sort fifteen couches, or fifteen vats of raw sewage, or fifteen greased pigs on Ritalin. Papers are deceptive!!! A lot more brain power goes into them than most things.  So be proud of every little bit you do. Also, I have a folder labeled ""Holy shit, I might need this"" for the stuff I'm just not sure what to do with, but I know is important.

So all medical paperwork is going in blue folders. Bank stuff in green. Paycheck stubs in yellow. Etc... All current mailings and statements have been converted to electronic format. No more paper statements. Separate box for all tax filings.  If it's something I can find online it's tossed.

As silly as it sounds, I thank beer cans as I put them in the recycling bin. I thank underwear and clothes before putting them in the dirty clothes hamper. For me, that's the best first step I can take.  I have 20 of the exact same boxer briefs in different colors. I own no other underwear. I have 3 pairs of the exact same brown dress socks. I have one pair of black dress socks. I have 12 pairs of the exact same ankle cut black socks. I have 6 white a frame undershirts that are identical, 6 black/grey a frame undershirts that are identical (though not to the white ones). I now have places for most of my things- so I almost never have to go hunting for things.  This is the weird appreciation I have for the little things in my life after reading her book.

I wear my wedding band because it makes my wife happy - I couldn't care less about it.  There are ways to approach the Konmari concept without relying on the spiritual or mystical aspects of it. Maybe I'm a curmudgeon, but I'm not going to start thanking my old underwear before throwing it out any time soon.  So instead of looking for a 'spark of joy,' I just focus on a couple of questions:   Do I use this thing? If this disappeared from my home today and I didn't know it was gone, how long would it take me to notice? (For more emotionally-charged stuff) Does this object hold a memory, idea, relationship, or thought that I wouldn't have without it?   It's possible that I end up getting rid of more stuff than the average person would, but I just don't really see any reason to hold on to it. Getting rid of the Mouse EarsTM that I wore on my honeymoon doesn't mean I forget the honeymoon. Giving away a sweater my mom bought me doesn't mean I love her any less. Selling a car I inherited from my grandfather doesn't make him spin in his grave.  So, why keep it?  Just my two cents."

declutter,345rup,whiskeynostalgic,16,Thu Apr 30 20:55:27 2015 UTC,"""Spark of joy"" may be a narrow description. Is the object useful to you? Does using it or otherwise appreciating it make your life easier or happier?   It's okay to be flexible with Konmari. I think it's comes down to actively choosing the objects you want to be in your life. I believe it's correct to interpret ""sparking joy"" as ""bringing joy to my life either directly or through its utility.""  The wedding band is interesting. Did you keep it or no? Why?"

And that's ok. But mostly, what you should be throwing out (if you want to declutter/minimalise) is things you don't need, things that are broken/trash, and things that you might use -sometimes- but just don't get enough use to warrant having a space in your home.   Things that make you doubt? Get rid of it. You can always do this first, and be stricter about what to keep later on... You can always throw out more things."

declutter,345rup,Shike,8,Tue Apr 28 15:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm the same, I classify in the following manner:   Is it improving your life in some manner? Is it degrading your life in some manner? Are you completely apathetic, and if so does it hold utility?   If something is improving your life in what you feel is a tangible way (just makes you happy, you enjoy it, whatever) - keep it.  For me this is actually quite rare.   If it is a hindrance, in the way, and doesn't help you with mandatory utility then toss (some things are a hindrance, but you have to have them unfortunately).    Lastly, if you're apathetic to the item, does it hold any utility?  If no, discard, if yes - grade the degree of utility.  How often are you really using it?  It is getting in your way more then benefiting you from this utility?  If it benefits more than hinders your goals, keep, if it hinders more than helps, toss.  You keep the wedding band because it makes your husband happy or your husband makes you happy and it's representative of that.  The band itself likely wouldn't, it's what's attached to it.  Thus it should fall under category one."

I love to use it because it's sentimental and it does its job so well. That's what the spark of joy means to me -- a little bit of happiness when something works very well.   Maybe that description will help you. But, even if it doesn't, I think your way of decluttering will work well. Don't sweat it, just keep peeling back until you're happy with the amount of things you have."
declutter,345rup,bellsofsaintjohn,6,Wed Apr 29 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"The basic difference between KM discarding and the usual kinds is: usual kind is ""if you have a reason to discard it, do so - don't keep it just in case"" KM is: ""If you don't have a good reason to keep it, discard it."" This results in a whole lot of neutral stuff being discarded that wouldn't otherwise.  To be honest though, KM works best for people who struggle to discard (that's what the ""thanking old underwear"" is for). For people who do form emotional attachments to objects, they have a lot of guilt in throwing them out. If you don't have those attachments, those aspects might not be necessary for you.  If you don't form relationships with objects, it'd be like she's asking you to start, which would be crazy. In fact, she's addressing people who have unhealthy relationships with objects, and teaching them to make them healthy ones, or end them. That line about ""not every person you meet is destined to be a boyfriend/girlfriend"" etc"
declutter,345rup,emk2203,6,Wed Apr 29 08:34:39 2015 UTC,"I think you put too much emphasis on the spiritual aspect of KonMari. This comes from a Japanese culture, where teachers sometimes scold students by saying ""Apologize to the paper for wasting it!"" when the students paint without showing effort.  Translate it for you own mindset and cultural background, and you will be fine."
declutter,345rup,n_throw_away1e8bc4e8,5,Wed Apr 29 12:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole ""spark of joy"" thing doesn't really work for people who suffer from depression (which can exacerbate hoarding/clutter problems).  You can ask yourself something like: ""if i put this in a box, will i ever take it out again?"" and if the item was already put away then ask yourself when was the last time you used it"
declutter,345rup,torotorolittledog,3,Tue Apr 28 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"Ha. I read that book too. If I did the ""spark of joy"" test to its fullest in my closet, I'd have three articles of clothing left."
declutter,345rup,LavernicaDeLuca,2,Wed Apr 29 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"I've felt the same feelings while going through Konmari. I don't have much that truly makes me happy to have aside from a few things like my digital camera and my laptop. I'm not a very sentimental person but I still managed to accumulate a lot of stuff. Konmari helped me let get rid of the junk that was sitting around just because. There was no reason, it was just something I bought at some point and just didn't bother to get rid of."
declutter,345rup,cleanedge,2,Tue Apr 28 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you are just thinking about it too much.  The idea is that you are letting your subconscious decide and it's easy to let your conscious thoughts override that.  You could try speeding up the process - decide in the time it takes you to pick it up and throw it in a pile.  Most people's brains will have attached good or bad emotions to most objects, yours may just be more subtle and less obvious but it should be there.  You probably just aren't too attached to your stuff, which honestly isn't a bad thing.  I do think there's some value to surrounding yourself with things that spark joy, but it's not wrong to be focused on people or activities instead.  Just keep the things needed to do what's important to you."
declutter,345rup,Gooseygumdrops,2,Tue Apr 28 16:39:45 2015 UTC,I'd opine that you either  take things for granted or you're really not attached to stuff.  Maybe you really could get rid if all your possessions and be perfectly content.  I know the object that makes me happiest is my hot water heater.  The first time I experienced a hot shower I thought I'd found heaven.

declutter,345rup,kairisika,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:51:20 2015 UTC,Sometimes it hard to know that we appreciate things until they're gone. Try imagining NOT having the item and whether or not that would make you unhappy.   I find this method works well for essential items that don't spark joy. Toilet paper doesn't spark joy but I'd be very unhappy if I didn't have it. Maybe having a wedding band doesn't spark joy but losing it would make sad and angry with myself.
declutter,345rup,betnhe,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Konmari seems to me like a very emotion-based system. I think it could probably be good for people who have a lot of emotional attachments to their stuff and need to find a way to break the broad emotional ""but it's my stuff!"" feeling.    If you're not emotional in your stuff-having, it doesn't seem like the best system.    Because I'm with you. I don't own anything that causes ""sparks of joy"", and the idea is silly to me (not that someone else might - just related to me personally).    I own things that I find useful. My problem with clutter is saving things I imagine might someday be useful, and convincing myself to not excessively hoard things ""in case I find a use"". The Konmari system isn't of any use to me, and might not be for you either.    I suggest you instead figure out for yourself what makes something worth owning, and judge on that basis. Your standard may be something different from the ""spark of joy"" that works for others."
declutter,345rup,kairisika,2,Wed Apr 29 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"It seems emotion-based, but it's not. The thing is: your irrationale makes you keep things. If you take an item and really look at it (which is what she promotes), you have a chance to view it objectively. At first your irrationality stirs (guilty feelings, sunken cost fallacy, memories). Once that settles you can finally see what is really there, uncloaked. And that is when you know if it 'sparks joy'.   Another thing is that I have found the 'spark joy' an incomplete translation because it is very vulnerable to misinterpretation.  A lunch box is not very exciting. But if you use it everyday and it keeps your lunch fresh and the lid stays on well even if you shake it, then it's definitely a keeper. It improves your quality of life, be it in a small way. It makes you feel content. That is the spark of joy."
declutter,345rup,conzathon,1 point,Mon May 11 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"You're trying to define things that really don't cause feelings of joy as still a ""spark of joy"".  why not just accept that ""it's useful and regularly used"" as the alternative instead of trying to force that under the umbrella of ""spark of joy""?    A spark of joy is inherently emotional, and that's exactly what you're talking about overcoming - the feelings of guilt and specific memories attached to it.    Yes, it's valuable to take a good look at everything and decide if it is worth keeping to you.  But deciding on the basis of whether you feel something about it, which is precisely what that system says, is not for everyone. Instead, one can take the good part of the system (the examining your belongings), and adapt it to a way that works for the individual (for example, ""do I use this regularly enough"")."

I think it gives people a sense of accomplishment as well as a feeling of control over their surroundings. People who have been through an upheaval often can use those positive feelings to help them feel confident and competent again.

If the item has sentimental value, you could make a stuffed animal or small pillow.   Keep in mind that there's no waste in throwing away something that has served it's purpose, and (for me at least) a major source of clutter is holding on to things that no one will need or want just because it seems too good for the trash. It sounds like this jacket is something you could let go. Also, many donation places turn clothing that is too worn for use into rags to sell in bulk anyway... so donation is still an option. If you have a bag of clothes that you're planning on donating, I'd say throw it in there."

Two other interesting options though:   If you bought from a store with a lifetime warranty (nordstrom/eddie bauer/llbean/rei/etc) you could try having it replaced You could try contacting the manufacturer and ask them if they'd repair/replace it.  (Or give partial credit towards a new purchase)"

declutter,33ya1l,BaylisAscaris,10,Sun Apr 26 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Great list, upvote for you. I'll add some of my favorite techniques for decluttering my brain (mostly using Android apps, though some are cross-platform):   -In my phone's grocery list I like to put good price-per-ounce ranges next to certain items so I can stock up when prices are good (my store always lists the per ounce price).  -For Android apps, I use a program called Timesheet (free) so I can one-click a widget to start/stop recording my freelance hours. It automatically calculates the total time. I used to record my times in notepad and it was scattered, unprofessional, and extra work. Timesheet has more features than I need, but I haven't researched alternatives yet.   -Speaking of widgets, if you have an Android phone and don't know how to set up widgets on your homescreen, it's definitely worth your time to learn. Your needs will be different than mine, but it can make important information more accessible, make common tasks a one-click process, and let you replace some of the icons on your homescreen with something more useful. Some widgets are downloaded separately from the main app, such as (this) Evernote widget.  -I love, love the paperless options many programs are integrating. Evernote (free) and Google Drive (free) for example have document cameras. They can be opened with one click from the homescreen from either a widget or shortcut. I know Drive automatically OCRs text for easy searching, and I think Evernote does it when you use the special document mode. The extent to which this has helped me declutter cannot be overstated.   -Google Music (free) lets you upload your music library so you can access it from any computer and any device that can access the Music app. You can keep an archival copy of your music somewhere that you have a lot of space, but not need to worry about syncing your library to different devices (you can still choose what music to store locally to cut down on data usage, but it's delivered from the cloud so that you don't have to deal with file explorers, connecting to computers, and transferring files to each device).  -""OK Google"" from the Google Now app (free) makes it incredibly easy to set reminders, timers, and alarms through a quick voice command. It's a 5 second process so I use it even for simple things like remembering to switch the wash over or check something that's on the stove. Note that having ""Ok Google"" detection on at all times can interfere with camera apps and VoIP/Wifi call quality on some phones - in which case you should leave the default setting to only detect ""Ok Google"" when Google Now is open.  -Tasker (paid) and NFC tag reading programs automate the process of changing settings on your phone when you get to work, when you're in the car, or when you're ready for bed. For example you can have your bluetooth turned on, all your volumes turned to max, brightness turned to max, and Google Now opened (so you can give it a command like ""OK Google, navigate to the post office"") as soon as you tap an NFC tag in your car. Or you can set Tasker to automatically turn off your wifi when you leave home to conserve battery power. Some things to note with this are that Tasker is probably over a lot of people's heads, and not all NFC tags are compatible with every phone. However, many NFC reading programs have friendly interfaces that can do simple tasks without the need for Tasker.  -Using a Chrome extension, the Pocket app (free) will try to intelligently pull the text from articles you'd like to read and then sync them across your devices in a customizable reading layout. Or you can view the original pages. Either way this is great for cutting down on browser tabs and for making that interesting article available to read when you're waiting in line at the store. The jury is still out on this product, but the free version seems adequate so far. Chrome to Phone and Evernote Web Clipper are other alternatives.  -Losing things can be a problem for those of us with clutter. You can configure the Lookout app (free) to make your phone sound an alarm and give you its last known GPS position if you lose it.   -Back to Evernote, I keep several key notes and notebooks. There's no way in hell I'd be able to keep track of these things without cluttering up my life:   Favorite recipes. Bonus: you can double-check ingredients when you're at the store.  I write down medical things as they come up so I remember to bring them up next time I have an appointment Medication dosages, medical conditions, allergies, family medical history, doctor's numbers, emergency numbers. Never know when you might need these in a hurry. I also keep a tiny copy of everything except the family history in my wallet (so far have not needed it, but it did get my wallet returned to me very quickly when I lost it a few years ago). Encoded passwords (in other words I'll have a base password, then make all my passwords are variations on that, so all I need to do is write my username and then ""3# 1 cap"" to know that it is the base password with 3 of the letters swapped for numbers and the first letter is capitalized - it's fairly secure because I don't write out the base password and it will be meaningless to a snooper) List of places I like to eat and dishes to make when I'm too hungry to think and remember things. Surprisingly useful. Travel and camping checklists Lists of attractions/restaurants/key places/notes for cities I visit, both for entertaining and for giving recommendations to others Shopping lists for specific stores like Costco Instruction manuals Guest lists, because it's nice to be reminded of my partner's friends and people I haven't seen in a long time when planning a get-together.  Records going back a few years of what I've given as gifts to people and what they've had on wish lists. You wouldn't think this is super useful, but it helps reminds you of their taste or of that thing that they really wanted but didn't get last year. If you already keep a list to make sure you've got everyone covered, it doesn't even need to add extra work. I also make private custom lists for people on Amazon to keep track of ideas. Organized gift ideas make birthdays and the holidays much less stressful.  Voice recordings of meetings in case I didn't catch everything in my notes. However, Microsoft OneNote is way better than Evernote for this, as it will show you what part of the meeting correlates to what part in your written notes. Likewise, you can find a spot in your written notes that doesn't make sense and the audio will jump right to that spot so you can listen to it again. The downside of OneNote is I found it took up too much space and I had an issue with it making several copies of notes (which exacerbated the space problems) - but they may have worked out the bugs since. These comments are based on the Windows version, but it is now on Android (here).   Note: several of the apps listed as free have additional storage space or features available with a paid version or in-app purchases. I list what versions provide the functionality I've discussed."

I've found that as I slowly get rid of more things, I'll go back to an area I already cleaned and get rid of things I don't need but couldn't part with at first. Use the 20/20 rule for ""just in case"" items. For books, there are different ways to approach it.  I am trying to not have any books, so I wrote down the names and authors of books I had and want to read eventually and then donated my copy.  When I get time to read them, I will get a copy from a library. For papers, records, class notes, etc., recycle what you don't need and keep only digital copies of what you can.      Can you give us a little more detail on your situation and what stuff you're having a hard time decluttering?  For example, if this is the first time you're moving out of your parents house I would have different advice than if you're a college student who has lived in several different places in the last few years.     For me, the most important decluttering accomplishment came with deciding to stop buying more things.  I will only go to the store if I really need something and can't make do with what I have.  I will only look for that item because I know if I look through the clearance section I will end up finding things I want simply because it's a deal, not because I need it."
declutter,33uasa,leslietheriveter,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"20/20 rule is interesting. I'm still weary though just because we've never lived on our own and I'm still paying student debt (recent grad). So I might not realize what I do or don't really need to take and I can't afford to replace a 20$ item every week :/ but it should work for some things at least! Thanks for the tips!  So our situation is, we are 22 and 25, always lived at home I just graduated university. We are planning on buying most things like dishes etc from thrift stores to save money and just reduce our footprint by not buying new stuff.

declutter,33uasa,leslietheriveter,3,Sun Apr 26 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"In this case I would see the decluttering process as not all happening before the move.  For me, the first time I lived on my own was when I started to get a good grasp on what I really need and what I don't.  For example, I bought all sorts of different cleaning supplies that I didn't need and now I'm focusing on only having reusable supplies which are multi functional and/or last a long time.  After you've lived in your new place for six months take stock of what you have and haven't used and try to declutter accordingly.     My main tip for your first place is buy as little as possible in advance, then once you're there only buy things as you need them.  I'll use another personal example to illustrate the point: I bought a storage ottoman thinking it would be cute and functional, where in reality I didn't need an ottoman so it just became an awkwardly shaped storage container."

I recently moved out of my dad's house and I found the best way to truly keep my apartment minimal was to take the bare minimum of stuff I thought I'd need to the new place. Left the rest at my dad's.  I've slowly been bringing more stuff to the apartment if I think I need it, but honestly,  it's made me realize that I really don't need or use 80% of my belongings. Every time I go to get more stuff from my dad's I donate the stuff I've realized I don't need."
declutter,33uasa,drdeadringer,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:43:34 2015 UTC,We are only moving about 45 minutes away. I was going to try and get rid of as much stuff as I know I can live without and then some things like clothes I just can't bring myself to get rid of but don't need at the moment (maybe winter and dressy clothes) I could leave there and after a few months if I still haven't needed/missed them then I can easily go and just donate it. I think the thing I'm having the hardest time bringing myself to get rid of is my record collection. We won't have room for the whole thing (about 300 records) and I might only be able to bring one crate for listening but I just don't want to get rid of them! haha really stuck on that one. We're also trying to rent a fairly small place which forces us not to bring lot of our stuff.

The idea is that I'd just copy my info over into their form and start anew with each new trip of stuff.  I'm hoping I can eventually do it, though. We dropped off two boxes of stuff last week and I didn't even bother taking a form because I never had time go through it all. I needed to see my floor more than I needed the write-off.  100+ items is a great decluttering effort. Congrats!"
declutter,33rbb5,happyeggeater,3,Fri Apr 24 22:13:36 2015 UTC,Do they just give you a blank sheet each time?
declutter,33rbb5,happyeggeater,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:22:28 2015 UTC,Yeah. Last time I filled it out it was hard to remember what I'd put in and what category it would fall under. I figured a template would speed things up.
declutter,33rbb5,TheStephinator,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is standard."
declutter,33rbb5,smom,3,Sat Apr 25 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"I usually type out a list of what is donated in lots - print sheet, attach to receipt, file in this years donation receipts envelope. If you are rushed for time you can take photos and document later."
declutter,33rbb5,urlefthand,2,Sat Apr 25 00:56:03 2015 UTC,It might be worth getting some software that tracks your donations and values for tax time. Most of the big vendors have something like this.   I've never had a donation place do anything more than mark off a number of boxes or bags.
declutter,33rbb5,5edgy,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"For someone who's never tried to get tax $ back for donations, is there an easy explanation/guide to doing this?"
declutter,33rbb5,lilfunky1,2,Sat Apr 25 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"Generally I've just gotten to the part of the tax software where it asks if I've made donations and I fill it in from there. But you need the documents/receipts if you are audited. It also helps to have documentation when filling things in so you know exactly what went where. If you get your taxes done somewhere I'd imagine it's the same - they'll need your papers saying what you donated where. Sometimes it's not alot if any that you'll get back, but I'll fill it in regardless. Worth checking."
declutter,33pv8u,nataliehw,0,Fri Apr 24 15:04:32 2015 UTC,are there any more tips that you want to add to this? let me know ! oh and by the way this is what im going to do this weekend... yey fun!
