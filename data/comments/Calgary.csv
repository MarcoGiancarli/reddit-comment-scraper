Calgary,3e3tpr,Mighty_Ack,14,Tue Jul 21 19:13:18 2015 UTC,These for-profit event things just wreak of being scams.
Calgary,3e3tpr,unjung,3,Tue Jul 21 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty smart actually. Every jackass with nothing better to do sees this as an opportunity 'to get out'. Take their money, give them a half ass experience and dont make the event again.   Then you change the company name and wait a yearbefore you do it again .  This shit is nasty too. The water is recirculated so youre essentially sliding down in a mixture of water/piss/spit/sweat. Nasty Calgarians."
Calgary,3e3tpr,Fuckoff_CPS,3,Tue Jul 21 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"And it sounds like they've pulled the regular additional step of shacking up with a charity and using volunteer labour to get the job done. Of course this guarantees confusion and sub-par service. (This is also why Stampede Roundup had long alcohol ticket sales lines this year, although arguably that's still a much, much better run event.) At least Colour Me Rad, etc. use paid staff."
Calgary,3e3tpr,unjung,4,Tue Jul 21 21:01:20 2015 UTC,What exactly are you suggesting?
Calgary,3e3tpr,NateStark,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Caveat emptor.  A one-off event like this that may or may not happen next year just need to build hype, capitalize and piss off. They have little vested interest in maintaining happy customers, because they won't be around for a while or even ever again."
Calgary,3e3tpr,unjung,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"""Let the buyer beware""... OK but I still fail to see how this reeks of a scam any moreso than a music festival or a concert?"
Calgary,3e3tpr,NateStark,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"Caveat Emptor, do your due diligence, buy a time machine, go into the future and see how they are going to fuck you over. What a scam. But... buyer beware, it's your own fault for expecting what was advertised."
Calgary,3e3tpr,00mba,5,Tue Jul 21 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"What? Caveat emptor literally means ""let the buyer beware"". I fail to see how still being allowed to go up and down as you please (within a certain timeframe) is getting fucked over... You're here talking about time machines and God knows what else."
Calgary,3e3tpr,NateStark,-6,Tue Jul 21 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"Originally, the ‘unlimited’ pass offered sliders exclusive access to the waterslide an hour before it opened and an hour after it closed – as well as the ability to slide down the soapy wet vinyl as many times as desired.   Now they have a ""timeframe"" over the weekend of 6 hours where they can slide, can you see the difference? Unlimited means, unlimited. What if it said ""Unlimited sliding for one hour!"" Or even 30 mins, or 10 mins. Is it really unlimited? I guess. Is it a sleezy way of selling something? Yes.   I was making fun of the caveat emptor part because how can you possibly predict that a company will change its unlimited feature to 6 hours on one day? You cant. Caveat Emptor is not possible in this situation because they got bait and switched. If the company had a history of doing this, then maybe Caveat Emptor, i guess."
Calgary,3e3tpr,00mba,6,Tue Jul 21 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"""Only Unlimited wristbands will be allowed to slide an hour before the slide opens and an hour after it closes. In addition to that, you'll get a wristband that gives you the ability to slide as many times as you like during the day."" This was the blurb when I bought my tickets, and it was what was on the website as of 10am this morning."
Calgary,3e3tpr,mrmoreawesome,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"In what way is this baited? You're still getting a hell of a lot more sliding than someone who pays for 1 or 3 or whatever. Maybe they saw from the other events how unlimited sliding was making wait times so much longer or something like that? And further, almost every ticket purchased for any sort of event has some language to the effect of ""subject to change""."
Calgary,3e3tpr,NateStark,6,Tue Jul 21 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"Saying unlimited and then it not being unlimited is baiting.   Subject to Change is something they put in the contract so they can do this without it being an issue legally. Does it make it right? No. Does it make them look like shit? Absolutely.   If you are speaking in terms of legality and business, tough shit for the customers. If you are speaking in terms of customer service, morality, and good business, it's very disingenuous/   Do the customers have a right to sue them? Nope. Do they have a right to complain? Absolutely."
Calgary,3e3tpr,00mba,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"I would argue that baiting requires intent. Did they offer an unlimited pass and plan to restrict it to certain times later in order to simply charge more for it then yes, it is baiting. However, in the time-allotted you are still allowed to slide for an unlimited amount of time and the change may have been, as I said, due to failures at other events. I don't believe it is amoral or poor customer service, in fact it make be better customer service for the event as a whole."
Calgary,3e3tpr,NateStark,3,Tue Jul 21 20:31:07 2015 UTC,A lot of bad comments on the Facebook event page. The Kamloops event had three hour waits.

If you look at the anatomy of the foot and lower leg, you will note that most of the pertainent muscles are tiny (foot intrinsics, tibialis posterior).  Building these skinny little muscles will not make much difference in foot position when you have body weight + force of the step coming down.  That, and I'd be surprised a service as busy as sports med would bother with PF."
Calgary,3e3rrh,cracher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input.  Are you in this field?   I've found that other muscles (especially stabilizers of the foot) get very sore sometimes.  To the point where I will avoid walking to avoid the pain.  I have reason to believe this relates to the PF issue.
Calgary,3e445o,CalgaryMensWellness,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Genuinely question..  What's the difference between gay and queer?  And wouldn't ""other men who have sex with men"" fall under either gay or bi?"
Calgary,3e445o,electricsheep12345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:26 2015 UTC,"Gay typically refers to a man who is sexually and romantically attracted to another man. Queer is more broad, and different people who identify as queer describe it differently. Generally speaking, queer identified people don't subscribe to ""traditional"" or ""mainstream"" conceptions that are attached to labels like ""gay"" or ""bisexual"". Someone can also use queer to describe their gender, rather than their sexual orientation.  ""Other men who have sex with men"" might include men who identify as straight but also have sex with men. It is more about the sexual activity than it is about the identity."
Calgary,3e445o,electricsheep12345,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"Uhh .. ok .. I guess it's a bit more clear.  I guess I've never put too much thought into separating my gender, identity and sexual orientation."

Calgary,3dy8c1,rotten42,-19,Mon Jul 20 16:43:26 2015 UTC,@canehdianman @rotten42 - It is ALWAYS a good idea to speak directly to the Charity if you ever see a business/individual Fundraising or Leveraging a foundation. @TheDerwin did take your advice and I was contacted by the team at Make-A-Wish this afternoon.

Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,6,Mon Jul 20 22:39:47 2015 UTC,What are the chances that 65% to Make a Wish also isn't as it first seems?
Calgary,3dy8c1,Cheesewheeler89,-13,Mon Jul 20 15:33:17 2015 UTC,More than 65%.

Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,35,Mon Jul 20 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"Not selling the original, which was presented at the auction, is fraudulent and breaches fundamentals of what an auction actually is.

Calgary,3dy8c1,ohsnapkins,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:42 2015 UTC,Did they offer donation receipts for tax benefits? Might be worthwhile following up with make a wish to confirm they are actually benefitting...
Calgary,3dy8c1,cheddarkitty,8,Mon Jul 20 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"Due to changes with CRA, there are no longer tax receipts for products won from bids.  Something to do with gifts, and you are getting something in return for the donation.  (I had the same question, my pop filled me in)"
Calgary,3dy8c1,mbear11,7,Mon Jul 20 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"Please don't quote me on this, because I can't for the life of me remember how I heard it. I seem to remember hearing that you should be provided a receipt for the difference in value of the gift and what you paid, assuming the difference is more than $20. So if the painting is worth $50, and you paid $250, you should have been given a receipt for $150 in donation."
Calgary,3dy8c1,silvershines,15,Mon Jul 20 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"I had questioned this... Janine at Funding Innovations said that the painting is worth more then what I ""bid"" so I wouldn't get any taxable donation slip...  I wrote Make a Wish in Alberta.  We'll see if they return with any response."

Here is more from the CRA: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/prtng/rcpts/menu-eng.html  @mbear11 - ""these people"" re: my team - are amazing. That's what you should think. We have dedicated our lives to Fundraising and it is not always an easy job, but, CRAZY rewarding. You might want to check out our vimeo or YouTube to see us in action.   @silvershines - Correct. We are not a Charity. Would be amazing if we could issue tax receipts, but, won't happen. See CRA link above to @cheddarkitty  @NorseGod - We have never collected a Tax Receipt and used it corporately in any way. There is really no advantage (that I know of) to doing so and you're right - it's not our money. It's money we collected from supporters like @TheDerwin and thousands of other Canadians who participate in our programs.   @diamondintherimond - You are correct and we have been able to work with our Foundations and our donors to secure a tax receipt when it is an extraordinary gift. (Usually over the fair market value by $500 or more)   @ProfessionalShill - You should reach out to some of the Families of Children I have given to and ask them if they think I am trash.

How is this transparent? It sounds like an outright lie but correct me if I'm wrong."
Calgary,3dy8c1,diamondintherimond,5,Mon Jul 20 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"I think Janine did a great job of explaining it. I won't talk about the exact $$'s in @TheDerwins bid (Just to respect his privacy and charitable contribution) but Janine was right. The Fair Market value of the piece exceeds the bid amount. Plus we don't/can't offer tax receipts anyways. The only time they get issued is when we facilitate an introduction between a bidder willing to make an extraordinary donation, and a foundation.  Important to note that this particular image has been replicated many times and it is immensely popular. It's a very fun piece. Not all are created equal - there are differences between the pieces that our customers receive and the ones available online at discount prices. The biggest difference being the Charitable Component."
Calgary,3dy8c1,bomberman447,4,Mon Jul 20 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Good idea contacting Make a Wish. They are such a great organization, I'm sure they will check into whether or it they are connected to a potential sketchy company.   As for the value of the painting, that sounds questionable. Can they provide proof of how much it is worth?"
Calgary,3dy8c1,djstreet,6,Mon Jul 20 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"I used to work for charities and once ran a silent auction. You should be able to receive a charitable tax receipt if your bid is obviously much greater than the actual value of the item. The difference between the item's value and your bid is how much you could get a receipt for.   Example: bidding $1500 on a pair of hockey tickets worth $300, you could theoretically get a charitable tax receipt for $1200"

Calgary,3dy8c1,Donvm,-8,Mon Jul 20 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"Just from reading their FAQ's they seem a bit sketchy to me. For example:    Do I receive the exact item that is displayed on the easel?  In some instances you may receive an identical copy of the display piece or one in a numbered series of a work. Rest assured that you will receive the exact same piece of art or collectable that you bid on.    Besides the spelling mistake, ""identical copy of the display piece or one in a numbered series of a work"" and ""exact same piece of art or collectable that you bid on"" are totally contradictory statements.   I would be very interested in seeing a copy of their financials."
Calgary,3dy8c1,silvershines,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:36 2015 UTC,@Donvm - Would always welcome any suggestions that might provide clarity. Sorry about the spelling. I have forwarded your catch and we will fix it.
Calgary,3dy8c1,specificbarista,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"It's all good that the spelling error will be fixed, but are you going to clarify the statement as well? Saying that the person will receive the ""exact same piece of art"" and ""identical copy of the display piece"" in the same answer is incorrect at best or disingenuous at worst. They are really not the same thing and the fact that it's such a long answer to what is essentially a yes/no question makes me think that it is intentionally confusing.  As for suggestions that might provide clarity:  1) Most people (as most people here did, including me) assume that charities and companies that work with charities are non-profits. Your site does not seem to mention anywhere that this is not the case. You should, at the very least, mention this in your ""about us"" or FAQ section.  2) Since Funding Innovation is a for-profit company, you have no requirements to make your audited financials available to the public. I personally never donate to any companies that have closed financials, but I think that any company that relies on donations (for-profit or non-profit) should be required to show where the money is going. Would you be open to making audited financials available on your website?  P.S. I'm not surprised by the downvotes, but I think it's good that you are taking the time to reply to everyone."
Calgary,3dy8c1,silvershines,8,Tue Jul 21 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"No one should be downvoting you, you are correct.  Their 'long answer' reminds me of the Humane Society's long answer to ""are you a no kill facility?"" Just answer yes or no."

Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,4,Mon Jul 20 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like everyone gets one as long as they meet the minimum bid. For a transparent company, they sure miss out on a lot of details."
Calgary,3dy8c1,specificbarista,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:14:31 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,6,Mon Jul 20 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"@silvershines @specificbarista - We will keep striving to put more and more content online so it is available for everyone to see.  To specifically answer your questions of ""does everyone win who bids over the minimum?"" - NO.  More to come on the website, but, it is that simple."
Calgary,3dy8c1,specificbarista,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:38:09 2015 UTC,Why would you have multiple copies of the same picture? When something looks like a piece of original art and then what you receive is different and they are obviously mass produced it kind of defeats the purpose and makes people lose trust in the situation. You could get something a lot cheaper at Ikea and just make a donation to the charity.
Calgary,3dy8c1,wachet,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"@specificbarista - No different that a lot of great home stores - if it's trendy/in season/in demand - buyers will commit to more then one and distribute accordingly. Your thinking is correct. You could get something cheaper and just make a donation to charity. What our program does - is marry those two thoughts and complete them in one transaction. It also creates a situation, every day, in a Grocery Store, Restaurant, or in this case (@TheDerwin) in a Bar, where the Charity gets to be front of mind and it creates an opportunity to give (and get)"
Calgary,3dy8c1,adventuresofpipi,7,Tue Jul 21 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"I just can't get over the fact that a person is bidding on picture A and you are giving them picture B, even if it looks very similar it's still not what they bid on."
Calgary,3dy8c1,pseudolobster,10,Tue Jul 21 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"Did they already award out the original painting to someone else? Why wouldn't they be able to provide with, you know, the one you paid for?  I don't like going nuclear with things but I think the Make a Wish foundation would be interested to hear what's happening to your bid."
Calgary,3dy8c1,adventuresofpipi,12,Mon Jul 20 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could reach out to them.  I did get pretty upset.  I feel cheated to be honest.  If it was something mass manufactured like an iPhone, that's expected.  They are all the same.  When it comes to art, it's very personal.  Nowhere did it say I was bidding on a similar piece."
Calgary,3dy8c1,electricsheep12345,10,Mon Jul 20 14:50:20 2015 UTC,Just image goggled ‘frog with glasses painting’ first 13 hits are identical to your recently won ‘painting’. Looks like a giclee print that’s had a few brush strokes added for texture. Seems kinda scammy. Cute image though.
Calgary,3dy8c1,adventuresofpipi,4,Mon Jul 20 15:25:37 2015 UTC,Oh brutal. You can order it from china for as little as thirty bucks for a 3ft one.
Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,7,Mon Jul 20 16:10:10 2015 UTC,I wonder is this came from the infamous Art Factories in Dafen Village in China?
Calgary,3dy8c1,adventuresofpipi,8,Mon Jul 20 16:56:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact same painting in Pier 1 (or similar type store).
Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,-9,Mon Jul 20 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ‘’Fine Art” sold at Costco & Walmart. At least the price tag on those pieces doesn’t make a person think they are buying an original.   Sucks that an organization like Make-a-Wish would allow their name to be tied to this kind of thing. Next they will question donor fatigue.   It’s as ethical as auctioning ‘Handmade Turkish Rugs’ & packages of loose ‘Genuine Thai Gemstones’ for charity."
Calgary,3dy8c1,fishermensballs,8,Mon Jul 20 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"@adventuresohpipi - OUCH. I hope I can provide a little more clarity on what we do throughout this thread. Specifically to your thoughts: Re: ""At least the price tag on those pieces doesn’t make a person think they are buying an original."" - Certainly not our intention. We tend to be inline in price with most retailers selling similar items.  Re: ""Make-a-Wish would allow their name to this kind of thing"" - This program provides undesignated funding that can be used by Make-A-Wish for their most urgent needs, and their costs are zero. We are very reputable, and operate under a contract with specific guidelines."
Calgary,3dy8c1,ConvertsToMetric,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"Walk the talk. If your company states they are ‘militant about transparency’ then make it so. Declare the country of origin; give credit to the creator of the design, state the materials/technique used, production date and the number of copies being sold. Your company is passing these decorations off as art. There is a suggestion of originality. Clearly this is smoke and mirrors for your money making machine, a fraction of which is allegedly donated to charity. Consumers have a right to know what they are buying. Donors have a right to know where their donations are going.  This appears to be nothing more than another version of the Student Painter Scam, redressed as a charity fundraiser.   The OP clearly though that they were participating in a real auction to raise funds for a charity. The OP believed they bidding on an original piece of artwork. The sad truth is that this kind well meaning person was deceived. There was no auction; it was just a shady sales technique to manipulate the consumer. The product received was a cheap mass produced product, not the original artwork it was billed as."
Calgary,3dy8c1,Xoxies,4,Tue Jul 21 00:17:37 2015 UTC,@adventuresohpipi - I agree with your suggestions to increase our levels of transparency for specific pieces and have no issues doing so. Please feel free to read the other posts with various links/testimonials/real world examples of what we have achieved and how we have effected positive change. Always room for improvement I suppose.

Calgary,3dy8c1,Iversia,6,Mon Jul 20 22:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yikes. It is going to a good cause, but it seems like at a starting bid of $200, they should at least tell you that this painting has a truckload of copies."
Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,5,Mon Jul 20 22:37:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like they are buying wholesale China paintings and selling them at these auctions? Scam scam scam... ugh.
Calgary,3dy8c1,Iversia,5,Mon Jul 20 18:07:46 2015 UTC,Your CC will probably reimburse you and revoke the charge. The credit card companies are really good at taking care of their spenders. Then you can give the painting back.  You can even do this on a debit purchase by going to a bank teller.

Calgary,3dy8c1,Pharrow-,6,Mon Jul 20 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"It was a print of an original piece of artwork, that then was embellished/made unique by hand-painted work done on top. How is that not the method popularized by Kinkade?  Anyway, the issue here is that the OP bid on a particular ""version"" of the painting, and did not get the one that they bid on. It's unfortunate, but certainly not far from the truth at all."
Calgary,3dy8c1,djstreet,4,Mon Jul 20 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"All of the silent auctions on ""art work"" you see in stores works in a similar manner. You never get the actual piece you are seeing in the store. In fact, you also don't have to win any auction either. Any bid they receive that is over the minimum will ""win"". They will call you up and send you a print. I bid 5 dollars over min on a piece and noted the print number, which was 5 out of 306. When it arrived it was 295/306. To test things, the next couple times I saw one of these auctions, I again put in a bid 5 dollars over, and every time I would get a call saying I had won."

Calgary,3dy8c1,MSWschnoodle,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:35 2015 UTC,You can buy that painting for $130 at an art store near Ikea (Kivea? sp?).  It's a 'print' from an original. So it's handmade but a copy; no two will be precisely the same.
Calgary,3dy8c1,bookermorgan86,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I would call your CC company then the police.

They do just seem to rotate through the same few pieces... which means the ""painting"" is really just a print with a few brush strokes thrown on. Disappointing.  I would definitely reach out to Make-A-Wish. Funding Innovation is capitalizing on the credit of Make-A-Wish's name and if I was in resource development at Make-A-Wish I would ABSOLUTELY want to know if a company representing my brand was treating my auction winners poorly."
Calgary,3dy8c1,jayheidecker,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"I have heard that the ones for Ducks Unlimited have multiple copies. As long as you put the minimum bit, usually $200, you will get a copy. I have a friend that 'won' one."

Calgary,3dy8c1,TheOregonSnailTrail,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I never knew that charities could hire for-profit companies for fundraising. It makes sense now that I think about it. The comments from the company, though, do seem contrived. I mean they're fundraising-for-hire company. Own it. Don't claim that you take the ethical high ground. If these ""auctions"" were required to have a disclaimer telling bidders that they could get the painting at Walmart for a fraction, and donate more directly to the charity, then Funding Innovation wouldn't exist. I guess what I'm saying is the entire business exists in a gray area that makes consumers uncomfortable; a lack of transparency IS the business model, despite them claiming the opposite. That they are bringing in cash for the charity they (the charity) would otherwise never see, is just a rationalization to behave in a way that can be viewed as ""shady."""

Calgary,3dy8c1,FundingInnovation,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"Hello all. Chris Carter again, speaking on behalf of Funding Innovation. I want to thank all of you for sharing your thoughts and impressions on our Easel Program. Although it’s not been easy for us to read the criticism and accusations, it is really important for us to know how our programs are being perceived and received. You’ve brought a lot to our attention and we will use your input to improve our messages and our communications.  I don’t mind apologising again for the poor experience had by /u/TheDerwin.  We are committed to making it right for him. We have already refunded 100% of the purchase price and the piece is still in their home. Now I’d like to address a few things brought up through the thread.  1) We are indeed a for-profit company. One of the biggest challenges that a charity or humanitarian organisation has is bringing in enough dollars to fund their mission and keep their doors open.  Traditional fundraising isn’t cutting it anymore and charities need help. Funding Innovation is proud of how we are able to support our charitable partners by providing new and fresh ways to raise money. ‘Profit’ is not a dirty word around here. We are a business and we employ 40+ people across Canada.  2) We ensure that our charitable partners always receive 65% of the net proceeds that are generated by our programs. Our charitable AND community partners do not incur any direct expenses, risks or liabilities with Funding Innovation programs. This allows them to apply 100% of the funds we raise to their most urgent needs.  3) Funding Innovation is a business, not a charity so we cannot issue you a charitable tax receipt. It has nothing to do with the value of the product or the amount of your bid and I apologise if this was miscommunicated. We are an organisation that provides innovative fundraising services to charitable and humanitarian organisations. The only time they get issued is when we facilitate an introduction between a bidder willing to make an extraordinary donation, and a foundation.  4) By ‘militant transparency’ we mean that we understand that it can be a confusing world and it can be tough to know whom to trust. Funding Innovation shares our fundraising results live on our website. http://fundinginnovation.ca/results/.  We have given $315,000 to our charitable partners this year already (July 2015) Our goal is to donate $675,000 to charity by the end of the year.  Our goals for 2016 are even bigger.  You can see how much money we have raised to-date for charity and you can see it broken down by our charitable partners.  We offer all of our charitable partners, as well as any that are considering working with us, the opportunity to audit our books and take a close look at our business model. We don’t ask anyone to take our word for it.  5) We can understand your skepticism.  Our claims are indeed bold and our goals are even bolder. We are driven to create GAMECHANGING programs that help our charitable partners fund their heroic missions.  So quite simply, we ask our charitable and humanitarian partners, as well as our community partners, to talk about their experiences with Funding Innovation.  We created the GAMECHANGER Series to capture and share these stories.  We also share both written and video testimonials on our website.  Please take a look.  http://fundinginnovation.ca/testimonial/  6) Is it true that you can search the Internet and get a better deal on a similar piece? It may well be.  The team at Funding Innovation works hard to source beautiful and interesting pieces that we think people will really enjoy.  The difference maker is this case, is that when you purchase a piece through our Easel Program, 65% of the net proceeds from your purchase go directly to the charitable partner. The Easel Program is designed to make giving easier and enjoyable.  Instead of, for example, giving a cash donation, you are able to purchase a piece of art, home decor or a collectable that you like and that will benefit the charity that the purchase supports.  You are always free to buy what you want and to choose where to buy it.  We are truly grateful to the customers who choose to participate in our Easel Program and thus support worthwhile causes.   7) Typically, you will not receive the piece that was displayed on the easel but a copy of the item or one in a numbered series of a work. There may be small variations from piece to piece and prints are sometimes hand-embellished to provide visual texture. Copies may not be identical but they will be very similar to the display copy.  We are taking your feedback and using it to ensure that, moving forward, this is stated very clearly so there will be no further misunderstanding. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. We have already updated our ""FAQ"" section based on your input - http://fundinginnovation.ca/faq/ - with even more to come.   8) In many cases, the art or collectables featured are not original paintings or one-of-a-kinds, but prints or pieces in a numbered series of a work.  We’d love to be able to offer original artwork with a minimum bid of $200 but we haven’t yet found an artist who wants to work at that rate.  Jokes aside, we are currently working to create a special Easel Program that features original work by Canadian artists. The price point will be higher, but you will have the opportunity to own some exciting original artwork.  Consider signing up for our newsletter to stay updated on this and our other exciting endeavours.  http://fundinginnovation.us11.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=1f6aa5aae2252034beb21a105&id=910cf9f104  9) Our marketing team is seriously bummed out that ‘GAMECHANGER’ is getting some flack. At Funding Innovation, we are truly privileged to witness the very best of humanity working tirelessly to make the world a better place for all of us.  Our charitable and humanitarian partners change the game on a daily basis. Our community partners are raising the bar as to what it means to contribute to their communities. We are honoured to serve and support these people and calling them a ‘GAMECHANGER’ is our tribute and a recognition of how they go above-and-beyond. Please consider watching some of the videos on our website that salute these fine organizations and the people that drive them. http://vimeopro.com/fundinginnovation/the-gamechanger-series  I am happy to answer any further questions that you might have. I know it’s easy to throw somebody under the bus at the first inclination or if something goes differently then we expected, but please keep in mind that we are a real group of people doing what we can to serve the organisations and individuals out there that need help making things better for all of us.    Chris"
Calgary,3dy8c1,blastermistress,3,Tue Jul 21 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"Hello Chris / /u/FundingInnovation  It's been an interesting couple of days for you to be sure.  I was upset, and made the post on Reddit to bring attention to what I believed was bad business practice.  I do applaud you for coming to Reddit, and sharing your organization and all the good you do for many different charities.  You are correct in saying that for-profit is not a bad word.  Without you, many charities wouldn't have the same funding.  You bring awareness in a new way.  The entire reason I was upset, is I received a different piece of artwork then the one I bid on.  That in it's entirety was the issue.  Nothing else.  I've tried calling you twice today, no doubt you've been busy.  I do appreciate the fact that you credited my donation back to me.  I hope this serves as a lesson that if you don't change your business practices that it can happen again.  You need to have an organization system in place, so that people get the art they bid on.  I have no doubt in my mind that people will take photos of the art they bid on.  You don't want others having the same experience I have had.  The last thing I would want is to take money away from the Make-A-Wish foundation.  So we have gone ahead and donated the full amount directly to them.  Proof  I hope that in your meeting with Make-A-Wish on the 30th that you take a look at your current system, and adjust it so that your volunteers/staff make sure the pieces of art the bid on is the one they receive.  I do wish you all the success in the world. Sincerely, TheDerwin"

Sorry in advance for any spelling/grammar issues - I wanted to write this myself, right away.   I am here to answer ANY questions about our program and as long as it is appropriate - will gladly respond as openly and as honestly as possible   Fundraising is a tough job and our reputation is EVERYTHING.   Everyone is correct - it is NOT an original piece of art. However, the hand embellishing (acrylic and decoupage) is unique on each (This is why TheDerwin writes: ""The paint doesn't have as much texture, the pieces of fabric/paper added to the canvas had to be glued back down. It's definitely not the same painting, definitely not the same quality"") but they are VERY similar. To some, the one with slightly less embellishment might be the piece they prefer.   No ""scam"" here - we raise over $650,000.00 for amazing organisations like Make-A-Wish and others like Children's Miracle Network, SickKids, and 62 more across Canada.  We have three major funding programs that we now run:   The Art Easel Program Live Events - Sealed bid Art Gallery  Live Events - Specialty programs    We are 40+ people working hard every day to do one thing - Fundraise.   100% of everything we do has a charitable component.   We put together a few short videos to show ""who"" is Funding Innovation?  Funding Innovation Core Story - https://vimeo.com/130879441   Funding Innovation Cheque Presentations - https://vimeo.com/131437611  You may have seen some of our programs on the news and not even know it was ""Funding Innovation"" - We always let our Charities have the spotlight.  Here is some recent footage of an even still running at Canada's Wonderland: http://bit.ly/1IezudB or even more on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FundingInnovation (<--- You can see our biggest live event there in Canada's Wonderland)   We also had the pleasure of launching our first video series!

GAMECHANGER Series: Original Joes: https://vimeo.com/133076903  You can see most of the series by visiting: https://vimeo.com/fundinginnovation/videos  I hope we can make TheDerwin happy - I have already offered 100% of his money back and we can pick it up tomorrow/at their convenience.  On an unrelated matter - does anyone in here want to buy a colourful piece of wall art that features the likeness of a Frog?? Semi-famous on reddit...  Kidding.

Calgary,3e0pxx,00mba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"So pretty much the only reasons to get rid of it are to allow more people than seatbelts in your car, and to drive after having a drink.

If you absolutely cant make that sacrifice then I guess a person is better off to get rid of the GDL, otherwise whats the point?"

Calgary,3e0pxx,00mba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"I think as a responsible driver I wouldn't let more people into my car than the amount of seatbelts I have anyways, that is just foolish."

Calgary,3e0pxx,00mba,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:57:49 2015 UTC,I'd say that's fairly subjective.
Calgary,3e0pxx,belil569,0,Tue Jul 21 03:27:57 2015 UTC,Id say its not subjective when you get pulled over.
Calgary,3e0pxx,00mba,0,Tue Jul 21 03:58:04 2015 UTC,Is it against the law to drive with a GDL license? I dont get it.
Calgary,3e0pxx,belil569,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:22 2015 UTC,Then Ill make it simple for you. GDL has limitations that a full license does not. Most people dont want those limits so they get it done when they can.
Calgary,3e0pxx,larper256,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"Actually the only real restrictions on Alberta GDL is 0 tolerance when it comes to drinking. They don't just ticket you, they take the car and you get a suspension.  And the whole passenger seatbelt thing.   I'd suggest getting your non-GDL when your license comes due. Yes it is 100% a cash grab in this province."
Calgary,3e0pxx,belil569,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:56 2015 UTC,Hmmm suspension vs a ticket whats worse...
Calgary,3e0pxx,00mba,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:06:16 2015 UTC,Just don't drink and drive... It's easy. And it's safer.
Calgary,3e0pxx,larper256,0,Tue Jul 21 05:57:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. But it's not an issue for a lot of people who don't drink.
Calgary,3e0pxx,firebane,-15,Tue Jul 21 12:55:03 2015 UTC,LOL money grab. Go elsewhere please and actually learn to drive.
Calgary,3e0pxx,jclemy,5,Tue Jul 21 13:45:54 2015 UTC,It is a money grab. It really doesn't test anything more and it means once you're done you never have to do it again.
Calgary,3e0pxx,firebane,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"Again no its not. It validates that you are seemed a good driver and then allows you to find good jobs, upgrade your license for other things etc.     Only those who have no need to upgrade their license think the way you do and if you don't need it then don't get it."
Calgary,3e0pxx,jclemy,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:24 2015 UTC,"Having a good job also means finding the time to take another meaningless test is difficult. This also had nothing to do with someone's position in life.  They also charge almost double for the second test.   No one needs to be able to drink, have more demerits or have more people than seatbelts. If they were really looking to qualify people's driving skill they would encourage people to take it. A certain amount of time with no traffic violations would probably suffice as well without the large extra payment."
Calgary,3e0pxx,firebane,-4,Tue Jul 21 11:42:54 2015 UTC,If you have a good job they will let you take the time off to take said test. If you have an employer who won't let you take the time off then they aren't a good good employer now are they.    A full license to any good employer can be an added perk as for example the company I work for won't let anyone drive with a GDL and requires you to have your full license due to insurance. So why would you short yourself a good opportunity or job just because you don't feel a upgrade is worth the money?
Calgary,3e0pxx,echidna_sneeze,5,Tue Jul 21 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"I am confused by the assumption that a driver's license is a benefit to all good employers for all good jobs. I couldn't care less what kind of drivers license my surgeon has, and I assume the hospital feels the same way."
Calgary,3e0pxx,firebane,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"I said ""any"" not ""all"" large difference in the usage. But if you can't understand that then I suppose it could be difficult for you to understand getting a full license."
Calgary,3e0pxx,jclemy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:34 2015 UTC,Not all good jobs even require you to drive. I occasionally need to go to places but even moving up in my field there's really no benefit to not having a GDL license. I could take time off to take the test but I still have to pay the higher fee with no foreseeable benefit to me.  My employer didn't even need to know I had a license.

When someone is being harassed by an old man sending dic pics, one who could easily be sending it to children, maybe trying to hunt down pot heads shouldn't be their priority.

Calgary,3dy2lw,B-rye8888,5,Mon Jul 20 14:53:51 2015 UTC,75 a month for access to any YMCA in the world. I feel great supporting a local organization that uses my $75 to give back to the community.

Calgary,3dy2lw,Bonspiel13,8,Mon Jul 20 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone is recommend specific gyms, but you should pick one near where you live or your workplace. You're more likely to use it then."
Calgary,3dy2lw,cwmshy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:13 2015 UTC,"I go to Anytime Fitness on 1 st SW, and it does what you need.  about 50-55$/mo, though, although it has towel service and private change/shower rooms which is nice.  Free parking as well in hotel arts parkade, if you validate your ticket on your way out.  Being 24h, it is also nice for off hours sessions.  I go usually between 6-830am, and I never have trouble getting the equipment I need, but I can't speak for any other time of day.  I imagine 11-1 is crazy, as is 430-630, but I can't say for sure if/when it slows down."

Calgary,3dy2lw,asad16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"WCP doesn't sound bad. I could just walk there, get my heart rate up, elliptical, weights and then C-Train back."

Calgary,3dy2lw,cancon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:08 2015 UTC,Not sure about non-tenants. I am a tenant and am paying $62/month plus the $10/month squash fee and we get the enrolment fee waived.

Calgary,3dy2lw,Matticusmaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:54 2015 UTC,Athletes and non-athletes.  Not much in the way of seniors or families. The front desk will give you a quick tour if you are interested.
Calgary,3dy2lw,firebane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:10 2015 UTC,No gym will give you any information via email or over the phone as it is honestly a massive sales pitch to get you in.    Also the time you go plays a massive role. For example World Health Bay @ 5-6pm is an absolute gong show and you get nothing done.
Calgary,3dy2lw,LilDrunkenSmurf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"If I had to take a guess, I would say the 24/7 one is Anytime Fitness? If so, it's ~$55/month. I signed up for a NW location, but can drop into the downtown one if I like."

Stephen Ave and Eau Claire are good options downtown (although Stephen Ave's free weight area is way too cramped)."
Calgary,3dy2lw,Cheesewheeler89,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:23 2015 UTC,I registered at Probodies in Marda Loop about 3 yrs ago. I paid 199 reg. fee and it's been $40 a month since then.  I also do Crossfit 3x per week as something different than strict weight training.
Calgary,3dy2lw,Esoteric88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"Goodlife is where I went to - they've got a couple downtown locations, but I go to their one on 17th Ave. Never had a problem getting equipment (I work out around 9 PM on weekdays and whenever on weekends). It's 24 hours, and I think it comes to $48/month (without towel service)."
Calgary,3dy2lw,Iron_Apostle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"I go to Goodlife.  Three gyms downtown, including a brand new one on 17th.  Can be pretty busy during the prime hours but the staff has been friendly so far.  Goodlife also has some kind of 1 gym deal thats cheaper but doesnt allow you to go to the other ones.  Im usually there around 9pm as well.  You'll know because I look in the mirror too much and im always stretching out all of my nagging injuries =)."
Calgary,3dy2lw,frozenhell,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"I've been going to Talisman for years and I love it.  It may not be for you if you just want to do elliptical and weights, I go there because I like the variety of options.  Sometimes I hit the pool, the fitness centre or when I can round up a partner badminton.  I tend to get bored doing the same things too often.  $70/month"
Calgary,3dy2lw,aint_frontin_whi_chu,12,Mon Jul 20 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"If I was you I would buy some weights for your home. It will pay for itself in 2-3 months, and you're more likely to lift at home rather than having to go to a gym.  If you're looking for an elliptical, just take-up jogging or roller-blading while the weather's nice. Wait until October to get locked-in to a gym membership."
Calgary,3dy2lw,bodyforlifebill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"If I was you I would buy some weights for your home. It will pay for itself in 2-3 months, and you're more likely to lift at home rather than having to go to a gym.   Every bit of research on people's exercise habits claim the opposite of what you just said."
Calgary,3dy2lw,Elfer,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the individual. Anecdotally, I was much more likely to work out with my crappy weights at home than I ever was going to a gym, but that's just me.  These days though, I find sports way more engaging and motivating than working out at a typical gym. If I can pack in recreation and exercise at the same time, I get waaaay more exercise."
Calgary,3dy2lw,aint_frontin_whi_chu,5,Mon Jul 20 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"How? We don't need to go to a special place to lift weights. Habits can be made at home as well as anywhere else. If anything, having the weights sitting right there in front of you is going to get you active, more than having to travel across town (in the snow, 6 months of the year)."
Calgary,3dy2lw,NateStark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"Psychologically you're more inclined to take advantage of something that you're paying for, or else you will be out the money. Further, when you're around other people doing the same thing, it makes you want to keep going and to push yourself. At home alone you don't have that. And I believe OP is asking about downtown gyms because he either lives or works there, I don't think he'll be travelling across town."
Calgary,3dy2lw,aint_frontin_whi_chu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"I suggested he pay for the weights. What's the difference? I know plenty of people who buy a membership but don't go enough to justify it. Yes, paying for something makes it more valuable to you, but there are stronger motivations that eclipse that one in this case.  I agree, that being surrounded by people doing the same thing makes you want to do that thing, but the point is he would still need to get to the gym to be surrounded by those people. Personally, seeing someone on TV or at work/the mall is enough to get me to pick-up the weights at home. I don't need to see someone actually lift the weights to make me want to lift.  Even if the gym is a few blocks away, the effort of going out in the cold is more than enough discouragement. Having the weights in the house removes that barrier."
Calgary,3dy2lw,bodyforlifebill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:44 2015 UTC,"There are many reasons. There is just something about going to a physical gym, somewhere else that makes people more likely to work out. The most successful people who work out at home, usually started at a gym, got in the habit, and then bought equipment. There are exceptions to the rule of course, but this is just what most surveys have shown. Most home exercise equipment ends up being used to hang laundry.   Until recently I was thinking of picking up a squat rack, Glute Ham Raise bench, and some weights for my basement. But, with a little baby and wife at home, I doubt I would ever be able to workout in peace. It looks like I'm keeping my gym membership for the next few years."

And if you've been in your location longer than a year and this is the first time you've noticed the machines this late, theres a good chance you've slept through previous attempts and your sleeplessness is affected by other factors.

Calgary,3dzkr0,notdedicated,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:31 2015 UTC,I don't have access to the tools needed to do it but from my time in a tool shop this will be very difficult to do the set up alone could take an hour but then the cutting I would be afraid that when I put the tool into the metal it will grab and totally distort the piece

Calgary,3dzkr0,firebane,0,Tue Jul 21 04:21:04 2015 UTC,Looks like a really small piece of tubing. Go pick up a tubing cutter for $5 and do it yourself. Really easy and quick.
Calgary,3dzkr0,Skaffer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:51 2015 UTC,Did you even read his name? Let the man have his request
Calgary,3dzkr0,Musclecity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Tubing? What part are you referring to?  The shade itself is 15"" high by 14"" wide made out of a light metal of some kind. I certainly don't have the tools nor the experience to make this cut all the way around the base to make the thing say 11"" high instead of the original 15"". I'm hoping for someone with the appropriate thing to secure it in place and spin it (like a lathe) and then have the cutter held against the shade to make the smooth, perfect cut."
Calgary,3dzkr0,yyc_mongrel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:49 2015 UTC,Yes you could do it in a lathe with a part off tool.. pretty easy. How ever gripping it in the jaws and the set up would be the tricky part.
Calgary,3dzkr0,silentjay1977,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"I was hoping it could be gripped through the top hole where the light passes through once completely dismantling the piece. The metal is definitely soft, the grip wouldn't need to be too firm nor would the spin need to be too fast. I'm just looking for someone with the appropriate tools to actually do it that I can commission."
Calgary,3dzkr0,Musclecity,4,Mon Jul 20 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"As /u/Musclecity noted, a lathe is the right tool for this job.  You might be able to interest some machining students at SAIT into taking it on for you.  Otherwise, you're looking at going to a place like Cactus Machine Ltd."
Calgary,3dzkr0,firebane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:45 2015 UTC,I think it would be much faster and less labor intensive to scribe a line at the height that you want the shade to be cut and then cut with a cut off tool and grinder to bring it to the line. At this point it would require a repaint but it would be safer as far as the cutting without distorting.

Calgary,3dvlxk,kaidon,3,Mon Jul 20 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"There was an episode of Marketplace about this.  Consumers react much more adversely to increases in price than to decreases in size, so the packaging of many products is being ""flattened"".

Calgary,3dwthg,ColinTheBeerGuy,4,Tue Jul 21 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Crandell Lake campground is managed by Parks Canada and is inside the National Park. It is a 10 min, incredible drive from the townsite. The sites are spacious and you're almost guaranteed to see mule deer and black bears. You can tent here (2 tents max). They also just started a program where you can rent tipis which look awesome!  There is also the townsite campsite which is right in town. There are some tenting spots but it's mostly RVs, there are little to no trees on the site and is not very ""nature-filled"". However plus sides of this campground are that it is located right on the lake, and is two blocks from the bars and restaurants. Some of these bars get hopping every night of the week during the summer with townies and tourists, mostly American.  Tl;Dr Crandell Lake for nature, Townsite for partying."
Calgary,3dwthg,ShredLox,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"+1 for Crandell. Beautiful well-treed sites, lots of closeby hikes, and an amphitheatre where they do neat nature edutainment programs. Firewood included with a burn permit. Can't beat it.  If you have pets, be wary of the deer around the townsite. They're not afraid of people and can be quite aggressive towards other 4-legged life."
Calgary,3dwthg,jclemy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:31 2015 UTC,Crandall sucks for booking the teepees though. We called and they said they were available.

There's lots of other swim spots and rentals of boats and stuff on the lake in town. Saw quite a few bears around but never too close to our campsite. The one hike I'd definitely recommend is one right behind the info centre, basically goes straight up to look over the town.  It's pretty family oriented it looked like to me."

Keep in mind that all campgrounds have quiet hours after 10pm so please don't be one of the people I despise :)  Honestly though, if you want a no-rules camping experience, head to a PLUZ, there are some great wilderness areas west of Rocky Mountain House where you can do pretty much whatever you want."

The owner and his wife are super nice, passionate about Waterton, and really helpful/ knowledgeable.  It is definitely catered more to RV camping than tenters. However they've got some decent campsites that are surrounded by bush and accessed by path.

Calgary,3dsnny,wain123,11,Sun Jul 19 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"I was in community dvlpt and planning and Stellergt's response is correct. Much of south Calgary is comprised of communities built upon wetlands (marsh lands) and therefore the increased numbers of lakes from diverted storm water. On the http://www.mahoganyliving.com it clearly states ""wetlands"". North Calgary is at a higher elevation. Foundational cracks and shifts can occur in any home but usually occur at higher rates in the south. Here's a topographical map of Calgary http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/files/calgary.pdf You can access this information and other topographical maps through the City of Calgary as well."
Calgary,3dsnny,Ajk_81,7,Sun Jul 19 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, Lake Bonavista was the first, and a lake was made because it was developed on bald prairie, which didn't make a pretty community. I guess that this would be the primary reason for other SE communities having lakes."
Calgary,3dsnny,bodyforlifebill,0,Sun Jul 19 03:22:17 2015 UTC,"Sometime in the last year CBC morning show interviewed the guy who ran the lake project. Sorry, no names or dates on when."
Calgary,3dsnny,Aplicado,26,Sun Jul 19 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"This is due to geography topography (thanks Jonnybeanbag) . The southeast is relatively flat. During very heavy rainfall, to prevent flooding and ponding in these communities, storm water is diverted into the lakes for storage. The northwest is quite hilly, flooding and ponding in these communities is less likely to occur. In addition, developers can use the lands to build more houses instead of having to build a lake."
Calgary,3dsnny,stellergt,4,Sun Jul 19 02:56:10 2015 UTC,Do you mean topography?
Calgary,3dsnny,JonnyBeanBag,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"It isn't because of rainfall. The neighbourhoods are flat, but the lakes were built to make them desirable to live in."
Calgary,3dsnny,bodyforlifebill,-21,Sun Jul 19 03:36:33 2015 UTC,Who told you this? That is not true.
Calgary,3dsnny,silvershines,21,Sun Jul 19 03:09:11 2015 UTC,"I work in civil engineering, with a focus on municipal land development."

Calgary,3dsnny,Aplicado,-20,Sun Jul 19 18:13:36 2015 UTC,Where is the lake in McKenzie Towne? Copperfield? Somerset?
Calgary,3dsnny,silvershines,20,Sun Jul 19 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"You're correct. There are no lakes in these communities, but there are many wet ponds. These wet ponds function in the same way as the man made lakes. They collect storm water under heavy rainfall events and slowly releases water into the bow river as to not overload it all at once. I did neglect to mention in my earlier post, the advantage to having a lake instead of storm ponds is make your subdivision more appealing and more desirable to live in."
Calgary,3dsnny,stellergt,-22,Sun Jul 19 04:54:23 2015 UTC,And that's what I was getting at. Lakes are there to make the community desirable and differentiate it from others. It is the more expensive route for developers to go to deal with excess water as compared to just doing storm ponds and that is why people pay a premium in their lot price to live in those areas.

Calgary,3dqkuf,yyc_333,7,Sat Jul 18 21:04:51 2015 UTC,Or even just reply back with a new price. Sometimes people just suck at negotiating

Calgary,3dqkuf,U_R_Shazbot,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"Out of courtesy to the seller, don't negotiate on price until you show up for the item. This drives me crazy when the buyer hasn't left the couch and already wants 50% off. Cash in hand is king."

Carry what you want to pay in one pocket or wallet, and the remainder in another pocket. I will not barter over the phone/text/email. I listed my price and you haven't bother to inspect anything before trying to knock the price down.

Calgary,3dqkuf,Executive_Slave,2,Sun Jul 19 05:44:06 2015 UTC,I did this.  Was looking for a long time and nothing.  Being really patient.   Then I expanded the search. 50k.  Then 400k.  Calculated the gas it would take and sleeping arrangements.   Finally found item cheap as fuck. The trip turned into a mini adventure.
Calgary,3dqkuf,arcelohim,-8,Sun Jul 19 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"If they want to reserve the item, they can email me a down payment. Otherwise I couldn't care less"
Calgary,3dqkuf,ajau_1,9,Sat Jul 18 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"Down payment? Yeah and how easy is it to flake out on that and just keep the money. What a scam.  I only do business with people that keep their word and have some sort of integrity.   I do my part by not low balling, setting an appropriate schedule for the transaction. Canceling as soon as possible if something comes up(never done that).  I have had zero problems on Kijiji because I choose to deal with people that will accommodate both parties mutually. It's just good business."
Calgary,3dqkuf,arcelohim,-10,Sat Jul 18 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"I was being facetious about the down payment. I don't hold anything for anyone. I respect people who bargain, not afraid of it like too many Canadians, but I can't stand low ballers fishing for a sucker."
Calgary,3dqkuf,ajau_1,5,Sat Jul 18 18:02:33 2015 UTC,Guess we're not doing business together. We just have a different approach to this.

I really just wanted to get rid of it. Well It was either they didn't respond back, or ""can you deliver"", or ""can you rent a uhaul or truck and deliver?"", or ""what are you selling again?"".

People flake on me all the time so when I am selling I tell people whoever shows up first gets it. And you work around my schedule!

Calgary,3dqkuf,electricsheep12345,15,Sat Jul 18 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe that works in Calgary.  I was trying to buy a tractor about an hour north of town.  I had been exchanging details with him a couple of days and he told me he was working all week so the only day he could meet was Sunday morning. I told him I'd leave home at 8AM on Sunday morning and be there about 9.  Sunday morning, I told him ""I'm getting in the car and I'm on my way.  I'll pay you full price if it can start and drive."" and he says ""A fellow from edmonton called me this morning. He wants it and is on his way""  He wouldn't tell me if he knew when the guy from edmonton had left or was anticipated... So I drove up and beat the guy from Edmonton who had driven two hours to get it.  After the tractor was loaded up, I pulled away and passed a truck with a trailer; clearly the guy from Edmonton... I bet he was pissed.  I think the seller could have been a bit less of a dick."

Calgary,3dqkuf,Mighty_Ack,5,Tue Jul 21 16:57:31 2015 UTC,I bought some furniture off kijiji when we first moved to town. The people were moving and had a dining set and couch. I offered the full price plus $50 if they were able to deliver it. They were willing. If people don't offer extra for delivery they are delusional.
Calgary,3dqkuf,specificbarista,3,Sat Jul 18 15:48:14 2015 UTC,50 isn't really that much for delivery in this town with dealing with getting the furniture out side your place and into your vehicle and than dealing with traffic to and from the drop off location.
Calgary,3dqkuf,alpain,4,Sat Jul 18 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"It's fine if it's in a nearby community. Otherwise I'd just pay some guy with a truck $50 to do it. The issue is a lot of people want a free item dropped off, or offer asking but want it delivered. Even pizza places charge for delivery."

When I said that was unreasonable and I was just looking for a range to know if it was worth my time, he flew off the handles and sent me an all caps rage email telling me how dumb I was for not knowing what it was worth, calling me a low baller, and just generally venting all of his Kijiji frustrations on me.  Not cool."
Calgary,3dqkuf,smurdoch,10,Sat Jul 18 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of flakes.  I usually price my items at a good price, a little less than any comparables. I never accept lower offers, since those people are often the flakes. I hold out for my listed price, and re-list entirely at a lower price if that's what I want to do, until I get someone who's willing to pick up for my listed price.   Most of the time, the taker doesn't ask questions or haggle the price. I usually include all the basic detail copied and pasted from internet sites about the item, and then ignore any questions.  I have never succeeded with someone after agreeing to hold the item.  Sometimes the person says they will come at a certain time to ""look at"" the item. I usually clarify ""are you looking at it or buying it?"". I never get a response then."
Calgary,3dqkuf,cwmshy,7,Sat Jul 18 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"Lol, dude, you clearly haven't sold much on Kijiji in Alberta, bc, or Ontario, it's the same everywhere."

Calgary,3dqkuf,assholing,5,Sun Jul 19 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"I find giving things away for free is particularly bad.  People respond to free things they don't really want because they're getting it for nothing, so then they flake out when they have to pick it up.  I find putting something up for $5 or $10 helps a little to weed out some of the flaky people."
Calgary,3dqkuf,markusbrainus,2,Sun Jul 19 02:21:28 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my strategy - when I put things up for free I get 20-50 time wasters before somebody MIGHT finally come through.  Usually this takes 2-3 days of putting up with annoying people.  After a lot of frustration with this I just started listing everything I wanted to give away for free between $1 and $10, so the people scouring the free listings don't see it.  Usually it takes a couple days before I get a response but whoever responds and actually comes to pick it up I just let them have it for free."
Calgary,3dqkuf,zero10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:19 2015 UTC,Very true. Happens all the time on the free stuff facebook groups too. People who are getting something for free have no appreciation of others or their time.
Calgary,3dqkuf,silvershines,3,Sun Jul 19 06:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'm down to just using Kijiji for getting rid of free items, as those are the only reliable pickups now a days. I now exclusively use Facebook Buy&Sell or auction sites; lots of rules to follow, but people that are serial flakers get removed from the group pretty quick.  Take a moment to search for some groups within your quadrant. I think you will be a lot happier with the experience."
Calgary,3dqkuf,theBoxy_Butcher,7,Sat Jul 18 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"I've found for me that getting rid of free items is actually a lot harder, people constantly don't show up. But if I list the item at a low price, I only get people that are interested in the item, not just people who want free goods. Then when they do show up, it's a pleasant surprise when I tell them to keep their money."

Calgary,3dqkuf,Kintarly,3,Sun Jul 19 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"A couple of months ago I sold a stove as well as the washer and dryer.  I basically had about 3 weeks to a month of people making appointments every few days and nobody showing up. I was making plans to take the washer and dryer to the scrapers when a guy said he'd be over immediately. And he was!  and that was nothing compared to the stove. electric stove I was asking $50. The first guy wanted me to deliver it to an apartment for that price and take his old one to the dump. So I dropped the price to $30 and had the real crazies come out. One guy wanted to drag it back into my house to test if it works, no you're not coming in and there's a gas range in the way now. If you pay $30 for a stove you don't get a warranty.   I wound up selling it to a guy who looked to be about 80 and who showed up completely unannounced. Apparently I had accidentally published my address in the ad (oopA!). He offered me $10 for the stove. I said for that price I wouldn't help him put it in his truck. But I did."

If it's less than I'm willing to take but a serious offer I'll come back with a counter offer.   I recently seen a watch that was on the last page of the search I had done. The ad was up for like a month and the guy had the watch on for $900. I offered $700 and said I would drive the 2 hours to pick it up that night. He come back just ranting about me lowballing and must have been blowing his top based on his reply. $700 wasn't my final offer but a stating point for negotiations however the deal was off based on his reply.

Calgary,3dqkuf,kingshnez,5,Sat Jul 18 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"I have had very little experience on the site, but have a couple of cautionary tales.  Both about people selling motorbikes, one a crotch rocket, and the other a harley.    First guy was my friend Duane, selling his rocket, and had advertised it on kijiji.  Some guy came over, and asked if he could take it for a spin, would leave his truck there and his keys with Duane. D said sure, the guy took off, and at the 4 hour mark, Duane called me, and said what should I do.    I jokingly said ""Go bang donuts in his truck for a couple of hours""   D ""really, you think?""  Me ""no call the cops, the guy either laid your bike down, and is either hurt, scared to come back, or you got scammed""  D ""how could he scam me, he left his truck and keys?""  M ""He left A truck and some keys... go check, right now, then call the cops""  Sure enough, he left some keys, for a stolen truck, that had a screwdriver rigged ignition...  2 nd tale, from a customer that was selling his hog.  Had it advertised on Kij and CL.  Kept getting calls, people wanting to come see it, or know where they could look at it.  Had a few people come by, but he was asking way to much for it.  He was also getting lots of calls that when they would answer, would be hang ups.  He told us about it one day, and I warned him to chain the bike down to something, that is when he moved it into their living room.  Literally drove it up a ramp through his front door, and parked it in the middle of his and his gf's LR.  Calls kept coming with a few tire kickers and so did the hang ups.  One day he comes home to find his front door kicked in, no bike and burn out marks on their hard wood floor.  The guy was pissed, but the burn out marks on the hardwood comment made me laugh (sorry).  As a side note, the same guy with the hog, also lost his truck in a lake while 4x4ing on the ice, broke through and sunk.  Then he reported it, and Fish and Wildlife, or AB Environment or whoever, made him hire a helicopter and divers to pull it out in the spring.  Cost him an additional $20K."

I kindly said to her that I was expecting something in a closer timeframe. She gets back to me a little while later saying that we could make the transaction in the next couple of days. Then shortly there after said she'd be available that day around 4pm or so. We finally ended up making the transaction that day, and was quick and painless. Another occasion I wanted to purchase a Xbox from someone, and they never got back to me until a couple of days later. They said they'd be able to meet some time in the coming weekend.

I've sold lots of things on kijiji and received many low ball offers. I've never understood the anger. How difficult is it to ignore an email?  In the olden days you paid $50 per week to list your car in the auto trader. You priced it competitively because you wanted to sell within that week to avoid additional cost. Nowadays I suspect 90% of vehicles are not even really for sale on kijiji, because the price of advertising is only your time to rewrite the ad. Those (high ballers?) sellers are trolling for a sucker.    So a new car seller lists for what they think is a reasonable price based on what others are asking, and get offended when offered a price it's actually worth. Which in my sellers experience is take the lowest comparable vehicle, and knock 20% - 30% off."

Nothing annoys me more then the 'can you post pictures?' when there are actual pictures in the ad or 'what are the specs?' and they are also in the ad.

Show them the car and they want to drive it, i say fine it has a knock as I said by email and phone. I said just take it down the road but no further, 15mins later they come back, cant hear the knock.  I say OK but it does have one. They waste 1.5 hrs of my time and say they will go for a bit to eat and be in touch.

Calgary,3dqkuf,EnglishBuck,2,Sat Jul 18 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"What great negotiating skills you have. You must get the best deals.   '7000 Obo'  Oh fuck, I'm gonna get him so good.   '6800!!!!'  Uhhh, ok? Deal.   Also, I thought you would have accepted 1500$. And he offered 1300$. Your English isn't great but at least you're trying. Way to give 110% man."

Calgary,3dqkuf,EnglishBuck,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"What is hilarious, therealAce, is that you can't math. He let him walk for $400, not $200, which is almost 25% of his firm price. And offering $200 less on a $7000 purchase is a discount of about 3%. Pretty big difference. You must live with rich parents in Britannia and have no concept of money."
Calgary,3dqkuf,silvershines,7,Sat Jul 18 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, if you damn kijiji people would slow down and do business properly you could get top dollar for your shit. Hold items, take bids. What's the matter, don't you people like money?  Having a really tough time with kijiji right now myself. Wife and I decided to buy a travel trailer. Went out and got my truck all rigged out for it then went and tried to do some kijiji shopping.  It's been months, we've seen a few trailers but more often than not, we find out the trailer we want to see has been sold. Usually right before we leave to go look at it, sometimes we don't find out until we arrive to see it. People just show up, cash in hand and buy these things on the spot.  It's fucking ridiculous. Most trailers get sold within a couple days of being posted. So unless we're willing to ""leap before we look"" and be ready to buy the damn thing on the spot, we're not going to be buying one any time soon. Problem is, we're not like that. We're careful with our money. We'd like to be able to take 12 hours and sleep on a decision. So far that hasn't been remotely possible.  We'd be willing to negotiate with these people and even make a higher offer if we like what we see, but people just don't give a shit. People are so damn eager to sell.   Looks like we'll be waiting for winter for this market to cool the fuck down. No trailer this year.  Edit - some words"

I had no idea it was happening.  My friend didn't want to pay more than the item was listed for, and she expected to keep the change, and well like I said she decided ""sure I'll round down to the next 20"", and then she sent me a nasty email saying it was deliberate and this and that.. but we never forced her to take it for less, and well she didn't have change either, and I wasn't even there, so what the hell could I do?  I think she wanted me to drive across the city to pay her the difference, which worked out to something like 5 dollars or less.  She lived in the DEEP NE, I live in the SW.  I might have even done that, but she was such a nasty bitch in the email I told her to go fuck herself and to grow up and learn to stand by the decisions you make.  Wat a twat."

I really hope you find your firearms. Did CPS give you a hard time or were they understanding of the situation?  This is so unfortunate. Losing firearms is something I WOULD NOT want to do if I had any. Plus my whole sense of security in my own home would shatter.

Calgary,3dppr6,billybookcase,7,Sun Jul 19 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, around noon when most people are at work or in school is prime time for residential B&Es.  Most are a crime of opportunity, however some professionals will case neighborhoods in the morning and take note of who goes to work. But its rare for a professional to go after guns, more heat involved and hard to fence.  Also the burglar likely didn't care about the persons schedule, most don't, professional or amateur, most will not spend more than 10 minutes inside the home unless they are targeting a safe or other large items (Appliances, TVs, etc).  If you really want to protect your house and your precious items. Simply make it take to much time to get at them, bars on windows and a reinforced door (and frame) with a decent lock (that is actually used) will defeat almost all but the most determined.  To take it a step further, get a home alarm, they are more of a passive tactic but they do put a lot of pressure on a burglar, if forced entry cannot be achieved almost immediately its too risky. Yes for those of you with alarms and a door or window that could be easily forced open or broken then your alarm is worthless and all professionals know this.  And on the extreme side, real multi-hundred pound safes are the gold standard, but seeing as most people don't have a grand plus to purchase such a beast a simple safe as long as it can be affixed securely to your foundation and when especially used in tandem with an alarm system will take too much time to remove or open."

I get these are sentimental, but if they just didn't exist, people just couldn't use them for crimes.

This is a really expensive place to live. That's why I always shake my head when Vancouverites move here because 'Vancouver is so expensive'."
Calgary,3drfw6,ajau_1,2,Sun Jul 19 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"And it can't be explained by taxation either.  Taxes are higher in London and NYC than here in general, and liquor taxes might be higher here, but not by much.  Labour costs are similar as well and rent is higher there.   Why is it so damn expensive here?"
Calgary,3drfw6,unjung,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:57:24 2015 UTC,"I suspect the same reason everything else is more expensive here... smaller market means higher add-on costs per unit.

Calgary,3drfw6,NorseGod,5,Sun Jul 19 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've been to several of those bars and I've had yet to be served even a basic cocktail like a Manhattan better than what I can make at home. Completely subjective opinion, but that's my experience. I've been working on my cooking skills for at least 15 years and I'm wonderfully surprised by the quality of food at so many restaurants at town. I got into ""fine cocktails"" a few years ago and have yet to be wowed anywhere."
Calgary,3drfw6,drays,5,Sun Jul 19 01:33:59 2015 UTC,"I should hope so. Making a great cocktail at home is about the easiest thing on earth. The ingredients are absolutely predictable (with the exception of how sour your juices might be) and you can tailor your drink precisely to your taste. Within a couple weeks I was able to easily turn out drinks as well as anyone in town.  But people don't go to a cocktail bar for a just a cocktail. They go for a social experience, an ambiance, and each of those bars is a great place to have that experience.  The comparison to cooking is not apt. Two people following the same recipe with identical ingredients will make dishes of radically different quality because cooking is an incredibly complex set of operations in which small changes in temperature, technique and preparation have massive effects on the outcome. The more experienced of our two cooks will invariably produce a better outcome because he has had more time to learn all those nuances. Once you learn how to do a proper shake, and how hard to wield a muddler, the rest of bartending is about speed and consistency. The technique and the recipes are the same whether an amateur or a pro is doing them, it's just that an amateur can't run a tape of thirty drinks in 10 minutes."
Calgary,3drfw6,NorseGod,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"But people don't go to a cocktail bar for a just a cocktail. They go for a social experience, an ambiance, and each of those bars is a great place to have that experience.   Ahhh, that's part of why I hate cocktail bars.

Calgary,3drfw6,drays,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"And that's very fair. For me, I prefer to go to a good bar because at least I will get a cocktail that's drinkable... But I agree that it's nt going to be as good as the ones I can make at home for a third of the cost.  Actually we often throw cocktail parties for that reason. Everyone brings the fixings for one drink for a dozen people, and we make drinks for each other all night.  It helps to make sure nobody drives home after those."
Calgary,3drfw6,unjung,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt you can make a good Manhattan, if you put any time at all into it. I have a friend who makes his own bitters and syrups, and we make knockout cocktails at his place all the time. However, I don't think amateurs like us have put the time in to be able to invent our own drinks, or freestyle based on a single ingredient. I'd say that's the difference with the guys and girls at Proof, MT, etc."
Calgary,3drfw6,NorseGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I've been developing my cooking skills as an amateur for 15 years, that basis in understanding flavor is a big help. I make my own syrups, and have been doing my own bitters since Silk Road started carrying botanicals. And then /r/cocktails had brought me fat more interesting, unique drinks than anyone local.  Like I said, if I can're find a place locally that makes basic drinks as good as I can at home then why should I trust them to get experimental? Someone else said the point of those bars are the ambiance and social experience. I can totally see that, it's just not something that draws me."
Calgary,3drfw6,unjung,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Okay. As you said, subjective opinion. Most posters here can't do what you can do and therefore must go to a bar to get a good cocktail. The places I listed are a shit ton better than anything we had prior to the arrival of Milk Tiger (there was that place around 17th and 7th which is now a Thai restaurant - they had good cocktails but were ahead of their time)."
Calgary,3drfw6,NorseGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:28 2015 UTC,I know my opinion is a lot harsher on bars than most.
Calgary,3drfw6,rawmeatdisco,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:55 2015 UTC,You can get well made cocktails in Calgary and there are some very good bartenders here but I find that consistency is often lacking. Bars will hire people who have no interest in cocktails. Training will often be substandard as well. It has become common place for restaurants and bars to bring in a consultant to design a cocktail menu and then completely skip training of any sort.
Calgary,3drfw6,NorseGod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see that. I'm not one to jump into a popular place after the grand opening. So we likely get the B-team at the bar who hadn't been trained at all. My wife went to a ""cocktail training"" course one time, when she was in university. It was for ""experienced bar tenders"" to better their skills. She left after the second class, astounded at the ignorance of the other students. ""What's vermouth?"" was asked and most of the class thought that was a good question."

Calgary,3dpem1,NBeezer,5,Sat Jul 18 04:35:10 2015 UTC,"I heard a stat for the Calgary oil and gas job market... 80% of positions are placed through networking while 20% are placed through applying online and hoping you get picked. That means... A typical week of searching for work means four days of networking (taking people for coffee, networking events, etc,) and one day of searching for and applying online. That is probably close to reality. Its only a guess but I bet my resume has only been seen by a hiring manager for 1% of the jobs I've applied to. Trying to beat the automated resume search system they use (the big companies anyways) is tough to do. I'm an engineer not hr so take with a grain of salt but I've done a lot of reading into this. No one wants to hear it but networking is the best option. My last two jobs in Calgary have been through personal contacts. Meeting that hiring manager while circumventing hr by any means will get you places. That resume search system and the hr person reading your resume try and match the exact job description with resume because neither knows better so keep that in mind in cover letters and resumes."
Calgary,3dpem1,boredinthegreatwhite,3,Sat Jul 18 13:29:01 2015 UTC,Yes. My mother has worked in 3 oil companies in Calgary since we moved here in 2001. She never had to look for jobs since her friends in said companies would recommend her for a position.
Calgary,3dpem1,Le_Reddit_Elder,9,Sat Jul 18 07:08:53 2015 UTC,"You couldn't have picked a worse time to move here, unfortunately.  This drop in oil price looks like it's going to sustain through to next year, and as a result, there is a flood of resumes on the job market.  It depends what kind of work you're looking for, though.  Stuff like labor and trades jobs are always in high demand, so if you're hurting for cash and want to get some exposure to another line of work, I would suggest picking up some of that kind of work.  Other than that, if you're a geologist, engineer, accountant, or IT person, you're probably be going to be searching for awhile.  Networking is also huge, as mentioned before.  Most people get hired by who they know.  LinkedIn helps, but you'll want to actually meet some contacts in the business and build up a repertoire with them."

Calgary,3dpem1,EFFENEH,9,Sat Jul 18 07:16:55 2015 UTC,"I've been taught otherwise. People say you should at least be volunteering while you're unemployed because it shows employers that you're:   Still professionally productive and active even during downturns Engaged with giving back to the community Volunteer coordinators are excellent professional references   Plus, you learn a lot about yourself while you're volunteering. Also, for most cases, volunteering positions are often not the same as your actual professional duties unless you're like an Event Planner or something.  Also consider this - how will you answer if employers ask you what you've been doing during periods of unemployment?"

Calgary,3dpem1,StraightTalkExpress,4,Sat Jul 18 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on your sector; oil and gas is obviously hurting, but personally, as a teacher, Alberta (and Calgary) are great for my career. Lots of young families can afford to live in Calgary - at least compared to Vancouver, where I've come from. This means a constant (and increasing) need for teachers and schools. I was recently hired by the Calgary School Board as an on-call teacher; there's not a lot of money in it (very little, actually), but it's the doorway to a full-time position that will pay infinitely better than what B.C. pays FT teachers. I spent four years 'subbing' in BC, and all the province does is cut the education budget, leaving students under-supported, and newer/younger teachers like myself without jobs. Even the Conservatives in Alberta funded education better than B.C. does!  My wife's a personal trainer; Calgary is a very health/fitness-conscious place, and with the generally higher average salaries that Alberta sees when compared to other provinces, she similarly earns more money and has access to more clients than in BC. A personal trainer in Vancouver starts (at a major gym) at an average of twelve - yes, TWELVE - dollars per hour, despite it being a job that requires either a B.A. or an extended diploma and extra courses. The lowest starting hourly pay rate in Calgary? $20! Not exactly high, but a hell of a lot better (about 40%!) than $12!  I think what your job perspective is depends greatly on what your field is, and if you're new to the area (as I am), what it's like where you came from. Vancouver's job market has been depressed for years, and BC citizens earn much less when compared to the national average for their fields. Alberta, even in a down-turn, is a major improvement on where I came from."

Secondly, I've also lived in Europe (Scotland and Ireland), since I'm a dual European-Canadian citizen. No snow there, but I'm not 'just' a Vancouverite, even if I spent most of my years there.  Vancouver looks nice on a post-card. Actually living there? It doesn't live up to the billing unless you have a lot of money."

A really nice city with a lot of great things about it, but, at least for me, not worth the very limited career prospects and very high cost of living.  I've lived in a number of other Canadian cities and I was happy in them as well, however to be honest, if I could get a high paying job (e.g. >$100k/year after taxes) in Vancouver, it would be at the top of my list. Calgary would be my next choice if I was staying in Canada. Maybe not ""The Best Place On Earth"" but the winters are easier to deal with because of the Chinooks than places like Montreal or Toronto and great hiking and skiing are nearby. Hell, the parks in the city are pretty damn nice and plentiful.   In reality, odds are I'll be moving to the US in the next year because there are hundreds of times more jobs in my field there than here and getting a TN visa with a PhD in a biotech relevant specialty isn't too difficult."
Calgary,3dpem1,burtaexpat,3,Sun Jul 19 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"That's just it - you need a six-figure salary (after tax) in Vancouver (AND its suburbs) to enjoy what most other Canadian cities (including Calgary) consider an achievable 'middle-class' lifestyle - i.e. detached (or semi-detached) home, relatively modern car, money for a modest vacation each year, and so forth.   It's always interesting how a city that works for one person doesn't work for someone else. I find it hard to believe that Vancouver (and its suburbs too) works for anyone, save the rich. A PhD should take you far; I've got a BA, two graduate diplomas, and a Masters' in progress - education opens doors!"

I imagine one (or two) of those things helped. There's also the fact that the NDP came to power, and one of their main platforms was better funding for education - namely a reduction in class size. This necessitates hiring more teachers, so to some degree, I am sure that my application was a case of 'right place, right time'."

Calgary,3dpem1,NwHmeOwnr,6,Sat Jul 18 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"Don't hesitate to take that Mcdonald job    I'd rather be sitting on my couch bitching about how tired I am from work (any work), than sitting on my couch bitching about how broke I am because I'm unemployed."
Calgary,3dpem1,Roloboto,4,Sat Jul 18 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"And it you are worried about not getting hired because you are overqualified, tweek your resume to match.   When you find a job that is more suited to your skills...but might be worried about that part time job that got your through the tough times, leave it out. Its not relevant to the job at hand.  But there is no point in going in the red and having to sell all your stuff just because you can't find a job. I assure you people are hiring, not in O+G, but they are hiring."
Calgary,3dpem1,PopcornMouse,3,Sat Jul 18 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"I feel the same as you, but the fact is many persons laid off can collect EI cheques from their couches (for now) - can't do that while working a till."
Calgary,3dpem1,RalphWiggum4,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:07 2015 UTC,Plus EI pays better than minimum wage.

Calgary,3dpem1,canadathrow,9,Sat Jul 18 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"Doesnt matter what the market is, remaining in the country I was in was not an option."
Calgary,3dpem1,specificbarista,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:42:14 2015 UTC,Did you move from another country or from another part of the country? If you moved from another country one issue might be not having Canadian experience on your resume. In which case get out and do volunteer work while you're job hunting. Have someone look at your resume and see if it needs an update.
Calgary,3dpem1,heidamazeballs,4,Sat Jul 18 16:21:34 2015 UTC,Sad but true
Calgary,3dpem1,Fuckoff_CPS,2,Sat Jul 18 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"I dont do hiring but I get to look at resumes and talk to my boss about who would be a good fit. He actually skips people that have worked 0&G (we are non 0&G, but do have some 0&G clients) because the biggest worry is them leaving to go back to oil as soon as there is a rebound. For the time we put in to find the right person and train them to our ways of doing this, its not worth it. We just cant compete salary wise with big oil but we make up for it in work / life balance. And most o&g workers always come with a 'i need to one up people' attitude."
Calgary,3dpem1,EFFENEH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:41:50 2015 UTC,So of an O&G worker was looking to switch industries he'd be better off leaving his experience off his resume? Would be tough to explain the employment gap I suppose. Lose/lose
Calgary,3dpem1,Fuckoff_CPS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:28 2015 UTC,The cover letter would have to explain why they are looking outside O&G. I personally don't want to see people applying for the sake of a job because they got let go in 0&G and need something to pay the bills meanwhile.  Make it sincere why you want to switch industries is my only suggestion.
Calgary,3dpem1,ycccccy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"It's only bone dry if you are expecting a cushy highly paid oil and gas job. Yes, those are in short supply these days, but transportation, infrastructure, professional services, and many other fields are still hiring.  The people on this subreddit have a very twisted view of what a healthy job market looks like. When Calgary is booming it is literally possible to fall ass-backwards into money. When oil and gas has a hiccup, that isn't possible any more and people think the sky is falling.   The fact remains that Calgary is the BEST major metropolitan city in Canada to find work. We have the highest participation rate and the lowest unemployment rate.   You just need to put some effort into it. Networking has always been incredibly important to the Calgary job market, that isn't new. Talk to recruiters, generate relationships, go to job networking events, get your name out there, have TONS of meetings with recruiters. You will find a job, but you have to be active. Just throwing your resume out there on a bunch of web sites is generally ineffective in Calgary, and it has always been that way. You have to actually MEET people."
Calgary,3dpem1,OwenFinnn,0,Sat Jul 18 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"That ""lowest unemployment rate"" is a sham - it helps that the 30,000+ people who are out of work are considered ""contractors"", so they don't count toward the unemployment rate. Those people are looking for jobs too now.   There is no way that the flood of O&G applicants are getting into my field suddenly, and yet I have no job after two months of trying. Good thing I saved enough to get me through to Xmas and maybe beyond, and that my wife is working a decent job."
Calgary,3dpem1,aliceminer,0,Mon Jul 20 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the industry. I heard the military is still hiring. Honestly, oil and gas jobs are mostly gonna thru networking. Calgary is one of the most corrupted place on Earth where most jobs are obtained thru networking."
Calgary,3dpem1,pucklermuskau,0,Sat Jul 18 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"thats...not corruption. thats just how jobs work. you get a job by becoming part of a community, not by applying to some ad."
Calgary,3dpem1,aliceminer,0,Mon Jul 20 12:52:29 2015 UTC,"How is hiring your friends over other qualified candidates not a form of corruption? If a politician rewards his friends or supporters, it is called corruption :P"
Calgary,3dpem1,pucklermuskau,0,Mon Jul 20 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"what other qualified candidates? networking isnt about making friends, its about making a name for yourself. its not a matter of getting hired because you know someone. its a matter of ensuring that the people doing the hiring know you, and know what you're capable of."
Calgary,3dpem1,aliceminer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:41 2015 UTC,Networking is about making friends otherwise people will just use githubs and other sites to show off their work :P
Calgary,3dpem1,pucklermuskau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:03 2015 UTC,"well, good luck with that."
Calgary,3dpem1,pucklermuskau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:25 2015 UTC,"i think thats a pretty limited view when it comes to securing a job. its not just about demoing 'your work', its about getting to know people, as to whether their personality fits with the business, whether they're reliable, etc. github isnt going to do that."
Calgary,3dpem1,specificbarista,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"When people are looking for work with zero success I am always reminded of the scene in Christmas Vacation where Clark says he can't believe Eddie has been out of work for 7 years and Ellen says Catherine told her he's been holding out for a management position. When you are looking for a job you have to look outside your comfort zone. Apply on jobs one or two steps below your regular level but still in your field, or in related fields. Money is money. It's better to have a lower salary or the same hourly rate and 30 hours a week instead of 40 if your option is being out of work for 4 months, how much income do you lose then?   I am not a barista.  I have a business degree and spent many years in finance management. It was tough to get into when I moved to Calgary and when I needed a job I looked everywhere and kept my options open. I have spent the better part of the last five years in the restaurant industry and although it's more hours it's less stress and I make about the same amount of money I did before without dealing with office politics. My requirements for a job were: benefits, flexible schedule, decent work environment, overtime paid when worked not banked or lieu given. I cut expenses when I started out to reflect the then lower income. I don't have a vehicle, I cut off cable and switched to a $20 a month cellphone plan. I live within my means and the bills get paid and I don't care that I'm no longer utilizing my degree. My resume has no gaps in it and I earn my weekends. There are plenty of jobs out there for people who need to work.  Think outside the box you put yourself in, and good luck."
Calgary,3dpem1,Augustus_Trollus_III,2,Sat Jul 18 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"I have a b.comm as well and it seemed like everyone was going into finance post grad.  It just wasn't me and I'm kind of glad I didn't go into it.  That being said,  it's often hard to think beyond that box post grad since you've been prepped for certain positions for 4 + years."
Calgary,3dpem1,specificbarista,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:48:14 2015 UTC,I totally get that. It was frustrating at first. That said I remember coming home with a migraine every day. This is better.
Calgary,3dpem1,YYCenvironmentalist,0,Sat Jul 18 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what you're looking for, and the background that you have.  There are definitely opportunities out there, just a lot of qualified people applying for them.  Anything geology and engineering related is really dead right now"
