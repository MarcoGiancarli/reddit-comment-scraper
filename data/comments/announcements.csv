announcements,3djjxw,justcool393,4581,Thu Jul 16 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone answering these questions. I have a ""few"" questions that I, like probably most of reddit would like answers to. Like a recent AMA I asked questions in, the bold will be the meat of the question, and the non-bolded will be context. If you don't know an answer to a question, say so, and do so directly! Honesty is very much appreciated. With that said, here goes.  Content Policy   What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing? Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored? What is the policy regarding, well, these subreddits? These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of ""where would you not go"" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned. (Edit: WatchPeopleDie shouldn't be included and is definitely not as bad as the others. See here.) What actually is the harassment policy? Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example. What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a safe-space? A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way. Do you have any plans to update the rules page? It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it. What is the best way to report harassment? For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example?  Who is allowed to report harassment? Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins?    Brigading   In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them? Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the ""Badpire"", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there.  What are the current plans to address brigading? Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits. Is this a good definition of brigading, and if not, what is it? Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all.    Related   What is spam? Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content.  Regarding the ""Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech"" comment, how do you feel about this, this, this or this? I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words ""bastion of free speech"". How do you plan to implement the new policy? If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned. Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it? It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset. Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events? I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning."

Messaging serious threats of harm to users towards themselves or their families. Less serious attacks - but ones that are unprovoked and sustained and go beyond simply being an annoying troll. An example would be following someone from subreddit to subreddit repeatedly and saying “you’re an idiot” when they aren’t engaging you or instigating anything. This is not only harassment but spam, which is also against the rules. Finding users external social media profiles and taking harassing actions or using the information to threaten them with doxxing. Doxxing users.   It’s important to recognize that this is not about being annoying. You get into a heated conversation and tell someone to fuck off? No one cares. But if you follow them around for a week to tell them to fuck off, despite their moving on - or tell them you’re going to find and kill them, you’re crossing a line and that’s where we step in."

What about if someone instigates and many people respond negatively? If a person of color were to go into coontown and start posting for example - the sub would jump on them with hate, but in that place it would about par for the course.

Once he realized tagging me was a quicker way to get banned, he stopped adding the /u/ before my name. I was told to go to the admins about this, but I honestly have no idea how to do that.

I'm only speaking about this passively; I've seen it happen a lot in /r/hearthstone, /r/wow etc where various youtubers have been banned from reddit because they were doing video content for reddit, and not posting much outside of that.

If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.   This would be extremely valuable to mods since right now often users have no idea what is going on.   A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was somehow so we can better learn the rules.   This is good. It should also say who removed it - not all moderators will be pleased with this, but if there is resistance to accountability they are probably doing something the community wouldn't approve of.   A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.   This has some potential for abuse and could create resentment if overused...but if this is viewable by anyone who wants to see it, then at least users can tell if posts are being mislabeled. There's really no reason not to have it publicly viewable, i.e. something like ""/r/SubredditName/spam"".  On a curated subreddit I moderate, we always make a comment whenever we remove something, explaining why we did it and citing a sidebar rule. We feel transparency is essential to keeping the trust of the community. It would be nice if users who wanted to see deleted submissions on their own could simply view them; we've published the moderation log whenever someone requests it but this is cumbersome. Users need a way to simply see what is being done.   There should be a separate function to remove content that breaks site-wide rules so that it's not visible, but this should be reviewed by admins to ensure that the function is not being abused (and of course to deal with the users submitting content that breaks Reddit rules).    With giving mods more powerful tools, I hope there is some concern for the users as well. Reddit mods' role has little to do with ""moderation"" in the traditional debate sense, but more as a status of ""users who are given power over other users"" to enforce any number of rules sets...sometimes with no guidelines at all. With that, there needs to be some sort of check against the potential abuse of that power and right now we have none.  The important thing to remember is that content creators and other users don't choose their mods. They choose what subreddits to read and participate in, but often those two aren't the same. In many ways it's a feudal system where the royalty give power to other royalty without the consent or accountability of the governed. That said, when mods wield their power fairly things are great - which is most of the time.   For instance, in /r/AskHistorians the mods seem (at least as far as I can tell) to be widely well-respected by their community. Even though they are working to apply very stringent standards, their users seem very happy with the job they're doing. This is of course not an easy thing to achieve and very commendable. Let's say hypothetically, all of the current mods had to retire tomorrow because of real-life demands and they appointed a new mod team from among their more prolific users. Within a week, the new mods become drunk with power and force their own views onto everyone in highly unpopular moves, meanwhile banning anyone who criticizes or questions them, all while forcing their own political opinions on everyone and making users fear that they might say something the mods disagree with. The whole place would start circling the drain, and as much as it bothers the community, users who want to continue discussing the content of /r/AskHistorians would have no choice but to put up with the new draconian mod team.  The answer is ""Well if it's that bad, just create a new subreddit."" The problem is that it's taken years for this community to gain traction and get the attention of respectable content posters. Sure you could start /r/AskHistorians2, but no one would know about it. In this hypothetical case, the mods of /r/AskHistorians would delete any mention of /r/AskHistorians2 (and probably ban users who post the links) making it impossible for all of the respected content creators to find their way to a new home. Then of course there is the concern that any new subreddit will be moderated just as poorly, or that it only exists for ""salty rule-breakers"" or something along those lines. On the whole, it's not a good solution.    This all seems like a far-fetched example for a place like /r/AskHistorians, but everything I described above has happened on other subreddits. I've seen a simple yet subjective rule like ""Don't be a dick"" be twisted to the point where mods and their friends would make venomous, vitriolic personal attacks and then delete users' comments when they try to defend themselves. Some subreddits have gotten to the point where mods consistently circle the wagons and defend each other, even when they are consistently getting triple-digit negative karma scores on every comment.  My intent here is not to bring those specific cases to your attention, but that in general communities need to have some sort of recourse. Mods shouldn't need to waste their time campaigning for ""election"", but they shouldn't be able to cling to power with a 5% approval rating either. Reddit already has mechanisms in place to prevent brigading and the mass use of alt accounts to manipulate karma. /r/TheButton showed us that it can be easily programmed where only established accounts can take a certain action. What we need is a system where in extreme cases, a supermajority of established users (maybe 80%?) have the ability to remove a moderator by vote.  Would it be a perfect system? No, but nothing ever is. For those rare cases where mods are using their power irresponsibly, it would be an improvement over what we have now."

I have, in the past, posted to GW on my ""real"" account because I forgot to switch accounts. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's done something like this, or to whom something like this has happened. Thankfully, Reddit currently doesn't show the username of the poster on user-deleted posts. Please, please, please DON'T change this. Even if the actual content of the post is obliterated, sometimes even a record that someone posted in a sub at all could be harmful to their reputation and, depending on who sees it, potentially their safety, as would any way to ""see what was removed"".

I'm a moderator of more than a few NSFW subreddits, including /r/BDSMcommunity and /r/BDSM, and as I stated in the teaser announcement earlier this week: this decision, and the specific wording, is worrying.  I want to specifically address this:   Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people   As well as your earlier comment about things being seen as ""offensive"" and ""obscene"".    There are sections of the world, and even the United States, where consensual BDSM and kink are illegal.  You can see where this is the type of announcement that raises more than a few eyebrows in our little corner of the world.  At what point do the minority opinion and positions be accepted as obscene, offensive, and unwanted?  BDSM between two consenting adults has been seen and labeled as both offensive and obscene for decades now."

It was a sub that was critical of the NeoGAF forums, such as the leader using his position to cover up a sexual assault he committed against a female user he met up with.  /r/NeoGAFInAction was banned as well without justification.

What about ""I think being fat is gross but you shouldn't kill yourself"" or ""I don't like fat people""?  I ask because all those behaviors and more were wrapped in the fatpeoplehate drama. Surely there were unacceptable behaviors. But as a consequence a forum for acceptable behavior on the issue is gone.

As much as the mods need more support and contact with the admins, there are also a lot of corrupt mods that damage Reddit and abuse individual users with arbitrary bans or even mass bans.   A guy named ""davidreiss666"" is a classic example. He's been booted put of at least two subs for mod abuse and he still mods over 100 more.   I suggest the following:   A cap on the number of subs a user can moderate. Nobody can moderate over 100 subs in good faith, so they're obviously doing it for the power trip.  Transparency with bans and other mod powers that can be abused. Many of the worst mod abuses go completely unnoticed, unless it's a sub with open mod mail or the abused user kicks up a stink.  Have an option for subreddits to ""recall"" moderators. Right now, a sub can't get rid of a toxic mod unless there's a more senior mod willing to act. So even if there's a mod that's objectively doing a bad job, if he's senior enough, he's untouchable. Then the only solution is to unsub and basically ban yourself, which is cutting off your nose to spite your face.    TL:DR: if you're wondering why the default subs all suck, a big part of the reason is crappy/corrupt mods ruining them."

Change the rules for subreddit request to make it so that if mods aren't actively moderating a sub then a user can reddit request the sub.   As it stands right now the mod must not be active on reddit for 90s in order for a reddtor to request the subreddit in /r/redditrequest.

Do you see an issue with more and more default subreddits configuring their automoderator to automatically remove comments from users who have just joined? On numerous occasions a friend or family member has created an account after me telling them about reddit only to find that when I go to their overview page and follow the permalink to their actual comments that it is missing. I presume moderators are doing this to mitigate trolls or something but I think it might become a systemic problem if all of the defaults move in this direction.

I think it's important to understand that these three things happened in this sequence:   Alexis gives timelines to mods for specific things I get assigned to focus on moderator issues Ellen resigns and Steve comes back as CEO   It's definitely not that we don't think we're going to have anything done in 3 or even 6 months, we're absolutely going to get quite a bit done. That's a very long time to get things done when there are resources devoted to it, it's mostly just the order that things happened in that have made this confusing. Specifically, we want to make sure that we're focusing on the right things first, so it's important that we start having conversations directly with mods to find out what that is, instead of being committed to working on the two things Alexis mentioned. They're both definitely important issues, but I don't know if they're the most important ones. That's why we've been trying to step back from those promises a bit, not because we think they're impossible but because we're not sure if they're even the right promises.  Steve coming back as CEO is also a really big step here. Even in the announcement post, he listed improving moderator tools as one of his top priorities. From talking with him so far, it's been very clear that this is something he wants to make sure we make some major improvements to soon, and I'm confident that he's going to make sure that we get a lot of updates made in the fairly near future.  Overall, things are definitely still not settled, and I expect they probably still won't be for a little while yet.

At one point, /r/gaming's AutoModerator configuration was removing upwards of 70% of submissions and comments posted to that subreddit.  I am personally opposed to these kinds of uses of AutoMod, including banwords lists that trigger auto-removal.  OTOH, you are absolutely correct that the reason these things happen is because we just don't have the kind of tools needed to properly manage communities with millions and millions of members.  You get places with 10 humans, maybe 6 of which are active in any sense, trying to moderate a community of five million.  And they can't even IP-ban.

They insist they're not judging people on the basis of skin color, but by their character...which they presume to know simply from looking at the color of their skin.   They're not just talking about known criminals; they judge children playing with their grandmothers just by looking at them.   If it were just this kind of stuff, though, I would tend to agree it's mostly harmless. However, they're not just saying, ""I hate these people."" They're watching people die and celebrating it.   They celebrate when parents are killed with their children in their arms.   They celebrate when black children die.   They celebrate when black infants die. This first link is to the original headline; then the OP amended it to confirm the child's death.   Are you confused by the usage ""made good?"" Hint, for those who haven’t waded very far into this muck: the origin is the saying “The only good nigger is a dead nigger,” a sentiment echoed frequently enough on that sub that the shorthand “made good” can exist and be understood. Search coontown with the terms “made good” OR “made gud” OR ""goodified"" to see how rampant this usage is on the sub. This is how often they talk about murder. It's bad enough when they're using it to talk about the death penalty being meted out on the streets for petty crimes that generally carry straightforward jail sentences. But when they're cheering that nine churchgoers were ""goodified,"" perhaps because one, a state senator, dared to try to bring attention to black accomplishments? I mean, really? (Notice too, that the person sort of regretting violence is at -1, while the person supporting political assassination is in the positives.) Honestly, what year is this, that support for political assassination can be given quarter, in any way, shape, or form, on a mainstream website? These guys are straight out of the Jim Crow South with this nonsense. (""How dare those darkies be proud of something a black person did? Good guy Dylann Roof, assassinating that uppity nigrah!"") This is literally the logic of lynching.  This is not harmless. They are intentionally spreading misinformation which incites people to hatred, and that hatred has real world consequences. It reinforces already-existing biases, which make it more likely for black people to be killed even when they are unarmed and pose no threat to anyone. And the more people read this stuff, the more they want to do something about what they're seeing.   Perhaps this doesn't matter to you, /u/spez; maybe you don't know many black people, or maybe you don't take seriously the idea that a person, simply driving themselves somewhere, say, to a new job, can end up in police custody on the flimsiest of pretexts and die just days later. Or maybe, you don't really care.   But this is real for me, which is why I'm writing this. When they champion segregation or repatriation, I picture myself and my children being forcibly dragged away from my husband, their father. This content makes me feel unsafe, because I have no idea who in the real world is viewing it (many more people than their subscriber numbers suggest, clearly, as evidenced by the fact that you can't bring yourself to just drop them from the user statistics entirely by banning the sub). I could ignore coontown, but it wouldn't give me the ability to ignore cops who see nothing but misinformation and stereotypes when they see me or one of my children. I'm pregnant; how fast could I run from an overzealous neighborhood watch volunteer who questions what's in my hand or my bag? Knowing that people like this exist anywhere is overwhelming to me at times; their existence on this site, where I go to have useful conversations with wonderful people, negatively impacts my experience of the real world, because their recruiting tactics are clear and you can see them radicalizing people. I now mistrust every white stranger I see because of this stuff, because who knows which one of them is carrying a gun, ready to ""goodify"" a nigger? They don't know or care how many degrees I have, how many people I help daily, my spotless personal record. All they see is misinformation and stereotypes, and another ""dindu"" on the way.    Do you really think asking the decent people who use your site to subsidize the violent preparations going on in the cordoned-off basement is being a force for good in the world? Wherever this group goes, they will do their best to recruit. That is the purpose of their existence: to spread their speech, to spread their hate. As long as they are here, they will continue to climb up from the basement into the defaults to invite newbies downstairs. They will fill their heads with nonsense, and while most probably won't do much with that information besides grumble and vote Republican, a few will become radicalized - at least one of them will become a Dylann Roof someday. Do you really want that blood on your hands? Is that really what it's going to take for you to finally summon the courage to shut them down - a mass murderer with this subreddit (or one of many noxious others) in his browser history, for all the media to see?   The purpose of speech is to make common cause and eventually take action. It serves no real purpose otherwise. The connection between hate speech and violence is clear. You are of course allowed to host whatever you want on your website - that is your First Amendment right - but if you really ""want the world to be proud of Reddit,"" how can you possibly give quarter to people who would watch innocent people die and laugh about it, just because they're brown? Sure, if you didn't host that speech, someone else could. But you don't have to do this; you don't have to support the spread of evil, violence, and death for any reason.   If this decision isn't official yet, you have time to reverse course. Do the right thing, if not for money (which, if you're really not profiting from them, why are you wasting money on servers and staff time supporting them?), then for your own soul.   Edit: deleted extra word  Edit 2: thanks for the gold, kind strangers. I appreciate the support.   Edit 3: Some more links about white supremacists using Reddit for their recruiting efforts, for those doubting. In both, note how they use and influence other aspects of the site.

The following example can usually be found on both sides of these conflicts, so don't presume I'm speaking about a particular side of a particular debate:  There have been many cases of people accusing others of harassment or bullying, when in reality a group of people is shining a light on someone's bad arguments, or bad actions.  Those that now see this, voice their opinions (in larger numbers than the bad actor is used to), and they say they are being harassed, bullied, or being intimidated into silence.  How would the new rules consider this type of situation, in the context of bullying, or harassment?"

announcements,3djjxw,The_Antigamer,740,Thu Jul 16 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"I have been a redditor for a very long time, and I've been part of a range of kinds of communities that vary fairly significantly.   I am also a female who was raped, and this is something I have been opened about talking fairly frequently on reddit.   I disagree with the ban of the aforementioned sub, because I feel that it sets a precedent depending on what the society deems appropriate to think about, and what it does not.   Please note, that I can not and do not pretend to speak for any woman who was raped besides myself.   What I am concerned with is this distinct drawing of a line between the people who own the site, and the people who create the content on the site. Reddit appealed to me because it was the closest thing to a speaking democracy I could find in my entire existence, utilizing technology in a way that is almost impossible to recreate across large populations of people otherwise.   This sequence of events marks this as a departure from that construct. From today onwards, I know that I am not seeing clusters of people with every aspect of their humanity shown, as ugly as it may be sometimes. I feel that it is not the subreddit that causes subs like /r/rapingwomen to exist, but this stems from a larger cultural problem. Hiding it or sweeping it under a rug from the masses is not what solves the problem; I have already lived under those rules and I have seen them to be ineffective at best and traumatizing / mentally warping at worst.   People's minds should not be ruled over by the minds of other people, and that is what I feel this has become. Internet content is thought content, idea content. It is not the act of violence - these are two very separate things. You can construct a society that appears to value and cherish women's rights in the highest regard, and yet the truth can be the furthest thing from it.   I really would hope that you would reconsider your position. To take away the right of being able to know with certainty that one can speak freely without fear, I don't have many words to offer that fully express my sadness at that.   The problem is not the banning of specifics. The problem is how it affects how people reason afterwards about their expectations of the site and their interactions with others. It sets up new social constructs and new social rules, and will alter things significantly, even fractions of things you would not expect. It is like a butterfly effect across the mind, to believe you can speak freely, and to have that taken away."

It's weird being one voice among thousands,  but it's probably weirder to be the only voice that anyone's paying attention to.  This thread was a moderate success in my opinion.    The loudest and most controversial opinions are the ones that steer the conversation,  and rarely do you see vehement support for the middle ground.  I think it was either ban opinions or condone the worst of them,  and you didn't necessarily do either. This is a solution that appeases neither fringe, but allows both you and the community to move forward.

Massachusetts (1966), in which obscenity was defined as anything patently offensive, appealing to prurient interest, and of no redeeming social value. Still, however, this left the ultimate decision of what constituted obscenity up to the whim of the courts, and did not provide an easily applicable standard for review by the lower courts. This changed in 1973 with Miller v. California. The Miller case established what came to be known as the Miller test, which clearly articulated that three criteria must be met for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulations. The Court recognized the inherent risk in legislating what constitutes obscenity, and necessarily limited the scope of the criteria. The criteria were:The average person, applying local community standards, looking at the work in its entirety, must find that it appeals to the prurient interest. The work must describe or depict, in an obviously offensive way, sexual conduct, or excretory functions.

It is actually TOO specific, and yet also TOO ambiguous.  Who -- exactly -- is the ""You"" in that sentence?  Most people will place themselves in that position -- and thus it becomes a completely arbitrary, entirely subjective, non-standard ""standard"".  Most laws, codes, etc substitute at least some sense of ""reasonable"" and some sense of ""community"" -- ergo that the content deemed so is that which a ""substantial plurality, if not a majority of the members of a community, deem to violate a 'reasonable' sense of common decency.""  Granted that is STILL vague and somewhat ambiguous, but at least it is not construed in the sense of any ONE INDIVIDUAL'S idea of a ""common sense of decency"" (which let's be real, ""common sense"" doesn't actually exist and it certainly isn't ""common"", and you will never arrive at any consensus on it -- not as one once might have anyway -- even ""a sense of common decency"" is dubious).

announcements,3cbo4m,SingularTier,4484,Mon Jul 6 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hey Ellen,  Although I disagree with the direction reddit HQ is taking with the website, I understand that monetizing a platform such as reddit can be a daunting task. To that effect, I have some questions that I hope you will take some time to address. These represent some of the more pressing issues for me as a user.    1) Can we have a clear, objective, and enforceable definition of harassment? For example, some subs have been told that publicizing PR contacts to organize boycotts and campaigns is harassment and will get the sub banned - while others continue to do so unabated. I know /u/kn0thing touched on this subject recently, but I would like you to elaborate.  2) Why was the person who was combative and hyper-critical of Rev. Jackson shadowbanned (/u/huhaskldasdpo)? I understand he was rude and disrespectful and I would have cared less if he was banned from /r/IAMA, but could you shed some light on the reasoning for the site-wide ban?  3) What are some of the plans that reddit HQ has for monetizing the web site? Will advertisements and sponsored content be labelled as such?  4) Could you share some of your beliefs and principles that you plan on using to guide the site's future?  I believe that communication is key to reddit (as we know it) surviving its transition in to a profitable website. While I am distraught over how long it took for a site-wide announcement to come out (forcing many users to get statements from NYT/Buzzfeed/etc.), I can relate not wanting to approach a topic before people have had a chance to calm down.  The unfortunate side-effect of this is that it breeds wild speculation. Silence reinforces tinfoil. For example, every time a user post gets caught in auto-mod, someone screams censorship. The admins took no time to address the community outside of the mods of large subreddits. All we, as normal users, heard came from hearsay and cropped image leaks. The failure to understand that a large vocal subset of users are upset of Victoria's firing is a huge misstep in regaining the community's trust."

We allow organized campaigns to reach appropriate points of contact, but not individual employees who have nothing to do with the issues. We did not ban u/huhaskldasdpo. I looked into it and it looks like they deleted their account. We don't know why. We're focused on ads and gold. We're conservative in how we allow advertising on reddit: We always label ads and sponsored content, and we will continue. We also ban flash ads and protect our users privacy by protecting user data.

If you aren't banning an idea - no matter how terrible - why are you automatically banning every fat hate subreddit created? Is a fat hate subreddit ever allowed to exist on reddit again?  If IAMA was banned for harassment, would you also ban every single replacement AMA subreddit?"

You don't moderate your website - you have unpaid volunteers do that.  You don't manage your website - you don't communicate with your users or even the people who moderate your website for you.  You don't create content - you have users do that.  You don't update your website - upgrades are always ""coming soon"", or you rely on third-party extensions built by unpaid volunteers to fix the most broken parts of your site.  You don't manage your code base - you've been ignoring pull requests since 2013.   You don't sell ads - that process is automated.  So again, what is it exactly that you guys do all day?"

Especially replying with info concerning the shadowban - this has been thrown around a lot and it's good to get some stuff cleared up.    Regarding #1, It concerns me that ""reddit as a platform not being safe"" seems subjective. The 'report' card gets thrown around a lot as a tool to silence critics and dissent.    A better definition of what constitutes a ""safe platform"" would be appreciated. Would openly criticizing viewpoints expressed publicly either elsewhere or on site constitute harassment?    For hypothetical, if a user on twitter used their account to organize a campaign a community disagreed with (be it a political or social movement), would it be harassment to link their website/twitter in a submission critiquing their reasoning?    Now, what if the same thing was done without the critiquing - Merely as an advocacy that it's happening?    There's a huge grey area here and I hope you can see people's fear of being silenced through the 'report' card.    As for the other points, I appreciate your input and I approve of your commitment to labeling ads and sponsored content.   Again, thanks for your time. I appreciate it."
announcements,3cbo4m,Whubwhub,23,Mon Jul 6 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them. We allow organized campaigns to reach appropriate points of contact, but not individual employees who have nothing to do with the issues.   This is a hugely unworkable harassment standard.  EDIT: For those of you who may be supporting this definition, think of it like a lawyer would think of it. Think of it as someone who is being accused of a crime and wants to find a way out. What would the problems be? The biggest problem, right on the surface, is that this definition is predicated on a number of concepts that also need a definition.   When it's something that the majority of people wouldn't disagree about (say, for example, the word ""cabinet"" - most people would probably agree, to within a certain margin, what is and isn't a cabinet). When the term is something more vague, that's what causes problems. This definition includes multiple vague terms, and the consequence is that it probably makes it even more difficult to agree on what is and isn't harassment. For example, grab your three best friends and have a discussion on how to define ""systematic and/or continued"" (continued for how long? two comments? 100? is it a period of time? a number of complaints?)), ""torment or demean"" (torment or demean - can we all agree what tormenting is? can we agree on whether something is demeaning?). Define ""safe platform"" - safe in what way? Physically? Mentally? Emotionally? Socially? At what point does it become unsafe?). Safe place to ""express their ideas"" or ""participate in the conversation"" - what is the level of expression or participation that everyone is entitled to? If someone concludes that they'd rather not post a comment because someone will call them an idiot, is that harassment? ""Fear for their safety"" - the same standard for safety that was used previously? - or the ""safety of those around them"" - does ""those around them"" mean family? or friends? or anyone that you know? what about anyone you know online or on reddit?  This is one of the worst attempts at formulating a standard for guiding conduct that I have ever seen. Note that it does not even require a level of intent (so you could be harassing hundreds of people right now without knowing it!). You might as well say ""harassment is whatever makes someone feel unsafe"" - and that's basically what they did here. Who determines what these words mean? Well, the admins, of course. And the words can mean whatever the admins find convenient in the moment, then they can change for the next convenience.   What is needed here is a clear definition with factors that can be used by a person to objectively judge new situations. For example, in New York, first degree harassment is defined as:   S 240.25 Harassment in the first degree.  A person is guilty of harassment in the first degree when he or she intentionally and repeatedly harasses another person by following such person in or about a public place or places or by engaging in a course of conduct or by repeatedly committing acts which places such person in reasonable fear of physical injury.   Now compare these two definitions. First things first, New York's statute isn't perfect either. But the conduct is fairly clearly outlined. It requires INTENT (""intentionally and repeatedly""), it requires that the conduct take place multiple times (reddit's definition could be read to include a person being injured multiple times by one action), it DESCRIBES THE PROHIBITED CONDUCT (following around in public spaces or repeatedly placing them in fear of physical injury), and it describes the TYPE OF INJURY (physical). Pao's definition doesn't do any of those things."

Come on, if you want credibility you need to respond to what Ellen actually says, not just downvote everything and only and always assume the worst.

It's okay to disagree and even dislike Ellen Pao. It's okay to think she's a bad CEO and should step down. It's okay to call her out on it and say ""you're a shit CEO and you're ruining my favorite site"" if you think that is true. I am only saying it's perhaps not constructive or ethically justified to call her such awful slurs.   I'm not even taking a stand here. For what it's worth, I do not think she is a good CEO of reddit, as she doesn't seem to understand the culture or have grown up with it. There are lots of people who grew up with the internet and sites like reddit, and they seem to have a better understanding of the values these communities treasure (e.g. no censorship, even of awful things we disagree with).

I had a 3 year old account with over 30K karma, over 10 Redditgifts gift exchanges, months of gold given and received (with years still on the books I never got back), a large friends list, etc...banned because I posted the number of a business.  I didnt start a witch hunt or say anything bad about the business....I wasnt promoting the business....still, it was seen as doxxing and without anybody else hearing my case, I was shadowbanned (and not notified about it).  When I did figure out what had happened and why I was suddenly talking to myself, I had to look up ways of getting a hold of Reddit.  They dont exactly have a customer service hotline (you know, like real businesses with real customers do).    That was a pain, but was able to finally reach somebody.  It was Krispykrackers.  Her one word reply?  ""Why do you think it is OK to post personal information?""  And that was it....I never heard another word, I never got an answer back from Reddit Gold about my paid-for months of gold I still had...and /u/gekokujo was lost to me over a non-issue.  There was no accountability, no transparency, and no recourse for grievance.   As a Reddit Gold user at the time, I was a PAYING CUSTOMER...and as you could have seen from my comment history then (or now), I am not a troll.   Leaving Krispykrackers in charge of fixing your out-of-control staff and unfair practices is worse than letting the fox run the henhouse.  Foxes arent evil, they just eat chickens.  On the other hand, humans like Krispykrackers have their own sense of social justice and a license to be judge/jury/executioner with no witnesses and only the shadowbanned-mute voices of her opposition to speak up.  There is no solution as long as Krispykrackers is playing a major part.  She is as big of a part of the problem as Pao herself and I can prove that (with my own experience and that of others...some involving chat logs from past controversies).  Fix the problem....dont promote the problem to a place where she will further abuse her power and your site.  EDIT - Thanks for the comments, guys.  I did get a response from KrispyKrackers that is hidden in the comments below.  As thanks for her response and in the spirit of fairness, it definitely deserves to be seen.  I apologize for any bad formatting, but I dont think Ive linked a comment before.  Also...in the comment above it says that I had ""years"" remaining on my Gold.

That fact is deadly dangerous to reddit, because the moment the content creators jump ship, I'll follow them like the fair weather fan I am, because I don't care -- at all -- where I get my content, or about which corporation or moderators are involved. If reddit compromises its content stream by having moderators jump ship, I'm out too, not because I care, but because I don't.  So she's right -- most reddit users absolutely don't care a bit about this, or the site, or really anything. And that's why she can't afford to piss off the moderators, who are the people who do care.

They'll have accounts they use regularly and never post, or just use the site without an account.  This means that when there ARE votes up or down, they typically don't reflect a minority.  The votes instead represent what many more readers/users are thinking or agree or disagree with - kind of by proxy.  For example, say a pic post gets 4000 upvotes.  That doesn't mean 4000 people and only 4000 people liked it.  It more likely means each of those votes represents a LOT of other users and their opinions.  The statement that it was a vocal minority I believe misreads entirely the depth to which the user base here is ticked off.  I think if you underestimate that or diminish it as a vocal minority, you will fail because you will fail to recognize the extent to which the base has been upset.

You'd think the app would be better supported by the company.  Also the policy that main employees relocate to the west coast may be somewhat misguided. I'm sure there's a reason for it. But in Victorias case she served a valuable purpose. The two main locations for high profile personalities is the East and West coast. Helping someone like Michael Emerson navigate an AMA while he's in NYC filming a tv series means to me he may not be fluent in the process and for him to have a good experience would mean someone being beside him is invaluable. A temporary location could be set up if it's a costs issue. A dedicated office isn't always necessary. (Emerson's AMA was canceled due to the recent issues. I hope this is just a rescheduling matter, I was looking forward to it). Many people would volunteer to assist if it's a monetary matter as well.

I was one of the original founders, former CEO, and now the Chief Product Officer and as such I've had the opportunity to put a lot of process in place, as well as help ask the right questions whenever we do things. Naturally all communities have their nuances and differences, but in the end it boils down to respect. Respect the community: honor your users and content contributors for the work and effort they do.  Often this results in us taking a tradeoff in what we call ""Technical Debt vs Community Debt"" where instead of creating friction for our users, we take on a technical burden instead. For instance, we launched a redesign recently, and instead of forcing everyone over, we maintained a classic version of the website, and told ourselves that we would maintain two versions of the site for the foreseeable future, and do our best to improve the redesigned version to the point that it compels people to switch (""lets make it so much better that they willingly switch"").  We often sit down and ask ourselves the following questions, in no particular order or priority:   Is what we're doing impacting the way the community uses the website? How does it impact all the different types of users: casual users, frequent visitors, lurkers, content contributors, power users, etc. Are you moving someone's cheese? Are you changing something that users are very used to or have been conditioned to? Is there a way to transition it smoothly? Does it impact the way our mods use the website? How about our editors, or other internal staff? Does it impact the way our content contributors use the website? Does it impact the integrity, trustworthiness, or authenticity of our brand, content or community, even if its just the perception of such? Does it impact the sense of community, their sense of ownership, pride or involvement with the website? Are you addressing the needs of the community, especially ones that were explicitly requested? Did you make a tradeoff? If possible, can you address both your goals and the communities needs at the same time? At the very least, do not ignore what your community is asking for. What do you anticipate the negative feedback to be like or about? How will you respond to it? Are you releasing a ""complete"" product (is it finished?), if not: what is missing and why did you choose to omit things? How are you communicating these changes or reasons to the community? Did you solicit their feedback before, during and after the change? We've learned that communication is key: frequent and open communication. Users may not always agree with us, but they are usually reasonable and will at least understand it if you explain why you need to do something. One of the best ways to manage change, in my opinion, is to solicit that feedback and actually act on it quickly. You wont make everyone happy, but the fact that you listened, considered and ultimately acted lets the community know that you're listening and working -with- them. What is the plan immediately after the change? Who will handle interacting with the community, collecting the feedback and making action items for them? Do you have resources set aside to quickly respond to the user feedback and fix bugs or issues as quickly as possible to minimize the risk/impact to the community?   Admittedly, we're not perfect either, but we've learned over the past years that if you're willing to engage with your community, they can be pretty cooperative and understanding, so long as you actually put a good faith effort into taking their feedback, listening to their concerns and being responsive in a timely manner. And as you probably noticed, since /u/ekjp actually communicated here, the nature of the responses overall is markedly less hostile - because once you connect with someone on a personal level they become much more reasonable.  Edit: I don't deserve the gold, but thank you kind stranger! But one more thing I'll say is that the community is vocal in threads like these because they've invested into this community and they feel a part of it. View people's feedback as passionate (even if it's harsh) because they care, and because they want things to improve."
announcements,3cbo4m,Vogeltanz,140,Mon Jul 6 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Hi Ellen,   I am certain that you realize much of the userbase (or at least enough of the userbase ) is upset enough that your words are meaningless to them. Or at least too little too late.  I don't have any direct investment in the current situation but it does effect me and all of reddit.   You and the administrative team have made several decisions starting before you came to reddit that the community has openly opposed. Yet you ignored them completely, not even addressing their legitimate concerns. Sometimes, mocking them in private (always be careful what you and your team put to ink).   This reminds me quite a bit of the windows 8 launch.  No one was surprised by window 8's failure because the community had been telling Microsoft for quite some time that win8 was not what they wanted, that it was laid out in a way that they didn't want, and that it would fail if they released it.  They didn't listen.  I feel that Reddit is at the same crossroads. The community has definitely been telling you how they feel and you have ignored them and in some cases mocked them. You are walking a dangerous path that will likely lead to significant brand damage at the very least.  To save what you can you need to step back from your title and salary and spend some time becoming a redditor. The community has asked you for specific items and you need to do more than post a generalized CYA message.   I realize that any changes will take time and most of reddit does as well. However, if you want the community to see your words are more than another hollow pile of crap, post your goals and how you are going to meet them, not just that you have goals. Address the specifics with specific language. Engage yourself in teh community instead of standing apart from it.   Reddit doesn't need a CEO, it needs a 'lead redditor'. Think on that for the good of us all.   Many specific items can be found in other posts in this thread and I am sure that the couple I post here are already covered but I think that starting with these is how to start.  1) End Shadowbans.   Do it today. Stop it immediately. Don't wait.  If a user is to be removed from a sub or from reddit in general there needs to be a process, not teh whim of an admin.   Someone to be banned should be informed before the ban is permanent. The ban must be reviewed by another party and the person to be banned needs to be able to defend themselves.   Yes, there are people who need to be banned. Yes, admins have full control over who can do what on reddit. No, you don't owe anyone any of this. However, it only takes one wrongful ban to enrage your user base and there has already been many more than one.   The temper of an mod should never screw over a user. Put a process in place and use it.   2) Solidify rules for subs and enforce them.   The most recent of all of this is of course FPH and the fallout that ensued. I don't support FPH but it does expose a giant issue with reddit and not for the first time (merely the most recent).   If you are going to ban subs (and really posts as well) you must have a solid set of guidelines by which you judge such things and it must be applied evenly to all subs. No matter who they are or how big they are or who mods them. You simply can't have it any other way.   Either all is permitted or what is not permitted but be the same for everyone.   Again, yes reddit has the right to do whatever it wants. However, your userbase expects an even application of the rules.  3) More than words.   If you had issued an apology long ago none of this would be an issue. However, you didn't. You even went so far s to talk to others before dealing with your userbase. I saw in one of your other replies that you blamed downvoting as to why. Yet, you can make a sticky post to the front page. There really was no reason for you not to address this a couple days ago, or the FPH crap the day after it happened.   However, you didn't. Instead you allowed the pot to stew. Now your words will fall on deaf ears (eyes?) and you have already hemorrhaged users. It isn't going to destroy reddit, At least not without further blundering, but backtracking at this point will be very difficult.   You need to do more than make a couple posts.   What I suggest is that you take these threads and gather the issues the community want addressed then make a post with those items and what specific steps you will take to address them, with an expected timeline.   This will be a significant amount of work but it is back logged work whose deadline is long past.   _  I don't want to see reddit die and I don't want to see it transformed into digg or similar).  You must allow your community and moderators to drive your decision, not to try to make decisions to drive your mods and community.   I truly hope that more comes of this than empty promises and CYA postings. The opportunity for you to change the communities perception is at hand but how you handle it will determine everything and so far it doesn't look favorable.   -Muad'Dib"
announcements,3cbo4m,InsidiousToilet,2224,Mon Jul 6 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"The average users don't care about moderator tools. What matters to the passionate non-mod reddit community is:  PAID CONTENT: Will AMA and other reddit subs have content paid by sponsors? Will you disclose if reddit receives money for specific corporate posts to receive higher placement/votes? How far are you willing to go to monetize reddit?   CENSORSHIP: Will you delete subs based on advertisers' requests? Will you ban users who don't agree with specific speech/content guidelines?  POOR MANAGEMENT: The firing of Victoria may, in fact, be completely justified. But the pure business of firing the head of AMAs (arguably Reddit's highest profile sub) was simply terrible management. Why didn't you know how your business is run? Why didn't you have a transition strategy in place for Victoria's departure? Why didn't she introduce her replacement to her important clients/mods? How is this not business 101?  TRUST: Reddit is run by the good will of unpaid moderators. How can they trust you that their content won't be regulated based on corporate sponsorship? The rumors regarding Victoria's firing over disagreement about turning AMA into a money machine must be addressed. And ""we don't discuss firings"" isn't good enough -- what is Reddit's plan for the future of the AMAs? And why should we trust you to continue to support a site that doesn't seem to respect your intelligence?   Simply, if these issues aren't addressed, then it's time to move somewhere else. If Reddit wants to turn the community into an advertiser platform (and do it in the most unprofessional, mismanaged way) then there's no sense in supporting a site that no longer shares our beliefs. Why should we trust you to do the right thing?   Edit: for Yishan and kn0wing:  LEADERSHIP: CEOs are the public face of a company. Good CEOs give investors and customers confidence in the company. While toxic CEOs bring companies crashing down. So what does Ellen bring to Reddit? Her previous work history is mired in controversy, as is her husband's. They've both been universally destructive of the companies they were part of, as well as exhibiting questionable morals and ethics. So what qualities or assets did Ellen bring to the table to get the job at reddit? Her hiring -- and subsequent defense by Yishan and kn0wing -- doesn't speak well to the decisions that are driving the company. What value does Pao possess that makes her, despite her personal and professional toxic qualities, a value to reddit?   INTERIM: Ellen Pao has been called an ""interim ceo"" though she's quoted as saying she'll leave ""over her dead body."" Isn't her mismanagement of AMAs and her role as the public face of the company, losing users and potentially money, cause for letting her go? Why isn't now the perfect time to end her temporary employment and find a real CEO?   FOUNDATION: Wouldn't reddit be better served as a foundation similar to wikipedia?"
announcements,3cbo4m,Elle-Elle,74,Mon Jul 6 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"This'll get buried, but hey. May as well add to the pile. Not that anyone is going to read this low.  I wrote my master's thesis on online communities, and specifically on the communication (or lack of) between online communities and the companies that run the sites they gather on. I focused on LiveJournal, which a lot of us remember for having a lot of user insurrections much like what we're seeing here.  As I wrote, I made a brief article that I titled ""Top 9 things to never do to your online community."" These were brief takeaways, things I noticed being repeated over and over again (as an anthropologist, I tend to look for patterns). Reddit broke SO MANY of these in this instance. In fact.. pretty much all of them.  1. Don't bury the lead.  You took this action on a Thursday, right before a long weekend, and as far as anyone can tell, didn't announce it anywhere. The more you try to hide something, the more a community will dig and dig and dig to find out what happened. And when you do it on a holiday, you've just given them prime time to do so. What do we do on our weekends but sit on your site and create content?  2. Don't talk down to them.  Several of the responses from Reddit admins sounded fairly patronizing. Don't do that. Treat your users how you want them to treat you. And remember... we can smell bullshit in a statement like a fart in a car. Don't make flowery promises. This statement isn't overly flowery.. but there's some stuff in there making my whiff detector go off. Be careful here.  3. Don't underestimate your community.  This sort of goes with #1. Don't think that they won't notice when something happens, don't think they won't get upset when a wildly popular member of your staff is fired without warning or reason. Don't think they'll just sit on their hands going ""well. that's a bummer."" If 15 years of online communities have taught me anything, it's that they don't sit on their hands.  4. Don't ignore your community and its opinions.  Mods had a really hard time getting answers. Considering they do the bulk of the work on your site, that's a really bad move.  5. Don't just give them lip service.  This post is better than most ""we fucked up"" posts i've seen, you've given two concrete things that are already in place, and another that is promised, but could still be vaporware. You're ""committed to talking more often with the community"" but you don't say how that's going to happen. And your own site makes this difficult; anything you say is going to be downvoted, which means no one will see it. That's a recipe for disaster right there.  6. Don't keep things from them.  We understand that you can't go into details on why Victoria was let go. Personnel issues are highly confidential, and pretty much everyone gets that. But finding a way to address what happened and give answers while still preserving confidentiality. It's hard. But I have to think you're all fairly smart people and can figure out how to make that happen. Or at least get out in front of it before everyone throws a fit. Then YOU control the story, and aren't scrambling to respond.  7. Don't believe you're the center of your user's world.  Sure you're a big part of a lot of people's lives, but you're not the only place. If people get pissed off at you, they're not just going to keep it here. They're going to go to all the other places online they hang out and bitch. i saw stories on reddit, on Twitter, on Facebook, Tumblr... everywhere people hang out online, people were talking about the #RedditRevolt. That takes a minor kerfuffle and turns it huge, fast.  8. Don't take your users for granted.  You're the current ""thing"" but the ""next thing"" is already on the horizon. Don't think you can do what you want, especially if it's outside the communities ideals, and they'll still stick around, or you'll attract the ones that will agree with you. Replacement doesn't work. Because once you have a reputation for not listening to your users, that'll stick, no matter who agrees with you or not.   9. Don't just take the attitude of ""we'll never make everyone happy, so fuck it, we'll do what we want.""  This is the most dangerous attitude to take. You don't seem to be doing it.. yet. I just hope you don't ever do so.   takes off pith helmet, hops off soapbox  edited for formatting"
announcements,3cbo4m,well_golly,940,Mon Jul 6 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and ask my questions regards to the current state of Reddit.  As I see it, there are a few issues that need to be addressed publicly ans specifically.   These are all based on the userbase ""perceptions.""   Not being in any loop to the recent drama, these are all just what I'm getting based on they hype going on.  I'd love your response to the following issues:   Censorship - There's a fine line between making Reddit a ""safe"" place and making Reddit a place where you dare not ever offend.   Part of Reddit's appeal is that here is a place where you can voice your opinions and hopefully find others to discuss topics with.   Currently fatpeoplehate is banned, but what if someday there's an ""up in arms"" issue between (as only an example) the atheist and religious subreddits.  Do we start banning groups because SOMEONE might take offense to the existence of specific subreddits.  When do we start banning, when do we just ignore?   I don't have an answer on when it is and isn't appropriate to remove groups, but I'd think it's better to put things in the hands of the individual users / groups than censoring anything site-wide.   If I don't want to see fatpeoplehate, give me tools to block it completely... Trust - There's definitely a trust issue going on.   As you've stated, the person who asked the offensive Jesse Jackson comment wasn't shadowbanned, but in fact deleted the account.   Perception was that Reddit Admins could and would shadowban people who offend/bother them.  This tells me that you have a trust issue with your userbase as we're starting to see the Admins as the enemy, not the great folks who give us this cool place to hang out.  I'd love to know how you plan to repair the users' trust issues.  My opinion here is that there should be a lot more transparency on what Admins have and haven't done with regards to bans, censorship, and frontpage manipulations. Evil Reddit Management - There's also a perception out there that Reddit's Management (not the day-to-day Admins exactly) aren't good people.  Victoria's firing has highlighted this, as have apparently other Admin firings that have come to light.   I agree with your policy of not speaking to specifics about personnel issues, but Reddit and you very specifically have come across as heartless with the immediateness of these firings.   The ""nice"" people that Reddit users tend to be really don't like the idea that Reddit might not be a great place to work and we don't want to support a place that mistreats their employees.  We actually want the Admins and Users to all get along and make Reddit something special.  Axing a high profile, well-liked Admin like Victoria without some sort of press release is a mistake as ""we"" want to make sure all her hard work and kindness to ""us"" wasn't just completely disregarded in this decision.  In short, the Admins in general seem like nice people and we want them to make sure they're treated nicely, even when a parting of ways happens.   Those are my concerns moving forward and I'd love to see responses."

What I'm about to say is absolutely going to be buried, and that's fucking fine, but I just need to say it somewhere  MOD TOOLS ARE A PROBLEM, BUT A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT IS HAPPENING TO REDDIT; THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED HERE, AND IS NOT ONLY CONTINUALLY NOT BEING ADDRESSED, BUT CONTINUALLY BEING BURIED UNDER ""MOD TOOLS"" AND THE REDDIT COMMUNITY IS PRETTY MUCH FALLING IN LINE.  Long time lurker, don't even particularly care about reddit that much, but when I see this many people simply not getting what is a very obvious situation, I have to say something. For clarity and brevity I will try and do this in list form:  Generally agreed upon roblems with reddit   Censorship Commercialization No transparency No communication No Respect   I think that's pretty much the long-and-short of it. But look at this post carefully, then look at everything she and Alexis have been saying to media sources in the past two days. They have entirely been spinning this problem as ""oh, we're sorry, we don't know how to communicate! We really screwed up with mod tools, we're so sorry!"" And I get why some random reporter from another news site would bite that, but that fact that so many redditors are completely buying that as the primary, and ostensibly only, issue is fucking mind boggling. Yes, mod tools are an issue. Yes, I want the mods to get what they need, but there is a gigantic difference between one problem that can essentially be solved with a dedicated and competent staff, and another problem which is a group of leader fundamentally changing the ethos of an entire website, not only are the nowhere near close to having the same importance, but when most of the reddit hivemind seems to follow this Pao party line that the ""mod tools issue"" is the primary issue, then it almost becomes black comedy.  And I completely understand that she can't talk about Victoria being fired. However, from the few things we do know about that situation, we can deduce a few things:   Obviously it was a bad firing since Victoria happily stood aside while reddit burned over her firing. While not an undeniable fact, anyone with common sense can deduce that she was likely fired because she was the person stopping them from commercializing AMAs   THIS IS A HUGE DEAL  The Victoria firing is not a catalyst, or in any way an isolated issue. None of these are isolated ideas. Increased censorship plays for the case of commercialization, (And my ""censorship"" I don't only mean the FPH business, i mean for the past two days I have been looking at the differences between the top posts and the front page and it is remarkable how many incredibly-upvoted anti-reddit posts are not making it to the front page. This is very clearly website manipulation to make it seem like it's business as usual). Victoria being fired plays for commercialization. Mods not having the tools they need makes them less powerful which also plays for the case of commercialization. COMMERCIALIZATION IS THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THIS WHOLE MESS. Unless you guys want a reddit where every post is an advertisement, something has to be done about this now.  Everything about how they have spun the narrative, to how they manipulate the front page, to their business practices, to this awful marketing class PR memo they crudely labeled as an ""apology"" smells disgusting.  And what about that leaked screenshot of Alexis talking to mods where he explicitly said that all AMAs while be coordinated through an AMA email address, but would not give an answer on who that person is. That's essentially a smoking gun that is on gawker, digg and god knows where else, but is for some reason unable to make any traction on reddit. And I know that it's partially because so many power users are drinking kool aid, but it's also because, frankly, it seems like this entire website is being manipulated with ease from corporate HQ. I mean, that's the new plan with AMAs, sponsored AMA working through Alexi's weird nerve point email address which will likely be housed by a team of PR/marketing aficionados who will ensure that AMAs will be glorified commercials.  But whatever, clearly these people won, clearly you guys are fine with spending all day on a glorified home shopping network that poses as a forum. I'm off to fucking Voat anyway, but I had to fucking put this somewhere, just for my own fucking sanity, because I am really just astounded that no one can put this together.  Godspeed"

I don't expect anyone to say why Victoria was fired, that's none of my business, but there had to be a reason why that information was not communicated to the rest of the community and certainly the AMA participants of that day.  In his statement /u/kn0thing stated that AMAs would go on as scheduled, but the fact of the matter is that the AMAs scheduled to go on that day were disrupted due to Victoria's absence and the entire kerfuffle was created when an AMA participant was not being contacted and was forced to message the mods to find out what was going on, which triggered their reaction of ""We don't know, what's going on?""  You acknowledge ""mistakes were made"", but I'd really like to know who made the mistakes and what their rationale was at the time for doing so.   It's sad when I'm being encouraged to think that the best case scenario is merely incompetence. Did people responsible for the firing not know there were AMAs going on that day?

Instead of saying ""we'll try harder"" in one sentence, it's been done in a few paragraphs. Let's stop to consider how badly this has all been bungled up till now, this just looks good in comparison.  Ellen, I'm a pretty typical Reddit user. Fairly casual, I mostly stick to the default subs, and I'm not a foaming-at-the-mouth zealot trying to get you canned. Having said that, I'm not going to be able to stop supporting the mini-revolt going on unless a few things are addressed.    I'm not of the opinion you should have spent your weekend here placating us, but I'm still not seeing any explanation of WHY the Admins have let things get so bad here.  We'd be a lot more likely to accept an answer of ""We're so sorry, we'll try harder"" if we knew what was different last time (from the other 245 times we've heard this) Again, it's hard to take anything you say terribly seriously if your reaction to the petition is to stick your fingers in your ears and go ""la la la"" as loud as you can.  Almost 200,000 people have demanded you step down, you need to address why a LARGE percentage of your readership should drop this demand.

I'm not asking for concrete details, but I'd like to know how exactly you plan to draw the line between abusive/illegal behavior, and stuff you (or other Admins) really dislike but won't prohibit on here.

The minority of Reddit are the ones that care about the success of the site.  The millions of 'unique page views per month' could care less if Reddit stopped existing.  The vocal minority, though...

It is best to treat everyone with dignity and respect.  Do you know how Netflix started?   The genesis of Netflix came in 1997 when I got this late fee, about $40, for Apollo 13. I remember the fee because I was embarrassed about it.    Blockbuster was their own downfall.  They thought they were too big to fail.  It was not Redbox that caused them to fail.  It was not online streaming movies that caused Blockbuster to fail.  Blockbuster was their own enemy.  They were arrogant and did not respect their customers.  All it takes is for the same arrogance and disrespect to continue within Reddit, and it will suffer the same fate as those that came before it.  As we speak, many users are jumping to other platforms.

Why you aren't working with the current modtools providers on how to integrate their product? (They've said time and again they would love for you to steal from them)  How you think Krispykrackers, working alone, will be enough for 6,000+ mods? We've already said we don't think this is going to work, and I've heard no response to this.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's hard for me to take a post like this serious when you don't address any of the issues that have been outstanding, but only the ones brought up by the recent event."
announcements,3cbo4m,Jackson530,13,Mon Jul 6 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"The biggest mistake is the thought that reddit is a business that can be acquired like you could acquire a lemonade stand. The people who are working the stand can be replaced, and the recipe doesn't change.  reddit is not a business like a lemonade stand, reddit is a community. The opportunity to profit from reddit arose with it's popularity, allowing it to turn into a business. The fault here is the complete misunderstanding of how reddit fundamentally works and retains it's popularity.  Content. Users. Moderators.  If you come in and start banning content, upsetting the userbase and alienating the moderators... Well, you've effectively created the holes that eventually sinks the ship.  I don't disagree with wanting to remove content that is hateful towards other people. I do disagree with actually putting it into practice. For again, by doing so you are shooting yourself in the foot.  reddit is a private company, and can decide in any shape or form what it wants to allow on it's site. But realize that one of the allures of reddit as a community is it's perceived freedom to speak wholly unrestricted. A forum only limited by law. When reddit starts bringing social morality into the equasion, the perception of being able to speak your mind freely is shattered. Thusly crippling a factor that drew in users.  Morality is subjective. Removing content because it might be morally correct to do so to you or me, is just bad business sense in this particular case. Which is profoundly ironic seeing as the act itself was an attempt to make reddit more marketable, not actually some noble deed by Pao. It could very well open reddit up to sell more ads, but when your userbase no longer exists that will be rather redundant.  I have grown up online, with online communities. With the amount of experience I have, I can safely say I have seen communities come and go. reddit is not exempt from that possibility.  If you want to last you need to remain relevant. To stay relevant you need to offer something unique.  I'll give you a hint: The only thing that is still unique about reddit is the people who maintain and enforce quality in the content.   And they do it for free."

I agree that you can't talk about employees, but you certainly can address concerns about how celebrity AMAs will happen without this position.

I do moderate a sub, but it's very simple, and I've never had any troubles on that front.  But here's my perspective:  Ms. Pao is the lightning rod of the current upset within the community. Yet by apologizing for ""the  past several years"" of mistakes, she is impliedly shifting blame from herself onto Reddit's prior leadership. In particular former CEO Yishan Wong.  Three or four posts on my daily feed is now controversy-related. That's not good, and I don't enjoy it. I suspect others don't as well. Media outlets are reporting the controversy, which signals to me that the unrest has at least several days if not a week or two left before it fans out.  None of us knows what's really happening internally at Reddit right now. Maybe Ms. Pao has already increased revenue 100% since her arrival. If so, who am I to say that she isn't the best candidate to become full-fledged CEO.  But then again her arrival seems to have brought multiple controversies and user dissatisfaction.  If Ms. Pao's internal leadership isn't top notch, it would be hard for me (as a hypothetical board member) to justify her current role given the recent unrest and failure to control the public-facing situation.  I'm even more troubled that her allocution is apologizing for past mistakes before her arrival -- essentially refusing to take responsibility for the current situation.  So, I'd put the question to Ms. Pao bluntly: why should you continue to serve as Reddit CEO?"

To put that in perspective, since I've joined Reddit, it was the first web site I opened every morning before all others, it was the only site that I received content from, and it was the last site I read before passing out due to human sleep requirements. I did not read news, tech sites, blogs, etc. unless it was linked on Reddit - until last weekend.  You are absolutely correct in that your words are nothing but that - hollow text on a screen that does nothing for my declining interest in this site's administrative direction.

announcements,3cbo4m,FunkyFarmington,11,Mon Jul 6 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously far too late to this thread. But, on the offchance you admins diligently dig through the mountain of comments these announcements get, I'll say a few words.  Motivation.  You've got a strong ecosystem of mods on reddit, some of us have been around a long time, some even longer, and some are just starting out. We've seen a lot of these dramatic events come and go, we know they're ripples in the ocean.  The dramatic events aren't the problem, they're just a catalyst that causes widespread public knowledge and forces you to make PR statements and the like.  The problem is a long term degradation and separation of the relationship between admins and moderators.  Once upon a time you guys conversed with the mods, openly, actively, regularly. We had channels in which we could chit chat with you, it was almost social. I had friendships with admins and former admins, I played Civ with a few of you.  I've been trying to pinpoint when that changed for a while now and I think I can safely say it was the Violentacrez incident. Understandably I think you all felt threatened or perhaps even somewhat responsible for what happened, and you categorically needed to keep a certain level of separation between moderators and admins so that reddit could remain impartial. By keeping yourselves separated from us you could maintain the idea that you do not endorse any of the content on reddit. It gives you plausible deniability.  The problem with this however, and the question you have to ask yourselves, is, what's worth more to you?  The relationship you guys once had with the moderators gave everyone enormous motivation. I know I once spent 100+ hours per week working on the communities I moderated. That has diminished to near nothing due to disenfranchisement - motivation has been destroyed.  Encouragement and endorsement of your moderators will give you the influence within communities to move reddit forward positively again. The moderators are your ""influencers"" within the community afterall, to borrow a marketing term. Their positivity towards you will result in the community's positivity towards you.  The big problem you have is that the old moderators who are now demotivated and have built up years of jadedness are probably a lost cause. Rebuilding their motivation is probably impossible, but, because of the way reddit has always operated the largest and most successful subreddits are owned by some of the oldest users.  This is a problem that will take years of rebuilding trust to solve. It will take years for new moderators to become the old-moderators-of-tomorrow but with better mindsets through having not built up negativity through neglect. You need to commit to years worth building new trust with new moderators and allow for time to very slowly and naturally cause the new moderators to replace all the old ones, in both influence and position. Only then will the problem be solved and motivation within reddit's modteams to be at the level it was when the largest growth booms were occurring.  What MUST NOT happen during this time is reactionary negligence due to drama fallouts. Or a new CEO to come along and decide it's important they fiddle with everything to stamp their mark on the site. It needs to be a wholehearted longterm commitment, and it needs somebody with a full understanding of the history that's led to this point and the slow path to repairing it needed at the helm. I don't know if that's /u/krispykrackers but good luck. I hope she understands fully the longterm commitment needed to take on the role.  If I were you all, I'd go back in time and take a look at old reddit. You archived it all, it's still there. Think about how /u/raldi, /u/hueypriest and so on once communicated with the community way back when. It was a different time for reddit, things were done better, and the moderators were certainly a happier and more motivated crowd. The users were also. If you want a true and honest ""quicker"" solution here. Hire someone from the existing moderator community with a good history with the rest of the mod community to be your ""moderator advocate"", someone who isn't just going to be forced into pretending to care about mod issues due to the position they've been give but who already cares. You'll get a lot more support from moderators by doing so, and if you hire the right person you'll get someone that genuinely turns this whole mess around for you."

Reddit has always erred on the side of free speech, while many other social platforms have continually cracked down on their user bases, which is one of Reddit's singular appeals. I understand that a line must be drawn when individuals are cruelly bullied or specific threats of violence are made, which is the same line drawn by US laws. But, the general perception has been that you are moving to sanitize Reddit of controversial content in order to appease advertisers and generate buzz in certain media circles.    I never was involved with any of the recently banned subs or any subs with racist or sexist content, and I don't begrudge Reddit moving towards monetization; but I will fight to keep Reddit a place where people can speak freely even it I find it to be offensive. Any future censorship must only come after a lengthy and transparent dialogue with the members of the sub in question and the Reddit community in general, and the Reddit leadership must clearly establish the line it is drawing for harassment."

You have a history of throwing a hissy fit when you don't get your way but I, along with plenty of other users of this site don't want ""change"" we want you to stop trying to fix something that isn't broken.  You are such a narcissist that you think that you can fix what's ""Wrong"" with the internet, but you're only fanning the flames against you.

Censorship needs to cease.  you know that word, it's the word that comes before ""desist"" in all of those letters you've been sent in your life. i'm not saying stopping removing ILLEGAL content, but to completely do an about-face in the way reddit has ALWAYS been communicated is a great way to ostracize the community.    Mass deletions of negative stories about you, SHADOW-BANNING those who dare dissent needs to stop.

announcements,3cbo4m,Samathura,6,Mon Jul 6 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"I just joined Reddit (never heard of it before this blowup).  But I gotta say something is off kilter about the relatively new internet business model of a for-profit company using volunteer moderators and whose end-product is the user.  The company plans to make money selling a product to advertisers.   The only product is the attention of each individual user.    Moderators are the suppliers who actually bring the product to the screen by providing an environment the product wishes to enter.    The company took actions which suppliers interpreted as arrogant, and the result of which was to make their job more difficult.  When suppliers objected, the first reaction of the company’s highest management level was to publicly, by way of on-line posts, make a joke of the concerns of those suppliers.  Other levels of paid employees followed suit.  Incensed by the perceived insult and inflexible attitude, the suppliers shut down the supply line.   That alone caught the attention of the company.  There is a definite disconnect between the paid execs/management/employees (aka company); the volunteer moderators; and voluntary users.  It is not just a PR matter.  Users have come to understand they are the product.  The volatility of business on the internet, the very essence of how fortunes are made, is also the road by which the product can walk away if its needs are not met.  The suppliers are the front line in seeing that those needs and wants of the product are met better at one internet organization than another.    If this business model is to succeed, the company must first accept that the moderators are their only supplier and then provide incentive to that supplier to remain in the business model as a necessary partner."
announcements,3cbo4m,TheGreatRayPape,7,Mon Jul 6 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"It's often incredible to me some of the opinions that surface on this site, it truly gives me perspective and humbles my world view time and time again.   I must admit that I too was soured by the seemingly waning disconnect that existed between Reddit and it's volunteers, having believed that what made Reddit so unique was it's quirky yet incredibly connected community, a community I like to consider myself apart of, which, in my mind, could have only come from like minded people running the show.   The outcry though was... childish. People who make it their principle argument to compare someone to Hitler lose credibility almost immediately. It was shocking to see so much of that vitriol up-voted, and gain so much visibility, but time has taught me to check my idealism when it comes to the quality of this site.   So for that, I actually wish to apologize to you and let it be known that we do not all share such disdain, and that not all of us believe that anyone should be subjected to such immense hatred.   What I have felt though is disappointment, disappointment which has been greatly alleviated by this incredibly difficult to make apology.   As a user, all I hope going forward is that the Reddit administration make a more concentrated effort to be apart of the Reddit community. To let us know, and let us be the first to know, all the changes that you intend to make with the community. To listen to some of our more well thought out ideas, and to make efforts to address some of our grievances. To truly embrace what makes Reddit so great, enabling the community to make and produce beautiful content. To be the face of the internet, to be the voice that connects the virtual world to the real world. To that end, I for one also embrace the goal of making the community safe and friendly because I don't believe it's good for anyone involved to allow our best foot forward to begin with pictures of Hitler, but that's my view.   I believe in this site, I believe in it's potential, and I believe in the excellence it is capable of and the wonderful things we can achieve. I think this website could change the world for the better, if we are only given the opportunity, so allow us the opportunity, work with us, grow with us, and we will repay you with our gratitude in spades.   You have a beautiful creature in your possession. Treat it as such and watch the beauty unfold.    Thank you again for this post, and I wish you the best in all your future endeavors."

We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.   You know what? All it takes is time. I'm not saying you need to explain every decision you make to us (quite the contrary) and I'm not saying you need to spend time talking to us each day, but if you really want to talk to us, then you'll need to make time for that, and we'll know if you don't.   Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments.   See what I mean? ""Including myself"" has turned into ""our team"" in just a few paragraphs. I understand you must be a very busy woman, but you need to understand that saying that you want to talk to us more often, will bite you in the ass if you don't. I believe your intentions are genuine, but my advice is not to make promises you can't keep, and certainly not at this time.  Also, I think that tools and reverting the search are definitely good areas to spend your resources on, but the real key here is communication. You seem to be trying to appease us with the promise of awesome tools, as if you feel that that's what people are craving. That may be true (or it may not, I honestly couldn't say) but that isn't what people are angry about, at least not the main reason. If you think tools are a solution to your current predicament then I say, only if they solve the communication issue. Tools, or the lack thereof, are not what got you into this mess.  You canned Victoria for reasons that are arguably none of our business and probably protected by an NDA (edit: by which I mean you probably couldn't talk about that if even if you were so inclined), but the mods from /r/IAmA weren't complaining because you canned her for whatever the reason is you canned her, but because she was the only one they could rely on to properly communicate. You should have had more folks like her in the admin team long ago, and you should get more folks like her in the admin team right now.  I hope you'll be able to turn the community around, best of luck."

I am sure other users will take you task on that. I will leave that to them. My question is why.  Did you screw up out of incompetence? stupidity? Apathy?  People make mistakes sometimes and everyone understands that. Sometimes people forget things, sometimes they don't stop and think for second, and so on. Sometimes people can genuinely say, ""I made a mistake. It won't happen again."" But sometimes that isn't enough and a reason must be found.  If someone  takes a car and swerves it into a busy sidewalk and runs over a bunch of people, it can't just be explained away by, ""I made a mistake and it won't happen again."" A reason why it happened has to be found. Was that person drunk? Did they have a psychotic episode? Did they fall asleep at the wheel? Something else? Of course I am not saying what you and the other admins have done is the equivalent of running people over, I'm just trying to illustrate a point that in some cases you can't just say you made a mistake and move on from there. You have to explain why it happened.  So what was it, and what will you do to make sure it isn't going to be an issue yet again?  Incompetence? Don't see how that can be fixed except resigning and letting someone competent take place.  Stupidity? Same as above.  Apathy?

Basically you're in a state of a doomed company that hit its peak and will be a downward spiral with small positive bumps here and there.    This may not even be your fault the flavor of the month only can last a month no matter how popular it may be.  Even worse is that you have a unpopular CEO now as the face of the company who unfortunately for you, happens to be you.   Right away you started  with controversy and seem to keep falling into such. You're unable to gain any positive outlook while also failing to hide in the background to let things simply be forgotten over time. To be quite direct it would be best if you stepped down at this point as you being CEO only harms the company.   I too run a company and while it is in completely different field  if I found myself to be uncontrollable  in my behavior that hurt my company I would step down from my own company that I built from the ground up  and seek the help that I need.   Also I will end this with something I wished to tell you nearly since you came to be CEO.  I think you are either aware of running a sinking ship or are unintentionally sexist and hurtful.    What you have done to limit employees negotiating salaries will only hurt your employees.  Perhaps you put on the face that it was a gender issue in hopes of saving money in which shame on you.   Or you truly believe what you say and again only hurt your employees.   You would have to have a sexist outlook to believe that men are superior in negotiations to which I might add if you truly believed this surely as the CEO of your company you find yourself in  so are you saying that you as a female are inferior to a male that would be in your position?  I don't see you are inferior to me based on gender so why do you regard me as your superior at-least in this trait?     Also what about highly skilled women who can hold negotiations?  Whether it be on salary or business work? How do you justify hurting them while claiming it's about gender fairness?  A employees interview skills don't just stop there  if you were competent you would recognize employee strengths and utilize them in the work place.   It sounds like to me you are admitting that you cannot see the values in employees during the interview process, and if you're not capable of that than why again are you the CEO? This should be something low management can do and you can't as the CEO!?  Instead you only hold everyone back and don't let both the men and women with talents shine.    Perhaps Reddit is savable but not with you as captain of the ship.  You need to step down and before you do press the idea of innovation into the heads of your employees.

announcements,35uyil,chocolate_chip_kelly,25,Thu May 14 10:02:07 2015 UTC,"Meh... Why remove non-copyright content in the first place? Reddit's lack of free speech has made me turn away from it as a community as a whole. It's a parody of it's once famous self.  Simply put... Comments and content on a website like this are categorised as a forum. Peoples opinions in the open air for everyone to see, consider and then 'react' upon. Be it acclaim, indifference or condemnation. Removing threads and comments is not akin to an editor in print journalism and reddit should not take any stance on its content at all period. It is 'the forum' and not the 'mediator' of a debate. This website is not print journalism and the views expressed here should always remain unedited and accessible to all.  Removing content is advocating the removal of people to think as they please. I may find your views abominable but I will defend your right to express them. Censorship is always tied to someone's idea of morality and morality as we know is biased at best and physically dangerous et al. Finally you'll also find that the ones who censor content do so because they are unable to deal with it. They will either reject an idea or obsess over it. Rejecting an idea is fine except it's also a rejection of who we are as humans and doing so means we cannot learn as a whole and grow. Obsession implies some form of guilt at finding an unwholesome idea some how appealing and in hoping to remove all the naughty words from the dictionary you reveal who you truly are. The one who desires to know them in the first place. Both denying others to do so and harbouring an unhealthy approach to dealing with your own humanity.  I'll also add: removing comments is not just censorship you're destroying the very idea of a forum. The walls, the roof the seating of the auditorium; gone and meaningless. It's people within merely puppets of a moderator. Their expression dead. Tyranny in disguise. We the tyrannous."

Then, when content still magically appears, a trap can be deployed: ""Well, this doesn't have the trusted, verified stamp on it that any removed content would have, therefore nothing out of the ordinary is going wrong!"".

Ellen Pao claimed to not be banning ideas, but an admin (DividedStates, to be more precise) recently said to a user (who had not been a moderator of FPH, and thus was not attempting to circumvent a ban when he tried to create his new subreddit) that ""FPH is no longer welcome here, and by trying to re-create[sic] the community you are putting your accounts in danger."""

So if we created a ""spoiler"" link flair, we could have a ""spoiler"" thumbnail for it that would appear for users on the frontpage.  If we have book spoilers and tv show spoilers, we can have thumbnails for those too.  All of these would also block out the picture thumbnail itself, which frequently contains spoilers."

It seems like every project has a different approach and I worry that /r/beta is going to be used too inconsistently to make it worthwhile.   We try to launch things in a way that's appropriate for the scope of the feature. So, for example, minor bug fixes or small UI improvements are either silently fixed, or mentioned in our live thread, which we try to keep up-to-date with every change. Larger changes that are user-facing get mentioned in /r/changelog - an example is Q&A sort, which is definitely user-facing but not likely something that every user or even most users will care about. The largest features are reserved for a blog post and /r/blog - things like the launch of reddit live and embeddable comments.  Hope that helps clarify how we do things - of course, we've grown a lot over the last year as a company, and we're continually learning, so we'll continue to experiment with the right ways to communicate changes with you all.  tl;dr We launch things in the appropriate venue based on the size of the feature.

A new one is posted every Monday and by Sunday there are hundreds of questions and answers that would otherwise have been their own separate threads--for a small subreddit, being able to organize the chaff in one place is a godsend.   BUT we also have other scheduled threads throughout the week: Tinker Tuesday, Mailbag Wednesday, Free Talk Friday, Selection Sunday.   Those threads don't get nearly as much attention. If we could have the one big stickied weekly thread up top, with a rotating series of stickied post throughout the week just below it, it would really clean the subreddit up."

announcements,2x0g9v,ramstoria,3,Tue Feb 24 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"I've said this elsewhere and I've even seen a few admins echo the sentiments.  No one really cares about a ""positive brigade"" when something a community views as awesome happens and other similar communities link to it and flood it with support in the form of up votes and positive comments.  The actual problem is when ""negative brigades"" happen.  And a community is over run by ideologically opposed people who down vote everything and leave snarky negative comments (often nothing more than calling people retards and other disruptive trash).  This is why people look at SRS and affiliates (SRD) so often.  These communities that are narrowly focused on ""things they don't like"" become reddit bully brigades, it doesn't have to be all of them doing the brigading.  If 10% of them actively troll a targeted community's new queue then it causes disproportionate damage to the organic sorting of submissions.  I've seen posts that basically say ""conspiracy theorists are retarded pedos"" get voted up to the front page of /conspiracy while posts that the community traditionally are interested in are all sadly sitting at ZERO in the new queue.  There shouldn't be anything wrong with linking to another subreddit on reddit, the only reason it has become associated with something ""bad"" is because these bully brigade ""we don't like you"" subs are allowed to exist.  I can't imagine why reddit would, on one hand, ask all these strangers on the internet to come here and build up your community, while on the other hand they are allowing destructive groups of bullies to actively break a community because they don't like it.  http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2x82hh/jihadists_destroy_historic_statues_in_nineveh/  Its just like this video here /u/kn0thing,  it takes a masterful intelligent mind to create something after a lifetime of patient focus as discipline.

We could probably use some clarification on moderating this rule on /r/PhotoshopBattles, and some heads up on how strictly it will be enforced.   We regularly have images of celebrities posted, and sometimes members of the public, that get photoshopped into looking like they are nude, or that depict them performing sexual acts.   Actually, on my front page right now this post is directly below a PsB thread of Emma Stone accidentally showing her crotch, and there are photoshops in the thread that depict nudity, or that make it look like there is sexual conduct happening.   There is one depicting her with a penis, and John Travolta looking like he is about to kiss it. This image would seem to be prohibited on reddit now; if it is do moderators have a responsibility to enforce the rule, or should we assume that someone else is going to deal with it?   Would John Travolta or Emma Stone have to contact reddit, or will images, that we can assume they would not approve of, be removed by admins?  We also get images where people photoshop violent situations into images, usually in a horror movie-type context or with famous historical images that depict violence. How strict should the 'violent personalized images' rule be taken, and is it now up to moderators to enforce, or should we leave it to admins?   edit: typos"

announcements,2x0g9v,Volsunga,35,Tue Feb 24 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"It is my opinion that more often than not it feels like the general purpose of a ""moderator"" is to react to trouble reports and otherwise assist in enforcing the rules. But the way reddit has things set up, it makes the moderators seem like community leaders when in fact, enforcing the rules could be all that they are doing. As an example, /r/TheForest has 5 moderators (not counting automoderator), 4 are actively using reddit but ""inactive"" to the subreddit they moderate in regards to that they haven't posted anything to the subreddit in more than half a year, two of which are very active DayZ players. They could be moderating through the mod panel, but regular people can't see this or other forms of moderating activity except through posting patterns. In short it appears that 4 out of 5 moderators aren't participating in the growth of the subreddit, just moderating it.  Another issue that I see is that some redditors are moderating in excess of 50+ subreddits. It makes it seems like some people collect moderatorship and are proud of it, although I am aware of the fact that some people were named moderator without their approval (/u/Jeresig in /r/JavaScript as a likely example, I don't really know) before that policy changed.  I think defining community leaders / contributors as people that both actively participate and moderate in a subreddit would be a better indicator and contributor towards the health and growth of a subreddit.  tl;dr: Moderators aren't necessarily growers of communities. Redditors that actively participate in subreddits (moderators or not) should be noted.  Also this whole post would make for an interesting /r/DataIsBeautiful visualization."

With this said, I'm also a bit uncomfortable with what happens when reddit fires employees or when employees leave reddit. There was an issue last year with an administrator who acted at times as a community manager who had the power to ban the accounts of any user that he wanted. He was either fired or resigned from reddit last year yet he had total clearance to any user's account on this site and during his tenure as an admin he was abrasive with a number of users and openly alluded to things that some users had said in their private messages and made these allusions in public comments on this site. That didn't sit well with me at all and I found it to be a clear violation of your site's rules and it was a clear violation ethically if not legally of conduct.

Or does this feature already exist and I just haven't found it?  In losing the threaded appearance of what makes reddit reddit, the functionality of the app is greatly diminished.   For example, when there are two IAmA Hosts in the same thread (e.g. two guys in a band) the app won't recognize the other one as OP. If the other OP replies to a question first, it will show his answer as the ""question""... So only both answers are shown.   Also sometimes when the questions are already answered by another user, and the OP chimes in to say ""yes, that's exactly it"" as a response to the user response, I don't actually get to see the original question and have to guess at it. Terribly annoying.   2) is there a subreddit for the official IAmA app where I could post these and further concerns like /r/alienblue is for alienblue?   In alien blue, the subreddit (feedback channel) is clearly visible on the sidebar. I am not sure of the origins of the devs for the IAmA app, but it sure would be nice to have it be consistent throughout the apps.   3) paid version to get rid of apps for IAmA?  As with alien blue now, I assume this update means that we will be seeing ads on the mobile IAmA app in weeks to come. Or am I wrong about that? Is there going to be a one-time IAP to get rid of said ads then?   Tl;dr consistency and functionality of reddit IAmA app   Lastly, thank you for your efforts to remain transparent with your users."

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any rules which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the blog post speaks very well to this. We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.   Every second a sub like http://www.reddit.com/r/photoplunder/ is up after this you're basically saying that unless a person has enough money to hire an attorney, or is savvy enough to create a DMCA take down, or find your DMCA procedure to make you do work their stolen nude pictures are fair game. The victims might not even be aware of them.   That's reprehensible.  Particularly given the tenor of that blog post and your comment about being shocked if it were your own family member.  I don't know why you edited that part about family out.   Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!  A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on.    You could always follow the suit of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and return the money generated from someone else's stolen images and likeness used for commercial gain.  I'm somewhat amazed an enterprising attorney hasn't hopped on that tort claim yet for one of these celebrities.

You can find instructions on how to do so by a quick google search, and our DMCA contact info in our user agreement.

We have little recourse to get those photos off of the internet, other than to recommend owners finding them issue takedown notices to the companies hosting them.

There isn't much to say beyond this, so you may take it or leave it.  We did ban a handfuls folks involved in ZQ postings. The content was not an issue with us. The main issue we were seeing is raids being executed by outside parties which were taking part in vote manipulation on the site.  The mods of some subreddits also took their own actions. While I don't personally agree with some of the responses, they're generally welcome to moderate as they see fit, and we saw no reason to intervene on their actions. Some other subreddits opted to take no actions.  The suggestion that we were actively trying to censor discussion of these topics does not  match the evidence. Yes, some people were banned because they were doing sleezy shit, but reddit was in no way devoid of the discussion. The /r/all page was covered in ZQ links and discussions on a few of these days.

announcements,2fpdax,audacious_hrt,65,Sun Sep 7 08:19:12 2014 UTC,"The issue here, yet again, is one of transparency and communication.  As you've said several times, Reddit is a user-driven platform; the users are the site's resource - you as employees don't supply content for users to consume, users supply it for themselves, and essentially vote to manipulate what other users see, creating a fairly democratic system of content.  In an ideal world, such a model would require no administrator intervention, or indeed, administrators, because content is directed by the users.  Obviously almost nobody thinks that's realistic, but for any platform which is driven purely by user interaction, executive administrative decisions which impact on users must be weighed carefully because, more than in other models, such decisions risk appearing heavy handed, or worse dubiously motivated when the rationale behind them isn't immediately obvious.  This has happened time and time again.  Often rationale is perfectly legitimate, but users (who ultimately ARE the website) have to all but guess what it could be.  This absence of transparency is especially bad for a user-driven model; Reddit provides a platform, and gives users the tools to dictate what they wish to see more or less of, and these things should, in theory, do almost all of the work for you.  Of course, such a system will never be enough by itself, but when it isn't, and when moderator, or more importantly administrator interaction is required, it must be possible for users to understand the rationale behind decisions, otherwise this stops being a user-driven platform, and ultimately users become disillusioned and stop being users.  What's probably needed is application of a quality procedure to these decisions.  At the moment, administrator intervention feels arbitrary; inconsistent.  The rationale for large decisions isn't obvious, and usually seems to require a painful period of attempting to draw administrators into passing comment to understand what the hell happened and why.  Ask anyone even remotely business savvy whether that's good process and they'll look at you in horror; this isn't how management should run anywhere.  If you get down to it, you'll probably find that your users are reasonable people (well, mostly) - actually explain decisions up front, make dissemination a part of the process of taking large-scale administrative action, and I guarantee you'll see a far, far happier userbase when these sorts of decisions are necessary.  To put it bluntly, Reddit is not the most technically brilliant user-driven web platform of the modern day.  It isn't the most advanced, or the most intuitive to use.  It is still the best, however, and that's entirely because it maintains a preponderance of users compared with competitors.  The internet is a fickle thing, though, and we've all seen poor management or failure to adapt result in boycotts or mass migration over the years.  I'm sure I don't need to explain the potential consequences of users losing faith in administrative decisions.  No matter how legitimate your reasoning for making decisions, without transparency, users will draw their own conclusions, and as this episode demonstrates, it'll almost always be for the worse."
announcements,2fpdax,Brimshae,28,Sun Sep 7 10:34:16 2014 UTC,"I find the stance that ""vote brigading is evil"" to be rather entertaining, as reddit often does exactly that by linking to polls, surveys, youtube videos (to upvote/downvote) etc. But it's fine as long as it's not on your site right?  And before this is answered with the typical ""well, reddit users can do what they want"" I'd point out that the admins in the past have effectively encouraged vote brigading congress and the FTC/FCC over internet-related issues (such as SOPA/CISPA). In fact, I believe they're about to do it again this Friday over net neutrality. Imagine how they'd feel if next Friday the FCC says ""any comments we receive from users that came from reddit or any other site taking part in the planned protest will be ignored"".  Seems kind of hypocritical.  And note, vote brigading != vote manipulation (making fake accounts to vote multiple times). The latter is obviously bad and should be stopped. My guess is that it gets hard to detect manipulation inside of the circumstances that arise when something is being ""brigaded"", so rather than solve that problem they just banned vote brigading."

The issue of 'stolen pictures' on the internet is a sad one. Many of the victims of this type of activity are never aware that it is going on, due to the size and scope of the internet. In turn, sites hosting images have little way to determine what may or may not be stolen. The best thing many sites can do is respond quickly in the event of a DMCA from the owner of those photos.  In that vein, I'd also like to speak to some of the 'the FBI only cares about this because celebs!' rhetoric that is floating around. Due to the public status of the individuals involved here, not only was the theft of the images immediately known, but any followup investigation will be equally well known. I guarantee you that if thousands of photos had been stolen off of private accounts and then sold (or reportedly sold) for large sums of money to others on the internet, the FBI would certainly be involved (although it would get much less press coverage). The FBI isn't having to involve itself because these celebs are somehow more important, the FBI is getting involved because there was apparently a major breech of security and alleged transaction of stolen goods (likely across state lines, which is the FBI's forte)."

Someone would get angry about something someone else did, a mob would form, their address / phone number / real name would be found, and then the target would start getting harassed in real life. This pattern repeated itself so often that we had to make a rule preventing it in response. One important piece of this is that we don't even allow someone posting their own personal information, as we have no way of verifying that the info they're posting is actually theirs. As such, the personal information rule is not something we find to be applicable to this incident. This is a tad extreme, but I imagine if we applied it to images the same way we applied it to personal information, we wouldn't allow anyone to post any potentially private image of themselves anywhere on reddit."

We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. ... Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint. ...   You guys have an identity problem here.  You want Reddit to be a particular sort of site, but you aren't willing to make it that site. Wanting it and wishing for it isn't going to make you any happier when it isn't.

It tries to attract really nice people into administrative jobs, presenting Reddit as a place for gift-sharing and donations and political change, while simultaneously saddling them with a community full of a lot of really nasty content and then tying their hands to do anything about it.

I'm not an expert, but it seems like that would be fairly easy and would remove any chance of reddit hosting copyrighted images."

announcements,2fpdax,kasmackity,3,Sun Sep 7 14:40:53 2014 UTC,"In an interview recently conducted with an ex Reddit moderator, details have emerged that suggests initial speculation on content manipulation within Reddit.com for the purpose of profit for 3rd parties to be not only true, but common place in practice among certain members of its moderation team.  Although the source of these accusations has declined to comment on specific cases of such behaviour, IndieJuice has been informed that content manipulation for 3rd party profit is part of a much larger issue within Reddit’s internal posting and user relationship structure. The extent to which is currently unknown. Original allegations of content manipulation arose from members of Reddit’s own community as part of an online controversy surrounding allegations of nepotism within the video game industry.  Such allegations were dismissed by a member of Reddit’s administration team as the work of another online community, in an attempt to discredit a known games developer, as well as embroil their associates in a sex scandal, by method of an ‘internet raid’.  Given new light on the matter, such claims are only partially valid. While an attempt was made by an alternative online community to influence specific content on Reddit.com, the practice of content manipulation is itself an issue that has been common place on specific subreddits by members of their own moderation team.  IndieJuice’s source on this matter has suggested that moderators on particular subreddits have engaged in the practice of content manipulation to unfairly benefit specific websites, as well as platform favourable discussion for a 3rd party, at the price of ‘luxuries’. All of which remains unknown to the subreddit’s subscribers.  Though the source was unwilling to provide specific instances of such behaviour, examples were given. Trading ‘content flair’ and an ‘ask me anything’, for particular users, was ‘standard’ in a ‘favour for favour’ trade. Though the purpose might vary for a moderator accepting such a request, it was implied that such trades are made at an equal benefit for both parties involved.  The implication of such evidence in the case of pre-existing questions of nepotism raises further concern for the question of corruption within the video game industry. Current discussion on the matter has only ever suggested at the existence of such corruption and has, as such, been limited to possibility.  The form of corruption suggested by IndieJuice’s source is extensive. It is also very particular, in that it extends itself far beyond normal questions of ethical conduct and acceptable practice.  Though IndieJuice is unable to mention further specifics that implicate members of Reddit’s administration team in general, informal, misconduct despite the interview revealing as much, what may be said is that specific moderators are involved in the original controversy of ethical press coverage itself.  The scale of this entire issue has yet to make itself known, though the source did hint at the fact that major video game news sites, and members of their associated press, might also be involved; or at the very least, specific well-known individuals acting of their own accord.  Though the original controversy raised on Reddit focused specifically on a game developer, recent events have caused the entire ethic of journalism within the video game industry to come into question. This also includes quality of content and the nature of favourable reviews in the instance of pre-existing relationships.  Reaction to this issue has been mixed, by those both within the scope of controversy, and those beyond. What may be said is that it is no longer an issue of ‘misogynists’ on the loose in social media, but of the ability of those whom wish to express themselves being able to do so safely.

announcements,2fpdax,treborsel,12,Sun Sep 7 08:29:46 2014 UTC,"This whole conversation is just devolving into ""How about this subreddit I find offensive or objectionable? Why is this not banned? If you're going to ban /r/thefappening then ban all the things!""  If there was a TL;DR for this post, it should read:  ""Content-wise, our stance has been and will be: If it doesn't legally require us to take action, and doesn't violate our own rules, we try not to mess with it. However, in this very extreme circumstance without precedent, a questionable subreddit was BREAKING the freaking site for everyone, so we had no choice but to ban it.""  This is reasonable to me, but people love finding conspiracy where there is none and crying oppression/censorship when that's not really what's going on. Since when did reddit become ""the man?"" We all love this site for its freedom, and it's largely because of the work of the site creators and admins that we've been able to create that culture. Can we not lend them a little credence when they try to explain their actions? As they've admitted, they got some timing wrong, and didn't explain themselves as clearly as they could have the first time. But, again, this situation is without precedent. Honestly, this kind of frank explanation is more than we could expect from the head of almost any company, and I for one appreciate that.   A subreddit got banned in order to protect the site as a whole. Had reddit not banned it they would have had to continue allocating more resources to policing it, which surely would have sparked more outrage as to why effort was being spent on allowing people to keep endlessly mirroring stolen photos. They made a reasonable call they had to make and chose the lesser of two evils. No one's trying to censor or oppress anyone. It's still reddit. Grow up and deal with it.   To the top commenters who are trying to discredit a justified explanation by calling out other subreddits they don't like: So you want an open platform, but when a forum begins to break the foundation of that platform in a way that would harm the experience for everyone, you think that should be allowed to continue? But then, when that platform-breaking forum is banned, you then start witch-hunting other forums you don't agree with out of spite for the banning you don't like - calling for more bans which would then further hurt the openness of the site? Do you see the irony here?"

I expect the leader of my country to make tough decisions, and I expect the same from website admins. I am a pragmatist, and I recognize that situations are fluid while you assess the various options and potential consequences. Your ultimate decision was careful and deliberate.  I think what is sticking in everyone's craw is the feigned morality. I can only assume that such language is there as a cover-your-ass measure for those mining your response for media quotes. Many are quick to latch onto such language and scream that you allow other subs that are much more immoral. As a pragmatist, my thinking is, well, the existence of those subs is not threatening to bankrupt the site at the moment, so we do not have to worry about them right now. More generally, I think that arguing hypocrisy is a fundamentally cheap and valueless argument.   Your job is tending to the going concern of the site. As such, you have to make tough calls when a tough situation arises. The very nature of tough calls is that folks will be pissed no matter what you do. In this instance, I think you have endeavored to make the choice that is best for the ongoing existence of Reddit. Had you stood on some sort of principle and allowed the site to be bankrupted by aggrieved victims of a hacking scandal, then you would have killed the very forum in which folks are currently criticizing your actions.  tl;dr: You made a tough call in a tough situation, and I support your decision."

DMCA notices are a) removing content from THEIR website (as in Reddit was actually posting the infringing image) and/or b) if the websites entire existence was to circumvent copyright protections on software or materials that have copyright protections in place (DVD, software, whathaveyou).  DMCA does not specifically prevent a website from linking to illegal/infringing content, nor is there case law that requires you to remove links to infringing content (like copy written images).  Reddit doesn't host images, or does it? If no, no reason to take down the link. The only thing I can think of is the thumbnail that goes with the link, and if that is the case you remove the image and not the link.  Reddits sole purpose isn't to circumvent copyright protections on materials that have copyright, so no take down.  So, yeah, not buying the DMCA line either."

The community that makes it sees it as two things, the defaults and biggest concentrations of people being one thing, and the small communities being a different place altogether, with different rules, audience, conversations and the like.  By treating all the site as one thing and applying rules that may work well on the huge defaults of millions of subscribers but will only harm the small ones with barely hundreds, you're harming what's probably the best part of the site, the communities that still feel like a community and not a faceless crowd, specially for the veterans among us that have been on the site for a long time  You're doing a disservice to us by treating all of us as one thing.

So, this change really doesn't do anything to bring back the visibility we had before, sure the number weren't accurate, but they were a good indicator of various aspects of how well a comment was going, in the context of that thread and sub.  On a side note, I don't support any kind of ""vote fuzzing"", I think it's deceptive and makes the voting aspect meaningless.

At what point does ""significantly"" kick in?  I would like a decent sense of the numbers involved. Vote fuzzing may not have given an exact figure, but it did give us a decent sense of when something has seen a lot, or a little controversy.

Personally, I think the changes make little sense as they are and - at best - should have been given more thought before they were implemented.

Why are we spending time on features to ""solve the problems"" of the new changes when most people agree that the changes weren't what the users want.  At best, the recent update was a solution in search of a problem- no one asked for them.  I just ask you to consider this: sure, the admins and developers may think this is best; but, the community clearly doesn't and their ad revenue pays for the site.  Why isn't their VERY CLEAR opinion top priority?    Did the previous code base cause technical problems?  That might be worth saying if true.  If not, the only reason to ignore how the public feels about a sudden change without any warning is pride, which is exactly what happened to Digg.  A simple rollback and mea culpa would do more for public clout on this issue than ANYTHING.  Everything else, barring some better explanation as to why this occurred (and no, I don't buy the ""we wanted to solve the 'why was this downvoted'"" explanation- people said it, sure; but no one cared), feels like the admins and developers are being defensive about their code instead of caring about the users of the site."

Please, if there's any way possible to get them back, let us know and I think there'll be enough people willing to do it. Suck your dick? Donate money? What can we do? Please just let us know if there's even a chance of it coming back because honestly it's making me anxious.  Can someone explain to me why the vote was fuzzed in the first place?  Great. Now I put reddit admins in a similar, smaller boat as Comcast and my awesome U.S. government. Everybody hates the system. Big wigs don't care because their data says its better/right. The vast majority is hosed. I've been digging 4chan more recently anyways.  God. Just put the numbers back. Let US interpret the numbers. I'm not interested in your interpretation of my post. I don't understand why this is so hard.  Why can't you just unfuck the site you fucked up?  The fact remains that there was nothing wrong with the old system and you guys are just being a bunch of stubborn dickheads. Fuck this half-assed bandaid ""solution"" to a problem that you guys made, by trying to solve a problem that never existed.  The SS Reddit has a hole a foot wide. Water's already flooding in, and the ship has already started to sink. The captains have to fix it, fast. Their solution? They stick a Band-Aid over the damn thing. And it's not even one of those giant novelty ones, it's just a freaking normal Band-Aid that's gonna get washed away in about two seconds. RIP Reddit.  RIP in peace reddit. ¿|¿'d that for you.  IMO the best move for reddit is to undo getting rid of vote fuzzing. A lot of people, including me, want it back because it told us a lot of useful information, such as if a post with a total score of 2 had one upvote or 100 upvotes 98 downvotes.  More information is always better. Please bring back actual numbers. And stop fuzzing them. I can deal with bots, I can't deal with a site intentionally making itself worse because they fear bots.  Can we skip to the part a week from now when you admit this was all a terrible idea and restore the status quo?  Still less useful. Needs to provide more information. An improvement, but barely. C-minus  A better idea would be to, you know, maybe admit that it wasn't a good idea and go back to the way it was. I totally get wanting to fix the voting fuzz, but maybe try actually just fixing it instead of changing it altogether, then adding little features to the change that makes it slightly more like how it was before the change. That just looks like yall are acknowledging it sucks, but don't want to look like you made a bad change. Change it back to the way it was and no one will be mad. Seriously. We will be happy that you actually listened to the overwhelming majority input and made changes appropriately.  All this work for something you could have easily left alone.  You're lying, and the users who matter are well aware of it.  If this was meant to benefit us users, you wouldn't have done it without telling the community first. Not that we aren't all aware that the previous system was a veil to hide censorship and vote manipulation, but the ""new system"" does nothing to diminish the concern that that threat is growing. The only significant ""inaccuracy"" in the counter was reddit's vote-fuzzing algorithm.  Put it back the way it was, and stop trying to exert undue control over your users. Whatever you are gaining from this ruse is not worth what will be lost by turning the supposedly democratic nature of this site into a joke.  In other words, ""Fuck you all, we know we're right.""  IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT! EDIT: Adblock is back on  Reddit needs beta test servers where they can deploy changes like these and get feedback before deploying them to the masses, it's the only way to prevent a massive backlash (see the response to the last announcement)  Beta environment could be invite only/reddit gold for instant access. Invite all the developers of the addons for reddit to test the changes before they go live and gauge how the users would respond, then make changes accordingly.  Not even close to good enough. You didn't even tell us what the damn threshold is, so that dagger indicator might as well not even be there. This is also far less clear and more confusing than the system it replaces.  You're still skipping the part of this process where you explain and justify the massively unpopular change that led to this whole mess. You can say   > but we still feel strongly that putting fuzzed counts to rest was the right call.    But until you bother to fucking explain your reasons for feeling that to the community, we're going to be upset. You fucked up bad, and this doesn't come remotely close to fixing it.  Why don't you people understand that NO ONE likes these changes? Put it back the way it was, admit you made a stupid mistake, and pray that it's not too late to keep this site from completely going under.   ""DON'T PUSH ME, 'CAUSE I'M CLOSE TO THE EDGE,  I'M TRYING NOT TO LOSE MY HEAD. IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE SOMETIMES, IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW I KEEP FROM GOING UNDER"""

Taking the log of n would be of some use in distinguishing posts with low engagement, limiting the detail (integer or one decimal resolution) would limit the ability of bots to determine how effective they're being in moderations.  As for the issues with smaller subs getting hit by downvote brigades / trolls, giving more visibility on subscribers to mods, limiting voting to subscribers, and/or setting minimum age to moderate, would be useful.  I'd also like for mods to have the ability to override vote-based hiding of comments.  Generally, I think limiting moderation influence, making it an ""earned"" capability (maybe a ""moderator"" badge), and/or discarding low-valued mod actions when more credible mods are available, could be useful.

Why in the world anyone thinks this would be a good change is beyond me.  Edit: To build on this, I'd like to explain how this affects me in a personal way.  Months ago I decided that I was going to teach myself how to use Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Illustrator.  /r/photoshopbattles has been my outlet for that since then.    In the past few months, I have learned a lot and improved my skill quite a bit.  I relied on seeing my upvote/downvote ratio to judge how well I was doing.  In a perfect world, users are supposed to vote based on how well a shop is and not whether or not it made you laugh.  Of course, this isn't always the case as is shown with my frequent Dickbutt shops, but it's still at least a good indicator.    People can point out things I did wrong, forgot, or need to improve on.  I welcome that.  That is what will make me a better photo editor.  Now while people can still certainly do this, removing the ratio leaves me completely in the dark as to how many people enjoy my shops or thought they were good versus those who didn't.  All I have now is a point total that I couldn't give a shit about.  I don't care about karma.  I care about growing as a photo editor because eventually I want it to lead into something substantial and worthwhile.  Seeing a point total is completely meaningless to me.    Recently I did some of my best work with a screencap from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  People loved it.  I had tons of requests for wallpaper sizes and it even became a huge hit in /r/wallpaper.  I can't even tell you how good that makes me feel.  Seeing people enjoy my work is a large reason I stick around here.  When I see downvotes, that tells me there are things I need to improve on.  I no longer have this.  I no longer know what people are thinking about my work unless they say so.  I certainly welcome this but the vast majority of Reddit does not comment at all.  I understand that the votes are fuzzed but like I said, it's still a general indicator.  Seeing people get excited over something I created means far more to me than a point total ever will.  All of this aside, the new system has completely broken the way the weekly photoshop battles work.  The winner is decided solely on the number of upvotes.  Now that nobody can see the ratio, there's nothing stopping from people manipulating the vote so they can be the winner.  This defeats the purpose of having the weekly battle at all.  Downvotes were never counted in these battles but now we will not be able to see what posts are being downvoted."
announcements,28hjga,spacecyborg,25,Wed Jun 18 21:41:36 2014 UTC,"Hey admins,  After waiting a few days to see how this change would work out, I've decided to make a post here.  Obviously there's probably been tons of messages sent to you guys, but I'd like to offer my view on this change (which, frankly, isn't that different than the majority of voices in this thread).  I've been using reddit for several years now, and I like the many communities that are here. Being with a group of people that have similar interests really helped to attract me to the site and to use it. There's also a similar interest and reaction to this post: that mostly everyone does not like this change. I'd like to pick apart some of the points in the announcement. I might overlook some things and some of my comments my not be exactly correct, but as an average user, I feel that this is what some other users might feel as well.   ""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit...   The first sentence is something that I've seen before and after the recent change. Before the change, I don't think I have to give an example of where I've seen these types of comments. Yesterday though, I ran into this comment on /r/NASCAR. The comment is here. Also, that sub has had a downvoting problem in the past in race threads, where comments have gone from 1 point to 0. This change doesn't affect the display of points that a comment has, and, if I guess right, these types of comments will still show up from time to time.  Next are the percentages that a submission shows. Now, I don't mind (and after reading through a small amount of the comments here, neither do a percentage -- no pun intended -- of the users) the hidden amounts of votes that a link/text post shows. However, that number and percent can be easily be misread. For example, this submission has a 50% approval rate with -128 points (let's just say 0 points). Now, I'm going to echo the concerns of comments: how do we know the size of the audience that has read this post? Is it 2 people that have upvoted this and 2 people that have downvoted, or is it 10,000 upvotes and 10,000 downvotes showing that many more people have voiced their opinions than my first example. Other people have also voiced concern over the vote percentage being manipulated and other things, but they're discussed more in depth than I can wrap my head around.  Those are the first two thoughts that come into my mind when I tried to type this out. Obviously, more redditors have more thoughts and concerns regarding this change and may explain things better than me.  I have no doubts that when going through these changes, everyone on the admin team thought that this was a good change. And I can see that. However, not everything works out like it does when first planned. As others have said, this change affected /r/PhotoshopBattles' flair ranking system. Now a user may not get, let's say, a 1k flair because others downvoted their comment.  This isn't meant to be a derogatory comment, and to prove that, thanks for reading this giant block of text. I didn't realize that I have a tendency to ramble on and on and on.  EDIT: Just found some grammar errors. There's bound to be some more in here somewhere."
announcements,28hjga,TheDoctorWho-vian,20,Mon Jun 23 04:23:11 2014 UTC,"Display accurate votes. Block bots with Captchas.  So the problem here seems to be that you have no reliable way to stop bots from manipulating votes.  All the fuzz, all the inaccuracy, all the broken, is just to stop bots from being able to tell if they actually work or not. Because you have no way to stop bots.  So I sat down to think about this problem for a while. Here's my proposed fix.   No more vote fuzzing. No more soft capping. Display accurate tallies of the votes up and down. Score is a straight ups-minus-downs. If you leave percents, make it display both up and down percents. 51% upvoted, 49% downvoted. None of the votes are fake. Each user account has a vote bank. When you first register a new account, you fill out a captcha. This captcha pays one vote into your vote bank. You spend this vote from your vote bank to upvote or downvote a post. This prevents a bot from simply creating eighty accounts and upvoting or downvoting something. A human would have to sit there and fill out eighty captchas, one for each account, to pay that initial vote into the vote bank of each account, which is no different from one human troll going to extreme effort without using a bot at all. When your vote bank is empty, you cannot upvote or downvote posts. Clicking the button will display a captcha instead. Fill out the captcha to pay another vote into your vote bank, which you can spend to upvote or downvote. As an account grows older and you fill out more captchas, admin can be more and more assured that the account does not belong to a spammer or a bot. Older accounts get paid more votes into their vote bank per captcha filled out. Accounts which become bots or spammers and are identified as such get deleted. When they get deleted, their upvotes and downvotes get deleted off other submissions and comments as well, so their effect can only ever be temporary. This makes it unprofitable for a bot or scammer to waste all their time trying to build a credible account. So what a normal user would experience is a brief period of annoyance on their new accounts and on throwaways where they have to fill out one captcha per vote, and then after a month or so of regular non-botlike use, their captchas would generate hundreds of upvotes for their vote bank to the point where they only occasionally have to fill one out at all."
announcements,28hjga,Eltrion,49,Wed Jun 25 20:42:40 2014 UTC,"First, you went and made a bunch of subreddits default against their explicit objections (/r/TwoXChromosomes for example). Then you've gone and and substantively changed the way the voting system works to cries of complete disapproval (that's 100% don't like it, if you're confused). Both times you've acted without a semblance of consultation or openness.   A lot of businesses and websites seem to operate like this--decisions are made, and filtered down--whether or not the users like the changes. Reddit can't afford to act that way, because what you do isn't what makes this site tick, it's the users and the communities that they form that give this website value. Your (awful) decision making skills aren't what bring people here, so when you autocratically swoop in and change things, people are understandably upset. And in this day and age credibility and trust is such a dangerous thing to have sliding out from under you.   Here's what you should do if you want to reverse this very troubling trend. Have every front page sub (or some other amenable grouping) elect a representative who will represent the interests of the users of this site at a quarterly meeting. Have some actual decision making power vested in this group. You don't have to let them run your company (obviously), but putting big decisions and changes past a group of people who have a mandate to represent the interests of the communities on Reddit would go a huge way towards changing the recent perception of Reddit admin team being completely at odds with what the users of this website want. This scheme has actually been tried at least once. And it worked very well.  You need to regain the trust and faith of the users of this website. The easiest way to do that is to put your trust back in the communities that built this place. We know what's best for our communities, you obviously haven't the faintest idea."

We've even come up with a mock-rank system based on users' wins. It's a lot of fun, it incentivizes quality posts, and the subreddit has ended up with some amazing posts from people. This sudden decision impacts a fundamental way our subreddit functions, and will carry with it the need to fundamentally change the way an active, vibrant subreddit with nearly 10,000 subscribers functions.   While I recognize Reddit is run by the admins and you're free to do with the site as you wish, I really would have appreciated the community being asked before the change went into effect, so we could explain what negative impacts there might be that you might not be thinking of.   Worst of all, I don't see how this actually fixes the problem it seems designed to fix.

So far I've done this 8 times, and I think I've only had to sit down with some patience to identify the extent of fuzzing once, when two options were both rated high.  The per-account basis has been working really well for such a small sub, but I feel like people could now more reliably game the system, with a pet sockpuppet or something. Whether they upvote themselves does not matter now, because they can just downvote the competition, and Reddit may be none of the wiser.  I've looked into other ways to conduct a poll, but I don't look for any fixed answer. While there is 1 criteria I look for, the answer can be hundreds of possible answers people could vote for. Google forms may work for this purpose, but there's no real way to eliminate duplicates.

announcements,28hjga,Eltrion,18,Wed Jun 18 20:13:25 2014 UTC,"Alright, so after finally reaching agreement with one of the mods of /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, I have reposted this removed post with changes:  Title: ""Please revert the concealing of upvotes/downvotes""  Contents:   This announcement has officially hit 0, making it the only announcement that has ever been downvoted to zero. It is down from the 1890 points I screencapped it with on June 18th.   With over 9,000 more comments than any other announcement, Redditors commenting on the post have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.  In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes (that could be shown through RES) should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical. It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" from what I have seen, it does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments.   Let it also be noted that this action of removing upvotes/downvotes was done without consulting the user base first. Nor did the announcement ask for community opinion of the change afterwards. This has worried many people. I strongly suggest that the Admins revert this change, at the very least, to restore trust of a considerable number of users who feel disenfranchised. I suggest that the Admins ask the community for suggestions of how to fix the perceived problem laid out in the announcement."

announcements,28hjga,EvilHom3r,19,Sun Jun 29 20:07:09 2014 UTC,"Okay, looking at this from a new perspective. Before this, reddit was a Juggernaut, basically unstoppable. Will it survive this? Most certainly. However, the good will it had is no more. This change was seen by many as a grim spectre of things to come. Currently there is no comparable aggregator. There was no need for one. But now, a lot of more easily disgruntled users are hopping to other aggregators, most notable whoaverse. A week ago, whoaverse was a non-entity, a project by one dude to see if he could replicate reddit's functionality. Now it has a small community all working to refine it. No, it's not ready yet, and Reddit will not fall just for this. But next time you change something against the best interest of your users, there will probably  be several other sites ready to jump in. Reddit survived this based only on size and its relative monopoly, next time it will hurt significantly more.  You better start building up some goodwill to starve off all your newly energized competitors reddit, lest one of them step up to the plate to challenge you as an equal next time you get down on your knees, and compromise your stated values for those advertising dollars.   This isn't a threat, this is dry assessment of what is most likely to happen. This is Internet Explorer 6 all over again. Tread lightly Reddit. I know you won't though. You will screw up again, your market share will fall by more each time it happens, and you will be too blinded by money to see what is happening until it is too late.  In the mean time I will continue using reddit. Inertia is strong and the alternatives are immature. However, I will be monitoring and contributing to up and coming competitors as well.   I implore you reddit! Remember what you once stood for, not so long ago. Make a fool of me. You won't though, this will all come to pass. And when you ask why, we will all point to this thread and laugh at your blindness."

The people running it being disconnected with the users, having no visibility in their decision making, and not having the balls to admit their mistakes and change it back. Users trickle off until there's no point in going anymore. If they had made a poll yesterday asking ""Hey, should we get rid of the ability to see the downvotes and upvotes?"" they'd see the 90% saying ""hell no"" and agree it's a bad idea, who thought of that anyway?   But you know what, reddit relies on us in a very visible way. Reddit gold. There's a counter every day showing how much they need to hit the goals. Finally we have a way to show our dissent in a way that matters. I want to see that bar stagnate, never get to 100% so long as they stick by this dumb decision.

On the surface this is a minor change, and not the end of the world, but there's more too it. Now granted it's not a good change, it has a few problems with it, but it's not horrible. We could have worked through it if it was handled differently. The problem is all the double speak and passive aggressiveness by the admins surounding this whole ordeal. Basically, as far as we can tell, it does the exact opposite of everything they claimed it does in the announcement.  In a sane world, they would announce the change slightly before hand, implement it, ask for feedback, then revise as necessary.  Here they've dropped it in with no warning, then told us they arn't changeing it back, because any reaction we have to it, no matter how rational and well put together, is ""knee-jerk"" backlash. They have heavily implied that they don't care how much stuff they break in the proccess, that's our problem not theirs. Everything we've heard from them since then has been either passive aggressive dismissal of our arguments, uninformed spin-doctoring, or blatent lies.  The breaking of the vote counters is a fairly minor problem that could have been dealt with by now. The much, much bigger problem is that reddits admins are dangerously out of touch with their userbase. (or at the very least Deimorz is. If it's just him though, why haven't the other admins thrown him under the bus and started cleaning things up yet?)

This is the explanation given by mod /u/redtaboo:    This post has been removed, this subreddit is not the place to rant at the admins.   These are the contents of the post:  Title: ""Redditors have spoken - the last announcement has been downvoted from 1890 points to 0 points.""  Text:   This announcement has officially hit 0, making it the only announcement that has ever been downvoted to zero. It is down from the 1890 points I screencapped it with on June 18th.   With over 9,000 more comments than any other announcement, Redditors have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.  In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes that were shown by RES should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical. It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" It does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments.   The Admins of this site can still reverse the change, but damage has already been done. This action made by admins, done without consulting the user base or asking for community opinion, will leave a permanent scar that will not be forgotten. By refusing to listen to their users, the Admins have built a wall between them and their user base.  ADMINS, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.  Revert this change. Listen to your users."

There's a big difference between a post/comment with 2 upvotes and 1 downvote, and a post with 100 upvotes and 99 downvotes. Showing them both as ""1"" is extremely misleading.  While I can understand (and don't really care about) removing the post counts, there is absolutely no reason to remove the vote data for comments. It was never visible by default, someone would have to specifically install a userscript/addon to show them.

A lot of the time, most or all of those upvotes would have been fake ones added by the site. The fuzzing was not only at high numbers of votes, it could start on the very first vote.   You are not fixing anything here, you're just concealing information. The numbers still aren't accurate. I mean, if it's not worth seeing the number of upvotes/downvotes because they aren't accurate, why should we be allowed to see the points we see now? They aren't accurate either. You're not preventing people from asking why their comment has downvotes. Having a downvoted comment and not being able to see any support does not make me ""feel"" any better.  Also, you're seriously going to claim that when I saw an unpopular comment in a small subreddit with 27 downvotes and no upvotes, with 3 comments of negative feedback under it - you are going to claim that the community had no demonstrable effect on that comment? Nonsense.   What you need to do is change things back (to bring back trust to this website at the very least) and then come up with a reasonable alternative to the fuzzing system. I mean, if you think that fuzzed numbers aren't worth seeing, then logically, you should either come up with a better alternative ( I have seen many good suggestions) or we just shouldn't have a voting system at all, which is obviously a terrible idea."

The whole idea of ""Who would downvote this?"" is to spur discussion because the poster doesn't realize what could be wrong with their post.  Reddit has now gone down the path of trying to 'eliminate karma drama', and yet this won't help.  The sheer existence of ""points"" listed on a comment or post, regardless of up/down vote tallies, can still lead to users seeing a 0 or negative karma and not understanding why people would downvote their posts.  Even with fuzzing, you can see activity with regard to a post/comment.  That is important for fostering an environment where discussion and debate thrive, and that's exactly what reddit is built upon.  This was a bad decision, plain and simple."

You tried vote fuzzing as a way to battle them, but that clearly had it's drawbacks...I understand you felt something had to change...however removing the up/down votes altogether isn't the solution. There are other ways to combat bots, you should look into them instead of making the site worse for its users.  That said, not having votes visible for the most popular submissions almost makes sense, but removing vote counts for comments is a monumentally bad idea. Seeing those votes is absolutely crucial for smaller subreddits, and for browsing comments in more diverse comment threads.

As others have said, 1 upvote / 1 downvote is a very different thing than 100 upvotes 100 downvotes.  Also, a 2000 / 100 split is very different than a 20/1 split.  Having a massively upvoted comment is a really neat reward that motivates users with a feeling of great appreciation. ""82% like it"" doesn't have the same impact. I suspect that screwing with this incentive will change the economy of information here in a negative way. It'll feel dead. A musician wouldn't feel nearly as rewarded by ""82% clapped"" than by ""1000 people clapped"". It's like playing to a void. Not getting feedback.  If feedback for vote gaming is such an issue, why not just take a cue from /r/politics and hide scores temporarily, when the submission is fresh? Delayed feedback is still good enough for real users to feel appreciated.  Seems to me like you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

announcements,28hjga,hedgefundaspirations,10,Wed Jun 18 20:46:38 2014 UTC,"Whether you realize it or not, these two changes put together have effectively eliminated any attempt to define up and down votes as anything other than ""like"" and ""dislike"".  First, by focusing not on the votes themselves but ""67% like it"", the direct implication is that votes are based on likes or dislikes.  Of course, this has just about always been true for submissions regardless of rediquette, by the nature of what a submission is, so while it is troubling, it's not terrible by itself.  But you have also revamped controversial sorting. Now, unless you have some kind of AI that reads all the comments and determines that they are controversial, I assume you are doing this by vote counts, and (hopefully) comment counts (and maybe the vote counts on the comments). And the problem there is that the definition of controversial is that something is both liked and disliked by a lot of people, enough that they will argue about it. So once again, the implication is that a vote is for how much you like or dislike the content of a comment, not the validity of the contribution.  Of course I could be entirely wrong about what defines a controversial post in your new sorting method, but I think it's safe to say that lots of people will still make this inference even if it isn't accurate.  On the bright side, most people have been using the downvote button as a dislike button all along, so at least now we can stop pretending and just accept that the lowest scores will be not for the useless posts, but for the unpopular opinions.  Which means you should probably change ""best"" sorting to be called ""most liked"" or ""most popular"".  After all, if I understand correctly, ""best"" has something major to do with the upvote:downvote ratio as well as number of votes (which is great under the old system of rediquette, not so great now that it will just display the hivemind opinion)."

Edit: I'd say a better example is much higher voted stuff.  For example, a +50.  Is that 54 up vs. 4 down, because that's close to unanimous.

announcements,28hjga,GussyH,10,Thu Jun 19 03:23:31 2014 UTC,"never got a response back from my previous message to the admins last week, but sent another one (this one went to /r/announcements mods instead of /r/reddit.com mods). here is the message i sent them    Last week, as I am sure you are away, the reddit admins made an extremely controversial change to how submission and comment scores are displayed, and the community has rallied together demanding these changes be rolled back.  These changes were made last Wednesday, and now, nearly a week later, there has been no official response as to where this monstrosity stands. Are there any intentions to inform the community on where things stand, and if there is any possibility of this change being rolled back, as many people wish to see happen (as evidenced by the first announcement in reddit history to ever end up with negative total score, currently ranking in at roughly -300 points, and almost 15,000 comments, mostly in opposition to the change).  I am aware that the admins have privately mentioned to various users that ""changes are being considered"", but I would urge you to roll back these changes until a proper (and acceptable) course of action can be decided on, and to actually involve the community before making such a fundamental change that breaks core functionality of the website.  My last message to the admins (mod mail to mods at /r/reddit.com) received no response. That message is available here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/cicjwp1  Hopefully the vast amount of negativity surround this recent change is being noticed. If the supposed goal of the change was to make reddit appear less negative, it has been a massive failure. The original announcement asked people to give the change a few days and see if it felt better. It has been almost a week, and it doesn't feel better. Hopefully when that statement was made, it was a sign that the admins do actually care what the community thinks and it wasn't just a pr statement to appear to be open to changing things if the community ended up hating the change.    just like last time, i urge everyone to keep hitting the admin inboxes and voicing your displeasure over this mess. just remember, there is a difference between a constructive message and a profanity driven rant."

I think it's clear that this change has not been received well and it has only left the community frustrated and confused about the change. I don't see how vote fuzzing could have been such a huge issue to result in a drastic change. I'm sure that there was a lot of thought put into this (at least I hope so), but what are those reasons? What exactly does this change? I would have hoped for a detailed ""changelog"" to be released alongside with this change, but instead, this change has just been pushed onto us (Redditors) and given us no choice but to ""see if things 'feel' better"".  TL;DR - Listen to your community. This was handled badly, but you have the choice to fix it by either a) reversing the changes or b) giving a CLEAR definition of what exactly happened, and adjust.  I don't see how the constant stream of people continuing to be voice how they are displeased (old and new users) constitutes as a ""knee jerk reaction"".

With over 9,000 more comments than any other announcement, Redditors have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.  In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes that were shown by RES should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical. It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" It does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments.   The Admins of this site can still reverse the change, but damage has already been done. This action made by admins, done without consulting the user base or asking for community opinion, will leave a permanent scar that will not be forgotten.

Hmm I feel like completely changing the look and functionality of reddit today - just do it dude, no one will care - WTF?!?  Individual subreddits already have the power to hide this and there are very few where this does make sense, but site-wide seems a bit extreme.  The ""who downvoted me?"" posts, will now be replaced with ""why are there question marks for the up/down count?"" - mission accomplished!  Improvements are good, taking things away - not so much.  One of the things that the counts are especially useful for is as a check when considering downvoting - if your reaction when reading something is that it isn't very useful and you see that there are lots of downvotes - you add to the downvote count without a second thought, but if you think something isn't useful and you see that it is overwhelmingly upvoted, you sometimes reconsider your initial thought and find something useful in the post that you may have missed.  Also when the vote count is high for both up and down often is a good indication that the post may be more interesting than others.   These and many other things that may not be obvious are lost when you decide to ""just change"" how the site works."

Yes, it might make sense to the people who run reddit (who are mostly programmers, and programmers tend to think in idealized abstractions) but it makes little to no practical sense. Here's a fundamental question that I haven't yet seen an admin answer about this change: what problem are you solving with this update?  It's an incredibly simple question, and I have yet to see it answered in any way that makes sense to me. Please point to an example, somewhere, anywhere, of the problems you believe that seeing vote counts as causing for the reddit community, and why this problem is so dire that an incredibly unpopular decision like this must be made, and must not now be reversed, despite the outcry.  An unpopular opinion like this must be justified, if for no other reason than because it is so unpopular, and so what justification could you possibly have for making this wildly unpopular decision?  In short: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So tell us what is broken.  I think this is why you see so many conspiracy theorists in these threads: it's not because they don't trust you or because they are offended by you. In fact, to the contrary, they are giving you admins much more credit than you deserve by assuming that the admins, execs, and board members of reddit must not be stupid enough to make such an unpopular decision for absolutely no practical reason, and therefor, they must have a very good reason that they cannot, for some reason, share with us.  But the reality is that there is no conspiracy. This is just an idealistic but wildly impractical (and therefor stupid) user experience design decision."

I'll downvote the person asking if it seems like they're fishing for karma, or I'll explain the fuzzing that's going on if they're genuinely curious (or maybe I won't, but I'll upvote the person who does).

But that's not my main problem. My main problem is Reddit's stated policy of ignoring the users and hoping they just get over it.  I've loved Reddit in large part because it seems to listen to its users and respond to them. The admins are part of the community. This is as opposed to something like Facebook, where it's run as a dictatorship -- the corporate machine is very frank about making the changes that suit their own purposes, and the users are expected to get over it. They have a large enough userbase that even if a portion of it leaves because of the change, it's barely worth noticing.  Reddit seems to have correctly judged that their userbase is large enough to do the same thing. Some users may leave, but by and large this will just be a blip on the radar. I'll probably keep using Reddit myself.  But I no longer like Reddit. It's no longer the cool place on the internet that I recommend to everyone, and would quite happy to donate to if needed.

There's a tremendous difference between a comment with +1/-0 and +100/-99, but now both will be displayed at 1 point with no additional context.  On submissions, this change is almost entirely pointless: If anything, showing an accurate count of points and percentage of likes will allow for more accurate computations of up/down votes. It wouldn't be hard to reimplement an estimated vote count on the client-side.  I also find it strange that the sidebar says ""XX% like this"" when reddiquette says that you shouldn't vote down things just because you don't like them. That wording only reinforces bad voting habits."
announcements,28hjga,TESTlNG,6,Wed Jun 18 20:04:54 2014 UTC,"Ok. First of all, let me get this straight, because there seems to be a lot of confusion about what this is actually saying. The way I understand it is that submissions will not show the number of up/downvotes, but will show a percentage of people who upvoted it, in addition to the total score. Comments will show total score and that's it. Correct?  I'm going to ignore the submissions part of this, because frankly I don't care. What I do care about is the comments.  From reading the comments here, these seem to be the three problems people have with it:   You have no idea how many people interacted with your comment. If you're sitting at 5 points, that could mean four people saw it and upvoted it, or it could mean hundreds upvoted it and hundreds downvoted it. There's no way to tell the difference. You have no idea what the general reception was. As people have pointed out, a comment with (6|1) is very different than a comment with (1006|1001). Some people use the voting system for other things, such as polls or voting in contests.   The solution for point 2 is quite obvious: Put a percentage on the comments as well. A comment with (6|1) would show 86% and a comment with (1006|1001) would show 50%. When I first read this post, this is what I thought it meant, and I didn't think it was absolutely horrible.  The solution for point 1 is quite simple as well, something I found while reading through this thread: Show a fuzzed total number of votes. A comment with (6|1) would show something like <10, whereas a comment with (1006|1001) would show something like >1000 or >2000.  The third problem I don't really have a good solution for. I guess you could maybe implement a new kind of ""poll"" post in addition to links and selfposts. Or you could maybe allow mods to see the total number of votes, so they can use that to see the winner. Neither of these are great, though.  But in the end, that's an awful lot of work to put in just to remedy this one change. The much easier option would be to just put back the numbers. Personally I think something like these suggestions would be better (otherwise I wouldn't have taken the time to write them down), but either way would be fine by me. The way it is now, where you just see the total score, is not."

It's not like people are leaving the community in droves.  The open nature of the numbers--even if they are a bit innacurate--is an important differentiator from other community sites on the internet. Once people get the gist of how the numbers are working, and especially once they know about the vote fuzzing thing, it gets them even more involved. It helps us feel like this is 'our' site. I click the upvote button and actually see my little contribution increase the rating. It makes my vote feel like it's mine and it matters--even if it doesn't so much. As far as loyalty is concerned, it's the feeling that's important.  This change will make it easier for new users, but it's also going to make it more like all the other sites out there. I'm guessing It's also probably going to reduce the amount of Reddit gold given. People like to like things other people like. I'm more likely to give gold on a post that I see is widely appreciated by everyone. If I gave gold only when something specifically struck me, I'd probably never give gold. I need to see just how much everyone else loves what they said.  I'm going to stick around. But my guess is that without being able to see the votes, I'm going to start feeling lost and I'm probably going to stop voting. And differentiating reasons for coming to Reddit are probably going to dissipate, and eventually I'll just be going somewhere else that's making me feel at home.  I'm not happy about this change, Reddit. The upvotes and downvotes are a big part of your identity (I'm talking to you, Reddit.

Even though fuzzing was (is?) an attempt to allow newer posts to rise, but in doing so hid the ""true"" number of points on a post, this was okay. Absolutely no one had a problem with it, because we all knew it was a thing. The fact is, nobody is in support of this change, and nobody ever complained about the issue before it, either.   Like so many of my fellow redditors have mentioned, you're killing smaller subreddits, and other subreddits like /r/vexillology, which hold contests based solely on the number of upvotes that a post gets.   And even so, a little warning would have been nice. One of the greatest things a team of admins can do for the people using their service is to communicate with them, and not doing so is one of the easiest ways to get them to leave. Already, people are looking for alternatives to Reddit, and looking into making their own competing website. Is this what you want?  The main reason why I love Reddit is because it is a wonderful forum for discussion, in which you could tell how many people agreed or disagreed with you in the form of clear numbers. If you get a ton of upvotes, keep doing what you're doing. If you get a ton of downvotes, stop. If you get about the same number of upvotes and downvotes (which is the real point of contention here), then it all comes down to how large the individual upvote and downvote totals are in deciding whether people care a lot about what you've posted, or just kept scrolling down the webpage. While I get that your new algorithm accounts for this, you're cutting the head off the entire body of Reddit, because the people who are actually doing the posting and keeping this wonderful thing alive won't know how to do so.   So have a fucking blue ?-vote, admin. This was poorly thought out and horribly executed. I first came to Reddit on /r/mylittlepony, and as my fellow Redditors there would say, it's getting really fucking hard to love and tolerate you."

announcements,28hjga,zoot_allures,6,Fri Jun 20 22:40:03 2014 UTC,"This is not a joke or something i take lightly. The reason I'm writing this is about the recent change in removing the counter for upvotes and downvotes. I know that you guys have thought of all possible outcomes and have already prepared yourself for this 'knee-jerking reaction', but this is bigger than that.  I've personally felt over the last few months that Reddit has been moving more and more in the wrong direction - from mods censoring subreddits to blatant bans on subreddits all together without explanation. Although, through all of that I have been quiet - kept my opinion to myself because I thought that maybe I was being pessimistic and was alone in thinking that. So, I continued browsing and browsing as these changes happened and kept my mouth shut. However, this is the last straw. The elimination of the counter will lead to far worse outcomes and have worse consequences than you're willing to admit.  First and foremost, and what should be notable to you even if you don't care about your user base, is the example of Digg. How much of your users came to here from there in search for a site that didn't mess with things that weren't broken - that didn't do things without explanation or good cause - that came here as a safe haven from that. Reddit turned out to be a haven of close-mindedness in the guise of open-mindedness. The exact same thing as your predecessors.  I don't have all day to type this so I'll touch on my final points before I go. This leaves out the ability for good discussion or knowing whether or not anybody agreed with the guy who has -2 points or if three people just trolled the guy. It brings more lead way for ads and promotions to be brought onto the front page without evidence that vote wasn't manipulated. I'm not too eloquent with words otherwise I'd continue, but I'm not so take that into consideration.  TL;DR : The removal of the upvote/downvote counter was not a good idea."

The only thing this will do is allow groups to pay for content to be pushed to the front page. There will be no way for us to determine if it was legitimately placed there or not, because we have no way of knowing the vote count.  This has no benefit to small subreddits at all, in fact it makes it much harder to feel any sense of community now, it ruins polls and events based on upvotes, and honestly I see no positives added to my reddit experience with this change, only negatives.  This change is a bad idea, plain and simple. You made a mistake, that's okay. But the overwhelming negativity from all of us here should be a clear indication that you made a poor decision. Do we want this site to become another Digg? Why ruin something that so many people considered a huge part of the Reddit experience?  I can tell you right now, I will not ever purchase gold, donate money, or even upvote any posts from this point forward. I will also use adblock, and encourage all of my friends to do the same. This is a protest."

I am aware that in responses to other redditors, you have cited the cryptic ""59% of redditors have upvoted the announcement thread"", and using this to claim that they must support the change.

It doesn't help that there's almost no response from you guys.  I dislike the mod's statement elsewhere that this is just a ""knee-jerk reaction.""  That's dismissive and insulting.  I've seen other changes implemented on reddit that weren't always the most popular things ever, but nothing on this scale.  Personally, I don't care as much about the vote numbers on posts, but the comment numbers were an integral part of my reddit using experiences.  Yes, I use RES, and I think, judging by the comments here, maybe a lot more people use RES than you thought.    I can go to any site and see a stream of stuff, but the comments are where the community happens and the vote tallies are important to that.  Everybody's saying it.  There's a big difference betweeen a 5 point comment that is 6|1 and one that is 1005|1000.  It tells us what is controversial, what is seeing a lot of traffic, it's important for contests, and shows when brigading is happening.  And yes, we know those numbers aren't exact, that they're ""fuzzed"", but it's close enough.  I've been on reddit for over 2 years and finally bought some gold credits last week.  I have always enjoyed using the site and wanted to show my support, as well as have an extra way to show my appreciation to those comments that made me laugh (or to my favorite shops in /r/photoshopbattles ).  Now I kind of regret doing that because, if you don't change this back and you've said you won't, I don't feel like supporting the site any more, and will definitely start spending my time elsewhere.

Now with no way to check up/downs, we have no idea if there are 5 people participating or 100. Wimbledon is coming up really soon and this change is going to make the best part of Reddit for me a worse experience as well as the rest of the users in that group.   I gotta wonder wtf you guys did this and why if you were going to do this you did it in such a terrible way from a PR standpoint. Was it like the person that said this was to stop showing downvotes on Reddit ads claimed? Because if so that really sucks. You could have just disabled votes on ads and left this all alone.

announcements,28hjga,Mach10X,9,Wed Jun 18 20:04:15 2014 UTC,"Ugh. I can't actually believe that the Reddit admins would take away such a vital piece of the reddit experience. I mean come on.. What harm was it doing? Really?  You can CLEARLY see the amount of users which dislike this change, and you can take from that, that the same proportion, if not more, users agree with them.. Oh wait.. YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU TOOK AWAY THE FUCKING NUMBERS!  Jesus Christ admins.  This is probably the worst.. I don't even want to call it an ""implementation"" because it's clearly not. What it is, is a downgrade from what the system used to be. You've single handedly taken away a tool which users relied on. and whole sub-reddits themselves relied on too!  You're going to get a lot of angry users because of this. You're also going to get a lot of pissed off users who decide that they may actually leave reddit now.  Some reddits may even shut down and go quiet. Whilst that's drastic, it's still a possibility, moreso now because of this.  The data wasn't ""misleading""?! People relied on that! People could voice their own opinions on whether or not they liked a post or not! We could see how many people liked it, and how many didn't, and because of that, sometimes it sparked another conversation and discussion to happen under the original comment. That's not a bad things, that's a GOOD thing!  If someone had +150 l -340 then clearly that comment holds the opinions of some, yet others disprove... Well I wonder why? How's about I follow the comments? Well, one users has a valid point responding to that comment, oh wait, that user also disagrees, yet his comment is also valid too.  Now, we can't exactly fucking see whether people disagree or not, and because of that I don't bloody know whether comments underneath are going to side in one direction or the bloody other!  This comment is one in 4889, at the time of writing.. Now I don't even know if people are going to upvote me for this, or downvote me into oblivion, and more to the point, I don't even know if say, 50 people would have liked it, yet 85 people disliked it.  People like to know that they've been supported at least by some, even when they're in times of being disapproved of.  I think you yourselves, are even going to disprove of this change you've so gracefully and quickly you've taken from us.  I mean for fucks sake.. You didn't even talk to the community first to see if we even WANTED the change."

The (somewhat fake) vote numbers gave me an idea of how many people were involved with a particular comment. I've even seen comments with +200-200 which made them very interesting, but now it's very difficult to figure out how controversial a particular comment is. I'd have to sort by controversial and see how far down that comment is to get an idea of the up/down ratio.

One is a simple ""meh"" comment with one or two votes that nobody detests and the other might be a post that answers a real question and has 7 upvotes and no downvotes.  EDIT: Wait, seriously?

I've trusted you guys to not serve flash ads and ads with malicious content and you have yet to show anything that remotely makes me think you have any intention of ever sinking that low.  Bravo to you guys! You've proved that it's possible to have ads on a site without malicious content and once you earn peoples' trust they'll jump through hoops to allow ads to help the site out.

I'm in the online marketing/web analytics world and my understanding is that once a given device is initially associated with a userID, it maintains that association unless you push a new userID to it (such as when a new user logs in).  So if you simply log out, it has enough of a device footprint to continue associating your behavior with the profile you previously logged in as.  Would really appreciate a technical answer on this one, ideally backed-up by Universal Analytics official documentation.  Also, are you passing in a personally identifiable userID? Google explicitly prohibits this:   ""You must provide your own unique, persistent, and non-personally identifiable string ID to represent each signed-in user. This ID is most often provided by an authentication system.""

You know how you can go to your phone settings and see a list of Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts? SD card installs can't do that, because dismounting wipes out all that account info.

announcements,24aevu,NotSafeForShop,2,Wed Apr 30 05:19:39 2014 UTC,"Understood, and I do plan on looking into it - there's a reason I said ""probably not"" instead of ""no""!"
announcements,24aevu,Kentucky6996,3,Wed Apr 30 16:20:07 2014 UTC,Way back in the day my first PC ran on twin floppy disks.  I soon learned that it wouldn't be able to find command.com if I took the disk out.  The same applies to SD cards in mobile devices.  Do you really think redditors are stupid enough to think the app they installed onto 'external' storage will still work without the card installed?  Internal storage is at a premium in mobile devices.  Literally dozens of system apps and services are using it.  Given that some devices might have as little as 512mb internal storage it's a little presumptuous that there will be enough room for reddit as well.  Please give the user the ability to manage their apps for themselves.
announcements,24aevu,Curlysnail,1 point,Tue Apr 29 20:25:45 2014 UTC,"I answered that here. Basically, it's more than just being about not being able to use the app while the SD card is out - it's about the number of settings and pieces that get wiped out from the system when the card is dismounted (including when it's dismounted to connect as USB storage to a PC) in such a way that the data can't be restored without manual intervention on the user's part."
announcements,24aevu,stesch,5,Tue Apr 29 20:42:56 2014 UTC,"Came here to find the usual ""Reddit is evil"", ""Reddit is NSA"" comments. Was not disappointed.   Reddit is going to make changes whether you like it or not. They are being upfront, that goes along way.   I noticed some people questioning Google Analytics, which I can understand. Why not invest in a tool like Piwik which gives you the power of GA but is open source, and the data you collect is yours? (probably cheaper too)"
announcements,24aevu,rexx1,6,Tue Apr 29 18:21:09 2014 UTC,"For the app, we're going with GA because, well, we already use GA on the main website, so we don't have additional privacy implications beyond what is already in place."
announcements,24aevu,bobpndrgn,3,Tue Apr 29 18:25:17 2014 UTC,Makes sense. But wouldn't a tool like Piwik solve more privacy implications than it would create? (Just asking)
announcements,24aevu,canyouhearme,5,Tue Apr 29 18:31:04 2014 UTC,"That's a good question! While it sounds like Piwik would likely NOT create additional privacy problems, it would create additional work to set up. By the same token, continuing to use a product we already use - GA - also does not create additional privacy problems, while not requiring the back-end set-up."

The existing reddit gold features are things that tax the servers more, and it has always been implied that you're paying partly for the extra server usage. As a programmer, I'm fairly certain this feature does not use significant additional resources per user. I understand there's a business need to make reddit gold more compelling, but this feature is just something that would have made sense to have from the beginning.  I think this may make reddit less useful for conversation than it would be if the feature were available to everyone. If I'm writing a comment, and I want to mention someone and be sure they'll see it so they can reply if they want to, I can't just write /u/username.

Could you have a redundant memcached instance which instead of serving pages to the internet serves data to a disk backup, the idea being that when you spin back up the main memcached instances there is something to recover them from instead of having to start them from scratch? Or would that be no better than recovering it from Postgres and Cassandra?  I don't envy your problem; as a video game engineer I have a difficult job but it's one I understand very well. :)"
announcements,n49rw,JonLim,79,Thu Dec 8 03:12:01 2011 UTC,"So, in the end, a big part of the solution is to move a lot of this to Cassandra, which periodically saves a copy of its cache to a disk. Cassandra should be plenty fast for the data as well, once we can get everything upgraded to 1.0. We have a bunch of junk that is stuck on an 0.7 ring, which is quite slow.  Unfortunately we're in the process of migrating things around our Cassandra ring, so we're stuck for a bit :/  Edit: I should also note, we're using memcache for locking. Once we move locking elsewhere, we can be much more flexible with adjusting the memcache infra."

announcements,n49rw,marcman84,5,Thu Dec 8 04:30:37 2011 UTC,"Cassandra is very handy in terms of availability. We can define the replication level of our data, and we can define the consistency level we want to read/write our data at.  For example, our replication factor(RF) is set to 3, meaning that every piece of data is replicated to 3 machines. When we write out data, we ask for QUORUM level consistency, meaning that the data is written to to at least RF/2 + 1 nodes before the write command is returned.  Additionally, Cassandra supports more complex replication placement strategies. If we were to split our Cassandra cluster into two separate, geographically distant locations, we can define a placement strategy that ensures data integrity without bumping into latency heavily. In this case, we can write out using LOCAL_QUORUM, meaning that the write ensures that it has quorum before it returns, but only in the local datacenter. I should note that even though the writes are set to QUORUM, Cassandra ensures that they are eventually replicated everywhere. QUORUM write just defines what Cassandra will guarantee before returning a request."

announcements,n49rw,sje46,3,Thu Dec 8 04:41:44 2011 UTC,Reads/writes to Cassandra are actually quite fast. The reason it is slow for us is we are stuck on an old version of the ring which we are working on migrating off of.

Instead of interpreting things like ""memcached"" as ""memory cache daemon"", it is more natural to interpret them as ""memory cached"", which makes no real sense.  This leads to real confusion when people use phrases like ""to restart each of our memcached instances"", which sounds like ""to restart each of our instances that are memcached"", but in fact means ""to restart each of our memcache-daemon instances"".

announcements,n49rw,KeytarVillain,2,Thu Dec 8 06:20:20 2011 UTC,"Architectural suggestion: Deploy two clusters of memcached servers (I don't know the technical specifics on how it works, but I'm assuming you can group them together in serverfarms or something similar), and deploy these as virtual machines on ESX hosts, two per box. Set affinity rules in VMware so that each ESX host is running one VM in cluster A, and one VM in cluster B. Only allow two VMs per ESX host.  Now my thought is that since VMware does transparent page sharing, assuming that both VMs have similar memcached RAM caches, you can have both VMs using the same memory for the cache. This means that you can theoretically use the same bare metal hardware you have now, but have twice as many memcached servers. You can individually reload an entire single cluster, but still have 50% of your memcached servers up, and since you've oversubscribed the existing ones, 50% of the future state is actually 100% of your current state.  Wait... I don't know if this actually solves anything, but I already typed this all out and it seems like it would be wasteful to select+A, delete, so I'll just post it anyway and see how people reply.

I'm frantically waiting to hear back from a DBA specialist while they look at a server that went down earlier and took down production across three multimillion dollar manufacturing facilities. The reason? A database had to be restarted and didn't want to come back up. Sure, we have backups, but erasing 18 hours of production would fuck things up more than not being able to ship for a few hours. It's a proprietary database format too because my predecessors just kind of said ""what the fuck, why not?"" and management has a largely ""leave it alone until it breaks, then it's your fault for not upgrading it already with the money we didn't give you"" mentality.

Edit:  I've sent an email to the television station whose content Smith is streaming inquiring whether he has permission to do so and tipping them off to the hypocrisy angle if not.    With some help from IronHymen, bestnottosay, groovitude, and darthcorvus, I've gone through the list.  Many of the ones I've marked ""y"" have multiple other infringing videos.  If you want to join in, look through the ones I've marked ""n""; my searches have been fairly cursory.  Some of them don't seem to have any videos up, though, and some of them only have C-SPAN videos (which they are allowed to use).  Now, I'll try to contact local media in their area to get them interested in the hypocrisy angle.  If you are a reporter or work for an anti-SOPA organization and want to take over from me at some point, leave a comment or PM me.  If you want to take your own congressperson, please leave a note saying who you've contacted about it.

I love you EFF!  And a reminder, to take action go to sendwrite, american censorship, or wired for change.  ** IMPORTANT EDIT:** I've been in touch with a tech news site, who sent the story off to a couple lawyers.  I want to give them a chance to hear back from the other lawyer, but I'm feeling guilty seeing karma rack up without warning y'all: the first lawyer was skeptical that these videos would be criminalized, arguing that the Congresspeople could claim a good faith belief that their uploads were fair use.  I still think the law is awful and the contrast between the Congresspeople's rhetoric and actions striking, but I'm going to wait until I get more information to decide if there's a story here.  ** IMPORTANT EDIT 2:** There will be a story on this soonish (today or tomorrow).  I'm retiring from coordinate letters to local press today, but depending on what the story says when it runs, hopefully we can use it to crowdsource efforts to contact local media tomorrow.  ** Edit 3:** As KB1RMA points out below, ars technica has an article out.  There will probably be another soon.  Based on this, I'm not planning on pursuing this further.  If somebody else wants to, feel free.

announcements,me5e9,Light-of-Aiur,59,Wed Nov 16 09:18:26 2011 UTC,"I'll probably get lost in the deluge, but I'd like to share my email to both reperesentives from Florida who sponsored this bill.   Dear Congressman/Congresswoman _____________ :  I understand you have significant experience in law. As such, you probably thought that the Stop Online Piracy Act you sponsored in Congress was a good idea. It's intended to finally crack down on intellectual property theft, and help to encourage intellectual property holders to continue to create.  However, as someone who is more than proficient in Internet technologies, culture, law, and practices, I fear the bill you're supporting would be a significant threat to everyone's freedoms.  After reading the text of the bill, my understanding of it is that it would not only hold site owners responsible for the content users post, it would also require various internet services (DNS, advertisement companies, and ISPs) to cease all business with and revoke access to sites that are only accused of hosting infringing material. This, I feel, would violate due process, restrict free speech, and cause a significant chilling effect in new ideas/designs.  Please, consider the following: suppose that you and I both own web services. If we are in competition, anything that I can do to get more traffic than you would be a bonus to my profits. Under this bill, the easiest way for me to get an advantage would be to upload my intellectual property to your site (using proper obfuscation technologies, like a VPN or TOR), and then accuse you of hosting illegally obtained material. You, without the benefit of a court to defend yourself, would find your site's name removed from American DNS servers, would lose significant ad revenue, and would be locked out of your site until you could find and delete my material. It would be so easy to repeat that, once you were operating again, I could use the same trick. There would be no defense against this attack, and it would be completely legal. In fact, the terms of this bill are so broad that I wouldn't even need to actually upload my material to your site! I could just accuse you of hosting my material. You would have no opportunity to dispute my claim, and you would have the onus of proof of your own innocence, instead of me having the onus to prove your guilt.  If these two scenarios seem farfetched, I ask you to refer to the recent actions of Warner Bros. They sent false take-down requests to Hotfile, and even used Hotfile's anti-piracy programs to remove protected materials they didn't own.   I assure you, this is common practice on the internet. If all I need to do is accuse you of doing something, and you are assumed guilty until you can prove your innocence, our entire system of justice and due process is undermined.  This bill would also causes a chilling effect on the production of new ideas. If all it takes is one jealous competitor, or one sloppy rights-holder, to permanently remove my ability to produce, I would refrain from doing so.  If you now consider the current system, you'll see that the DMCA has sufficient power to protect ideas. It may have flaws, and its jurisdiction may not apply to foreign sites, but that is the nature of international law. America, though we are a great nation, can neither enforce our standards upon other countries, nor can it undermine its citizens' ability to freely access all material online. However, the DMCA is sufficient to discourage piracy as well as compassionate enough to allow new ideas to come to light.  In conclusion, this bill you have sponsored would not solve any problems, and would only further tarnish America's reputation abroad. We would engage in the same louche practices we condemn China for practicing.  For this reason, I do not support your decision to sponsor this bill. Further, I think that your sponsorship of this bill shames the Democratic party, as well as the great state of Florida. You should be ashamed.  Sincerely,  Light-of-Aiur   I doubt it'll ever be seen by my representatives, but I think I did alright."
announcements,me5e9,holdmystaffer,1220,Wed Nov 16 14:28:12 2011 UTC,"I work in the office of a congressman. There are two ways to get our attention: (1) mass phone calls and (2) form issue mailings.    Phone Calls: Your best bet is to call the D.C. office as they handle more of the policy related matters. When I worked phones, I kept a legal pad in front of me and kept track of the issues that we got a lot of calls on. If an issue got hot [over 25 or so calls], I would let a policy adviser know. I don't know how other offices worked but my Congressman kept tract of the issues that got hot. Here's a little tip for the phone calls though: the person on the other line isn't a miracle worker. No, they can't tell you why the Congressman supports or doesn't support that bill unless the policy advisers have told them to do so. No, they don't care why you think the Congressman is a dumbass for doing this or that. And no, you cannot talk to the Congressman. Keep the call short, tell me which bill you support or don't support, and be polite. If I get three callers yelling and cursing at me and the fourth is polite and thanks me for my time, you can guess which caller I'm going to go the extra mile for. Also, they will usually ask for your name, number, and address before you get off the call. This isn't part of some grand government conspiracy to steal your lunch money. It's so we can keep up to date on the issue. Your info goes into a program which lets us keep tract of constituents by issue so we don't waste our time going through legal pads of caller info when we send out a letter about how the issue got resolved. This program is NOT accessible to the campaign and it would be a violation of federal election law to do so.   Protip: This may get you on a fundraising listserv but calling the campaign office with your policy concerns will ensure the topic is addressed.   Mass mailings. There's a commonly held belief that elected officials give letters more weight than other communication. This is only partially true. Some people send us a letter about every topic that ever crosses their mind. And I mean EVERY topic. If you always write us, we barely pay attention to you after a while. I would say that 80% of the letters we receive come from 5% of the people who ever send a letter to our office. If it's the first time you've contacted the office, you'll get more attention. That being said, when I handled mail, what really got my attention was receiving several form issue letters everyday over a sustained period of time. When I say form issue letters, I mean the things that say ""DEAR CONGRESSPERSON, I [INSERT YOUR NAME] SUPPORT H.R. OVER 9000 AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TOO."" For example, I remember receiving a couple of these form letters concerning the funding of a local military base on a Monday or a Tuesday and basically ignoring it. However, as the week progressed, the number we received went from a couple to several dozen per day. You bet your sweet ass we addressed that issue as soon as we could find a camera."
announcements,me5e9,misterthirsty,297,Wed Nov 16 09:57:08 2011 UTC,"Here is the letter I just sent to my congressman:  Dear Congressman %$#*:  I am writing you today about a provision in the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) introduced on Oct. 26, 2011. It seems to me that this legislation had the effect of creating an American internet firewall, one that could severely restrict the ability of Americans Citizens to access the internet similar to the regressive policies of countries like China. In June of this year, the United Nations declared that access to the internet is a basic human right, and unfettered access to information was crucial in the recent Democratic uprisings in the Middle East. It is very disheartening to learn that the US Congress is considering the restriction of a resource so vast and important that it has completely changed communications, access to informational resources and the expression of all of our freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution.  Specifically, the SOPA does two things that promote the censorship of the internet in the USA. First, it would allow for suspension of service prior to being found guilty by holding any site with user generated content. Currently, websites such as Google, Twitter and YouTube operate under a ""safe-harbor"" provision in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act that, if invalidated, would force these sites to suspend user access before determining whether the users were actually guilty of copyright infringement. This is frankly a usurpation of due process established by the 5th & 14th Amendments to the US Constitution. Second, Section 102 of the SOPA allows for the Blacklisting, by the Attorney General's Office, of any website accused of harboring a copyright infringement, again without the prior establishment of guilt under due process. The ability of a government agency to ban user access to an online site or service without due process is simply a reprehensible act of censorship and nothing less.  Online piracy can indeed be a problem, although in some cases piracy can lead to an increase in visibility for software or an online service that ends up creating more revenue for the developer, artist or creator of the product. The issue of copyright infringement pales in comparison, however, to the idea that American access to the internet could be disrupted, censored or denied without first establishing guilt. Free and unrestricted access to information is the arbiter of a Democracy; restricting the access of American Citizens to the vast resources of the internet in any form goes against the very values enshrined in the Democratic spirit of our Country.  Thank you for your time and service,  misterthirsty"

I am writing to urge you not to vote for the SOPA.  There are plenty of laws already in place that govern the dissemination of copy written material, and we don't need any more. Forcing site owners to police the content of their communities' at the behest of copyright holder will only stem creativity and restrict freedom of expression.   Big copyright holders have pockets deep enough to police the use of their own content. They should adjust their business practices to encourage purchase, and not work to further punish their customers. Instead, SOPA will allow the government to become the copyright enforcement arm of big corporations.  Furthermore, creation of additional governmental entities to support SOPA, should it be voted into law, will only increase the already large burden on the taxpayer. As I mentioned above, existing laws provide plenty of ability for copyright holders to enforce their rights.   SOPA would be an expensive, redundant law endangering freedom of expression, hindering creativity, and putting a non-trivial amount of power over the openness and freedom of the internet in the hands of corporations that do not always have the best interest of the American people as a top priority. I encourage you to vote NO to the SOPA.   Sincerly,"

But they each have provisions on their form that checks if you are even FROM their particular district. If you are not from their district, they ignore the letter and it is instantly deleted. I am from New York, but their web forms are coded to delete my letters because I'm not technically a constituent.  In effect, those who are trying to pass a bill that effects ALL OF US, are IGNORING THE OPINION OF ALL OF US.  Therefor, I post my entire letter here, for anyone else to use. If you don't know what to write, and yet you ARE from their districts, you can use mine:  Hi, my name is REPLACE YOUR NAME HERE. I'm from WHERE YOU ARE FROM. I don't normally write to my congressman, but this is vitally important to the integrity of all that America stands for.  The Stop Online Piracy Act goes way too far, giving too much censorship power to those who would abuse it without any regard to the consequences such as collateral damage that will effect hundreds of thousands of websites. Not just the very few websites that host illegal content, but every single website, even the WhiteHouse.org  Any user could post in a forum, message board, or comment field, a link to a questionable website. If SOPA passes, by law WhiteHouse.org would have to be blocked after an infringement claim.  The very foundation of America is based on free information exchange and freedom of speech. This bill goes against everything that defines America, and it serves nothing but to perpetuate and assist old broken business models that refuse to embrace the internet and adapt. The RIAA and MPAA keep influencing Congress to adapt these draconian measures to help them survive with zero regard for how it effects all Americans.  The Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act has enabled many vital and internet defining websites to function such as YouTube. Without the Safe Harbor provisions, a single bad upload by any user to YouTube could shut down the entire site based off an infringement claim. The DMCA already provides adequate legal means to take down infringing works from a website. This system has worked for over 10 years, but SOPA has measures that will effectively kill the Safe Harbor provisions of the DMCA, which would stifle innovation meaning no more sites being created such as YouTube and Wikipedia, and leading to less job creation in the IT and Web Development fields.  This is the absolute worst bill I've ever seen, and I am appalled that it would even be considered. I am not alone in my sentiment, hundreds of thousands are appalled, and millions of Americans will be stunned if such an act should pass. If you truly care about America and the freedoms we share and proudly show to the rest of the world as an example, you'd know what you must do."

announcements,me5e9,suikoarke,3,Wed Nov 16 21:11:14 2011 UTC,"I just wrote this to my rep, but you're free to use or modify this for your own rep:  I'm writing to register my STRONG opposition to SOPA, the so-called Stop Internet Piracy Act that congress is currently considering. While strongly liberal, I firmly believe that the internet should not be legislated or regulated, unless that legislation or regulation acts to strengthen the freedoms available to citizens who make use of the internet. Privacy, the free flow of information, ease of access, and unhindered (read: uncensored) communications are what make the internet what it has been for the last 15 years: an ever-expanding segment of the economy and an engine of growth and human development.  We only have to look at the last year to see the impact the internet has had. Free flow of information allowed protests in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere to reform if not overthrow despots in their countries, bringing democratic reforms. The internet as it exists today allows genuine democratic action and organization by otherwise powerless people. It literally empowers people with democratic capabilities; self-publishing, organization, privacy, etc. America should not set an example for other nations to follow by restricting internet use for purposes that it deems unacceptable, especially if those reasons are economic--and do some research here, there are very strong arguments to be made that piracy does NOT harm the economy.  Sure I'm paving a slippery slope argument here, but how big of a leap is it for us to say that today we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by allowing piracy, and tomorrow we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by promoting unpopular taxation measures. Will the Occupy websites, on the internet of tomorrow that SOPA would help shape, be censored? The Tea Party's website? Rick Perry's? The internet doesn't kill people, you actually can’t kill people online unlike the real world, it is a unique territory that should be treated as such. The government must keep its HANDS OFF so that humanity can learn how best to use the net going forward, to bring new economic, political, or other opportunities we can't yet imagine to future generations.  I hope that, if or when Congresswoman McCollum has a say on SOPA, that she votes no. Further, I hope she takes a stand before the bill comes to a vote, and that she goes on the record in support of a free and open internet. (This isn't to say that I don't support Net Neutrality, that's an issue of corporations providing access to the internet, it's a simple logical leap to see why I believe they shouldn't be allowed to censor or restrict the internet, either!)"

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. Part of this act would undermine the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, which would make sites like Reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. Holding site liable for user created content essentially dismembers what may be the most culturally significant factor of the internet today. Consider the ramifications if a state such as Egypt had similar provisions and power over the content on the internet during the Arab Spring. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them. This act does not protect online businesses, it shackles them. Services such as Google, Ebay, and Youtube could be held responsible for user-created content. Which is why these California based firms have stepped out in opposition of this measure. Meanwhile, media giants such as Viacom support the measure because it opens up a plethora of potential lawsuits against billion dollar internet-based firms. Protect our California-based internet companies from media giants, and please, help keep the internet a public forum. I urge you to oppose SOPA."

announcements,mdop0,bassitone,7,Wed Nov 16 00:27:19 2011 UTC,"Una sugerencia a los usuarios de Reddit:  Que los que escriban las traducciónes sean hablantes nativos de su idioma ya que sucede que generalmente existen personas que cometen problemas pequeños pero que para un hablante nativo pueden ser vergonsos u objeto de burla. (Ej: Decir ''cerveza es bueno'' es incorrecto, pero decir ''la cerveza es buena'' es correcto)    I think that the people that works in the translations should be native speakers because generally there's people that make little mistakes but for native speakers they can be embarrasing or a reason to laugh.  BTW I don't want to work on translations because I'm lasy sorry :P"
announcements,mdop0,Erynsen,3,Wed Nov 16 00:51:35 2011 UTC,"Native speakers are, of course, preferred. But non-native speakers are still valued, for example, when we don't have a volunteer for that language, or as a way to get preliminary translations done and then have a native simply verify/correct"
announcements,mdop0,RochelleH,5,Wed Nov 16 00:10:04 2011 UTC,"The Dutch translation is awful but can't really be fixed by users. It says stuff like  ""Reden een reddit aan te maken 11"" i.e. ""Reason a reddit to make 11"" of course I don't know what 'reason 11' is so I can't offer you a better translation except tell you that the current one is just idiotic."
announcements,mdop0,psyberdel,3,Wed Nov 16 00:29:32 2011 UTC,The original intent of those strings was for the translator to make up their own reason (there's no need for 1:1 translations on them; just something suitable that sounds good in that language). Funny that the current Dutch translation took that literally.
announcements,mdop0,MollFlanders,2,Wed Nov 16 01:38:26 2011 UTC,"If you really want people to get involved into this, you should do it incredible easy to help. For instance set up a page where you choose a language and then it throws random strings that need translations and a box for writing the translation.  Finally make it export a .PO with all the translated strings that got more than 5 (?) equal translations.  Doing said page shouldn't take long, there are lots of people around here that will volunteer including me for writing it.  tl;dr: if you want people to get involved in a massive way, copy Re-Captcha model."

I'll just quote my comment from here:   What I find disappointing isn't so much the gold people acting like cockmongers today, but the actions of the reddit admins. They assured us that gold subscribers wouldn't be treated any differently before they pulled the trigger on implementing it, yet it's happened at least twice now that I've seen. Perhaps more, I don't know, but these were the ones that really stuck out at me. The first time I saw it was with reddit mold where we were told it would be random, then they admit after the fact it was a gold thing at first (links and context in pic). Then it happened again today with only allowing gold subscribers to login while claiming at the top of their site that it was random. Note that the thread is about only gold users being able to login and Jedberg came in to deny it, then admits to it further down.  I clicked on a gazillion different usernames of people posting during their supposed ""now allowing limited random logins"" and not a single one was a regular user. They were all gold subscribers. So if you're telling me it was random then you're a liar. If you're going to have user tiers, meaning you're going back on your promise to not treat donators/gold people different from way back when, then stop fucking lying when you're caught with your hand in the cookie jar and just fucking do it already. Otherwise just post that you can't allow access to everybody yet and you're using gold users to test things out. Just don't fucking lie and act all ""cutesy"" about it.   EDIT: I apologize for coming across so crass. Definitely could have made the case better, but I was a little pissed."

If only a small subset of users can be serviced, I'm ok with using Gold membership as one of the criteria for selecting the group. But It would be nice if other things are taken into consideration as well, such as number of spammers reported, frequency of votes on new stories, or the average ratio of up/down ratio for submissions. People contribute to Reddit in many ways beyond just donating money. Even if you're not happy with how this was handled this time, you probably should give the admins a pass.

announcements,gg3qv,comment_filibuster,154,Fri Apr 1 04:38:37 2011 UTC,"Slime molds are organisms in two taxonomic groups, the cellular slime molds (Phylum Acrasiomycota) and the plasmodial slime molds (Phylum Myxomycota). Organisms in both groups are eukaryotic (meaning that their cells have nuclei) and are fungus-like in appearance during part of their life cycle. For this reason, they were traditionally included in mycology textbooks. However, modern biologists consider both groups to be only distantly related to the fungi . The two groups of slime molds are considered separately below.  Species in the cellular slime mold group are microscopic during most stages of their life cycle, when they exist as haploid (having one copy of each chromosome in the nucleus ), single-celled amoebas. The amoebas typically feed on bacteria by engulfing them, in a process known as phagocytosis , and they reproduce by mitosis and fission. Sexual reproduction occurs but is uncommon. Most of what we know about this group is from study of the species Dictyostelium discoideum. When there is a shortage of food, the individual haploid amoebas of a cellular slime mold aggregate into a mass of cells called a pseudoplasmodium. A pseudoplasmodium typically contains many thousands of individual cells. In contrast to the plasmodial slime molds, the individual cells in a pseudoplasmodium maintain their own plasma membranes during aggregation. The migrating amoebas often form beautiful aggregation patterns, which change form over time.  After a pseudoplasmodium has formed, the amoebas continue to aggregate until they form a mound on the ground surface. Then, the mound elongates into a ""slug."" The slug is typically less than 0.04 in (1 mm) in length and migrates in response to heat, light, and other environmental stimuli.  The slug then develops into a sporocarp, a fruiting body with cells specialized for different functions. A sporocarp typically contains about 100,000 cells. The sporocarp of Dictyostelium is about 0.08 in (2 mm) tall and has cells in a base, stalk, and ball-like cap. The cells in the cap develop into asexual reproductive spores, which germinate to form new amoebas. The different species of cellular slime molds are distinguished by sporocarp morphology.  Dictyostelium discoideum has been favored by many biologists as a model organism for studies of development, biochemistry , and genetics. Aspects of its development are analogous to that of higher organisms, in that a mass of undifferentiated cells develops into a multicellular organism, with different cells specialized for different functions. The development of Dictyostelium is much easier to study in the laboratory than is the development of higher organisms.  A food shortage induces aggregation in Dictyostelium. In aggregation, individual amoebas near the center of a group of amoebas secrete pulses of cAMP (cyclic adenosine-3'5'-monophosphate). The cAMP binds to special receptors on the plasma membranes of nearby amoebas, causing the cells to move toward the cAMP source for about a minute. Then, these amoebas stop moving and in turn secrete cAMP, to induce other more distant amoebas to move toward the developing aggregation. This process continues until a large, undifferentiated mass of cells, the pseudoplasmodium, is formed.  Interestingly, cAMP is also found in higher organisms, including humans. In Dictyostelium and these higher organisms, cAMP activates various biochemical pathways and is synthesized in response to hormones, neurotransmitters, and other stimuli.  The plasmodial slime molds are relatively common in temperate regions and can be found living on decaying plant matter. There are about 400 different species. Depending on the species, the color of the amorphous cell mass, the plasmodium , can be red, yellow, brown, orange, green, or other colors. The color of the plasmodium and the morphology of the reproductive body, the sporocarp, are used to identify the different species.  The plasmodial slime molds are superficially similar to the cellular slime molds. Both have a haploid amoeba phase in when cells feed by phagocytosis, followed by a phase with a large amorphous cell mass, and then a reproductive phase with a stalked fruiting body.  However, the plasmodial slime molds are distinguished from the cellular slime molds by several unique features of their life cycle. First, the germinating spores produce flagellated as well as unflagellated cells. Second, two separate haploid cells fuse to produce a zygote with a diploid nucleus. Third, the zygote develops into a plasmodium, which typically contains many thousands of diploid nuclei, all surrounded by a continuous plasma membrane.  The cytoplasm of the plasmodium moves about within the cell, a process known as cytoplasmic streaming. This is readily visible with a microscope . The function of cytoplasmic streaming is presumably to move nutrients about within the giant cell.  In nature, plasmodial slime molds grow well in wet and humid environments, and under such conditions the plasmodium of some species can be quite large. After a particularly wet spring in Texas in 1973, several residents of a Dallas suburb reported a large, moving, slimy mass, which they termed ""the Blob."" One reporter in the local press speculated that the Blob was a mutant bacterium, able to take over the earth. Fortunately, a local mycologist soberly identified the Blob as Fuligo septica, a species of plasmodial slime mold.  Another plasmodial slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is easily grown in the laboratory and is often used by biologists as a model organism for studies of cytoplasmic streaming, biochemistry, and cytology. The plasmodium of this species moves in response to various stimuli, including ultraviolet and blue light. The proteins actin and myosin are involved in this movement. Interestingly, actin and myosin also control the movement of muscles in higher organisms, including humans."

announcements,gg3qv,Jorgeragula05,1 point,Fri Apr 1 04:48:20 2011 UTC,"So, people ask, “do Smurfs have… you know… sex?”  The answer is an emphatic and resounding yes! And why shouldn’t they? They’re people, too. What most people don’t know is why Smurfs are blue. Well, the reason is because Smurfs only have sex once a year. Face it: if you had sex only once a year, you’d be blue, too. Once a year, in the Smurf village, flags and banners fly happily in the breeze, proclaiming that the day of the annual Smuckfest has arrived. Birds sing and the Sun comes out to watch, despite the weather-Smurf’s direst predictions. I guess good ol’ Mr. Sun is a voyeur. In the middle of town, Papa Smurf gives a brief speech explaining the origin of the Smuckfest; how Dr. C. Everett Koop came to the village and warned all the Smurfs about AIDS.  Papa Smurf knew that no one made condoms small enough for a Smurf (even though everyone knows that all male Smurfs are uniformly well-hung, for their size), so he decreed that all Smurfs would only smuck one day a year.  “Smucking one day a year will help us identify any diseases we may transmit to one another, and keep them from spreading to the animals in the forest,” declaimed Papa Smurf. “Besides, it will give Smurfette a chance to rest.”  Yes! Smurfette must rest. For, as everyone knows, Smurfette is the only female Smurf in the village, and after a full day of having vigorous, rabid sex with two hundred cunt-crazed little blue men, she needs a break.  So, on the appointed day, Papa Smurf bids everyone throw their  inhibitions to the wind and immerse themselves in debauchery. And, as is his privilege, Papa Smurf throws out the first throe. At his signal, Smurfette unties the skintight blue band she must use to suppress her natural bustiness, and her astounding tits spring forth into the daylight. The Sun gleams lecherously on the smooth, blue flesh, nipples crinkling in the light of day from her soon-to-be-unbridled lust. Then Smurfette shimmies out of her skirt and stands before the crowd, naked as the day she was born, save the spike-heeled white boots she has donned just for the occasion. Her long, blonde hair cascades down her back and lasciviously outlines her buttocks, clinging like a dirty old man’s gaze to each curve and dimple. Her cunt winks lewdly from behind the golden shield of pubic glory, already glistening in mad anticipation of each and every raging rod it would receive that day.  And receive them gladly it would, for hers is the indefatigable furburger, and she hungered for the sauce blended in the heat of passion.  Smurfette turns to Papa Smurf and lifts her stupendous breasts with their turgid nipples to his lips. He takes each one, in turn, into his mouth, where his tongue dances the Fabulous Fandango around the areolae, as Smurfette moans like a cat in heat. Then, when poor Smurfette can take no more, Papa Smurf drops to his bony little knees and sprinkles his magic deSmurfilating dust on Smurfette’s engorged cunt lips. Presto! The lovely blonde braiding material falls from her, leaving her shaved smooth as a hard-boiled egg.  “Oh, Papa Smurf!” she cries. “Encore!! Encore!!” as she writhes in anticipation of the Fabulous Furless Fandango danced ’round her pulsating pussy.  Papa Smurf does not disappoint the damsel in distress; he slides his hands under her tight little blue ass and parts her moistness with his thumbs. As the hot, funky juices begin to run down his arms, he plunges tongue-first and tonsil-deep into her wiggling womanhood. Smurfette gasps as the talented tongue begins to do its magic, and her cunt clutches at it like a baby bird after a worm. Cradling his head to her crotch, Smurfette’s hips begin to slowly grind and twitch, for Papa Smurf’s tongue has unerringly found her S-spot, and Smurfette begins the slow, hot, agonizing rise to ecstasy.  “Oh, make me smurf, baby, make me smurf!” she pants, each stroke of his tongue causing her to throb and clutch.  As Smurfette’s moans and cries rise in pitch higher and higher, the crowd gazes in amazement at the mighty mound of meat struggling to escape from Papa Smurf’s pants. This, then, is the legendary Trouser Titan, bulging forth in a determined attempt to split the barrier. Just when Smurfette is certain that she will die from sheer sensory overload, Papa Smurf flings off his Levis and frees the Magnificent Heat-Seeking Moisture Missile from its cradle. Maddened with blind lust, Smurfette hurls Papa Smurf to the platform and leaps shrieking into the air, landing unerringly on his Titanic Totem. Suddenly filled, Smurfette’s cunt explodes in a monster orgasm, the force of which propels her screaming into the air again and again, each time plummeting her onto the Potent Purple Pecker and triggering another climax.  Before Smurfette can achieve orbit, Papa Smurf grabs her legs and pulls her to the ground. Swiftly, he stands, pulling her to her knees. Gasping in awe, Smurfette gets a head-on view of his hard-on, glistening in the light like a war staff. The sight of this shining stud is too much for Smurfette, who immediately grabs both of Papa Smurf’s bulging balls in her hands and pulls him to her waiting mouth. With preternatural skill and primeval hunger, Smurfette devours the monster cock, licking and sucking like a starving child with an ice cream cone. His ass knotting like a sailor’s anchor rope, Papa Smurf pounds into Smurfette’s mouth with furious strokes. As he reaches his blazing climax, he forces Smurfette to take all thirteen and 7/8ths inches of blue tube steak and fires round after pulsing round of blue goo down her ravenous throat.  “Hurray!!” shouts the crowd. “Now it’s our turn!!”  Suddenly the town square erupts with scenes of azure carnality, as two hundred tiny blue asses appear in the sunlight. Two hundred raging cocks swarm toward Smurfette’s waiting and ever-willing cunt, ready to make her scream for mercy as they scream for more. Four hundred bouncing balls follow each other toward the nearest available orifice, making Smurfette wish there were more of her.  Those lucky enough to find access to Smurfette’s fabulous form begin their crazed humping, as others find their schlongs being stroked as fast as she can grab. Those whose time will come later are coming now, as their friends clutch lustily at their forbidden fruits, flinging frothy fuck-foam far and wide.  Up the ass! Down the throat! Backhand, forehand, underhand, in the armpit or behind the knee, the Smurfs erupt in a display of orgasmic prowess to shame the most devoted student of the Kama Sutra. Soon the street becomes hazardous to navigate (and navigate one must), as the square gets deeper and deeper in the collective come. Hour after hour, the orgy rampages on.  Gradually, as night falls, the screams of orgasmic ecstasy turn to the moans and sighs of deep contentment, with the occasional whimper from an over-enthusiastic sodomite.  Soon all is quiet, as Smurf helps Smurf back to Home and Preparation H.  Tubes of Chap-Stick are quickly distributed to soothe aching lips, and aloe gel is applied (as are lips, if it is too stimulating) to the citizen’s members to ease the burning. As the exhausted (and completely sated) Smurfs lie in sexual stupor, gentle rains come (not them, too!) to wash away all traces of the fleshfest that was. And you wondered why Smurfs are always in such a good mood…"

He had busted his nose playing football in highschool, and ever since hadn't been able to smell anything. Luck him, we thought, because there is some nasty stuff after a hurricane.  Until we got to the moldiest house I have ever seen. About 5 minutes in, Mr. No-Smell starts smelling stuff again...and let me tell you, for someone who just got a sense back, he was not too please about it.  So be careful out there - mold will getch'ya."
