We can help you before the Fatcats return home from their fancy yachting vacation in Monaco.  First of all, turn up the heat to maximum setting in order to cook it faster. There is a little blinking disk in most hallways that will ring loudly to let you know that it's done. I do believe that it's activated by smoke.  Secondly, (and this will be hard to describe to someone who does not understand wealth) there is a proper place where the rich are supposed to defecate.   Located in the very same room where you are cooking the chicken, there's a basin with a water spigot. You may poop into it and then manipulate said spigot to wash it down. There's also a switch near it to grind up your ""second generation food"".  If you are not planning on staying there forever, think of placing your feces into the... uhhh... fridge!

If I'm in a hurry I go for the brown crunchy sugar, because it's harder to mix up with the low calorie ones.  This will give you more than enough calories to walk to the next Starbucks. (It's never far!) And nobody bothers to call the police unless you try to hit the same coffee shop every day.  Now, if you're really desperate you can try this one. Go up to the counter and just ask for a cup of water. They have to give you it for free. Sit down, drink the water, and wait until someone orders a really complicated order. It'll sound something like ""Soy latte with five shots of espresso, 2 pumps vanilla, 1 pump hazelnut, extra hot."" If someone says a lot of words you don't know, watch the person at the counter. If they roll their eyes, you're golden! When they turn around to make the order, dump the rest of the water in a trash can and fill the entire cup with cream. Grab some sugar on the way out too.  This will last you long enough to hitchhike to the next city. I've been doing this for two years. Soon I'll be strong enough to make it all the way to the holy grail: Seattle."

Frugal_Jerk,3ar6vm,icecow,6,Tue Jun 23 09:44:05 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of lentils, you pay me 0.5 lentils for every downvote and I'll get my bot army"
Frugal_Jerk,3ar6vm,judethedude,5,Tue Jun 23 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"Aha, just like a fat cat to make us beg and plead and grant you all kinds of recognition just for a single measly lentil, given to a charity rather than directly to the people in need (so the actual contribution winds up being like a 1/6 of a lentil). You richy rich bougie bigwigs make me sick."

Waste precious calories cracking raw bird eggs into my oft-used Dunkin Donuts styrofoam cup like I'm Rocky Balboa?  I suppose your penthouse on Park Avenue has cooking appliances, too?  Well, maybe we'll all just stop on by after we gnaw on some lentils so you can fry us up some in that cooking oil you're hoarding."
