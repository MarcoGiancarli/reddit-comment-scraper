indieheads,3e3pld,ReconEG,8,Tue Jul 21 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"Review by /u/11trobo  The first aspect you’re going to notice about this album when you load it up on Spotify/iTunes/etc will be the album cover, and to that extent, the album title, The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place. So many albums, especially in the post-rock genre, either cover depressing themes, or just sound depressing. The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place is such a breath of fresh air in the genre because it says exactly the opposite of so many albums before it. On the vinyl pressing of this album, the D side includes the phrase “The Earth is not a cold dead place because you are breathing, because you are listening” etched into it. This phrase rings true throughout the entire album because when you are listening, the Earth is truly not a cold, dead place.  The first track, “First Breath After Coma”, starts this album off with a single guitar playing single notes, almost resembling the sound a heart monitor makes. About twenty seconds in, a drum, somewhat resembling a heartbeat, starts accompanying the solo guitar. At about thirty seconds in, a second guitar joins, and at a minute, a third. The song continues to grow, adding some cymbals and even a rhythm change in the drum, until it reaches its first crescendo. Eventually, the song dies down at around halfway through its 9:34 run time. Then, the singular guitar that sounds ever so like a heart monitor, alluding to the title of the song, makes an appearance again, this time with some other guitars backing it up. That guitar slowly starts to get covered up by its backing guitars, a drum, and even some ambient noise. The song then slowly starts to rise up towards its final crescendo, which is vastly different from its first. Instead of just getting louder and having a more distinct rhythm, this time, the song gets more and more distorted with every second, until at the very end, you can’t make out a discernible tune to it, it’s just noise. This track works so well as the opener, as it sets the tone for the rest of the album. This song is hauntingly beautiful, representing rising hope, thus making it the perfect opener for this album.  One of the things that make this album for me is the transitions between songs. The transition from the last track to “The Only Moment We Were Alone” is so smooth, you wouldn’t notice it changed tracks unless you were looking. Since “The Only Moment We Were Alone” is the longest track on this album, standing at 10:14, it only makes sense that it’s the most drawn out. The song slowly rises and falls just like any other standard post-rock song, but what makes this track stand out is its last two minutes. The last two minutes of this track conclude this song with a whirlwind of distorted guitars and cymbal crashes. If last track resembles rising hope, then this one resembles losing it. The start of the next track, “Six Days at the Bottom of the Ocean”, resembles the soft, melodic guitar playing found on the opening of the first track. I like to think that the first five minutes of the song represent the light reaching the so-called “bottom of the ocean”. It’s the glimmer of hope that you manage to find when you are surrounded by crushing doubt. The last three minutes of this song are some of the most intense in this album, finally adding something else to those three guitars, strings. The strings complement this dramatic crescendo so well because they help build a sense of tension, which I believe this part of the song is trying to achieve. This whole part of the song almost feels like a chase scene, like a man running away from his fears. “Memorial” is one of the sadder moments on this album. The first few moments are so soft and slow, followed by the booming conclusion to this track, you can’t help but feel down while listening to this track.  It’s because of the juxtaposition between “Memorial’s” sadness and slow tempo and “Your Hand in Mine’s” upbeat sound and joyfulness that helps it to work so well as a transition piece.  There are very few songs that I can call a “masterpiece”, and “Your Hand in Mine” is one of them. There is nothing that I can say to do this song justice, but I’ll try my best. The beginning of this song reverts back to the beginning of the album, with a singular guitar cranking out singular notes, but only for a short time. A second guitar kicks in, and then another. For its entire eight minute runtime, these guitars keep a nice, upbeat pace that keeps this song both alive and breathing. The way the drums build from a gentle rattle-roll to thunderous booms and crashes at the end is simply beautiful. The final dramatic crescendo that occurs at 6:17 is a great way to send this album off, bursting into a beautiful guitar melody that brings this album home. The album ends by slowly having the guitars peter off to nothing for a somber conclusion. “Your Hand in Mine” is the feeling of happiness right after at tragic event, it’s the light at the end of a dark, dark tunnel. I like to think that this song says “Don’t be sad about what has just happened, think back to events before that, and just be happy that they happened”. It is after “Your Hand in Mine”, and to that extent, the entire album, finishes playing, you can sit back and say to yourself that the Earth is not a cold, dead place.   If you throw on your standard post-rock station on Pandora, odds are at least 80% of the songs that pop up will be influenced by Explosions in The Sky. EiTS greatly popularized “crescendocore”, or, following the pattern of “rise to crescendo, then drop” many times throughout a song. This style can be found in all works of EiTS’ discography, but I think The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place does this the best. The way this album moves from crescendo to crescendo so slow and deliberately makes it a spectacle in the genre. Unlike so many other albums, The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it in near perfect timing. I think that The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place is one of the essential post-rock albums specifically for those reasons. Its simple to follow style makes it a lot more accessible than it’s more abrasive counterparts in the genre, such as Godspeed You Black Emperor or Swans. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe if you don’t enjoy this album, or anything on EiTS’ catalog for that matter, odds are you won’t be a fan of the post-rock genre.  One of the main themes on this album that I’ve previously mentioned is the theme of hope, both gaining it and losing it. Even though there are many moments on this album that can be classified as sad, the overall theme of hope, combined with the themes of beauty, love, pain, happiness and wonder sprinkled throughout this album are what make this it stand out. Even though this album has no lyrics, I still can’t help myself to imagine it as a concept album. I like to think that this album tells the story of a man whose loved one wakes up from a coma, but only has a short time to live. She eventually dies and the man becomes increasingly angry at the world leading up to her funeral. Eventually, as the last song plays, the man comes to terms with it and looks back on the great time they shared together. This storyline isn’t official or anything, it’s just what I like to think this album is about. In conclusion, this album tells a story, but not in the traditional way. Instead of giving you the words, it gives you the soundtrack that’s playing in the background as the story’s taking place. It’s up for you to decide what that music is backing. It’s because of this that the album can be hard for many to listen to. It can bring up memories of exes, or even passed loved ones. On the brighter side of things, it can bring up memories of time spent with friends, or just a day at peace with yourself. No matter what emotions you feel while listening to this album, it’s because of the fact that these five instrumental pieces can make you feel such emotions, that you are reminded that the earth is truly not a cold dead place."

indieheads,3e3pld,gugs,5,Tue Jul 21 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"No dumb questions here dude. Basically, post-rock uses the traditional rock set-up (drums, bass, a couple of guitars) but is almost exclusively instrumental and really focused on longer, more ambient songs. Explosions in the Sky is probably the best example of the more melodic-sounding side of the genre, whereas someone like Swans is more noisey and abrasive."

There's spots where it sounds really cheesy and/or dated to me. But my main issue was just how disconnected I felt from the music throughout. Definitely felt like something made for people that that will guaranteed love it to love it. Totally don't feel like it's something that is awful and no one should enjoy, as there's a great deal of mastery on it, but it just didn't open my eyes or convert me to this sound or anything like that.   Only gave it one listen though, I don't imagine my opinion will change that much, but I still will give it a few more shots because why not."

indieheads,3e08ac,Bert306,75,Mon Jul 20 23:40:38 2015 UTC,I'll be low-key pissed if we get new Bon Iver before new Fleet Foxes but we'll still have new Bon Iver so I won't be that pissed but still.
indieheads,3e08ac,willforthrill,23,Mon Jul 20 23:56:21 2015 UTC,What?
indieheads,3e08ac,_lucabear,57,Tue Jul 21 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason, Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes are tied together in my mind. Maybe due to the fact that they are both folk music acts that achieved commercial success and underground acclaim and they both have two albums  (each of them having one self-titled) that were released around the same time as each other. I also happen to be a bigger Fleet Foxes fan than Bon Iver so this development just makes me think FLEET FOXES WHEN. But the potential of new Bon Iver is enticing too so I can't really front. Idk."
indieheads,3e08ac,willforthrill,13,Tue Jul 21 00:10:05 2015 UTC,I feel you man.  I got into both around the same time and they were the gateway into indie music for me.  I'll always tie them together in my head.
indieheads,3e08ac,topangapizzy,11,Tue Jul 21 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"Is there any chance of Fleet Foxes making a return? The band seems pretty dead in the water from what I've read, but I haven't followed too closely."
indieheads,3e08ac,jamaicanhopscotch,25,Tue Jul 21 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Robin Pecknold, the singer/songwriter/frontman of Fleet Foxes is currently in college getting a degree.  He's made a couple facebook posts a while ago that hint to there being some sort of project in the future, but it's been pretty dormant for the last year or so.  Which, good for Robin, but it also kind of sucks because I've never had a more hyped album than Fleet Foxes LP3, and I don't even know if it's ever going to happen"
indieheads,3e08ac,Trionout,26,Tue Jul 21 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hah, what a nerd"
indieheads,3e08ac,tru3gam3r,6,Tue Jul 21 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"he's thinking about his future, what a dork"
indieheads,3e08ac,harrythemay,7,Tue Jul 21 13:32:52 2015 UTC,How do you get hyped for an album that has no known recording or release schedule? Genuinely interested because I don't even question or wonder about bands that aren't active (so to speak) so its hard for me to get hyped about any material they may or not may not have made.   Part of this is because many years ago (before they reformed etc.) I was a massive (and still am) Blur fan and would trawl the forums for any snippet of info that placed them together. It was so frustrating when nothing would happen time and time again. It got to the point where I just shut that part of my fandom off and have never switched it on again for any band.   I was a huge Fleet Foxes years ago too but since they've disintegrated I've all but forgotten about them (not their music.)
indieheads,3e08ac,jamaicanhopscotch,7,Tue Jul 21 00:51:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I don't think Fleet Foxes is officially ""over"" by any means.  I feel like Robin is the kind of guy who would let his fans know of something like that.  I'm so hyped probably because I loved their s/t album, and Helplessness Blues is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Probably top 3.  I think it has some absolutely gorgeous songwriting, and it's not often that I connect with an album on such an emotional level.  I think Robin is a consistent enough writer that he could maybe give me another album that I love just as much, and that thought excites the hell out of me"
indieheads,3e08ac,VanillaSweat,4,Tue Jul 21 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"I wonder how they'll sound without John on drums, actually did he leave the band or did he just pursue solo stuff on his spare time?"
indieheads,3e08ac,evacipated,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure he properly left. I couldn't cite an interview, but if memory serves, he either didn't feel like he belonged or felt like he needed to leave to properly pursue his own musical career."
indieheads,3e08ac,jeremydurden,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:15 2015 UTC,he talks about some of his reasons for leaving in his WTF interview with Marc Maron.  If you're a fan of FJM or MM it's worth listening to.  I'm pretty sure it's out there on youtube.
indieheads,3e08ac,harrythemay,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"Do you ever worry that they may come back with a lousy album? I'd happily take Fleet Foxes and Helplessness Blues over something mediocre. Making two amazing albums is easy, its the third one that always stumps indie bands."

QOTSA - Songs for the Deaf  LCD Soundsystem - This Is Happening  Modest Mouse - The Moon & Antarctica  Kendrick - To Pimp a Butterfly  Beach House - Teen Dream  idk man thats just off the top of my head
indieheads,3e08ac,harrythemay,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure I'd consider Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead or QOTSA indie. Anyway, you're probably right but after tragedies like Twin Shadow's Eclipse (and other notable rubbish third albums like The Green Album, Our Love To Admire, Be Here Now etc.) I'm more wary of a band's third album than I am of their second. If their second flops you forget about them but if their second is a massive success there's a massive weight of expectation that, sometimes, the album never lives up to."
indieheads,3e08ac,comedownmachine,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"Really? Cause everyone always talks about the sophomore slump. Generally if you can overcome that, you're probably going to stick around for a while."

indieheads,3e08ac,doedeere,3,Tue Jul 21 05:14:31 2015 UTC,"Me too! I discovered them both at the same time around 2007 with the leak of For Emma, Forever Ago. I was literally twelve and I knew EXACTLY what this was.   Ironically both bands toured Sydney only a few weeks apart, with Beirut smack between them. I was forced to pick between the three (I chose Beirut, for the record)  Pretty keen for new Bon Iver, it's been far too long. I love Justin's side projects but Bon Iver and the thematic fluidity he employs between his records is absolutely immaculate in terms of artistry, and I love the idea of the continuation of a story throughout an series of records. The juxtaposition between For Emma and Bon Iver (warm vs cold / acoustic and stripped back vs. layered and more electronic) keeps me guessing what's to come - I can't wait to see what style he's going to employ on the new record! MUCH EXCITE VERY WOW"

indieheads,3e08ac,funkhouser15,15,Tue Jul 21 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Frontman of a successful band decides to go back to College. You can't make this shit up.
indieheads,3e08ac,willforthrill,14,Tue Jul 21 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's what Rivers Cuomo did after Pinkerton. But whereas Weezer wasn't good anymore hopefully Fleet Foxes will as great as ever."
indieheads,3e08ac,ThisTemporaryLife,8,Tue Jul 21 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Tell ya what, I saw Weezer last night and they slayed, which made me feel mighty confused as to why Weezer is awful now."
indieheads,3e08ac,willforthrill,5,Tue Jul 21 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think by any means that Weezer sold out, I think Rivers Cuomo's songwriting just became less and less ambitious. Which is unfortunate but I'm still holding out hope that they can deliver ONE more worthwhile album."
indieheads,3e08ac,ThisTemporaryLife,11,Tue Jul 21 00:56:47 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue might be that Rivers is writing for the same audience he was writing for when they made Blue and Pinkerton, rather than the same people who listened to those records when they came out. Instead of writing for the 30-year-olds, they're still writing for 16-year-olds - which is not a great way for a 45-year-old to make compelling music. I want the raw, confessional, honest, adult Rivers to make a Weezer record more than anything, because at this point it seems like he couldn't write himself out of a paper bag when 20 years ago he was a goddamn genius.    I also wonder if he's been making middling music for so long because he wants to keep success at arm's length. He poured his heart and soul into Pinkerton, and got fucked by the critics over it. He beat himself bloody over the reception of that record. I just went over to Wikipedia to see what the critics said, and I found these two quotes from Rivers responding to the backlash. This was him in '97, a year after that record was released:     ""This has been a tough year. It's not just that the world has said Pinkerton isn't worth a shit, but that the Blue album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the video. I'm a shitty songwriter.""     This was in 2001:   ""It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front of hundreds of thousands of people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself.""     It took five years for Weezer to make another record after that, and when they returned it was with Green, an album with a few good songs but no real true substance. That was the beginning of the end for them, and it's disappointing.    Rivers can't stop making music, but he's never going to put so much of himself into his music ever again. The thing he doesn't seem to realize is that the confessional, the honest, the raw is what people love about those first two records. So, he makes inconsequential, vacuous records that take no risks and have nothing to say, and if people like that and it sells tickets and albums it's fine, but if they don't he hasn't put anything real on the line.    It's like making a perfect bowl of homemade macaroni and cheese for your girlfriend, with fancy cheeses and bacon bits and all this great shit, and when she tastes it she tells you that it makes her want to throw up. You'll gladly make her mac and cheese again, but it's gonna be Kraft Mac - then, if she doesn't like it, she's not shitting on the fruits noodles of your labor."
indieheads,3e08ac,pure-guava,4,Tue Jul 21 01:16:08 2015 UTC,that's really sad. i think we take for granted sometimes the risk and vulnerability that is required for a musician to make something so personal and authentic
indieheads,3e08ac,ThisTemporaryLife,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly sad. In the wake of the ""Memories"" tour (where they played those two albums in their entirety), Rivers opened up to it a bit after seeing the impact it had on people. I think that's fantastic, considering the disconnect between his thoughts and the thoughts of the fans who had made those records part of their bones. At this point I haven't listened to a new Weezer album since Red, and I don't know if I need to. I just really want him to write from the same place that those records came from again. I don't want another Pinkerton, but I want another record of emotional and honest Weezer songs, because those are the best ones."
indieheads,3e08ac,pure-guava,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:05 2015 UTC,yeah Pinkerton is in my top 5 albums. i just want to give Rivers a hug.

indieheads,3e08ac,RockoBOOM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"If this is some strange sign that he's releasing a new album, I would love it if the album was very much influenced by the production of his contributions to Yeezus. I loved For Emma, but the tracks I've listened to on his self titled just didn't live up to the lofi atmosphere For Emma had (And especially his collab with St. Vincent). Some of my favorite parts of Yeezus were when Justin had the mic, and there was just autotune, delays and anything else just fucking it up in a beautiful way with all the beats in the background. Maybe it's because I really want a James Blake album right about now, but Bon Iver/Yeezus combo for his new album would make it one of the best albums of 2015 for me, or best of 2016."
indieheads,3e08ac,mattyb712,7,Tue Jul 21 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"This seems unlikely... but there was a time when imagining Justin Vernon on something like Yeezus seemed pretty unlikely in the first place, so anything is possible."
indieheads,3e08ac,Erikas_Bulbasaur,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"I agree it would probably be a stretch for a Bon Iver album. Regardless, I would love to see Justin do more hip hop in the future."
indieheads,3e08ac,skymind,3,Tue Jul 21 01:35:03 2015 UTC,I hope you've listened to GAYNGS then.
indieheads,3e08ac,wooden_boy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:34 2015 UTC,and Jason Feathers
indieheads,3e08ac,Erikas_Bulbasaur,2,Tue Jul 21 19:51:18 2015 UTC,I actually hadn't heard of this one. I like it so far- thanks.
indieheads,3e08ac,ChrisChrispie,0,Tue Jul 21 20:34:58 2015 UTC,Oh boi
indieheads,3e08ac,Toastmaster16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"He played new stuff at Eaux Claires so I wouldn't be surprised. I also ran into Chris from Volcano choir at the festival and asked if they were working on anything and he said ""yes but Vern has been busy with Bon Iver stuff"". I'm really thinking there is a new album in the works."
indieheads,3e1cz5,-thomasjefferson-1,10,Tue Jul 21 05:09:54 2015 UTC,Was waiting for the infamous SM3 walk was not dissapointed
indieheads,3e1cz5,dannydlc1023,5,Tue Jul 21 07:05:11 2015 UTC,still don't know how that actually got into the movie. so cringe
indieheads,3e1cz5,snowybrickman,4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:11 2015 UTC,There's also this monstrosity of a scene  Which contains the worst line ever uttered in cinematic history
indieheads,3e1cz5,throwmeout06,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:38 2015 UTC,dear god no
indieheads,3e1cz5,snowybrickman,4,Tue Jul 21 20:11:48 2015 UTC,the hot rod scene synced so perfectly
indieheads,3e1cz5,Awright122,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:50 2015 UTC,I knew you would pick this song before I even clicked the link
indieheads,3e1cz5,Ethanacho,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:57 2015 UTC,What song is it? I just started listening to Tame Impala.
indieheads,3e1cz5,Awright122,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"The Less I Know The Better from their new album, Currents"
indieheads,3e1cz5,flying_dutchman,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"Really surprised you didn`t include this scene, but that was awesome."
indieheads,3e1cz5,daButtah1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:05 2015 UTC,That was awesome! I liked how you timed a bunch of the clips to the music.
indieheads,3e2eos,Snusbonde,10,Tue Jul 21 12:56:23 2015 UTC,My God that's some awful artwork!
indieheads,3e2eos,Alexohmygollypixies,0,Tue Jul 21 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"Fits the song, in that case."
indieheads,3e2eos,number90901,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:56 2015 UTC,Oh ouchhh  I like it!
indieheads,3e2eos,The_Elder_Steak,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:07 2015 UTC,They released a video for this song last week. It's not that fresh.
indieheads,3e2eos,justmikeandshit,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Also it's just a re-recorded version of a song that they released 3 years ago, but with a bridge added"
indieheads,3e2eos,Bobosgenitals,2,Tue Jul 21 21:22:15 2015 UTC,I knew I heard it long before. I convinced my brain that I heard them play it at a show just didn't know when.
indieheads,3e2eos,justmikeandshit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:55 2015 UTC,Isn't up in a format that isn't Spotify?

indieheads,3e0jaj,MusicSillyNills,11,Tue Jul 21 00:50:18 2015 UTC,Awesome
indieheads,3e0jaj,funkhouser15,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:10 2015 UTC,Ya it was a great night to say the least!
indieheads,3e0jaj,L-dubz,9,Tue Jul 21 00:57:35 2015 UTC,Damn I thought I was cool cause last night I saw him after Pitchfork and I yelled 'Yo Mac' and waved and then he waved back.
indieheads,3e0jaj,jordood,5,Tue Jul 21 02:44:50 2015 UTC,I bet you that he gave you one hell of a wave back! The man is so charismatic. How was Pitchfork? I have always wanted to go
indieheads,3e0jaj,RockoBOOM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"Hijacking the post.   I've been going to Pitchfork in Chicago since 2010 and it is no coincidence that 2010 is also the last year I went to Lollapalooza.   Pitchfork does most things the right way. Only three stages, two of which alternate acts every hour and are close enough to each other that one may sit in the middle and enjoy every main act of the day in comfort. Then they throw a bunch of cool, smaller acts on a third stage which has music going close to constantly in a shader part of the park. There are no filler acts EVER. All the stuff they put on stage is worth checking out, and because everything is close together you are able to break away from Caribou to see a bit of A.G. Cook DJing.   Definitely a festival that is curated well, too. Food and beer options are always good, great art and records and books on sale, large areas of shade, lax security, wonderful crowds... Compared to the cluster fuck of Lollapalooza, I give smaller festivals like Pitchfork a huge edge.   The one complaint? Only one place to fill water bottles and the line is always 10-15 minutes, longer during breaks in sets. Other than that, it's pretty darn perfect."
indieheads,3e0jaj,RockoBOOM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"That sounds so great I really should make plans on going. It is also relatively cheap compared to a lot of other festivals.  My only qualm would be that I am not really fond of Pitchfork's reviews but other than that it does some really cool things, especially their interviews and docs."
indieheads,3e0jaj,RockoBOOM,6,Tue Jul 21 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"Reading that last bit where Mac is talking about getting your music out there kinda made me feel something, ya know? It seems so weird to think that Mac Demarco was just another guy doing odd jobs while trying to have a music career."
indieheads,3e0jaj,lafemmedargent7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:56 2015 UTC,Ya honestly because now he is such a big name. I guess it just takes time and luck ahaha
indieheads,3e0jaj,jramjram,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"It just shows that it's like a universal struggle for every musician out there, but the payoff is a beautiful thing. I was listening to your music video, and I kinda like the clean execution the music video has. Overall, the stuff sounds great, so just keep doing stuff. Also, which member of the band are you anyways?"
indieheads,3e0jaj,jramjram,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I threw that video together myself and it turned out surprisingly well haha. Getting views is the hard part! I am the singer of our band. Played a bit of rhythm guitar too for awhile but we ended up getting another guitar player so now I just ""sing"" (its more of a shitty croon if you ask me!) haha. I am glad you liked it though, thanks!"
indieheads,3e0jaj,MarryMe_StVincent,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"I was listening to your title track, and I loved the vocals on that track. About promotion, just find some music subreddits and websites that fit the genre you have and your taste, and post all your stuff there. Some subreddits have feedback threads or they'll just let you post music videos on their page as a link, so go look that up if you really want to."
indieheads,3e0jaj,mtg4l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"Ya I have been posting around on a few subreddits since it came out. I have posted here, and a few other places. We have done some interviews and gotten reviews. We also have some friends in the industry (I played guitar for The Orwells on a song because they pulled me onstage after Matt left the venue, We have played with Criminal Hygiene who we are now good friends with, we know and almost played with Twin Peaks etc etc.) Its just patience at this point and putting on good shows haha."
indieheads,3e0jaj,jamzedodger,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:23 2015 UTC,You can totally tell they are all lovin it from the pics. HA! That's killer.
indieheads,3e0jaj,jamzedodger,3,Tue Jul 21 05:53:42 2015 UTC,Thank god... I felt like such an ass for jumping up there. When I apologized and he said not to cuz it was awesome I felt so relieved.
indieheads,3e2tc1,fluos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"I saw them open for Temples last month.  They definitely have an interesting, dynamic sound, but I thought they sounded better when they played songs that swayed more towards rock rather than electronic music.  Any thoughts on this?"
indieheads,3e2tc1,routledc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"It's quite different from the rest of their recorded work (have you listened to that?), I never saw them live.  I really like how calm and laid back this one sounds..."
indieheads,3e2tc1,routledc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:48 2015 UTC,"I have not listened to their recorded work, but this track reminds me of MGMT."
indieheads,3e33o7,dubshent,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand any of that but that balance was impeccable.   It sounded like they kept saying ""quack quack quack"" during the chorus lol"
indieheads,3e33o7,FyuuR,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:57 2015 UTC,French is mutually intelligible with Duck. Little known fact.
indieheads,3e0k9x,indievidual,9,Tue Jul 21 00:58:06 2015 UTC,Does anyone else just not get the joke half the time or am I just putting too much thought into this
indieheads,3e0k9x,Parkmayn,24,Tue Jul 21 02:43:36 2015 UTC,Might be putting to much thought into it bb
indieheads,3e0k9x,snidelaughter,13,Tue Jul 21 03:04:53 2015 UTC,the key to reaching nirvana is to maintain balance from within
indieheads,3e0k9x,nietzscheispeachy,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:12 2015 UTC,"I think he just expected it to be lousy. Idk why he would think that, though, when Whole Love was Wilco pretty much returning to full form and more recently Tweedy's Sukierae was good."
indieheads,3e0k9x,DannyButler,6,Tue Jul 21 03:18:00 2015 UTC,well you know like it's an album with an arguably gimmicky name they sort of dropped with no hype whatsoever over a decade into their career with their seminal albums long behind them while the frontman's attention has been with other projects so one could reasonably expect it to just be okayish
indieheads,3e0k9x,woohalladoobop,3,Tue Jul 21 11:24:01 2015 UTC,*Over two decades into their career
indieheads,3e0k9x,nietzscheispeachy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"That's true. I know I had no idea what to think when they spontaneously released an album called ""Star Wars"" with a painting of a cat on the cover. I didn't even know they were recording, so I almost thought they they had done it all overnight, or something.  Still, you just can't underestimate the Tweedster."
indieheads,3e0k9x,ShakesJr,8,Tue Jul 21 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, making an album that isn't trying to out-do history can be completely fine. Star Wars does this very well"
indieheads,3e0k9x,admorobo,15,Tue Jul 21 03:51:35 2015 UTC,Fucking nailed it.
indieheads,3e0k9x,PaperCamm,9,Tue Jul 21 02:08:42 2015 UTC,He always does
indieheads,3e0k9x,ubermencher,6,Tue Jul 21 02:24:29 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I'm on my 5th listen, and it keeps getting better everytime"
indieheads,3dyo3r,bikemail,23,Mon Jul 20 16:38:32 2015 UTC,Excited to talk about this album with everyone who withstood the leak. Y'all are stronger than I am  Fatal Flaw SOTY
indieheads,3dyo3r,gugs,16,Mon Jul 20 16:46:35 2015 UTC,(S)HE SAID / (S)HE SAID is for me
indieheads,3dyo3r,mechewstaa,6,Mon Jul 20 17:09:42 2015 UTC,This song is fantastic.
indieheads,3dyo3r,sirernestshackleton,7,Mon Jul 20 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"I mean the whole record is awesome, but that song blew my mind the first time I heard it. In the same way arms against atrophy did when I first heard it years ago"
indieheads,3dyo3r,mechewstaa,7,Mon Jul 20 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"It's damn hard to choose when there are so many amazing songs, but if I had to narrow it down to the best of the best I'd go with Into the Void, Fired Up, (S)HE SAID / (S)HE SAID, More Perfect Union, and No Future Part V"
indieheads,3dyo3r,C34,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:33 2015 UTC,It's all so good ahhhhhhhhhhh
indieheads,3dyo3r,milksteaklover,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Listening to it for the first time now... it is really overwhelming. I love the songs I had heard early (Dimed Out, Fired Up, Come On Siobhan, Fatal Flaw) but some of the stranger ones are gonna take some digestion. I usually love +@'s ""epic"" songs, so I'm sure I'll fall in love with songs like More Perfect Union and (S)HE SAID"
indieheads,3dyo3r,PMmeabouturday,3,Mon Jul 20 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, it took strength to wait for a real release, but I persevered  not just because I couldn't find it"
indieheads,3dyo3r,TheSentientIguana,11,Tue Jul 21 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"My fucking god.  They did it, they somehow topped themeselves and reached some magnificent and glorious heights I never thought they'd reach.  FINALLY A FUCKING INDIE ROCK ALBUM LIVED UP TO THE HYPE"
indieheads,3dyo3r,itssowingseason,28,Tue Jul 21 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"This album is brilliant, be sure to check it out guys"
indieheads,3dyo3r,pxan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:53:06 2015 UTC,Where's it fit in the album rankings? Better than The Monitor??
indieheads,3dyo3r,toke81,6,Mon Jul 20 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"I think so, just barely. The length and the total lack of boringness in spite of that feels a bit more complete(?) than The Monitor"
indieheads,3dyo3r,hobbes96,9,Mon Jul 20 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this is brilliant, brutal, and beautiful. And the awesome self-references, like damn.   Like the song Mr. E Mann is about someone who looks like stickles but isn't him... the E stands for the electric man, which Stickles claims to be.  Then,  ""And it was so great to come under his glittering gaze  He wipes the winter away  See the brave face make all the races wanna say""  Reminds me of the intro to Richard the Third by Shakespeare:  ""Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York"""
indieheads,3dyo3r,Azersam,13,Mon Jul 20 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"This and To Pimp a Butterfly are my albums of the year. It's their best IMO. I loved The Monitor and Local Business is a fine album but TMLT was a listening experience that I will never forget. 'No Future Part V: In Endless Dreaming"" and ""Stable Boy"" are two of the most devastating songs of their career. Seriously, this album has so many highlights that I can't talk about in a single post  EDIT: They're coming to Vancouver in October but it's 19+ and I turn 19 in November. Why couldn't they just push back their tour by a month XD Fuck"
indieheads,3dyo3r,Azersam,8,Mon Jul 20 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"It may be worth tweeting at Patrick or sending them an email about your situation, they might be able to get you in"
indieheads,3dyo3r,ohheykiran,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I will do that!"
indieheads,3dyo3r,evanisonreddit,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth a shot. They played a 21+ show a few years ago in SF when I was 20, so I fb messaged the guitarist and was able to go."
indieheads,3dyo3r,Sonofsnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"I've tried that, and it's rarely (read: never) up to the bands, unfortunately."
indieheads,3dyo3r,lifeinaglasshouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"Why is there a 19+ restriction? I've never heard of that before. 18+ sure, but why the distinction?"
indieheads,3dyo3r,Azersam,4,Mon Jul 20 20:41:41 2015 UTC,In some parts of Canada the legal drinking age is 19.
indieheads,3dyo3r,westthomas,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they're performing in a Club (http://www.biltmorecabaret.com/) and like /u/LIFEINAGLASSHOUSE said, in some parts of Canada the legal drinking age is 19. I went to a Steven Wilson concert 3-4 weeks ago and it was for all ages, lol.   EDIT: I just noticed the tickets for the vancouver show are $15. How is this madness possible? Not that I have any problem with that but it's surprising how ticket prices for a band like Titus Andronicus is so low"
indieheads,3dyo3r,35wedge,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:40 2015 UTC,I think I paid around 11$ when they played with Ceremony at Lees Palace in Toronto right before Local Business came out.
indieheads,3dyo3r,PerryLJackson,7,Mon Jul 20 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"The hype is literally (like, LITERALLY) fucking eating me alive inside. Don't think I can hold out any longer..."
indieheads,3dyo3r,trianglemap,12,Mon Jul 20 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Held out for this. I'm going on a long run later and I'm going to bump it then. Very excited. Very very very excited.  I'm DJing right now for my school's station and I played ""Battle Of Hampton Roads"" in anticipation."
indieheads,3dyo3r,jackieclay,5,Mon Jul 20 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"This is an essential read for this album. Give it a gander as you listen along!  http://www.northerntransmissions.com/interview/patrick-stickles-explains-the-most-lamentable-tragedy/  Also, the lyrics (some even annotated by Stickles)  http://genius.com/albums/Titus-andronicus/The-most-lamentable-tragedy"
indieheads,3dyo3r,mechewstaa,4,Tue Jul 21 13:03:07 2015 UTC,The only reason I've been avoiding this leak is because I've only just begun to listen to them. I'm gonna give myself time to digest The Monitor before I move on to this album.
indieheads,3dyo3r,DisgruntledPorcupine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:05 2015 UTC,Gotta listen to taog too. I personally take that over the monitor any day
indieheads,3dyo3r,The_Elder_Steak,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who thought The Monitor was just a ""pretty good"" album, holy shit. Might be my second favourite album so far this year."
indieheads,3dyo3r,SurrealBrouhaha,3,Tue Jul 21 07:01:04 2015 UTC,"Have tickets to see them in Santa Cruz by myself in a month or two! If anyone is around, hit me up!"
indieheads,3dyo3r,Buffaloxen,4,Mon Jul 20 18:50:09 2015 UTC,Fuck this is a long album. And that's literally the only complaint I have with it so far. (On I Lost My Mind (DJ) atm) Edit: Hoooooly shit the stretch of Mr. E. Mann to More Perfect Union is incredible. I'm melting...
indieheads,3dyo3r,mustachereviews,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:01 2015 UTC,They did a video of that section of the album. Go check it out!
indieheads,3dyo3r,chareth_cutestory66,4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"This has been a hard one to wait on, but I preordered the record, & I'm going to wait to listen to it. I hope it's good."
indieheads,3dyo3r,throwmeout06,5,Mon Jul 20 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's obviously way too early to say this and not have it stamped ""hyperbole,"" but I honestly think this will settle as my album of the decade so far. After like a month with it, I really think it's starting to eclipse The Monitor, which is one of my favorite records bar none."
indieheads,3dyo3r,AmpersandFriends,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:35 2015 UTC,I've never been able to get into these guys- where should i start?
indieheads,3dyo3r,gugs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"As someone else who has never been able to get into them and really felt like they were being overhyped I'd have to say this album is a good start. It's long, but man does it work as a complete piece. I have so far been more invested into listening to this whole album than their other stuff."
indieheads,3dyo3r,throwmeout06,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to really delve into TA, The Monitor might warm you up to their ambition a little bit more than this new one -- it's a good example of how they merge the high-concept approach with really catchy punk. But you could also jump right in with this because it does speak for itself."
indieheads,3dyo3r,gugs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:49 2015 UTC,That's the one i've listened to a bit. I guess i should try again
indieheads,3dyo3r,throwmeout06,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"The new one is a little more...joyful? Don't know if that's the right word for it. Definitely more immediate, if that makes sense."
indieheads,3dyo3r,gugs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:33 2015 UTC,When i listened to them before the closest thing i could compare them to that i enjoyed was something like los campesinos! but way more raw punk style obviously. I'm gonna give this one and the other a go again though because i know how many people love them
indieheads,3dyo3r,bostonbruins922,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think that's a really good comparison to draw. Los Campesinos! are one of my favorite bands, and those vibes might be what I pick up on with TA"
indieheads,3dyo3r,westthomas,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:43 2015 UTC,This album is great! I caved and got it when it leaked but I support TA hard so i will be picking up the vinyl copy and maybe even the CD copy. Really hope I get to see them in Boston.
indieheads,3dyo3r,Street_Legal,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Only band I have ever, and will ever, stage dive to. They just make me so excited. DJ cover is unreal."
indieheads,3dyo3r,Literoy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:02 2015 UTC,So glad to finally see others enjoying this also.  This album has floored me. It's just so raw and beautiful (those strings!). Better than The Monitor and Local Business. Very premature but it's one of my favourite albums ever after a little over a month of listening. Fatal Flaw my SOTY also. Edit: Fired Up is my SOTY.
indieheads,3dyo3r,JerryAsterisk,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"If this is a closer for the band, it's one hell of a fucking closer. For the No Future saga, too. In Endless Dreaming is probably my favorite part of it, gives me such chills. This whole album may be the most ambitious thing ever, here I thought The Monitor was an exhausting listen.

I was suspicious about the whole concept of a ""punk opera"" and was half-expecting something pretentious, but this absolutely rules. Even at its excessive length, it's thoroughly gripping and that's really tough to pull off.   I grabbed tickets for one of their live shows in a couple of months, because I reckon once this gets formally released (and gets the excellent reviews it well deserves) they're gonna sell out their upcoming gigs quickly."

indieheads,3dyo3r,willforthrill,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"This album is really fucking great. One of the best so far this year without a doubt. But the fact that so many of you seem to think it's better than The Monitor (which it's not, to be clear, and it's barely even kind of close) makes it painfully apparent that most of this subreddit was in middle school when the latter came out.   TMLT has immense stylistic range and emotional intensity/depth, but it's also exhaustingly long, Stickles' vocals are COMPLETELY shot and there are definitely a few forgettable tracks (e.g. ""Stable Boy"", which is one of my least favorite +@ tracks of all). The massive Bruce influence can be taken one way or the other (""Fired Up"" is definitely SOTY for me this last month, idk for others), and the more polished sound overall is still a toss up, especially for fans of the first two records in particular.   But The Monitor is already and will remain a modern classic, the best punk album of the last 15 years at least, one worth serious reconsideration for those who felt lukewarm on first listen and one this sub was especially dumb to leave off its essentials list (while also being indicative of the absurd number of flaws in that list as it is, but I digress). The guitars are thicker yet clearer, more vibrant and packed with greater energy and lack thereof, more coherent and thematically intertwined (with recurring riffs/motifs interpolated so fucking well); the lyrics are honestly better (even if less emotionally 'powerful' than those of a man destroyed by his mental demons); the concept just fuckin' works (simultaneously making fun of kids exaggerating the severity of their suburban upbringing yet acknowledging its power as an American myth); its epic tracks (""A More Perfect Union,"" ""The Battle of Hampton Roads,"" ""A Pot in Which to Piss,"" ""Four Score and Seven"") completely dwarf those of TMLT; and ""To Old Friends and New"" makes me want to bawl every time. I don't even know why I'm this frustrated. I fuckin' made a new account to post this after mostly abstaining from indieheads for the last three months. But man, yall rave about The Suburbs and it wasn't even the best album about the suburbs released that year.  Alright, that's good. That's all I really wanted to get out. Fucking love TMLT; even more frustrated by the denial of The Monitor. Listen again, dammit.   Wait also - If you have doubts, a lot of the themes of TMLT are derived from The Monitor as it is, so it'll further your understanding of the former anyway. Stickles went in and annotated the lyrics on genius after the leak, if you guys hadn't seen that yet, which marks the references like a Norton anthology. Pretty chill for having your heart and soul already plastered on a million tracker sites for a month.  And while I'm here ranting, can you guys please recognize that Yo La Tengo has more than just two or three good albums? Jesus they're practically the best indie band of all time, definitely one of the most consistently good rock bands of all time, yet I've maybe a couple times seen anyone mention anything other than the big two from the 90s (while just hopping right over '95) and And Nothing.... For the record I am not from New Jersey. But I wanted to mention them since I only came to indieheads today to see if there was a working link to their new album which had supposedly leaked earlier.

indieheads,3dzd68,The_Elder_Steak,55,Mon Jul 20 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"Madonna and Kanye West.  Think about it. Both start off with a handful of albums that are different enough to stand out (Madonna, Like a Virgin, True Blue, Like a Prayer for Madonna, College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation for Kanye), yet similar enough to preexisting genres that they gain critical raves and broad commercial appeal.  While in their early periods they have a few incidents that they're seen as somewhat controversial (Madonna's wedding dress writhing, Kanye's ""George Bush doesn't care about black people""), they're still mainly well loved by the general public.    Then, both of them release an album that marks a complete departure from style (Erotica for M, 808s and Heartbreaks by K), and while both are successful and critically liked, they turn off some of their fanbase and neither will have the same level of commercial success again.  At the same time, they both become even more controversial public figures and become viewed as monsters by traditional media (due to M's Sex book and K's ""Imma let you finish"").    They then spend the next part of their careers trying to gain back the good will of the public while maintaining that they regret nothing (M sings ""I'm not sorry"" on Human Nature, K's ""screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it"" on Power""), and, after gaining back some good will, (M's Bedtime Stories, K's GOOD Fridays), they both release classic albums that are praised heavily by critics (Ray of Light and MBDTF) and seem to cement their positions as musical greats, even if they're never especially beloved as individuals by the public.  They continue to have reasonable chart success (M had some hits off of Music, K had some big guest spots and a hit with Mercy) and mostly avoid trouble.  Then, everything changes.  Both release albums with almost no chart success and which divide their fanbases further (American Life and Yeezus).  Neither sell all that well, especially when compared to their earlier albums, and another series of incidents around the albums (M's kiss with Britney and dressing as Che Guevara, K's continued rants and relationship with Kim Kardashian) continue to make them seem like public villains and outcasts.  Both of the albums in question are also marked by unusual sound styles and focusing on the respective artist's personal lives, as well as intense messages (M slamming materialism and celebrity on Hollywood and the title track, K slamming continued racism on Black Skinhead and New Slaves).  Granted, Yeezus was much more well liked by critics than American Life, but oh well.  Since Kanye still hasn't released SWISH yet, can't really compare beyond there, though Madonna definitely switched to focusing more on chasing pop trends and largely stopped trying to innovate or stand out, though she definitely still courts controversy.  In contrast, while I don't think Kanye is going to release an MDNA anytime soon and think he'll still try to innovate, some of his recent songs have definitely been on the more basic side (Only One, FourFiveSeconds).  I guess we'll just have to wait to see if the trend continues.   Edit: spelling   TL;DR; When Kanye shouted the eponymous anthem in the ""Bitch I'm Madonna"" video, he wasn't lying"

indieheads,3dzd68,troywww,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:43 2015 UTC,I thought all the albums up till Only By the Night were good and the last two were just ok but with some good moments.   Sex on Fire and Use Somebody are actually pretty good songs but they got so overplayed that I started to get sick of them.
indieheads,3dzd68,diane_young,3,Tue Jul 21 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"Whaaaaat. Humbug is one of my favorite releases by the Arctic Monkeys. I love the psychedelic/doom influence that brought a new sound to the table. IMO if they had continued with the same formula from the first two LP's it would be incredibly stale. Suck it and See was ok, and i didn't care much for AM where it seemed like they used the same ideas on almost every song."
indieheads,3dzd68,LifeInAGlassHouse10,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:57 2015 UTC,"Their old sound would've definitely gotten stale if they continued, it also would seem awkward coming from them once they grew up. It was springy, punkish music from really talented kids pretty much.   I feel like AM is where they actually sound like big, confident badass rockers and the songwriting is excellent. Humbug and SIAS are both quality albums for sure, but they didn't feel as fully realized as AM, in my opinion. Humbug gives off a weird carnival vibe whenever I listen to it, too. I'm sure it was intentional, and I don't think it's bad... just strange."
indieheads,3dzd68,troywww,5,Tue Jul 21 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"Slint and Drive Like Jehu.  Both mathy post-hardcore bands that released two albums, their second being their most recognized."

indieheads,3dzd68,elscorchoo,5,Tue Jul 21 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"Saw this online somewhere and found it interresting. Radiohead and the Beatles discography is very similar from Help to Let it be and Pablo Honey to The king of Limbs.  Help and Pablo Honey are both very poppy and simple but have some great songs and show a lot of things to come.  Then Rubber Soul and The Bends both are still with some straight forward rock driven songs but also has some very good songs and are both very critically acclaimed.  Then the album that changes everything Revolver and OK Computer. They are both masterpieces, and are both considered by many to be the best album ever, they both are pretty experimental and really push the limit of recording.  And when you think they cant top themselves and everybody was talking and thinking about what they can do next they come out with another masterpiece and maybe better then the one that they just put out. Sgt. Pepper and Kid A are  both very experimental and also considered by many to be the greatest album of all time.  Then they both put out a album a couple of months later that are kind of a leftover from the album before. Magical Mystery Tour and Amnesiac are both in a similar style to the one before them but not as good. But still both damn good albums.  Then they come out with a very experimental long album. The white album and Hail to the Thief. Both still very experimental and the band at their best but not often considered their best album.  Then they go a little less experimental and go a little bit back to their rock roots. Abbey Road and In Rainbows are both masterpieces  and are really a mixture of their early more rock songs and their later more experimental songs.  And then Let it Be and The King of Limbs. Both not as good as the other albums and not as well recieved by critics but still is a solid album and have some great songs."
indieheads,3dzd68,john-doe1234,9,Tue Jul 21 10:43:35 2015 UTC,"Well, there's the age-old ""first album is pretty rough, second one is absolutely fantastic, and everything after three is a cash-in""."
indieheads,3dzd68,McCaber,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"One that I always think of is how similar the strokes, arctic monkeys and kings of Leon are in terms of their discographies. All three started out with critically acclaimed indie debuts. Their second albums more or less expand on that sound with similar results. Their 3rd albums completely change up their sound and received mixed reviews."

indieheads,3dzd68,diane_young,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I somehow missed your earlier comment. I love because of the times, probably the last great Kings of Leon album. I don't think it was nearly as big of a departure from their previous sound as First Impressions or Humbug were."
indieheads,3dzd68,Benigans31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:53 2015 UTC,Yeah i still really enjoyed Only by the Night. But the last couple albums have been just ok
indieheads,3dzd68,diane_young,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did the same thing with all artists where I began to put them on such a huge pedestal because of their first three albums that i was pretty disappointed with there later releases. I think i prefer the Strokes later albums compared to the other two where i felt the musicianship and songwriting matured a lot with their third then took a step back in favor of a more ""mainstream"" sound (for lack of a better word)."

Got there and immediately went into a drinking game version of Blackjack. Ate a tremendous amount of fire-cooking hot dogs. Went canoeing after I tipped it over. Got back to the camp, headed inside, drank, lit fireworks which made a beautiful whistling sound, apparently smoked weed for the first time, talked about the Holocaust, cancer, and Carl Sagan, and then proceeded to evacuate my stomach because evil was brewing in there. I passed out when it was dark, and woke up when it was light. Ate some more hot dogs, played some poker, played some Risk, and then drove home alone, listening to Merriweather Post Pavilion for the first time (EDIT: as in my first ever listen of the album) while on the highway and it was GLORIOUS.

Weezer headlined the second night. My friend and I snaked our way up closet to the front, and when I was there, I saw a guy in a badass sheet music shirt. I noticed it said ""Black Lake"" at the top, and I asked him if it was a Bjork shirt. It was, and he got it when he saw her at Carnegie Hall. After a bit more banter I (in a stoned dehydrated filler wrap-up-the-conversation way) said something about the shirt again.    So he says, ""Wanna trade shirts?"" I realize that mine is... fucking a polo from Old Navy, dime a dozen shirt. Turns out, he's totally serious. So we traded fucking shirts. It was gross, it was weird, it was awesome, especially because he was a big guy as well so it was actually my size.    TLDR: It's not that long, just read it man.      Oh, and the festival was wicked awesome. I saw Weezer, Blondie, Passion Pit, TV on the Radio, Buzzcocks, Against Me!, Del tha Funkee Homosapien, BADBADNOTGOOD (who were supposed to play with Ghostface Killah, but he never showed up), Run the Jewels, Terry & Louie (formerly of Exploding Hearts), Alvvays, Thee Oh Sees (whofuckingslayedohmygod), and The Both.

Ought were probably the highlight for me, like I already posted about, but coming in at a very close second was Todd Terje. I was originally planning on going to RTJ, but my friends and I found ourselves on the rail after AG Cook (which was also really cool), and we decided to stay for a few songs. ""A few songs"" turned into dancing wildly for the next ~45 minutes. Other highlights of the weekend included Jamie XX, who did an excellent job of teasing his well known songs by incorporating parts of them into a really well done mix; Mac DeMarco of course, Protomartyr, Shamir, Viet Cong, Perfume Genius, and more. All in all just a perfect weekend for music.  Sadly didn't get the chance to go to the indie heads meet ups, but did get the chance to hang out with /u/lushacrous.

I fucking hate how passive agressive people get over ice cream like go to that frozen yogurt shop down the way its healthier for you and they don't get any business anyway so why are you deciding to wait 15 minutes to wait in line in a tiny-ass shop that (at one point) has 6 people working behind the counter and still can't make a dent in the line because more of you nerds keep filing through the door with your ten thousand kids trailing along and using up all of our taster spoons.

Now that its the summer, I can watch more so I'm bingeing on the famous and underrated stuff in each's discography."
indieheads,3dybsw,OptimalAudio,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"Nice...  I just saw Mommy again and fucking hell...  Xavier Dolan is only 26 and has made 5 really good movies already. He writes, directs, and edits them himself. The level of maturity and cinematic mastery he's displaying at 26 is unparallelled. He shot Mommy on a 1:1 scale. So a square. What he does within the frame of that, is that it throws off the rule of thirds and forces his characters to the center of the frame. For a movie about people who are entirely self-centered is a remarkable act of ingenuity and just ballsy as fuck. Everyone I went to film school with was like, ""Fuck, I wish I would have thought of that.""   He is going to be a household name in a few years time. He fucking should be."

If I remember from an interview with Pitchfork, the songs on that EP were supposed to be on Strawberry Jam but it was a very difficult and time-taking production."

Edit: we're really looking for people who are familiar with the modern scene - I think we have the classics nailed down.  Edit 2: And just a heads up, this is shoegaze - the only straight dream pop is going to be in the influences section.

We will also have a small section of influencers that will most certainly include dream pop artists. I would want to do a dream pop list later on with people who know their stuff."
indieheads,3dymss,Bert306,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"For sure, but will it be like, the extent of shoegaze discussed in /shugazi/ threads or what?"
indieheads,3dymss,clockwork_watermelon,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"We're including hybrid artists like Deerhunter, Alcest, The Horrors, etc. in the discussion on the shortlist right now (in addition to a lot of more orthodox shoegaze stuff), but we'll probably tackle them on a case by case basis. It's something we have to discuss collectively - I personally like the idea of showing a lot of different variations of shoegaze and how it's evolved and been picked up by a lot of different scenes. There are bands from all around the world on our short list too, which I think is pretty cool.  What are your thoughts though?"
indieheads,3dymss,heart_BURN,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:58 2015 UTC,"well I think it's hard to separate shoegaze into a single unifying sound. Take the ""classic"" three albums; Nowhere, Loveless, and Souvlaki. They all have really distinct and separate sounds and were all inspired by different scenes and bands. However, we would all agree that they are, to some extent at least, the definition of shoegaze due to their huge walls of sound, dreamy vocals, and thick guitars (amongst other things). But, for example, Souvlaki is in many ways a dream-pop album, or at least it certainly has all the hallmarks of one. Does that mean we should rule it out of contention? Of course not. Same goes for Loveless and noise-pop; Nowhere and britpop. Even looking to many of the modern classic shoegaze records we see lots of bleeding influence from genres like post-punk (Deathconsciousness), black metal (Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde), electronic (Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts), and even IDM (Velocity : Design : Comfort). For years, the scene has drew heavy inspiration from psychedelic rock, space rock, post-rock, and others and yet the scene still remains distinctly shoegaze. This seems to me because shoegaze is bound more by an attitude and an approach to guitar work than anything else. So my point is, when the genre is so diverse and draws inspiration from so many sources, it's not unreasonable to take albums like Deerhunter's Microcastle and say, ""Yes, they are heavily rooted in dream-pop, but fuck it so was Souvlaki."" I just think a lot of dream-pop etc. is shoegaze in a lot of ways.  Additionally, the fan bases are all but identical. The fans of The Radio Dept.'s Clinging To A Scheme, Candy Claws' Ceres & Calypso In The Deep Time and Beach House's Teen Dream are the same as the fans of My Bloody Valentine's m b v, Tokyo Shoegazer's Crystallize, and Kairon; IRSE!'s Ujubasajuba. So when the same people listen to the same albums and all that separates them are slight semantics, I don't think we should be overly picky. That being said, some stuff that is labelled as dream-pop like Grimes, Chromatics, and The Antlers are so distinct that it would be silly to lump them in. Same goes for noise-pop or else we'd have Slanted & Enchanted on our list. But you feel my vibe?"

indieheads,3dymss,ManlyDrinks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:13 2015 UTC,I totally have had that moment with Past Life but it is a lot like Giorgio by Moroder off Random Access Memories where it is a great song but the story really resonates with you the first couple times but with diminishing returns.

One is that the sound just cycles through decades, so right now 80's and 90's are making come backs, but trends can change so fast that in 10 years stuff might start sounding early 2000's.      My other theory is that electronics start evolving even more to the point where everyones set looks like Fka Twigs on drugs. In the end its hard to even think about what might happen because there might be genres and sounds we could never even fathom."

But yeah, The Holydrug Couple isn't 100% my thing either (except when I'm stoned out of my mind), but I definitely think it accomplishes on the sound it sets out for super well, and is worth having it on the radars of people that are into that sound.  Speaking of recs, do you have GOAT's Commune on vinyl? I'm going to do a giant writeup in the pickups post tomorrow on the like 8+ things I got at Pitchfork over the weekend, but I got the loser edition of it+a limited 7"" and a poster from the Sub Pop guys over the weekend and it's definitely one of the highlights of my haul and one of the best looking records I own now. The SP crew was so stoked that someone was both as aware and stoked on the album as it deserves, so props to you for turning me onto em!"

indieheads,3dymss,kappyko,5,Mon Jul 20 19:31:22 2015 UTC,They usually do it as a publicity event and NPR is a pretty good site with some prestige. You know it'll be treated with respect
indieheads,3dymss,lafemmedargent7,5,Mon Jul 20 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"The labels choose to have it happen, NPR doesn't just go rogue and release random albums. The reason that labels do pre-release streams is because starting a couple years ago, album leaks are all but completely inevitable unless you're going to do a digital-only release. So if people are going to listen to it early no matter what, it builds more goodwill towards the label and how they treat consumers to put it on a reputable site early. And also, NPR is huge and them doing this also ends up turning a lot more people onto the album."

indieheads,3dymss,crustinXbeiber,4,Mon Jul 20 20:08:16 2015 UTC,I am trying to get back into more proggy kind of music and rediscovered Zech's Marquise. I first discovered them while they were opening for RxBandits (my favourite band at the time). There are three non-Omar Rodriguez Lopez family members in the band - and you can definitely tell. The music is kind of a bit more easy going/groovy version of Omar's solo albums. Lots of cool math-psych-improv vibes. Here is their second album.   Another group I am re-familiarizing myself with is Biceratops which is the side project of Matt Embree and C Gak (drummer) of RxB. The duo recorded multiple improv jams and re-cut them to create their only album. I would recommend if you are into RxB or any of the lighter stuff Sargent House releases. They only have one album which you can check out here

indieheads,3dymss,vampire_wkday,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"I went to Sloss Fest in Birmingham, AL this weekend. It was the first year of it and I was actually pretty blown away with how well it was put on. The lineup was pretty solid and I was impressed with the setup. It was pretty cool to see some of my favorite bands from high school who I've never seen before (specifically Manchester Orchestra and Modest Mouse) and some of my favorite bands who I've seen a bunch (like St. Paul and the Broken Bones and the Avett Brothers).   It was also really cool to see a festival like that in Alabama. I know they have Hangout Fest in Orange Beach but that is pretty much Florida and doesn't count. I've lived in and out of Alabama for almost 8 years and have an intense love/hate relationship with it and times like this is when I really love it and have a lot of pride in the state. And then I visit south Alabama and remember why I hate the state.   On a non-musical note I saw a few friends from both college and high school there and it was pretty fun. One of my best friends from high school watched the Manchester Orchestra set with me as we relived our angsty high school memories together. It was magical.   I also went with a girl I had been crushing on for a while during college and thought things were going pretty well. We were sitting together before the Avett Brothers set, completely exhausted and leaning on each other. Somehow she got into a rant about her friend who said he thought some girl wanted to make with him and she was going on and on about how if a guy even thinks a girl wants to make out with him he should just go for it and stop overthinking it. Which seemed like the prefect time to interrupt her and go in for a kiss. But she brushed me off and said we were just pals. Thankfully the show started pretty soon after that but it made things really awkward for the rest of the night, especially considering I crashed on her couch before heading back to South Carolina this morning. Oh well."
indieheads,3dymss,jake_dpp,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Ayy. I'm from Alabama. And I feel you so much. I hate the south generally, but I'm glad when there's good festivals and stuff. Wanted to know how it went, being the first year. It seemed fun based upon pictures I was seeing on social media, and the lineup looked good. I might go next year."

Then Congratulations was alright, some good tracks, wouldn't listen to the full album again. Then their self-titled just got way too fucking strange, and I dig when bands get experimental because I bet MGMT could write some serious trippy stuff.

indieheads,3dwum5,Jd1490,46,Mon Jul 20 04:58:22 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I were gonna see Kevin and the boys play in LA with the Flaming Lips. We went early in hopes of seeing the band hang out in front. Instead, we were asked to leave the area, but we somehow made our way to the back of the venue and went through an open gate. And just like that, we had made our way to the stage. We stood far away, near the mixing consoles in the back, not knowing what to do. The Flaming Lips were on stage doing their soundcheck with Wayne standing out in front. And out of nowhere, Kevin walks up from the side. We notice him, my girlfriend freaks and scares him off. We decided to sit in the front after a while, and then Kevin starts walking around the stage. He starts messing around with the drums for a bit, and starts an amazing jam session with Kliph Scurlock (which I have on video). While all this was happening, we just sat there completely speechless. Wayne walked by us and gave us a nod, and then everyone left. Minutes later, I see Matt and Shiny Joe setup Tame's gear. Everyone then went on stage (except for Cam, he was MIA for some reason). They went through their soundcheck, and at that moment, me and my girlfriend realized that we were literally the only ones sitting down watching. They were playing live just for us. It was amazing. A lot more things happened, but I'm gonna get to the best part. At the end of the show, we were walking around looking for a restroom. We ran into Julien and had a pretty long conversation. Julien is the nicest guy you'll ever meet by the way, he's down to earth and genuine as hell. We thanked him for being kind, and he asked for our names and wrote it down on piece of paper he had. We asked why, and he told us he was gonna put us on the guest list for a show they had the very next day. That was probably the greatest experience of my life. Nothing will ever come close.  PROOF:  https://instagram.com/p/gFSKwcra-m/?taken-by=jdeniz9  http://m.imgur.com/a/xQtIb  There's also proof of Julien putting us on the guest list."

indieheads,3dwum5,art36,17,Mon Jul 20 09:18:21 2015 UTC,"Cool story, but as someone who has worked in live music, sneaking into a sound check could turn into a dick move (especially if you fanboy too much/at all). It's a a space for the artist to get into their routine free of distraction. It's obviously a different story if it's a public sound check for radio winners. Not trying to rain on your parade (seems like the band thought you guys were cool!), but just a heads up to others reading this, if you manage to see a sound check that isn't public, be courteous by being discreet."
indieheads,3dwum5,art36,12,Mon Jul 20 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, we tried not approaching the band as much during sound check, beside the time when my girlfriend freaked.

indieheads,3dx9h9,35wedge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:08 2015 UTC,Like everyone unknown pleasures was my first and favourite joy division album. Closer didn't have the hits (if you can really call a JD song that) and it was less accessible and more experimental with the almost noise rock opening track. But after a while I started to appreciate closer more and now I think it is their masterpiece. Decades has to be one of my favourite songs ever.

Every member of the audience embraced the communal vibe, and the beautiful, beautiful camaraderie held true the whole weekend, because it was true, the substance of 20,000 personalities poured into one through the lyrics of Skinny Love.   ""Music where two rivers come together - a confluence - for what are we but a confluence?""   There it was, the articulation of the energy I had lived within for three days, and the crowd roared in appreciation for the narrator's accuracy. This is a romantic hangover like I've never felt. I want it to be longer, I want to be there forever.   I love people. I love spontaneous music. I love brass bands joining with southern rock, I love angelic voices joining other angels, I love blind soul, I love grooving with the hot sun, I love the tears and the dancing and the smiles.   How can I doubt the world after that? Above the grief and confusion, it is has all the potential to reach a damn-near perfection. It just did, for three days, in the woods."
indieheads,3dwjq3,Snackpax99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree just a little on the communal aspect. Most of the time it was alright. But during Bon Iver (for which I was super far back) there was tons of people just talking and others who looked like they didn't even wanna be there. Killed the vibe a little during that set, but I still sang my heart out during those songs. But I definitely agree with that feeling for most of the bands I saw."
indieheads,3dwjq3,_lucabear,4,Mon Jul 20 16:01:47 2015 UTC,That will happen in the way back. I was kinda far too since we were so close for Sufjan's full set and among the talkers there were still people singing every song.

Bon Iver was fucking insane. That set was unreal and the two new songs just prove to me how truly incredible Justin is as a songwriter. Honestly, I expect the next Kid A to come out of his Bon Iver project. I would talk more about other bands, but I'm still hungover Bon Iver and still driving back to colorado.

indieheads,3dwjq3,frontrangefart,10,Mon Jul 20 16:41:54 2015 UTC,I'm glad someone started this thread.  I've been thinking all day about how special this festival was.  Yesterday was one of the best experiences I've ever had with music.  Elliot Moss was great!  Melt Banana was probably the most wild show I've ever seen. Phox was really heartwarming.  Sufjan was the first performance that ever put me in tears.  I can't even begin to describe that Bon Iver set.   To think this was all put on by a guy trying to bring people together in his hometown is incredible to me.  Everyone I've talked to has said similar things so I hope there's another one next year!  Let's hope they make the shuttle system a little better though.
indieheads,3dwjq3,LilQuince15,3,Mon Jul 20 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"Moss was seriously fantastic...I heard Melt Banana was insane...I'm a little upset I missed it.  Sufjan is incredible, I saw him a couple months ago in Chicago.  Did you stay for his whole set?  I was wondering how good a view the people at his show got for Bon Iver because it looked like the entire field between the stages was packed by the time he was done.  Ya I think they could definitely make some improvements (22,000 people trying to get out that narrow path to the shuttles Saturday was pretty miserable...and it definitely could have used some more shady spaces/industrial fans...) but overall I think it was very well done for an inaugural festival"
indieheads,3dwjq3,LilQuince15,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:44 2015 UTC,"I showed up early for Sufjan to get good spots and I stayed for the whole show because I was only a few rows from the stage. I ended up having a pretty bad spot for Bon Iver, but was no where near the back.  I can't imagine what it was like for some people who were way back there."
indieheads,3dwjq3,_lucabear,2,Mon Jul 20 04:01:48 2015 UTC,Ya I got to Bon Iver's set an hour and half before he started but I was still probably 3/4 of the concrete back from the stage...I looked back during the show and it just looked like there were people watching from a mile away lol

Then we were in the cement area on the left for Bon Iver.  Probably 50 ft from the end of the cement. You just had to push past the buffer of people sitting in the grass, then the cement area wasn't too packed yet.  I thought we had good spots for people who were that close to Sufjan."

It felt full and alive without feeling crowded and overwhelming which is an incredible feat for a festival with over 22,000 people and high heat. Even the best drivers were appreciative of how respectful everyone was.  It certainly was a unique experience. Astronautalis' televangelist confession booth was bizarre and hilarious while the spooky forest trail with its fake windows illuminating like houses in the woods and the pulsing spectrum of lights was so surreal and freaky wonderful (especially after a dab).  No red bull and budweiser advertising. It was nice to see a regional presence of sponsors like Leinenkugel, Summit, The Current. You won't see Bon Iver or Sufjan Stevens at other festivals either.  I'm really hoping they keep this going and are able to keep the same vibe. James Blake would make for an awesome headliner next year and maybe we can hear some Fall Boys Creek Choir. I'm excited for the future."
indieheads,3dwjq3,Snackpax99,7,Mon Jul 20 05:08:45 2015 UTC,"Serious case of the mondays today.  Outside of the headliners, a few small moments that stood out from my experience:  -Tallest man looking at his watch, seeing that his time was up, smiling at the crowd, and then muttering ""oh god damn"" before doing an a capella version of ""Like the Wheel"" to close out his set.  -The community dance party that was all of Sylvan Esso's set.  Also Nick Sanborn giving a shoutout to his grandma, who was seeing him play for the first time (I think he said, ""you all are proving to her that I'm cool!"")  -Seeing Matt Berninger dancing with his daughter to Grandma Sparrow on Friday afternoon.  Such a celebration of humanity.  As Justin said, ""you chose to come here, and you were right""  Edit: formatting"
indieheads,3dwjq3,km-53-,7,Mon Jul 20 16:00:44 2015 UTC,I left feeling like I witnessed something special. The amount of respect the crowd had for the music and artists I've never seen the likes of at any concert I've been to. Very few people trying to record the show on their phones or screaming at the end of every verse; there were parts of Sufjan's set where I thought I could hear a pin drop. Never once saw anyone get in a fight or causing a problem the whole festival. The campground was full of people sharing water/food trading brews and buds with smiles. The artists all felt like they truly wanted to be there and we're having just as much fun as the audience and the communal spirt between the artists throughout was great fun to witness.  Listening to Justin Vernon sing his heart out while sitting under the stars  surrounded by people who I felt were all sharing the same feelings as me is a experience that keeps slipping into my thoughts. I considered myself a moderate Bon Iver fan but it really felt like a religious experience.  Now that I'm back home and life continues on I feel like I'm missing something - my reality is missing something I found at Eaux Claires. I'm left hoping that it won't be just a one off experience and I'll be telling everyone about my time there hoping they will join me next year on the banks of the Chippewa.

I'm in the beginning stages of entering the music industry right now, and I applied for dozens and dozens of summer internships in NYC through job boards, forms, with zero luck— but then I ended up getting two amazing gigs through personal connections and reaching out through email/Twitter to see if people needed help.  It really really helps to be multi-faceted and have a variety of skills to offer— in the past year I've been a merch girl, social media marketing intern, blog writer, assistant publicist, front-of-house at pop-up events, concert photographer, etc. It's all about talking yourself up (to a certain degree) and making yourself useful."

To get an office job (production/marketing/booking etc.) in the industry you will usually need some experience and education. I started writing for a small indie magazine/website a year before looking for internships so I would have some stuff I could show to proof that I can write about music pretty decently. Knowing people also helps a lot obviously (I didn't then, but now once I get my degree and start looking for a real job I am hoping it'll help.)

indieheads,3dxae8,stopitsgingertime,3,Mon Jul 20 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of generic Hype Machine-type tiny music blogs are constantly looking for new writers— off the top of my head, I can name Euphoria, When The Gramophone Rings, and The 405— there are tons more if you go looking though!

indieheads,3dxae8,art36,4,Tue Jul 21 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely reach out to a local venue or promoter and start building a relationship. Volunteer for street team stuff, office help, anything that they'll let you do. It sounds like you're not too focused in on one job, which is good -- try a bunch of stuff out and see what you like. I have friends that have turned small internships with our local college town promoter into pretty good label internships back in their home cities. You gotta immerse yourself in the local scene if you want to meet people and get work."
indieheads,3dxae8,gugs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:42:30 2015 UTC,"Good advice, but I want to advise that it's far easier to land an unpaid internship gig then a paid full time job. I interned for a promoter, and there were only half a dozen paid employees in the office but a dozen plus interns at any given time."
indieheads,3dxae8,art36,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:43 2015 UTC,Very true. I'm in film/TV and the shift is occurring towards less unpaid internships and more paid after some high-profile lawsuits -- I can only hope that that shift happens in the music industry too.
indieheads,3dxae8,lushacrous,3,Mon Jul 20 12:29:08 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live and what is available, it can be either very difficult or impossible. It all comes down to networking and nepotism. I scored an unpaid internship at a mid-size venue in the Midwest because I was friends with a current intern whose brother was friends with one of the showrunners. The place gets dozens of resumes a week, possibly hundreds a month, and I guarantee I only got the gig because I knew someone. Anyway, I interned there for 3 years as well as a couple other marketing gigs, but I wasn't able to land a music job after college. There have probably been 40+ people I know who interned either before, during, or after me, and only a handful have jobs in music from that experience, but they're ALL at that venue, so it's pretty null and void. It's a tough industry to break into, even when you catch a break or have connections."

indieheads,3dxae8,lushacrous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"I would look into NYC as well honestly. What are you looking into studying? I just graduated this past spring.  You haven't really said what you are interested in too much but you want to be part of the promotions/marketing/etc. I think that's really important and the most important thing with music at this point is that you have the drive to pave your own career path. The only way you'll succeed is if you put in the work and poke your head in the right places, and obviously have talent and be enjoyable to be around.  I would suggest wherever you end up going to school, look up all of the different labels near you and check and see if they have an internship program- a lot of them display them online. If they don't display it use social media (twitter) and email to help you out. If they don't respond like that either cold call or just show up to their office and ask if they are looking for an intern.  Seriously though being someone people enjoy being around is one of the most important things-- you gotta think about it this way; in music the majority of people will always choose the person they enjoy working with over someone else, even if that other person is more talented/better at their job. This is especially true in advertising and it's all politics.  If you have any questions i would be glad to help out, just hit me up here again or PM me!"

Nothing against people who listen to leaks, but look at how hyped people are getting for the Frank Ocean album. Now compare it to Beach House. That early ass leak means all their hype's died by the time the album comes out and means they are going to sell way less than  they should, and don't get all the money they deserve."

But I'm sure you're right about certain artists, who might want everyone to have their first listen at the same time. And there are some cases where the release date is chosen for a reason and actually compliments the record in some way, such as Sufjan Stevens releasing Illinois on the 4th of July (independence day). Or when Microcastle by Deerhunter leaked, they decided to put out Weird Era Cont. as a little bonus for the people who waited for the real release."

I love how I can get lost in these themes and imagery that Kevin makers through his great lyrics (impressive vocubalary, very honest, great flow) and the instrumentation that is so detailed and portrays so many emotions.

indieheads,3dvjje,crysb326,2,Mon Jul 20 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? is commonly regarded as their best album, and it's honestly the best album for getting a feel of what modern of Montreal is like. From there, if you like the funkiness and glam aspects of the second half, check out Skeletal Lamping or False Priest. If you like the lyrical content from the first half (dealing with depression, relationship woes, etc.), and/or if you want something a bit more experimental, check out Paralytic Stalks, my personal favorite"
indieheads,3dvjje,xEstie,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"Well, considering I've been looking to find some good funk records, I think I will probably enjoy this! Also given I really like experimental works, Paralytic Stalks I'll also give a listen!   tl;dr I'll listen to everything then   Thanks!"
indieheads,3dvjje,ChocolateSizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"Paralytic Stalks was my first of Montreal album (I was 13 when it was released) and it completely changed the way I listen to music and what I listen to. I can still go back and find something new, an instrument in the background or lyric I overlooked. Before that I didn't know you could make a piece of music so intricate and layered. Have fun!"
indieheads,3dvjje,akidwhoplaysguitar,2,Tue Jul 21 05:33:04 2015 UTC,saw them live back in March - crazy show. They had a bunch of really cool stage props
indieheads,3dvjje,crysb326,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way as you, of Montreal is one of my all-time favorite bands. Sometimes I feel like they make up 90% of what I've been listening to this entire year. With 13 albums, and a lot of EPs, it's incredibly easy to get fully immersed in their discography."

indieheads,3dvjje,Apotheosis91,9,Sun Jul 19 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"People talking shit about musicians makes me uncomfortable. I was at a record store and some guy was shitting on Tim Hecker saying he was an asshole because he bails out of shows early and I was like ""staaaaahp"""
indieheads,3dvjje,sara520,3,Sun Jul 19 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"yeah this also has to do with the band OWING you something, it's just so uncomfortable :/"
indieheads,3dvjje,elscorchoo,5,Mon Jul 20 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"It's cool to have a picture but it's not your right as a music listener to have everyone be nice to you, and it's certainly unfair to call them out like that. There's a kind of entitlement people seem to be getting with regards to music lately, the band doesn't owe you anything for being a fan, and you shouldn't expect this kind of thing. In this particular case, I guess you could say it's a pretty dickish thing for the guy to do to just walk away without saying anything else, but one Instagram comment isn't really enough to know what actually happened and to be able to pass judgement on it."
indieheads,3dvjje,sara520,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"i agree.  i think sometimes people take it as a personal attack when it's really just the fact that somebody might not want to have their picture taken with a stranger at the moment.  also last time i saw parquet courts i remember seeing andrew in front of me in the crowd during the openers watching them on his own and people were going up to him and talking to him, and he was speaking to them, so i feel like maybe that person didn't even try to have a conversation with him and it was annoying, it would have annoyed me too honestly.  but this is all based on assumptions, in reality i just don't think it's very nice to go off on somebody where a lot of people are going to see it because you're bitter about something that in my opinion is pretty stupid."

indieheads,3dv40e,subaru_stevens,5,Mon Jul 20 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll forever be confused with the communal fawning or groveling regarding Pitchfork's random-ass numbering system. They're fucking numbers. Do you like the album? Good - or bad, if you hate it. Who cares what some guy in Chicago thinks who's job it is to stir up the exact reactions that sum up this thread."
indieheads,3dv40e,noraamitt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean you're right. When people post Pitchfork's reviews of albums here I kind of think it's just feeding the flame; that being said, I myself have the same problem in which I place an undeserved amount of importance on a Pitchfork score. I know that I do this, and yet I do it anyway. But I'm trying to shake it, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job.  I agree with pretty much everything you said, but I think this is an interesting question because it proves that Pitchfork's rating system is dumb. We all know that they've rated tons of albums higher than they should have been rated, whether it's because there are some artists they will support no matter what, or because of hype, or for whatever reason. This is a question that sort of shows that the opinions of Pitchfork are singular in nature and not representative of what people think, and that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and that life is meaningless and nihilism is the true way, etc. etc."
indieheads,3dv40e,PerryLJackson,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"but I think this is an interesting question because it proves that Pitchfork's rating system is dumb.   I hear ya, but I feel like most people here know that. What ends up happening is an echo chamber each time a thread like this pops up.   I used to pretty heavily turn to Pitchfork to discover new music back somewhere in the realm of '07-'10, along with GorillaVsBear. For that, I have no regrets; I've discovered a huge amount of fantastic music I still love to this day thanks to Pitchfork. I simply got fed up with rolling my eyes at some of the reviews and their grades. 7.4, what the hell does that even mean? 8.6? What makes it 1/10th better than an 8.5? Of course, I realize I'm playing into the same echo chamber I mentioned earlier. But I guess I just don't understand some of the outrage (which is probably too strong of a word because I doubt anyone cares that much, so I'll chalk it up to hyperbole) when an album is ""snubbed"" or graded too high, or given Best New Music.   And when an anticipated album reaches indie-cred nirvana and attains a 9.whatever, the community rejoices! They've made it! The gods have spoken, and we are validated! I feel like when the grades are posted in forums, the conversation devolves into a ""no fucking way, that deserves a 7.6, not an 8.3,"" or ""BNM? yeah fucking right..."" But I'm assuming that's exactly their intent. It works, and they're wildly popular.  Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon when it comes to this kind of stuff, but it can irk me sometimes. I avoid this by staying away from Pitchfork most times, but can't avoid it when I come here. And I love this community, it's awesome. I have very few gripes when it comes to /r/indieheads, but sometimes I just get sick of people placing far too much importance on the numbers and the BNM tag."
indieheads,3dv40e,noraamitt,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. Pitchfork is good for news (very consistent and quick with album announcements and the like), and generally the new music that they hype is pretty good. But yeah. Too much importance is placed on their scores. I'm sure there are a lot of people who feel like they can't like something unless Pitchfork does.  I will say that I actually do take issue with an album getting panned undeservedly, because of the power that Pitchfork wields. When an album (like the new Ratatat for instance) gets a 5.0, that guarantees that a lot of people will gloss over it based on that score alone. Pitchfork can make bands, and it can just as easily break them. So when a band doesn't get a far shake on the site, it can be kind of saddening. It's hard for me to be like ""just give _______ a chance"" and have other people be like ""I don't know, it got a 4.5 on Pitchfork"". It's sort of sad that people place so much importance on the site. And like I said, I'm guilty of this myself.  But that's why I check other sites like Stereogum and CoS, because it allows me to see where Pitchfork's sight may have fallen short."
indieheads,3dv40e,PerryLJackson,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to be like ""just give _______ a chance"" and have other people be like ""I don't know, it got a 4.5 on Pitchfork"".   Well, fuck them, frankly. The kind of person who would look at a 4.5 from Pitchfork and ignore the album because of that number is the kind of person who's opinion will probably not jive well with me. I understand that probably comes off as dickish, but it's how I feel. Truth be told, they probably would have missed out on a bunch of music they likely would have enjoyed if following that philosophy. If someone wants to gloss over an album because of a poor number, that's their issue. What matters to me is if I like the album, and I'm assuming much to the same way the reviewer conveys how much or little they like the album. It's just the way they convey that is usually pretty pretentious and arbitrary. Some people might get the impression of ""Woah, a 6.9....what do they know that I don't that would keep them 1/10th of a point away from a 7? They must really know their stuff...""  ¯\(ツ)/¯"
indieheads,3dv40e,noraamitt,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"I agree.  As far as the decimals go, I think it's completely arbitrary. Probably done just to separate them from the rest. I'd understand doing it in increments of 0.5 (Fantano sort of does this with his 'light' and his 'strong'), but yeah. It is sort of pretentious. That might be the point. For them to seem more scholarly than others, as if they carefully assessed every aspect of an album and pragmatically arrived at this figure."
indieheads,3dv40e,PerryLJackson,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"That might be the point. For them to seem more scholarly than others, as if they carefully assessed every aspect of an album and pragmatically arrived at this figure.   I think you're spot on with that. Couldn't have put it better myself.  I can only really handle one pretentious critic, and that's Robert Christgau, the self-appointed Dean of American Rock Critics. I love his capsule reviews, and while pretentious and convoluted, I like the way he describes his feelings on an album without bashing you over the head with it and being obvious. A lot of it comes across as ""What the flying fuck are you talking about"" at face value, as if the ramblings of a drunken washed up uncle who's regaling about memories past to uninterested nephews at the kids table at Thanksgiving. ""Sure. Uncle Robert, whatever you say.""   His review of Spiderland by Slint:   Out of Squirrel Bait by Hunglikealbini, a Trojan horse. Extolled for their multipartite songforms and, da-da, dynamic shifts from soft to loud, as well as their intimate knowledge of mental illness, these guys look like unassuming alternative types and in real life may be same. Their sad-sack affect fits right in. But musically--structurally, as one might say--they're art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions. And if you promise not to mention their lyrics they promise to keep the volume down   I really like the last line in particular. He doesn't say ""their lyrics are odd and they've quieted things down,"" but instead kind of deconstructs his thoughts and reforms them on the page like magazine letters in a ransom note.   And I love his ability to condense his thoughts into a concise little snippet. He avoids going into lengthy tirades and beat-around-the-bush essays (a huge fault of mine, I take way too long to get to my point most of the time) and taps into the essence of what he's trying to say. I think he does this effectively.   His review of MBV:   And the dearth was without form and droid, and texture was upon the bass of the beat   I wasn't kidding when I said I have a problem with not being able to get to my point - how did this turn into a huge sprawling comment about Xgau?

As /u/WhatWouldSpaderDo said, it's all about the beats. Everything from Don't Hold the Wall and Let the Groove Get In with their African influences and samples to crazy hits like Mirrors, Tunnel Vision and Suit and Tie created a great, varied album. Another thing that stuck out to me with the album is how Timberlake/ Timbaland are able to keep 7+ minute long songs fresh and captivating by developing them.   I mean it boils down to the fact that it's still a pop album so you can't go in looking for REAL MUSIC that speaks to you. It's just a really great, innovative, and expertly crafted pop album. but part 2 is garbage"

It's fun and entertaining, and that's the point. That's how I feel, at least. It's good for it's purpose, and I think that's okay. I like some Pop, but I know what I'm going for when I listen to it."

indieheads,3dv40e,nircat2,13,Mon Jul 20 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Let me give you every reason that Kanye West is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat, who had provided nothing but top-tier music since his debut. Let me school you with some straight facts: Kanye, despite his publicity stunts, is regarded by many as a kind, compassionate individual. He often talks to his fans, and from all accounts is genuinely interested in what they have to say, what their life is like, and what their goals are. This is somebody who for the past nine years has been public enemy number one. It would be easy for him to go into absolute seclusion, and bitterly resent everybody, but he doesn't. He has a passion behind what he does, and it reflects in his music. Rick Rubin regards Kanye as the most influential and groundbreaking artist in hip-hop at the moment. Paul McCartney regards Kanye as a genius. He invited Seth Rogen and James Franco to perform their ""Bound 3"" parody at his wedding. He has won the love and respect of anybody who genuinely takes an interest in his music (Which has won 21 grammy awards, might I add). Despite the VMA incident, Kanye and Taylor Swift are good friends, and Swift herself has a deep respect for Kanye as an artist. Not to mention, the dude has not had it easy. He slaved for years as a producer before finally making his big break on the production for Jay-Z's Blueprint, with beats for Ain't No Love (Heart of the City) and I.Z.Z.O (Takeover). Despite his success as a producer, everybody told him he couldn't rap, and would never make it. He eventually dropped College Dropout in 2004, reinventing the game with an album full of incredible soul-beats at a time where everybody was still trying to copy the G-Funk West Coast vibe Dr. Dre's 2001 had left. The album had smash hits like Through the Wire, where he rapped about his near-death experience in a car crash while STILL WEARING his reconstructive mouthgear; or his club-hit about Jesus in Jesus Walks, at a time where you weren't going to get anything religious on the radio unless you're on country/gospel station in the South. Late Registration debuted 2005, with a completely fresh Soul sound, and featuring the talents of Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Nas, Jay-Z, and of course Jamie Foxx in his smash hit ""Gold Digger"". I don't care who you are, this song had everybody dancing and was played and still is played in every club from New York to Tokyo to Berlin. His other single ""Diamonds From Sierra Lione"" touched on the issues of Blood Diamonds and the exploitation of Africans by Africans ""Over here, its the drug trade - we die from drugs/ Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs"". This album also has one of his most heart-felt songs Kanye has produced to date: ""Hey Mama"", his tribute to his mother Donda West, who raised him as single black mother in Chicago, with all the trials and tribulations that brought. The song is a beautiful display of a man who has a deepfound respect for the one who gave him everything. ""I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi/ Late december, harsh winter gave me a cold/ You fixed me up something that was good for my soul/ Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?/ You worked late nights just to keep on the lights/ Momma got the training wheels so I could keep on my bike/ ... and it don't gotta be mother's day/ or your birthday for me to just call and say: 'Mama!' I wanna scream so loud for you/ cause i'm so proud of you."" 2007 Kanye released Graduation. This was a completely new sound to his previous Soulful works. This had a heavy techno/EDM inspiration, from artists such as Daft Punk, in addition to the influence of House Music with its Chi-town origins. ""Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it/ I guess every superhero need his theme music"". His other single ""All of the Lights"" has a whopping fifteen extra artists, including Rihanna, Elton John, Fergie, Kid Cudi and many others. I could write a whole essay on Runaway, or Blame Game Then, in 2013 Kanye released ""Yeezus"", a.k.a. ABSOLUTE GENIUS. It is his anti-hiphop album of harsh, grinding samples, and disjointed jarring beats that comes together and by no sense of reason create some beautifully profound music. He denounces the institutional racism of the DEA and the CCA in his controversial track ""New Slaves"". He mocks the hubris and egocentrism that everybody sees him as having in his track I am a God, which takes the absolute piss out of the modern man who considers himself a god, with the absurd line ""I am a God/ So hurry up with my damn croissants!"" Kanye has stopped caring what people think about him a long time ago. But that's not what makes the album ABSOLUTE GENIUS. It's the fact that the entire album is in fact an allegory depicting the Tragic fall of the ""Yeezus"" persona, going from absolute stardom and egotism with the strong, hard hitting, angry, egotistical tracks On Sight, Black Skinhead, I am a God, and New Slaves. Then, it shows the invevitable Tragic fall, like something straight from Aristotle himself: Hold My Liquor and I'm in it deal with Alcohol and Sex addiction in a way that shouts the typical social glorification of the Rockstar lifestyle, whilst robbing it of all its glory. ""Focus on the future and let the crew knock her"" ""If you loved me so much then why'd you let me go?"" (x3) Then, we get into the final stage with the last two songs: Send it Up and Bound 2. Send it Up is Yeezus coming to terms with what has happened and joyfully choosing to put it all behind him. ""Reliving the past? Your loss"" is the beginning of the song, and it ends with Beanie Mann singing ""Memories dont live like people do; They always 'member you/ whether things are good or bad/ it's just the memories that you had"". At the end of Kanye's verse, he shows that the Yeezus persona has revived anew ""Yeezus just rose again."" Bound 2 is the 'happy ending' of Yeezus. Yeezus, after all that he's endured: the greatness, the loss, the suffering and the revival; he now is redeemed. He no longer is chasing the fame, the money, the superficial things, and he's found that ""One good girl [who] is worth a thousand bitches"" meaning that he has a legitimate relationship with a woman, as opposed to all the bitchy girls that he's been dealing with. This girl gives him everything that Yeezus could ever ask for: companionship. The final lines of the song reflect their relationship. It's not perfect, but ""you know, ain't nobody perfect"". They celebrate the small milestones of making it to thanksgiving and to Christmas; perhaps they can make it all the way to the altar, but first she's going to need to forget and forgive the person that Yeezus was. In the last two lines, Yeezus sums up the entire journey, on a number of levels: After this long-ass journey and transition that Yeezus has gone through, reflecting the verses of these raps and self-reflection; or the verses of him against his demons; or the verses of the Bible as they get married they're both tired, and sad at the state of how things are for people still living their lives full of despair, and in a metaphor and reference to the shortest ""verse"" in the Bible, they weep, just as ""Jesus wept."" ""Hey, you remember where we first met?/ Okay, I don't remember where we first met/ But hey, admittin' is the first step/ And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect/ And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep/ But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect/ And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'/ So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas/ She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist/ Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?/ Maybe we could still make it to the church steps/ But first, you gon' remember how to forget/ After all these long-ass verses/ I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept"" Now I've been writing this comment for the past hour, so I won't even go into his non-musical exploits, but rest assured that as far as fashion goes, Kanye West is leading the forefront with his Red Octobers or Yeezy Boost Sneakers with a resale value of several thousand dollars each. Now, I hope that if you actually took the time to read at least half of this, you will see that the hatred for Kanye is little more than an attempt to marginalize one of the greatest artists of our time. His outbursts, though not classy, are not unfounded. Heck, John Lennon literally said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus; if that's not hubris I don't know what is. Both Lennon and West are icons and artists who have changed this world forever. Just because you haven't taken the time to see further than your limited frame-of-reference by no means makes Kanye a bad artist or a bad human being. He is God sent, and full to the brim of musical talent. His new album will undoubtedly bring another wave of incredible artistry."

indieheads,3dv40e,Apotheosis91,16,Sun Jul 19 21:41:36 2015 UTC,A 7.8 is pretty close to being BNM lol

indieheads,3dv40e,Catholic_Spray,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:09 2015 UTC,A lot people blindly shit on Yeezus as well. I can see people not liking it if they want a different style from Kanye though.

indieheads,3dv40e,LurknMoar,7,Mon Jul 20 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"I really really like 'In Colour', but the response to your question is ""Our Love"" by Caribou."
indieheads,3dv40e,Lurie_,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree.  I found In Colour to be wayyy better than Our Love. FWIW I liked both albums (I'd give In Colour a 9 and Our Love a 7).    But yeah I felt that the instrumentation was more varied, the samples were more interesting, and the vocals were way better on In Cololur. I also felt that Our Love was a much more personal album with some dancey beats whereas In Colour definitely captured a broader experience.   There are similarities without a doubt, but I don't think that you could use Our Love as an example of an album that paints In Colour as ""heard before and honestly a bit boring"""
indieheads,3dv40e,LurknMoar,4,Mon Jul 20 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"Hm, I personally would give In Colour an 8.4 and Our Love a 8.7. They're really close to me.   I don't know, the nitpicks boil down to personal preference. In Colour is definitely more varied: ""girl"" is a sweet chillwave song, and ""I know there's gonna be good times"" is a banger (although I absolutely hate Young Thug's verse. Woulda been better with any other rapper). ""Loud Places"" is in contention for SOTY. But I personally really enjoy the more personalized aesthetic that Caribou brings to his music.   Actually, now that I directly compare the two, I might just agree with you that ""In Colour"" is a better record... shit!"

The fact Jenny Death isn't BNM is a travesty The Powers that B as a whole is the only album this year so far worth talking about competing with To Pimp a Butterfly as AOTY.  -Side rant over  Drake- Nothing was the Same  Best Coast- Crazy for You  Many of these as I'm looking through the list I haven't listened to and haven't been recommended to listen to by anybody and/or no one has been praising it (Lower Dens- Escape from Evil, Natalie Prass-s/t, etc).

indieheads,3dv40e,crichmond77,5,Mon Jul 20 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"Beyonce's eponymous album definitely deserves all the plaudits it got imo. The surprise drop and becoming the biggest selling album of 2013 in just two weeks meant it was a pop culture phenomenon. Music videos for every track as well meant the surprise drop was even more surprising and spoke to Beyonce's power. It was a cultural landmark. Twitter and Facebook absolutely exploded when she dropped the album.  In terms of music, Beyoncé covers a lot of ground. the subject matter is pretty out there for a pop album. She covers female sexuality a lot which is surprising for a female, and black women in general, especially considering she put it in the context of marriage. She covers motherhood and feeling sad (I'm not feeling like myself since the baby - Mine), and she also champions feminism (***flawless) and challenges traditional ideals of beauty (pretty hurts). The subject matter is not really what you'd expect from a traditional pop album. The music is also really good, bridge between mainstream pop and experimental dark rnb. There's a lot of dark electronic beats. The beat switch on haunted is absolutely breathtaking and XO is one of Beyonce's best anthems. Beyonce's self titled was an amazing pop album, and one of the best of this decade.  If you like Drake, you'd like Nothing Was The Same. It built on Take Care, adding more atmospheric production, better lyricism and cutting out the poppies interludes on Take Care like Make Me Proud. If you liked Take Care, Nothinf Was The Same was near to being its equal or better. Pitchfork liked TKe Care so understandable that Nothing Was The Same. Also, Hold On we're Going Home is one of the best songs of this decade."

Also, the 80s throwback was well made because it lacked the parodic element other 80s dance throwback music had, and the early 2000s didn't really have that element in pop music, it was more about trying to sound futuristic and slapping an awkward rap at the bridge."

indieheads,3dv40e,Polyfauna,3,Mon Jul 20 03:11:31 2015 UTC,oh shit I love that album!  upvoted
indieheads,3dv40e,The_Elder_Steak,14,Mon Jul 20 05:56:09 2015 UTC,"I Love You, Honeybear  I actually really liked this album for the first few listens due to the arrangements, but the lyrics really wore on me.  Misty's an obnoxious person.  I have no problem with pessimism, cynicism, or any other kind of -ism his music has been described as, but he sings with such self-importance.  If he hummed instead of sang, it would be a good album, but unfortunately Misty has a hard time keeping his mouth shut."
indieheads,3dv40e,jake_dpp,56,Sun Jul 19 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"It's kinda the whole point of the album though. All that cynical bullshit gets swept away in one song about one girl that he just met at the store one day. It's sweet, man :/"
indieheads,3dv40e,The_Elder_Steak,12,Sun Jul 19 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  It's the one reason I can't really get into that album. A lot of people try and tell me it's some kind of character? I haven't really been able to understand what is meant by that, and if it is a character, it doesn't make me want to listen to him say those things any more. It doesn't provide a lot of relief hearing those things being said by a fictional person rather than a real one. I don't want to hear it either way."
indieheads,3dv40e,CharminglyIrreverent,23,Sun Jul 19 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Well it is a character. He does have solo music out there as just Josh Tillman, but it didn't garner much attention. Now, his Father John Misty character has had a great deal of success. I can't imagine he'll be changing the sarcastic, snarky attitude of Misty anytime soon."
indieheads,3dv40e,RockoBOOM,3,Sun Jul 19 20:49:18 2015 UTC,"Woah. I didn't even know this and then I looked it up and he's released a TON of material as Josh Tillman-- Way more than as FJM. What a surprise. Thanks for the fun fact, I never knew..."
indieheads,3dv40e,crysb326,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"I actually think some of it is quite good - listen to Singing Ax. Steve Albini produced it, so it's raw and stripped-down. Pretty heavy folk music with strong songwriting in a much more serious tone."

I think it has some insanely good and interesting songs, but as an album, it's very inconsistent. ""When You're Smiling and Astride Me"", ""Thirsty Crow"", and ""Strange Encounter"" are very unmemorable IMO, which is made even worse by the fact that they're back-to-back-to-back. I'm also not a fan of True Affection. The rest of the songs range from good to magnificent, but That many unmemorable songs on an 11-track album keep me from calling it a truly great album"

indieheads,3dv40e,dewg0ng,2,Mon Jul 20 04:24:51 2015 UTC,It's a good album.  Not my favourite Wilco album.  Maybe it's their best.  But it seems a little over-rated.  And a 10/10?  How do you justify that?
indieheads,3dv40e,FrankinComesAlive,6,Mon Jul 20 05:54:25 2015 UTC,"If it's a good album, how is it the worst album that's ever gotten BNM? Have you seen how many albums have been given BNM?"

indieheads,3dv40e,wilandhugs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"This is my attempt at justifying it. TL;DR at the bottom.  I mean, I don't think it's the WORST album ever given BNM. But I could totally see how it would be overrated. I think part of the reason it got a 10 was the story behind how it was made (turmoil within the band, the label refusing to release it, streaming it for free on their website, etc.) which lead to a lot of hype surrounding it.   Personally, I like the juxtaposition between the catchy pop music and paranoia-inducing static/Conet Project radio babble. It's like listening to a Cold War Era AM radio channel that doubles as a number station. I also think the album contains some of Jeff Tweedy's most beautiful lyrics, like in Jesus, Etc and Ashes of American Flags. With its roots in alt-country and 70s-ish radio pop, it feels so undeniably American and I really love how it celebrates that culture.   This last point is pretty weird, but bear with me. YHF is very eerily connected to 9/11, and despite the fact that it was finished beforehand, it really feels like the first musical examination of post 9/11 America in some ways. I find this fascinating, even if it is a stretch. The album's intended release date was 9/11. The cover features a pair of towers (Marina City in Chicago - but still similar looking). The presence of the Conet Project Recordings on the album is like a sonic realization of the Cold War fear that war and destruction could happen in America and transform our lives. The disruption of otherwise simple pop songs with unusual noises, radio static and mysterious code speak is representative of this idea. Songs like War on War and Ashes of American Flags, while cryptic, could be seen as reflections on the post 9/11 political and moral landscape. Jesus, etc. contains some unsettlingly premonitory lines about the attack itself - ""tall buildings shake, sky scrapers are scraping together, last cigarette is all you can get, turning your orbit around"". And what keeps us together after this tragedy? ""Our love is all have.""  It seems cohesive enough to me that we can wrestle this theme out of the music.   TL;DR - catchy songs with the right amount of experimentation, lovely and cryptic lyrics, 9/11 conspiracy. Also I'm a diehard Wilco fan (obviously) so I'll always love certain things about the band."

indieheads,3dtj3o,MrNovember19,32,Sun Jul 19 08:45:30 2015 UTC,How were the new songs ?  What did they sound like ?
indieheads,3dtj3o,hiplink,20,Sun Jul 19 09:08:41 2015 UTC,"The new songs were absolutely great. It may have been the live setting, but both were pretty bombastic, think like the end of Holocene. One had a slight electronic influence on the drums, but both were somewhat close to Bon Iver, but also having a kind of Kaputt feel, just not as much sax, but also having just a little more rock thrown in. This is probably a bad description, and if a recording is released it may not sound like that at all, but yeah both songs were really great. The lyrics to one song (iirc) ended with him repeating a few times ""I wanna stop bothering you,"" before ending with ""I can't stop bothering you / I won't stop bothering you."" So definitely as emotional as ever!"
indieheads,3dtj3o,_lucabear,9,Sun Jul 19 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"I really liked them, but I'm convinced that he literally could have played anything and made it sound good live.  The whole production was amazing."
indieheads,3dtj3o,aMartin3105,27,Sun Jul 19 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"It's not that they were breaking up. What he said was, IIRC:   He was going on to the third cycle of Bon Iver. He's taking things slowly. He's just worrying about Eaux Claires. He's not planning on recording an album, YET.   But all in all, he's Bon Iver basically. If he wants to make new music he'll do some more Bon Iver for sure."
indieheads,3dtj3o,shirim,6,Sun Jul 19 12:19:17 2015 UTC,"I know, but there were a ton of rumors that this concert would be the last we saw of Bon Iver, which thankfully doesn't seem to be the case"

indieheads,3dtl2n,bad_posture,4,Sun Jul 19 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. microcastles is amazing. ""Agoraphobia"" is one of the most catchy songs I've ever heard.  monomania is incredible as well. were you a fan?"

Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. -> Halcyon Digest -> Monomania has gotta be one of the best 3 album streaks in modern music.   I think Monomania is my favourite Deerhunter album lyrically.

indieheads,3dtl2n,Apotheosis91,3,Sun Jul 19 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"You definitely need some Aphex in that rotation. Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is great for studying, and although it's more upbeat, Syro is too.   I find my favourite music for studying is really minimal techno. It helps my brain unlock and lose track of time, keeping me focused yet spaced at the same time. Two of my favourites are The Dead Bears by Newworldaquarium and Alacachofa by Ricardo Villalobos. Great, playful, imaginative minimal albums with a ton of depth, detail, and intricacy. Once you lock into those grooves there's no going back."

It's minimalist piano with strings (cello, violins) and some field recordings in an airport. It's somber at times. It's huge at times. Always emotional.  Dustin O'Halloran is really good. His work on the Like Crazy soundtrack is great.   On the creepier/tense side of things, Cliff Martinez made some weird warbly pulsating stuff for Steven Soderbergh's The Knick on Showtime. It's space music for a show about primitive surgery in the late 1800s but somehow it works, and I love it."

Albert Hammond Jr.sounds a lot like the strokes  Julian Casablancas sometimes sounds like the strokes  Arctic Monkeys first couple albums sound similar  The Libertines are like the british version of the strokes

To me it's a brilliant pop album - not inc a chart sense, but in a songwriting sense.    'Go (ft. Q-Tip)' &  'Sometimes I Feel So Deserted' could easily be hit singles. 'l'll See You There' is reminiscent of their sound on late 90's masterpiece 'Let Forever Be (ft. Noel Gallagher).'    If that wasn't enough to win you over, St. Vincent's on the record.

indieheads,3dtl2n,eon997,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have any music that sounds like the production on the new Alice Glass song, ""Stillbirth""? I was blown away by how industrial and syncopated it was."
indieheads,3dtl2n,Apotheosis91,2,Sun Jul 19 14:28:25 2015 UTC,Definitely HEALTH. Jupiter Keyes did the production on Stillbirth and is a main contributor to their sound. In a lot of ways Stillbirth was basically a HEALTH track with Alice vocals. Listen to New Coke and Die Slow to get an idea of what they're about.
indieheads,3dtl2n,eon997,2,Sun Jul 19 16:12:59 2015 UTC,I already started listening to Health after researching Jupiter Keyes. Thanks though!
indieheads,3dtl2n,Landicus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"I asked this earlier, but I'm looking for something like Dream-Folk I guess. Something that combines folk with Dreampop or even post-punk or electronic. Bon Iver's second album is kind of what I'm looking for.   Someone already suggested Mojave 3, Dreamend, and Grouper."
indieheads,3dtl2n,hiplink,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"You've probably heard it, but Carrie & Lowell has elements of ambient music and some parts are also reminiscent of post rock. Although, it is far less grandiose than the Bon Iver album."

indieheads,3dtl2n,jake_dpp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Whirr plays really heavy, melancholic shoegaze. Definitely a prettier sound than Have a Nice Life though. Check out Sway  You'd probably like Nothing a lot too. Check out Guilty of Everything. The vocals and melodies sound like a breathier, dreamier Kurt Kobain. Think Ride and MBV meet Nirvana."

indieheads,3dqt8c,ThisTemporaryLife,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:24:30 2015 UTC,Finger Back and Worship You should switch places with Taxi Cab and Diplomat's Son. Those two songs sound like they'd be better on that record.

indieheads,3dqt8c,cobbutkssotraoobat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:49:34 2015 UTC,"""Ya Hey"" is the album's weakest song in my opinion. Not because of the pitch shifting, but because the lyrical message rubs me the wrong way. But ""Hudson"" is incredible."

indieheads,3dqt8c,stu_balls,22,Sat Jul 18 16:34:18 2015 UTC,I feel similarly about Old; I do love the bangers in the second half but I think the first half is a lot more enjoyable for everyday listening.
indieheads,3dqt8c,That3D,6,Sat Jul 18 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I think Danny Brown is at his best when he's personal like that. Don't get me wrong, I think he has some pretty solid party tracks from both his albums but I'd love to see him put out a record that's completely personal. I think it would show depth as an artist. Or he could go the Death Grips route and make a record that's all bangers and just go completely over board to the point of parody."

In the same way that Death Grips amplifies violence, Danny Brown could make a record that just entirely amplifies partying.

indieheads,3dqt8c,GeorgeTaylorG,21,Sat Jul 18 18:28:53 2015 UTC,Honestly with the exception of Andy You're a Star I think that album is pretty consistently good. Though to be fair I'm a huge Killers fan. I consider it a modern classic.

indieheads,3dqt8c,mattyb712,13,Sat Jul 18 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely have to disagree there, the first half has two of my favorite National songs in general with Afraid of Everyone and Terrible Love. I'm a little biased as a National fanboy though."

indieheads,3dqt8c,dreamshoes,3,Sat Jul 18 22:25:34 2015 UTC,That's actually cool to hear. It's cool to see how the first half is impactful for some people when I always thought the general consensus was the first half was bad.

As a side-note, if you haven't seen King of Limbs: Live from the Basement then HOLY SHIT watch it. The middling KoL material is elevated considerably by the live aspect, of the aforementioned tracks are goosebump-inducing, particularly Give Up the Ghost. Watching Thom layer up all those vocals on the spot is incredible."

indieheads,3dqt8c,thebasedyeezus,13,Sun Jul 19 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is more because the songs are too samey and not that the second half is bad.

Reflektor is a great album with a ton of incredible songs, but it may be too many songs all together. Anyway, I can't wait to see what they write next!"
indieheads,3dqt8c,aMartin3105,13,Sat Jul 18 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"The Stephen Colbert performance of ""Normal Person"" is better than the studio version. More energy, better mixing."

indieheads,3dqt8c,aMartin3105,6,Sat Jul 18 22:01:36 2015 UTC,The violinist and drummer are on tour with St. Vincent too.
indieheads,3dqt8c,dreamshoes,3,Sat Jul 18 18:10:04 2015 UTC,say what now? I knew Jeremy Gara was playing for a shitton of artists in the studio but live with St. Vincent? Hell yes. And Sarah Neufeld as always on top (even tho I think she's no longer part of the core of the band).
indieheads,3dqt8c,ManlyDrinks,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should have clarified. They're her opening act, last I checked. Her band is still the same as the past few years, and the drummer certainly does not dissapoint."
indieheads,3dqt8c,aMartin3105,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:01 2015 UTC,are just Jeremy and Sarah opening or are they in a band with more people?
indieheads,3dqt8c,ManlyDrinks,2,Sat Jul 18 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"It's just Sarah but she has him along apparently. I could be wrong about this, I know she's there and I'm 90% sure she said it was Jeremy on stage (I'm not familiar with how he looks) but I never actually looked it up."
indieheads,3dqt8c,aMartin3105,2,Sat Jul 18 22:11:43 2015 UTC,jeremy is (in all respect) the uglier dude with the weird curly hair. and the sickest drummer also.
indieheads,3dqt8c,ManlyDrinks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:05 2015 UTC,"I saw them open for St. Vincent in June, and it was just the two of them. Atmospheric stuff, kind of bland, but it worked as a nice palate-cleanser before St. Vincent's electrifying awesomeness."

indieheads,3dqt8c,_lucabear,3,Sat Jul 18 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"they play in this and that band, they do smaller local stuff i think. i think richard is in Bell Orchestre with sarah neufeld and tim just started a new group or sth that is scheduled to release an LP IIRC (read it in CoS)"
indieheads,3dqt8c,ManlyDrinks,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff, going to check Bell Orchestre then. Are you familiar with their stuff?"
indieheads,3dqt8c,shirim,3,Sat Jul 18 18:33:50 2015 UTC,Actually no cause I didn't found any downloads to any of their projects. They are relatively underground. From what i've heard they are pretty baroque (and fully instrumental).  EDIT: I don't have wifi these days so let me know if you liked them! :)
indieheads,3dqt8c,shirim,2,Sat Jul 18 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you - I got bored after the second song... The only reason to keep going would be because they have AF members, and you're right, they're very underground (~5.000 views for most songs on Spotify!)  If you want instrumental Arcade Fire sounding stuff then sure, it's the thing, but it wasn't for me :/"
indieheads,3dqt8c,JarheadC,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:15 2015 UTC,hmmm... i'll still check it out with very low expectations hehhehe :)

indieheads,3dqt8c,lovelead,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Reflektor is a good example. Half really great songs, half weak songs."
indieheads,3dqt8c,Zangin,19,Sat Jul 18 17:25:53 2015 UTC,Probably the first half of MGMT's Oracular Spectacular. I've never really gotten into that second half yet.
indieheads,3dqt8c,stu_balls,14,Sat Jul 18 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, the last half is my favorite. I love that album top to bottom though. But I tend to play side B of the record more."
indieheads,3dqt8c,OzymandiasBitch,8,Sat Jul 18 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Of Moons, Birds and Monsters is the only really classic track. I do enjoy 4th Dimensional Transition as well though."
indieheads,3dqt8c,stu_balls,5,Sat Jul 18 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"The last few are drastically different, but as good or better than the more pop songs. Future reflections is probably my favorite MGMT song."
indieheads,3dqt8c,ck1915,3,Sat Jul 18 17:52:41 2015 UTC,Second half is kind of a less good preview to congratulations imo
indieheads,3dqt8c,MySuperLove,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"I love the first half, but the second half is so much better imo. The ending with The Handshake and Future Reflactions (which is by far my favourite MGMT song) is so amazing."
indieheads,3dqt8c,HoudiniShuffle,5,Sun Jul 19 00:16:26 2015 UTC,"I felt the exact same way, at first. I had heard most of the songs from the first half already and loved them but when I listened to the album, I was disappointed by the second half. Now though, those songs have grown on me and I probably prefer them to the overplayed ""Time to Pretend"" or ""Kids""."

The only tracks I ever listen to really are I come from the mountain, no spell, strawberries, tunnel time, and minotaur. It's literally 5 out of 10 for me. This album is imo a 9/10, but I can't help but skip everything else but those tracks every single time. Those tracks are perfect, so I can't help but skip the rest just to get to the good stuff."
indieheads,3dqt8c,number90901,17,Sat Jul 18 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"The first half of St Vincent's latest album is great, but the second half is kind of mediocre."

indieheads,3dqt8c,ManlyDrinks,18,Sat Jul 18 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Bring Me Your Loves is one of her best songs ever imo. I also love Every Tear Dissappears. To my ears, that album is about as rock-solid as they come."
indieheads,3dqt8c,cobbutkssotraoobat,5,Sun Jul 19 00:37:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. Any time I listen I have to play it all the way through, and usually the bonus tracks too."
indieheads,3dqt8c,usefulchamber,7,Sun Jul 19 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Every Tear Disappears, Regret and Severed Crossed fingers were some of the better songs of the album."
indieheads,3dqt8c,capncrunch94,3,Sun Jul 19 03:56:21 2015 UTC,Really disagree. The second half is harder to get into but it's still fantastic
indieheads,3dqt8c,number90901,3,Sun Jul 19 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"What? How? Sure, it transforms into a different album halfway through but it's still a great one."

indieheads,3dqt8c,Wolfekeenan,7,Sun Jul 19 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"2nd half has Don't Save Me, Days Are Gone, and Let Me Go so I'd personally disagree."
indieheads,3dqt8c,Alexohmygollypixies,3,Sun Jul 19 02:11:26 2015 UTC,My Song 5 is second half though right?
indieheads,3dqt8c,wilandhugs,2,Sun Jul 19 03:29:18 2015 UTC,I liked it the whole way through but different strokes for different folks
indieheads,3dqt8c,tcoogan15,6,Sun Jul 19 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"Odd Blood by Yeasayer. The first half is just great. From The Children to O.N.E. is a terrific stretch, but then it just falls into a pretty dull, unmemorable finish"
indieheads,3dqt8c,aud-farrant,5,Sat Jul 18 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"Huh, Rome and Love Me Girl are some of my favorites by Yeasayer. Everything after that is pretty forgettable though, I'll agree."
indieheads,3dqt8c,Byud08,3,Sat Jul 18 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. Other than Grizelda, that second half has some of the most laughably terrible songs I've ever heard. Hearing that album the first few times was like a cruel joke."
indieheads,3dqt8c,ModestMase,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"The first half of Forever Dolphin Love by Connan Mockasin is fantastic, but I always skip the second half."
indieheads,3dqt8c,Chipots,2,Sat Jul 18 18:19:42 2015 UTC,Which is fine because the Forever Dolphin Love track is like an album within itself.
indieheads,3dqt8c,TehCheesyOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:44:30 2015 UTC,The last song is the best song though(besides the s/t song). I just wish I understood what it was about.
indieheads,3dqt8c,number90901,4,Sun Jul 19 21:54:24 2015 UTC,I only listen to side A of Combat Rock by the Clash. I love every song on that side especially 'Know Your Rights' and 'Straight to Hell' but there's really nothing that catches my interest on the second half and The Clash are one of my all-time favorite groups.
indieheads,3dqt8c,SpongeBobSagetPants,4,Sat Jul 18 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"Side A of Darkside's ""Psychic"" is 4 songs of pure electronic genius and great basslines.  Side B is a bit hit and miss - veering a bit more experimental. I mean, side B is interesting, but harder to casually listen to."
indieheads,3dqt8c,eftj,2,Sat Jul 18 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more, the first half of that album is unbelievable... I will say that metatron is great as a closer and works better than most of the other 2nd half songs though"
indieheads,3dqt8c,SpongeBobSagetPants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:54 2015 UTC,The only song I don't love is Greek Light. It just seems out of place and the weird vocal performance just doesn't do anything for me. But God damn everything else on that album is grand. Nicolas Jaar is so talented. The level of detail he puts into his music is astounding.
indieheads,3dqt8c,eftj,3,Sun Jul 19 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"I think that I love you Honeybear has a pretty weak B side as compared to the first. The first half has six amazing songs in a row. But once stranger encounters hits I lose interest. However, ""Bored in the USA,"" and "" I went to the store one day"" are both amazing songs. I just think there is some filler thrown into the second half. I liked the album as a whole initially, but after a hundred listens I was not as impressed."
indieheads,3dqt8c,EnixDark,5,Sat Jul 18 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"Do you now like ""Holy Shit""?  That song is the best song on the record, I find it hard to believe someone could dislike it."
indieheads,3dqt8c,iheightmyself,2,Sun Jul 19 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"I genuinely don't think anything about ""Holy Shit"" is special or interesting, unless we're talking in comparison to the rest of the album."
indieheads,3dqt8c,OranReilly,3,Sun Jul 19 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"I liked the first part of Alt J - An Awesome Wave, but the songs got really repetitive to me during the second part of the album."
indieheads,3dqt8c,bagelboy29,2,Sat Jul 18 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"It's one of my favourite albums, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I think Bloodflood is the best song on the album so I'd have to disagree."
indieheads,3dqt8c,routledc,2,Sun Jul 19 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I knew this would be a little polarizing because a lot of people I know love the album to death.  That being said, I haven't listened to it in a long time and I just scanned through the songs again to refresh my memory.  I think it's not the second half of the album that didn't work for me, but the songs between the first and second interlude - basically the second 1/3 if you will."
indieheads,3dqt8c,FyuuR,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can agree with that, if I had to pick a third that was my least favourite, that would be it."
indieheads,3dqt8c,waloop,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"The final few songs of St. Vincent's Actor sort of blur together for me, and I don't care for them so much. I just sort of zone out every time, and then the album ends.  I like about half of Ween's entire discography. I can appreciate what they are doing with their weirder concept songs, but I don't care to listen to them more than once. Especially on The Mollusk, if that album was less ""I'm Dancing In The Show Tonight"" and   ""Waving My Dick In The Wind"", and more ""The Mollusk"", ""Mutilated Lips"", ""The Golden Eel"", and ""Buckingham Green"", it'd easily be one of my favorite albums ever."

indieheads,3dqt8c,FKAShibo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:16:03 2015 UTC,I'd argue the second half is better than the first... the sequence of tracks from 'Momma' through to 'You Ain't Gotta Lie' is incredible.
indieheads,3dqt8c,t_penn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:52:05 2015 UTC,I agree 100 %.  Tracks 1-8 are like straight 10/10s but then it drops off a bit with the exception of a few tracks

indieheads,3dqt8c,YeezusChristSupersta,2,Sat Jul 18 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"Modern Vampires of the City  Obvious Bicycle is an OKAY opener. Then the next five tracks are some of the best vw songs of all time. Then Everlasting Arms is just a sort of non-descript song, nothing too interesting about it. Then you have the three most annoying vw songs of all time one after another. Then Hudson, which is an awesome song but totally breaks up the flow of the album, and Young Lion is just an okay closer.  Idk if that counts as half.  I just needed to have that rant somewhere  EDIT: Just realized that this is in the text of the post itself lol"

Hunter x hunter (2011) if you want a long as fuck but really good anime that you'll go through way too quickly.  And i'll always have to recommend Baccano!, you'll be very confused watching the first two episodes and you'll probably want to drop it but don't, the first episodes only really make sense in hindsight."

I leave this place In a week to move across the country back home until I can land a real job... God I hope that comes quick. Anyway, my ex and I met back up to say our goodbyes on Thursday since she's leaving for a long family vacation. It was super teary and we both confessed that we still love each other, but that things are just too transitional now and that we need to figure our own shit out. We definitely want to both stay in touch as friends though. She even suggested that a few years down the line after we had our lives more flushed out we could revisit the relationship, but that seems like a really dangerous hope to me even though I kinda like the idea... We ended up watching UP together as our last thing. I fucking love that movie; it's probably my favorite. The whole theme is about not holding onto your dreams so tightly that you miss out on the opportunities that are right there for you. Idk, it really help bring me some peace.

indieheads,3dqj8x,Oldaccountlost,2,Sat Jul 18 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"I procrastinated and ended up not having  time to buy the earplugs, so I went to the show without them thinking it wouldn't be too bad as I've never worn earplugs to shows in the past. I ended up having to leave the show early simply because my ears were in pain (still a bit bummed about that).  Because I didn't get them in time I can't personally vouch for their quality, but from what I've read these ones work fine and are washable/reusable. But, because you're seeing them tomorrow, you might not have time to order online, and if that's the case your best bet at finding a pair is looking for them at a music store (like a Guitar Center or something like that).  Again, it might just be that my hearing is overly sensitive but it wouldn't do any harm if you had them just in case."

Everything is blown out to the nth degree in order to expose the emotional potency that lies between the cracks. When you listen, don't try and look for a tonal centre, treat everything as pure sound, and let the catchiness of the rhythms and the vividness of the textures be what draws your ear. Don't try and make out every word of the lyrics, just treat the voice as another textural element and let key words pop out at you. Eventually the meaning of the song will start to reveal itself more and more, as well as the relationship between the lyrics and the instrumental.   I would start with The Money Store, then you can move on to Ex-Military or No Love Deep Web in either order after that, then go in chronological order afterwards (Government Plates -> The Powers That B)."

indieheads,3dqj8x,evacipated,3,Sat Jul 18 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"It's not going to work out with Tinder Girl, I don't think. It's been four dates now, and I realized that I'm not feeling much. I don't feel really compelled to do anything physical with her unlike I have with other girls, and she hasn't made any advances either. We don't really have chemistry and if it weren't for the fact she did an exchange program last year, we'd have nothing to talk about. So, I think I'm just going to let it go, which is disappointing but I've already accepted it.  In other chemistry news, my co-worker and I have gobs of it, apparently, and I'm definitely attracted to her, but there's not much to do about it. I didn't realize we were flirting until someone told me that it was quite obvious we were flirting back and forth, but she's going to law school in Southern Ontario, and it's highly likely she'll be staying there. Plus, you know, she's my co-worker, though only for another month and a half.   My search continues."
indieheads,3dqj8x,number90901,3,Sat Jul 18 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"Trainwreck is a fantastic movie. Super funny all the way through, although it sometimes drags a bit.  In other news, I finally found vegan ice cream that actually tastes like the real stuff, which is litterally life changing.  Depression Cherry is my first Beach House album and it's sooooooo good. Slowly climbing the ranks of my favorite albums this year. I tried listening to some of their other stuff and it just didn't do it for me in the same way though."
indieheads,3dqj8x,gyrk12,5,Sat Jul 18 14:13:49 2015 UTC,Ugh Teen Dream is amazinggg.  Like just turn on Silver Soul and just cry blissfully.
indieheads,3dqj8x,number90901,3,Sat Jul 18 14:17:22 2015 UTC,I feel like I should love it but it just doesn't grab me like Depression Cherry did almost immediately. I'll probably get into it at some point.
indieheads,3dqj8x,gugs,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:51 2015 UTC,I thought Trainwreck was funny but it was so fucking long. They could have cut out half an hour pretty easily and it would have been tighter

indieheads,3dqj8x,SurrealBrouhaha,2,Sat Jul 18 14:37:40 2015 UTC,Is it the stuff made with coconut milk? Cuz that shit is top notch
indieheads,3dqj8x,number90901,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think it was with almond milk, which I usually hate but it was great here (and didn't have the almond aftertaste thank god).  The other big local ice cream place in town does it with coconut milk and unfortunately I can't stand it. It tastes warm and sticky and not at all like ice cream while this stuff is literally a perfect recreation of the normal stuff."
indieheads,3dqj8x,SurrealBrouhaha,3,Sat Jul 18 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the coconut stuff I've tried just tastes like a richer ice cream."

But I really don't fuck with Death Cab that much, played a couple songs I liked but overall it they did a pretty okay show for how boring most of their stuff is lol.  That new CHVRCHES single though, too good. Can't wait for September"

indieheads,3dqj8x,Alteryo,2,Sat Jul 18 19:00:27 2015 UTC,"If you want the classics, sure Goethe. Though if you want to read in order to learn German, I'd go rather easy with the language use and opt for relatively ""modern"" authors, like the those of Gruppe 47."

indieheads,3dqj8x,thebasedyeezus,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"so I didn't hear any Currents singles before listening at all and I gave it two listens this morning  I absolutely love it. it's miles ahead of Lonerism and Innerspeaker especially. maybe it's because I'm going through a breakup and I can relate to the songwriting more, but I seriously love all the songs. Nangs is phenomenal for its length.   maybe because the majority heard the singles before the whole record but as a whole I think it is really great and surprised me a lot, especially with left field jabs like the pitch-shifting on Past Life.  I might honestly even go so far as to say the album is a 9. while I don't agree with Cohen's over the top comparisons (atleast not yet), this is definitely a phenomenal record.  now tell me why I'm wrong"

indieheads,3dr0fh,jamaicanhopscotch,9,Sat Jul 18 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this sounds like an awesome idea.  So we would take a bunch of different subgenres, and find the most essential released within each said genre?    I'd gladly help out with this"

indieheads,3dr0fh,jake_dpp,7,Sat Jul 18 18:30:46 2015 UTC,I definitely would - I had expressed interest in a shoegaze/dream pop one earlier.
indieheads,3dr0fh,Segal-train,5,Sat Jul 18 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Yeah it was your post that got me thinking about it. I also think shoegaze would be a good genre to start out with since it isn't exactly a huge genre.
indieheads,3dr0fh,number90901,3,Sat Jul 18 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"I do think it's a good one to start with! I have a lot of good resources on shoegaze saved in tabs on my browser, I'd be happy to contribute!"

indieheads,3dr0fh,Apotheosis91,3,Sat Jul 18 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"Pre-Human Ideas wasn't very well received... But it was kind of a throwaway project that he did for fun anyway that is basically him playing with autotune. Nearly everything else though is worth checking out.

indieheads,3dr0fh,Trionout,5,Sat Jul 18 17:52:21 2015 UTC,I like it a lot. I have never used a streaming service before and am amazed by how easy it is to listen to new albums. Probably 75% of the music I listened to last week was new to me.
indieheads,3dr0fh,Apotheosis91,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest appeal for me. I don't want to pay for an album I'm not sure I'll enjoy, but getting a hand on it via torrents is becoming increasingly difficult. Being able to listen to an album in full before buying it is a huge plus."
indieheads,3dr0fh,Segal-train,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"Loving the personalized playlists, the freaking algorithm knows what I like already! And I'm a sucker for Apple so...  Anyway, I don't think I'll keep the subscription after the trial because Spotify free works well enough for me."
indieheads,3dr0fh,stu_balls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"I like it because it allows me to seamlessly blend streaming with my itunes library, and the disjointedness between the two was one of my major reasons for not using streaming services. Unfortunately, I'm way behind the times and my ipod won't support saved Apple Music tracks, but I'm hoping to upgrade soon. Provided I have the ability to do so, I'll definitely be keeping my subscription after the trial.

indieheads,3dr0fh,ManlyDrinks,2,Sat Jul 18 18:19:55 2015 UTC,I remember being curious about them when Fantano said they were sample-based in his best of 2010. Do they have kind of an Avalanches vibe? I need more Avalanches vibes in my life.
indieheads,3dr0fh,stu_balls,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:26 2015 UTC,Not the same atmosphere but they are phenomenal. Check out The Lemon Of Pink and/or Thought For Food.   Thought For Food is my personal favorite (they sample bloody It's Always Sunny) but most people seem to like Lemon Of Pink more.   Paul De Jong (one half of the band) released a solo album earlier this year. P good.

indieheads,3dr0fh,MachiaveIli,20,Sat Jul 18 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is Jamie XX the most mainstream sounding indie artist to hit big recently? Like seriously, I can see him getting Foster the People/MGMT-style treatment on this sub if he had actually made it to top 40. I think people just like to indulge their closeted love for pop on Jamie XX before it becomes uncool to like him. Maybe I just think this because I'm bitter that I can't get into him. Thoughts?"
indieheads,3dr0fh,Apotheosis91,13,Sat Jul 18 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'm a big fan of his new album and I don't really think of him as mainstream-sounding. His style is very diverse and strays from the popular EDM formula as well as from other indie-tronica groups like Chvrches or Purity Ring."
indieheads,3dr0fh,idonotownakindle,13,Sat Jul 18 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"He's hitting big because The XX hit big a few years ago and he's just surfing that wave (he's called Jamie XX for a reason).   That said, I don't really think the album deserves the huge amount of praise/visibility it has been getting."
indieheads,3dr0fh,Apotheosis91,7,Sat Jul 18 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"That's true, I don't think the album deserved a 9.3 from the 'almighty p4k' and it is somewhat overrated but I still think it's a great electronic album."

I don't see many people berating radiohead, and they are(were) one of the most popular bands in the world"
indieheads,3dr0fh,bad_posture,5,Sat Jul 18 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what he's going for. In Colour was a huge platform for him and rather than making the groundbreaking experimental album he's capable of, that would have put him alongside the likes of Nicolas Jaar and Arca, he made a choice to go for the pop appeal and ended up with an album of generic and lazily written quasi-EDM tunes. In Colour felt totally compromised in terms of what he's capable of as a producer, and for me that's why it was such a bitter disappointment."
indieheads,3dr0fh,Killatrap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:10 2015 UTC,Yeah because you're totally aware of his mindset right?
indieheads,3dr0fh,Andock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well no, but the way record has been promoted and given the nature of most of its content, it reads pretty clearly as a move towards crossover appeal as opposed to further experimentation. The record speaks for itself, that's just my understanding of it."
indieheads,3dr0fh,jamaicanhopscotch,2,Sun Jul 19 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think people forget the xx are an Indie Pop band and are already in the mainstream. Just because they make Indie music does not mean they're some underground band. They're debut album was number three in the charts and Coexist was number 1. People are away of Jamie, it's not like he's some hidden gem.   What do you mean if he had made it into the top 40? We're New Here was 33 and this was number 3. Main reason why the singles wouldn't hit the top 40 is the some of them (girl, sleep, gosh, loud places) of them were released online way before.  I see this album as more of a transition album for the xx (so that their next album won't be seen such as a big change) I can see reviews probably looking back to In Colour (which Romy and Oliver are heavily involved in) as the turning point of the xx making more accessible, or more upbeat if you like music."

indieheads,3dr0fh,stu_balls,2,Sat Jul 18 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to this, but I can't express how fantastic the new Hop Along record is. Frances Quinlan has the most exciting vocal ability in indie rock currently (imo). She's a great songwriter as well, and covers a large range of topics over the course of the album. The way she can write these big, scream-along choruses in songs about talking to Jehovah's Witnesses, or helplessly witnessing familial abuse, is very impressive. The music itself is fantastic - it takes cues from Neil Young, Springsteen, a little Pavement, a little Midwest Emo/math rock, some punk, grunge, etc. They bring it all together in a very refreshing way. There's a good chance that this ends up being my AOTY."

I think they are both excellent albums but I do prefer UMO's because I think he approached a similar idea in a more tight, cohesive and inventive manner. Currents is still one of my favorite releases of the year but I feel like it is a little more homogeneous as well as a little on the long side."
indieheads,3dr0fh,jamaicanhopscotch,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"I posted something similar a few days ago in the sub. Multi-Love is one the very best albums of the year for me and it's a shame that it hasn't been getting the same level of recognition as Currents (which is excellent too, but I think I prefer UMO's latest)."
indieheads,3dr0fh,heavy-pop,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:04 2015 UTC,I totally agree! Ruban has totally hit his stride and made the best album of his career but I doubt the album will rank highly on many year-end lists because of the countless other great releases this year.
indieheads,3dr0fh,WhatWouldSpaderDo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I relate more to Currents than Multi-Love considering one is about a breakup and the other is about some girl, you and your girl are into, or something. Multi-Love isn't as clear on its message as Currents, and I wouldn't have even known what Mulit-Love was about if I hadn't read up on it. I like what Currents is about. Kevin's talking to himself about a breakup. He's looking at it from all angles which makes this thing an almost cubist breakup record. It's like he wants you to hear him this time on Currents. Kevin stopped stretching his syllables and drowning his voice in the mix. As opposed to Lonerism where his voice was maybe subconsciously hidden, which only emphasized the album's theme.   Multi-Love is musically more adventurous than Currents, but where Currents loses in musical dexterity, it makes up for in straight-up soul. Soul is an unquantifiable construct that can only really be felt, and is entirely subjective. You either feel it, or you don't. I also like my psychedelia to come with a bit of groove. I always dug The Zombies more than early Pink Floyd and such. Currents just has a thicker groove. It seems more organic.   I love both records. Before Currents and Depression Cherry, I had Multi-Love as my 2nd favorite album of the year, but I put Currents right above it. As a soulhead I'm really liking this updated version of pysch-soul/funk that people are doing. It's a good time."
indieheads,3dr0fh,Trionout,3,Sat Jul 18 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I haven't really delved into the lyrics of Currents but it sounds worthwhile. I think the three-way love story of Multi-Love is really fascinating. I too hope that the psych-soul style that these albums use becomes more popular"

indieheads,3dms2k,jasonham,37,Fri Jul 17 15:17:19 2015 UTC,"I tell this story a lot.  It's 2009. I'm a freshman at UConn, slowly meeting people but still feeling a bit alienated. I see SSPU is touring with Cage the Elephant - they're playing Providence, where one of my best friends from home goes. I talk to him, we get tickets, I take a bus to RI. We get in line extremely early - it's my first GA show, and we're right up front on the left-hand side.  The show starts. An Horse is the first opener, they play a great set. (Later, I tried to say hi at their merch booth and bought a CD - they were the biggest d-bags in the world). Cage is just now blowing up, so their show is fucking popping, crowd surfers and rowdiness ahoy. Matt Schulz pretends to have a seizure during Back Against The Wall, spraying sweat all over me, it's rad.  Then SSPU comes on. I've been obsessed with them for 3 years, ever since I bought Carnavas. I'm screaming along to every word. I'm calling out requests that end up perfectly matching the setlist. Nikki, the bassist, keeps looking over at me, but Brian, the lead singer, is focused on the right-hand side.  Finally, they dig into Lazy Eye to end the main set. Brian starts the guitar solo and Nikki nods at him in my direction. He's shredding so hard and there's so much reverb there's a five-second delay on his solo. He proceeds to walk over to me and my friends, reach down and shake my hand mid-solo without missing a beat.  Other than Win Butler stealing my phone from the front of GA during the Reflektour, it's my favorite concert memory. So obvs I'm pumped for this new record."
indieheads,3dms2k,pajamalamaobama,13,Fri Jul 17 17:12:39 2015 UTC,I wanna hear that Win Butler story.
indieheads,3dms2k,canti28,13,Fri Jul 17 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that interesting, at least in context of the Reflektour itself. Anyone who went to one of those shows last year knows that during either Reflektor or Flashbulb Eyes, whichever one was earliest in the set, Win would walk out on a short stage extension that bordered the crowd, where front-row GA members would be excitedly snapping pictures, and grab a phone or two, taking selfies or making phone calls (usually miming it) before returning the phone (or tossing it into the crowd and breaking it, like I heard happened at one of the Chicago shows).  So, I'm an Arcade Fire superfan. Bought all their albums on release day, pre-ordered Reflektor specifically to get a presale code, been telling everyone I know about how good they are for the last decade. I get (overpriced) GA tickets for the show in Bridgeport, CT and drive myself and my now-ex down. I took a half day off work, we get there at 4 for doors at 6:30, it's the usual superfan thing. We get pizza, end up going from fifth in line to 20th, but then the line splinters to two doors so we go back to about eighth.  I'm wearing some stupid Regular Show Halloween costume, we get in, I literally leave my then-GF behind (she caught up, don't worry) and run as fast as I can into the arena, where everyone's confused by the two-stage set-up (a second stage in the back of the GA pit where Kid Koala and Dan Deacon would play their opening sets and where Regine and the Bobbleheads would periodically dart off to during the show). I use this confusion to plant myself at slightly-stage-left, which ends up being right in front of the stage extension.  So fast-forward to the show opening. They come out, start playing Reflektor, I'm crying, it's a whole thing. So then they go into Flashbulb Eyes, and I'll narrate it from my point of view.  ""Wow, this is so cool, but Flashbulb is kind of a shitty song so I'll just snap some pics. Wow, Win's really coming close to us. Wait, he's rushing us. Oh god he's running right at me, I'd better get some good pictures. Wait, Win, what the fuck- Why- You took the phone out of my hand - Why did you do that - Win please give back my phone - Win why are you making a phone call - Win plz - Oh thank god he remembered it was my phone and gave it back, whew.""  I put it away for most of the rest of the show after learning this lesson from him. When I finally checked to see what he had done in the 45 seconds he had it, it looked like he tried to take a selfie on it while pretending to make a phone call but didn't press the right button, so instead of Win's big mug I got a really cool abstract picture of the lighting system in the arena, kind of a ghostly blue and black image.  I ended up meeting him by chance a few months later when I volunteered for Partners in Health at their show in Massachusetts. He got lost trying to find the entrance during soundcheck - he'd been balling with friends near the ampitheatre - and ended up stumbling upon the volunteers right before we went inside. He's really fucking tall, nice as could be.  That's the story."

indieheads,3dms2k,Rossegut,2,Fri Jul 17 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Thats awesome! I have a similar story from when I went to see them on the same tour, only Manchester Orchestra played instead of An Horse. I was right up front with my friends and I was really into SSPU at this point and was singing along with every word and watching Nikki to figure out a bunch of the parts that I couldn't figure out. She noticed and towards the end of the set at the end of a song she reached out and gave me her pick. At the end of the set I got her setlist as well and she drew a really cool giraffe on it before the show. Those dudes are the best."

It's not the most fascinating record, but fans should be glad that they're still pumping out new tunes."
indieheads,3dmz5z,art36,4,Fri Jul 17 20:21:12 2015 UTC,I think you can apply this line to pretty much all their albums after A Ghost is Born.

indieheads,3dmz5z,SlightlyBiased,28,Fri Jul 17 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Star Wars is just a very fun record. From its random album title and track names to the neat cat cover, this album isn't taking itself too seriously by any means. I've listened to the album twice and while it isn't all that memorable, I think it's an enjoyable listen. The electric guitars are a nice change of pace for Wilco and the songs are all upbeat and infectious; there isn't really an anthem to be found on this record. Wilco is obviously past their prime but this album proves that they are still worthwhile. You can't ask for a whole lot more from a surprise release by a band at this point in their career.   7/10"
indieheads,3dmz5z,willforthrill,8,Fri Jul 17 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"As I've written elsewhere, this is the kind of album you should expect and appreciate from a group of aged musicians who don't feel the need to brood and prove themselves to the world any longer but instead choose to write and play more enjoyable music at this stage of their careers and lives."

It is growing on me really quickly though. Songs sound like they would be fun to watch live too so I will have to see Wilco next time they come around.
indieheads,3dmz5z,JeffGoldblumsCat,4,Fri Jul 17 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything already said. It's fun, and I think a big reason for that is how short it is. Taste the Ceiling is definitely my favorite track. Sounds like classic Wilco. Star Wars definitely isn't their best, but it's also far from a bad record. It'll get plenty more listens from me.   edit: grammar"
indieheads,3dmz5z,woweezowee34,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying Wilco is easily one of my favorite bands of all time, them and pavement are 1/1a. But since SBS something has been off about Wilco, I haven't enjoyed much of it since that one outside of a couple songs on each album. But this one is clicking with me. I'm loving the fuzzy tones, loving the catchy melodies, and absolutely love that they've gone back to experimenting with some noise again like on ""You Satellite."" This one feels the most cohesive since SBS. I've only given this a few listens so far but I'm gonna say it's their best since Ghost. Can't wait to stream Pitchfork tonight and check out some live versions."
indieheads,3dmz5z,art36,3,Fri Jul 17 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say something is off so much as they've matured and would like to explore more carefree music perhaps. Tweedy had some pretty shitty periods in his life and experiences that helped to mold his classic Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The band are a bunch off older musicians who might not want to brood and make ""meaningful"" music anymore and just feel like sharing some music they enjoy writing and playing at this stage in their career, which I think they are most entitled to do."

indieheads,3dmz5z,sedgwickian,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it. Too early to have really coherent thoughts yet, but it sounds like these are songs that maybe started in the Tweedy record sessions, put through the Wilco ringer. There are some lyrical themes that tie into those Tweedy tracks (esp. in ""Where do I begin,"" but elsewhere too), but of course the music surrounding it has a fuzzed out guitars and slightly off-kilter feel that screams Wilco.  Makes me wonder what that Tweedy album would have sounded like as a Wilco album (although I dig the Tweedy record as is, too)."
indieheads,3dmz5z,ChrisChrispie,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:05 2015 UTC,It's pretty good in my opinion. Especially the last song.
indieheads,3dmz5z,VanillaSweat,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty straight forward and accessible, but that is simply a neutral statement. Considering this is my first run in with Wilco (I know I'm a terrible person :P) I am really digging it. I'm assuming Wilco has some much more experimental or not so much straight forward work in their discography. My question is, if I really like what I'm hearing, what album by Wilco do you think I should listen to next, like is this a new sound for them?"
indieheads,3dmz5z,daButtah1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"Not terrible at all! It's cool to hear the perspective of someone who's never listened to Wilco before. You should check out Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. It's by far their most acclaimed/revered/treasured record with a really cool backstory if you are into that.  Also, Sky Blue Sky (Grammy-Nominated) is an album from their later discography that's very good, very accessble and with songs that were used in car commercials and stuff."
indieheads,3dmz5z,art36,2,Fri Jul 17 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like Wilco has the skills and experience to make another masterpiece, but decided to fuck around instead, but because they're Wilco it's still amazing.  Also releasing an album called Star Wars for free with a giant cat on the cover sounds like a joke started on reddit."
indieheads,3dmz5z,randomenchilada,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:16 2015 UTC,Looks like they're playing the entire album straight through at Pitchfork fest (Watching the stream now).

indieheads,3dmz5z,daButtah1,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't really enjoy Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (sorry) is there any chance I'll like this? I'm going to listen to it regardless but if I don't like YHF I doubt I'll like anything by them, which is disappointing because clearly I'm missing out."
indieheads,3dmz5z,canadadam,3,Fri Jul 17 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on why you didn't like YHF. Star Wars is similar to the more conventional songs (think Kamera or Heavy Metal Drummer) but the instrumentation is more focused on crunchy guitars over acoustic guitars. Also the parts are much looser and weirder. If you hated the crazy sound effects/loops of YHF than you might not like stars wars; there's not really a lot of soundscapey parts, but there is a lot of guitar feedback spread throughout.  I would listen to more... (The second song) and decide from there. The album is pretty singular in focus so if you like that, you would probably like the rest.   I'm not sure if you like other Wilco or you just tried yankee hotel foxtrot, but I would also give summerteeth a listen  Edit: didn't read you're last paragraph carefully enough...I'm not changing anything just disregard the last line."

indieheads,3dmz5z,canadadam,2,Sat Jul 18 00:18:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on why you disliked YHF. Do you dislike sort of easy listening ""dad-rock""? If so you probably will dislike this album too."

I do agree with what a lot of people are saying in that it's hard to expect much from Wilco at this stage in their careers, but the fact that they continue to make albums is promising.    A lot of people seem to not be giving ""Whole Love"" a lot of credit.  ""Capitol City"" is a top-notch song from them.  Art of Almost, I Love My Label,"" and ""Whole Love"" are also great tracks as well."

indieheads,3drle8,WadeYaeger,7,Sat Jul 18 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"I'll give an upfront criticism. It's not good. Way too low quality recording. Work on your singing, build your confidence. Up the volume. Get creative with your sounds because it's really bland right now. Work on your lyrics too, fix your timing too. You've got ways to go, but everyone starts somewhere. Good luck.   Edit-You're not going to get better if you ignore advice and continue to spam your music."
indieheads,3drle8,OZZMANDIAS,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"The lo-fi guitar sounds pretty cool, but you need to add some crisper sounds in there for some contrast and to ease up the monotony.  And the vocals are frankly dismal. Sounds completely separate from the music itself and they're not mixed correctly at all. Lyrics are pretty bad but that's something that just requires some more time to work out. The repetition really gets on ones nerves though, try to add some more variety."
indieheads,3dmyxz,jeremyirons911,46,Fri Jul 17 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"More of a session player but I think Pino Palladino certainly deserves some credit. Most recently he played on D'Angelo's Black Messiah, Hesitation Marks by Nine Inch Nails, and Adele's 21. He's also played on albums for Erykah Badu, Bilal, and Common, as well as D'Angelo's Voodoo, and has been The Who's touring bassist for about ten years. He's not a big name but has a huge reputation among artists, with Trent Reznor calling him ""probably the best bass player in the world."" I don't know how much anyone trusts Trent Reznors opinion, but the guys body of work is pretty impressive either way."
indieheads,3dmyxz,Apotheosis91,14,Fri Jul 17 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"All of those groups and albums are amazing and testaments to Pino's ability, but his work with the John Mayer Trio is particularly slept on. Mayer can shred and Pino and Steve Jordan are both amazing session musicians."
indieheads,3dmyxz,perpetuallypissed,11,Fri Jul 17 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"Mayer is really well respected in the blues community, even if he's a little flashy. I know it's not cool to say it, but he's a pretty talented musician. John Mayer Trio is great."

The National Anthem is great, and his closest thing to a riff. Yet he also has some amazing grooves like in 15 Step or Airbag, where he comes in and out, as well as Seperator and How to Disappear Completely, where he builds incredibly intricate and effective basslines.   Radiohead is my favorite band, and all members are fantastic at creating a cohesive sound, and Colin Greenwood is no exception."

indieheads,3dmyxz,gugs,61,Sun Jul 19 22:00:21 2015 UTC,I think Thundercat is probably my favorite active bassist. His influence is really obvious on any collaborations he's involved with and his solo stuff is full of crazy basslines too. Wesley's Theory is my favorite song of the year so far.
indieheads,3dmyxz,mellotronIII,13,Fri Jul 17 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"Thundercat is tooooo good, man. He can lay down some funky-ass shit like he does all over To Pimp a Butterfly, and is also capable of playing the bass really melodically and getting these very sweet tones out of it. Plus he has a golden voice on top of all of that.  edit: forgot a link to this performance of his"
indieheads,3dmyxz,willforthrill,20,Fri Jul 17 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"Overall, I hate ranking musicians and quantify any one as the ""best"" just because there are so many metrics to take into consideration.   That being said, I have to go with Chris Pravdica of Swans. I saw Swans live back in April and I'd never seen someone play the bass the way that he does. All of hard-hitting riffs on To Be Kind that sound like they are being played by the guitar is actually played on the bass. Chris Pravdica wields the bass guitar like a nuclear weapon and it's incredible. However, Kevin Parkers bass riffs are all very smooth and catchy and awesome so idk."

indieheads,3dmyxz,i_am_thoms_meme,21,Sat Jul 18 04:43:36 2015 UTC,So this might be a dumb answer but what about Jesse F. Keeler (of DFA 1979)? He might not be the most technical of bassists but he plays a lot of really sweet and catchy riffs.  edit: not the most technical
indieheads,3dmyxz,Apotheosis91,12,Fri Jul 17 17:30:32 2015 UTC,Jesse certainly has one of the most distinctive sounds of any bass player out there. His basslines may be simple but his tone and the range he pulls out of that bass is crazy

indieheads,3dmyxz,PCCP82,13,Fri Jul 17 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Victor Wooten probably has the most impressive chops I've ever seen. But then again I don't think ppl still do slap bass a lot either
indieheads,3dmyxz,racer_xtc,26,Fri Jul 17 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is cheating, but Carlos D. (formerly) of Interpol.  Cheating because he pays homage to the role of the bassist in classic post-punk bands of the '70s-80s like Gang of Four, Joy Division, PIL, etc.  Between post-punk, funk and reggae (and reggae-inspired pop), that was a golden era for bass lines."
indieheads,3dmyxz,Apotheosis91,10,Fri Jul 17 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Man, Carlos D was incredible in his prime. The interaction between him and Sam's drums on Obstacle 1? Wheeeeeeew"
indieheads,3dmyxz,racer_xtc,6,Fri Jul 17 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'm re-listening to familiarize myself with what you're referencing, and GODDAMN that's a spot on comment.  During the verse, there's just that simple pulsing guitar beat, but so much interesting stuff happening in-between with the rhythm section.  Carlos goes on quick bass runs which Sam adeptly compliments with a cool kick drum fill.  Very nice example!"
indieheads,3dmyxz,Apotheosis91,5,Fri Jul 17 19:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. During the ""we can cap the old times"" part of the verses. That back-and-forth they have is insanely intricate, one of my favourite moments in their discography. The first verse of Narc is another great example of how their rhythms fit together. A simple guitar progression on the beat, but all this craziness going on underneath.   Here's a Carlos D quote talking about the rhythm section from P4K's TOTBL Retrospective:   For me, it was like having John Bonham in the band, like the best of both worlds: I can be in the pure universe of floating melodies and melancholy textures, but underneath I get my Bonham fix, where I can land my bass notes. It was fucking magic."

However, the fact that she's a great bassist, singer, and composer at the same time puts her up there imo.  Honourable mentions...  I also slightly agree with Thundercat. as a bassist, I think he plays a lot of unnecessary notes, but the way he demanded respect out of the industry is impressive.  Victor Wooten is obviously the most technically impressive, but that isn't enough to be the best. He does have great grooves though, and is all around a nice guy.  Michael League of Snarky Puppy gets a lot of talk in the bassist community, I see why, but I don't know enough to say anything. If you're looking for modern Jazz, check out Snarky Puppy though.  Keigo Iwami - I'm not sure if he was the bassist for them when they released ""Hello everyone. Nice to meet you. We are Midori"", but if he was, he had some fucking insane grooves."
indieheads,3dmyxz,hiplink,2,Fri Jul 17 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"Snarky Puppy    In all honesty, these guys kind of bore me. I like a few cuts from Tell Your Friends and Ground UP.

I dunno if I'm just not that critical anymore, or if I'm just more likely to be forgiving towards bands I already like, but I totally dig this album.  I thought it went in a fun direction, and I think I'm going to end up liking it just as much as their other releases.    I guess I can see some of the complaints, but on the whole it just seems like people fell victim to the hype train."

indieheads,3dn50l,xen0cide,16,Fri Jul 17 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think people are just resistant to change in any part of their life  even if it's someone's musical direction. Yes, this is an over-exaggeration but this comes up all the time when artists change - no matter the medium. People can't distance themselves enough from previous works to appreciate progress - and a standalone masterpiece. Of course, I don't know how good Currents actually is  as I have not partaken in listening to it yet but this is just a general sentiment I have seen in today's world."

indieheads,3dn50l,TheMissoula,3,Fri Jul 17 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"That is a true sentiment. If it's not a calculated improvement, then it would not appease many people. But given how subjective music is, I guess that is why there is so much argument about the change."

The album feels off...It's enjoyable the first listen but the second time I heard I was already tired of it. The songwriting isn't on par with Lonerism imo. And even if I ignored Tame Impala's previous albums, it would still be an ok record, nothing too special. Certainly not anywhere close to a 9.3..."

It is always interesting, even if I don't enjoy it. I think a large part of that has come from making those kind of decisions for myself, were you decide to grow, change and move on from different parts of your life.  I really enjoy the lyric ""They say people never change, but that's bullshit, they do"" on Yes, I'm Changing. It really stuck out to me and resonated.

indieheads,3dn50l,PCCP82,5,Fri Jul 17 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"That was such a cringy line though. He didn't really change that much, and it was a change in a more accessible, easy-to-listen-to direction. Sorta lame all the way around IMO."

indieheads,3dn50l,Apotheosis91,8,Fri Jul 17 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"I finally listened to the new Four Tet yesterday and I really enjoyed it. It felt like a perfect return to the warmth and organic palate of There Is Love In You while still incorporating the more agressive pirate radio influence of Beautiful Rewind. It combined the best of both albums in a really interesting format. Plus the use of different Ragas for the morning and evening sides was really conceptually interesting. A great listen overall and definitely something I'll be coming back to throughout the year.   I also revisited Spirit They've Gone, Spirit They've Vanished on a whim (last time I heard it was three years ago) and hot damn I loved it more than any other AnCo album I've heard so far. I'm going to start going back through their discography and see if this is finally the kick that gets me to stop worrying and love the AnCo.  Also what's the general opinion on the purpose of the For Your Consideration writeups? I know we started with the idea of ""albums you think should be on the essentials"" but for me it's kind of outgrown that. I see it as more of a ""hey, here's an album that I think deserves your attention, and here's why."" There's a lot of albums I'd love to write about for you guys that sit outside the normal sphere of this sub's listening habits, and I think FYC is a great place to do that, but I don't want to bother if it would just garner a bunch of ""how is this indie"" comments."
indieheads,3dn50l,jamaicanhopscotch,5,Fri Jul 17 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"My initial appeal with AnCo is they had this Sydney Barrett charm working.....weren't afraid to make something that was out there and sounded like nothing else....  As they have gotten older; so have I. It helped that they were dudes who were from the same area as myself, just non bros doing different stuff than wearing backwards white hats and seeing Dave Matthews"
indieheads,3dn50l,Apotheosis91,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to experience AnCo sort of outside of time like I have. I was too young to be paying attention when they really started making waves, so for me they actually embody a kind of timelessness. Spirit and Sung Tongs feel like they could have come out of any era. Actually, one of the first things that really renewed my interest was a P4K writeup on Sung Tongs that contrasted it with most music being released at the time, and it really made me think. In the post-Bon Iver era of lo-fi dominance, it's really cool to think about how in a period of blown-out, over-the-top brassiness and melodrama, they were making this hushed and intimate music that was totally radical for its time.   You make a good point about the unassuming nature of their music. A lot of it feels like a part of their daily lives, something that just happened to be recorded but would have happened even if it wasn't. I'm really curious about stuff like Campfire Songs, which is literally just one live session on a porch (same with Hollinndagin, although it being a live show is a little different). Coming from a totally different background than they do, it's still very resonant to consider how exposed their early material is, and how much their discography documents their evolution as people."

I don't think I really need to impress her with my music taste as we've been together 4 years already, just that she doesn't particularly have time to listen to a lot of music - other than what is playing on the radio.

My most hyped release rn though is the next Swans LP bc I've been to their live show and I've heard their new material and I can confirm that it'll be up to the standard of their last two releases. Most albums are just kind of abstract concepts in my mind until I actually hear them, making the wait not that bad. But knowing how awesome the next Swans LP is gonna be is making this wait hurt."
indieheads,3dn50l,PCCP82,4,Fri Jul 17 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, being honest Radiohead's next album is probably my most hyped.  I got really into music after the release of The King of Limbs, and Radiohead kind of opened the floodgates for me"

indieheads,3dn50l,wehaveherpes,3,Fri Jul 17 20:26:12 2015 UTC,Just saw The National at Eaux Claires for the first time and it was hands down the best concert of my life.  I can't even believe how amazing it was.  I stood for 6 hours to get a good spot and ended up second row from the front right in the middle.  So worth it  I touched Matt's head and at one point he chucked a can of beer into the crowd that hit the guy standing next to me's chest and exploded all over me.  I cried tears of joy  Oh also Spoon was fantastic and The Staves were very good as well.

indieheads,3dn50l,VanillaSweat,2,Fri Jul 17 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"So I listened for the first time in years to If I ever feel better by Phoenix. I never got into them, so where should I start?"
indieheads,3dn50l,ReconEG,4,Fri Jul 17 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"These are in order. I think Phoenix is best when they're most danceable, so Wolfgang and It's Never Been Like That are my favorite. If I Ever Feel Better is the best song they've ever done. It might be the best dance song anybody's ever done.   United is kinda disjointed but it serves as an example of everything the band has done. Really weird, considering it's their first album. I only ever listen to Too Young and If I Ever Feel Better anymore, which are two of their best songs by far.  Alphabetical is by far their most mellow in that 70s fm radio kinda way. Think Phoenix doing Fleetwood Mac. I haven't listened to this one as much.  It's Never Been Like That is just full of nice pop rock tunes. It's thoroughly enjoyable and probably their most consistent album front to back, but it doesn't quite have the massive singles that United and WAP have.  Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is by far their most catchiest and danceable album and build from the sounds of If I Ever Feel Better and Too Young from United. It's pretty perfect apart from the 8 minutes that Love Like A Sunset take up in the middle of the album.   Bankrupt! sounds huge and goes more electronic/synthy. It's bigger without being as danceable, but it's still enjoyable enough."

Homogenic I listened to because it's on the Essentials list but Vulnicura was amazing all the way through. I know I'm not the best judge yet but I thought its songs were the most compelling of hers that I'd heard.

indieheads,3drkar,WhatWouldSpaderDo,41,Sat Jul 18 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"No. It's not. At all. I have to say, ""Cause I'm a Man"" is probably my favorite song on the album, and is also the one that comes the closest to falling under the vaporwave category. However, I'm sick of everything that sounds remotely like it was influenced by chill 80s/90s Music being labeled as such. I like the vaporwave genre, but It's really disappointing to see it become such a cesspool of parodies and knockoffs, when there are passionate artists who want to legitimately create music in that genre."
indieheads,3drkar,Parkmayn,15,Sat Jul 18 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like vaporwave is almost like the punk genre in the 70s, as most bands follow this strict formula that makes the genre parody itself, very similar to how people inspired by punk would follow the same stereotypes to be ""punk"" (Leather jackets and mohawks). Because everyone was following this formula, punk music was actually losing it's core values of being anti conformist by literally being conformist . Post punk was a result of punk music becoming a parody of itself, and it attempted to reach new artistic ground by having influences from genres other than punk (Best examples being Gang of Four, Joy Division, and the Pop Group). What I'm trying to say is that the way vapor wave is becoming a parody of itself (""lel im so aesthetic"") is very similar to what happened to punk music."

But they're a band whose catalog runs a wide gamut of guitar genres. I, like you, found them via YHF. If you get a chance, see them live, because all of the genre-hopping will make perfect sense in that context. They go from country to noise to 'dad rock' to experimental rock and back, and you'll learn to love it all.  Summerteeth after A Ghost is Born, though! Then Being There. Then choose your own adventure after that.  Enjoy it, I wish I could discover them all over again!"

Being There and The Whole Love are both really good surveys of all their sounds. I'd say start with those albums before you delve into the brilliance of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born.  Really all their albums are great."
indieheads,3dkac9,bisquit_jowitch,18,Fri Jul 17 01:19:00 2015 UTC,Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Summerteeth are required listening.

However, staring out my AirBnB apartment window out at Chicago while listening to the record feels really special to me.

indieheads,3dm420,hiplink,8,Fri Jul 17 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"My 3x3  Pavement - Wowee Zowee - This is the first album I've heard from Pavement. I first heard of the band when I was 14 and I promised myself I'd listen to them soon. I'm now 18, and it is only this week I'm hearing them. Actually, I'm really annoyed that I'd deprived myself of their music because this album is spectacularly good. Very inventive and still rather modern sounding despite being 20 years old. If Pavement's other albums are as good, I'm in for a treat.  My Bloody Valentine - Loveless - Well, not much can be said about this album. I've heard it countless times and it is not any less impressive than when I first heard it.  St Vincent - Actor - Easily my favourite album from Annie along with her self titled. Even though the first half is much stronger than the second half, it is a nice listen overall.   Deerhunter - Halcyon Digest - This was another first listen for me. Very strong album, but I think I need to spend much more time with it to actually collate any thoughts.  Sufjan Stevens - Carrie and Lowell - It was raining pretty badly in my town, so I decided to listen to something pretty comfy. Easily one of my favourite albums to come out this year. Probably one of my only gripes with the album is the first half of All of Me Wants All of You. Something about it just doesn't sit well with me.  Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot - The only Wilco album I've ever heard. Pretty nostalgic album for me; I used to listen to it all the time when I was 15, but I haven't listened to it as much recently. Pot Kettle Black is an amazing track.  Mobb Deep - The Infamous - I was once getting my haircut when the hairdresser was playing this on her laptop. So, this album will forever be associated with haircuts for me.  Beach House - Teen Dream  - Wow. Wow wow wow. Lovely album, but not as strong as Depression Cherry which is my album of the year so far.  Grizzly Bear - Shields - As much as I love this album, it is easily my least favourite album from them. I hope their new album is more inspired by the sound of Horn of Plenty and Yellow House."

Their career was pretty much leading up to the sound that Hell on Earth has, it's more Mobb Deep than their most acclaimed album."
indieheads,3dm420,hiplink,5,Fri Jul 17 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with that record, but I prefer The Infamous. Thanks for suggesting something though :)"
indieheads,3dm420,bostonbruins922,6,Fri Jul 17 21:04:23 2015 UTC,The only Wilco album I've ever heard.   You need to fix that ASAP. They just released a new album for free on their site. Its pretty great! I would also recommend listening to more of their older stuff. Really solid band.
indieheads,3dm420,hiplink,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:07 2015 UTC,I've actually been kinda afraid to listen to their other albums as I've heard that they are generally not that good. I don't want to tarnish the image of the band I have.  What album do you recommend ?
indieheads,3dm420,Runstradamus,3,Fri Jul 17 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Summerteeth was a great album as well, it come chronologically before YHF and is a good lead in to the sound of YHF. Sky Blue Sky is really good too - it's a lot more relaxing and laid back than most of their other albums."
indieheads,3dm420,bostonbruins922,3,Fri Jul 17 18:30:56 2015 UTC,Man they are one of the best bands going. My personal favorite is Sly Blue Sky.
indieheads,3dm420,TheAllStarrBand,3,Fri Jul 17 23:36:45 2015 UTC,Being There is pretty fun if you're looking for something more country-ish. Summerteeth is the most acclaimed besides YHF though.
indieheads,3dm420,eftj,7,Sat Jul 18 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"3x3  Currents - I love the first half of this album + Cause I'm a Man and Disciples. The last few songs and Past Life peter out pretty hard, IMO, but I still enjoy it as an album.  Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill - There was a thread a while back where people pitched weird genres and people provided artists in that genre. Folkgaze was suggested, and Grouper was listed as an artist. This is one of my favourite discoveries this year now, it's a stunning album, my favourite by Grouper.  A Dream Outside - I saw Gengahr live a while back when they supported Dry the River, at the time, I thought they were pretty good. They just released their first full album and it's really great. Indie Rock with some poppy elements, ""Dizzy Ghosts"" is one of my favourite album openers in a long time.  Depression Cherry - I really wanted to like Beach House, it took me til this album to be able to appreciate them, which is weird because I love DreamPop. Anyway, this album is great, really enjoying it.  The rest are albums I love and have listened to a lot."
indieheads,3dm420,snowybrickman,7,Fri Jul 17 12:41:04 2015 UTC,"Here we go  NEW STUFF  Tame Impala - Currents 8/10  Not as good as Lonerism, but still think the experimentation was worth it. The only unlistenable track is Past Life imo.  Knwledge - Hud Dreams 6.5/10  If you like Flylo, you'll like this. Albeit , not as good as anything Flylo has done, but still good hiphop, jazzy, glitch-based instrumentals. A lot of little vignette type tracks.  CZARFACE - Every Villain needs a Hero 9/10  Maybe my favorite rap album of the year behind TPAB, must listen if you like MF Doom or Wu Tang even a little bit.  Beach House - Depression Cherry 7.5/10  All around solid. Although I feel like all Beach House just blends together to me. I really like Sparks and Space Song.  Chemical Brothers - Born in the Echoes 6.5/10  Classic Chemical Brothers release. You either like them or you don't. Very solid features on the vocals though, Beck's track is probably my favorite. Again, a lot of their stuff blends together to me too.  Mac Demarco - Another One 6/10  Love Mac but this is just more of the same. This sounds like Salad Days b-sides. Obviously pleasant to listen to, but nothing special. Don't know how long this will last in rotation,  OLD STUFF  I love Childhood, Velvet Underground, and Zombies. These were just for fun."
indieheads,3dm420,gorill3,6,Fri Jul 17 14:00:52 2015 UTC,"6x6  Slowdive- Souvlaki  This has been on my 5x5 pretty much every week since I first heard it a couple months back. It gets better on every listen. The album is really cohesive and it took me repeated listens to differentiate the songs. The lyrics are heartbreaking and powerful. Favorite Tracks- When The Sun Hits & Dagger  Modest Mouse- The Moon & Antarctica  Probably my second favorite Modest Mouse album (after LCW). It's much more contained than the madness that was LCW. Favorite Track- Paper Thin Walls  Wilco- Star Wars  Really enjoyed this. This record packs some energy and I'm definitely going to be revisiting this. Favorite Tracks- More... & Magnetized  Tune-Yards- WHOKILL  My friend showed me Gangsta a few years back, but this was the first time I checked out the whole album. It's pretty good, but I don't know how much I will revisit this. Favorite Track- Gangsta  Animal Collective- Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished  This might be my favorite AnCo album (although I haven't checked out Feels yet). It's just all over the place and uncomfortable at times, but it's fantastic. Favorite Track- La Rapet"
indieheads,3dm420,princesa-real,3,Fri Jul 17 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've never heard of anyone who loved STGSTV and Alvin Row wasn't their favorite track!"
indieheads,3dm420,gorill3,3,Fri Jul 17 21:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely understand all of the praise that Alvin Row gets, since it's amazing. I would put it as my second favorite track (although after a few more listens it may knock off La Rapet)."
indieheads,3dm420,wehaveherpes,11,Sat Jul 18 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/91WPZLU.jpg  Really hip hop week sorry fam. I needed to listen to some classic stuff that I hadn't listened to at all.   De La Soul - 3 Feet High And Rising (1989)   Hadn't listened to this at all and it blew me away. Amazing rhymes and songs, great concepts. I think that another thing to appreciate is the general mood/tone of most hip hop at the time of 3FHAR's release, it's just a completely different feel and I can really dig that. And the other thing is that it's not like this album went from the sort of violent stuff that hip hop was centered around to a complete 180, this album isn't like all rainbows and happiness straight up. but it's just really about common stuff and to an extent, life in general, and that's why I love it. A+  Black Star - Mos Def & Talib Kweli are Black Star (2002)  This is my first project by both MC's and I think I still need a lot more time to think about this album and the racial message that it sends but I can definitely appreciate the beats and rhymes. Mos Def really intrigues me, his flow is really good on Astronomy (8th Light) and I also like his voice a lot. To be honest I don't think I like Talib as much but he's still amazing. undecided?? maybe an A? check back next week :)  Vince Staples - Summertime '06 (2015)  Far too much filler, especially on the 2nd half. 1st half is definitely far stronger, Senorita has a sick Future sample and the distorted vocals on Summertime are interesting. B-  A Tribe Called Quest - The Low End Theory (1991)  Q-Tip is a legend. A+  A$AP ROCKY - Live.Love.A$AP (2011)  My favorite Rocky release as well as my favorite A$AP release in general. Rockies flow is on point throughout the entire album, production is amazing especially the songs produced by Clams Casino. My personal favorites are Palace and Wassup. Also the ScHoolboy Q feature on Brand New Guys is ridiculously good, love it when two rappers are on a track in a style such as that, trading bars back and forth. I think that the album sort of loses speed after like Keep it G, but it's still a great mixtape. B+  BADBADNOTGOOD & Ghostface Killah - Sour Soul (2015)  This album has grown on me surprisngly. Didn't like it a lot at first but now I love love love the production, the tracks with features are great like Gunshowers and Ray Gun. This album was also my first exposure to Elzhi and now I love him. I think this album is top 10 hip hop this year and I really would love to see BBNG do something like this again with another rapper. A-  Tame Impala - Currents  This album is very good, besides one track that I'm not going to mention. Let It Happen might be my favorite Tame Impala song. the electronic style is definitely a direction most bands go one time or another, and this was definitely a great showing of how Kevin Parker is capable of more than just the psych rock from previous records. A-  Fang Island - Fang Island (2010)  This is a great summer album, partially instrumental math rock. If you like Hella check them out. I really love the cover of this too. B+  Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues (2011)  Thirsty for the new stuff pecknold where are you A+"

indieheads,3dm420,ShrekIsNotDrek,6,Fri Jul 17 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"I maintain that Thieves in the Night is one of the greatest rap songs ever, Mos Def's verse is on a completely different level.   For Mos Def definitely check out Black on Both Sides then The Ecstatic if you're looking for more, he's only got 3 albums but I think those two are his best.  For Talib Kweli if you want more Quality and Train of Thought, which is a collab with Hi-Tek producing, are both good starting points."

indieheads,3dm420,gorill3,5,Fri Jul 17 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"Black Star is fantastic. You should check out Mos's debut album Black on Both Sides, it's also great. Also Black Star came out in 1998."

indieheads,3dm420,Moon-Safari,6,Fri Jul 17 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"New listens this week (in chronological order) 3x4:  Glenn Branca - The Ascension (1981)  This is an essential no wave/noise rock record. The guitars are abrassive and pumping, but he also makes great use of silence and contrasts. Great record.  Islaja - Ulual Yyy (2007)  Someone from the sub gave me an essential freak folk chart and I decided to listen to this one. This one is from Scandinavia and you can really hear it by the traditional Scandinavian folk influences taht shimmer through. The instrumentation is also pretty diverse.  Fang Island - Fang Island (2010)  This is an energetic math rock album. I liked the melodies and rhythms, but I really didn't like the vocals. They somehow reminded me of some ""bros"" hanging out playing Halo in their basement if that makes sense to you.  Majical Cloudz - Impersonator (2013)  It's pretty music, but somehow also forgetable and not that unique. It sounded a bit cliche because of the reverb-drenched synths, slow beats and deep vocals.  of Montreal - Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse (2001)  Very good, but crazy album. Their typical Elephant 6 songs, but what this makes special is the narrative and the spoken-word tracks. It adds something to what already was a collection of good catchy songs. It may or may not become my favorite pre-Satanic Panic album.  Engineers - Three Fact Fader (2009)  Rock music with a lot of electronics that's kinda hypnotic. It's appealing at first, but not for an entire album.  The Dodos - Individ (2015)  This is some good indie rock. Nothing special, but I thought the rhythm guitar was very good. I'm not very fond of the song structures though. They ended some songs in a weird manner too.  Wire - Pink Flag (1977)  This album is really essential. It's the bridge between punk and post-punk imo. I'm not a big fan of regular punk, but this was appealing enough for me.  The Bird and the Bee - Recreational Love (2015)  Electropop album with a couple of very good songs, but if you listen to the entire album you will notice a lot of filler and that the album is getting boring. This kind of music works better in a bold EP format.  Hundred Waters - The Moon Rang Like a Bell (2014)  I was a little bored because of the super clean and polished instrumentation, but the vocal melodies are really interesting. The record didn't grab my attention throughout its entirity though.  Paavoharju - Yhä hämärää (2005)  Another Scandinavian Free Folk album. This one was more abstract and contained stuff like field recordings which I liked. Blissful music.  *Added Paralytic Stalks to the grid to fill it up and because I have renewed interest in it."
indieheads,3dm420,ilikecorn500,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:56 2015 UTC,Upvoted for The Dodos. I first heard them when I saw them open for Neko Case once. My favorite album of theirs is Carrier. Good stuff.

indieheads,3dm420,gaminauvelo,3,Sat Jul 18 12:23:28 2015 UTC,My week...  Debuts to my ears:   Tame Impala - Currents Yes - Close to the Edge Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - The Boatman's Call Ratatat - Magnifique   Radiohead and Vampire Weekend will eventually become my summer soundtrack. Also... Sting live album is such a chill. Judge me.
indieheads,3dm420,a_treacle_fiend,3,Fri Jul 17 11:36:18 2015 UTC,"My music listening has somewhat stagnated recently, so there's only a couple of artists worth noting.  Mumblr - Full of Snakes: This is a recommendation I got from here, actually, and I couldn't be more grateful to whoever it was that mentioned it. Such an engaging album album full of energetic, cathartic angsty punky funness. One of my favourite albums from this year so far.  Jon Gomm: Mainly been watching youtube videos of him play. He's one of these guitarists that uses his instrument to play percussion, rhythm and melody, either simultaneously or through a looper pedal. It may seem somewhat gimmicky (not quite the word, because it's obvious how much skill goes into this), but before too long you get to some really interesting, pretty songs.  Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear: Obviously, most everyone here will be quite familiar with this album at this point, but it took me quite a while to get into. However, after watching his Glastonbury set it just sorta clicked. He's got a great voice, solid song-writing ability and is straight-up hilarious, I'm glad I cam back to it."
indieheads,3dm420,fieryterminator,3,Fri Jul 17 12:12:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone Asked About You - Everyone Asked About You [1997]  It's in the style of Midwestern Emo from the late 90s that most people are familiar with, but it uses female vocals and simplified lyrics super well, to the point that all four songs on this EP are fantastic. I'd say that any fan of the genre at all should listen to this for sure.  Disco Inferno - D.I. Go Pop [1994]  I went into this expecting a great post-rock album, and I'm still sort of confused. Most of it sounds like a giant mess of samples mixed together where it's almost impossible to hear the simpler song underneath, but there are some small parts that I do like. Hopefully this record clicks with me sometime though because its fans seem to be very enthusiastic about it.  Frank Zappa - Hot Rats [1969]  I used to dislike this album a bit, but went back to it yesterday and discovered that it's actually pretty enjoyable if you pay attention. I lost focus a bit into The Gumbo Variations, but the first three tracks are musical gold. This album seems great for getting into jazz fusion, which is what I'll probably try and do soon.  Arab Strap - Philophobia [1998]  I've considered this album something special for a while now, but only after relistening to it yesterday did I realize how much I really liked it. The lyrics are consistently excellent, to the extent that they make the majority of the songs at least good, and the music plays with tension so well that it never gets boring. I'm going to listen to their albums after this one soon just to see how they sound too, and I really recommend this one if you haven't already tried it."
indieheads,3dm420,FarewellOrwell,3,Fri Jul 17 12:39:23 2015 UTC,"Titus Andronicus - The Monitor  Finally got around to checking this out, adored it after a couple listens. Took me a while to get over his voice. Seemed like a lot of grunting and moaning, but it fits really well into the songwriting.   San Cisco - Gracetown  This album is a fun and congenial record. Not sure if it will crack my top ten this year, but when I have people over this album really sets the mood for an enjoyable time.   Tame Impala - Currents   Really enjoying the direction they took; it's not quite as alluring as the psychedelicness of Lonerism, but they're willing to experiment and put themselves out there, and in doing so made some really great tracks. I prefer this over InnerSpeaker."
indieheads,3dm420,Diet_Dong,3,Fri Jul 17 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"Flying Lotus - You're Dead/Cosmograndma  Monoprice 8323's were on sale, decided to try them out as a throwaround pair. FlyLo is usually where I go to test out new headphones.   Mass of the Fermenting Dregs - S/t  I don't remember why I decided to revisit this one. It's still pretty enjoyable - I guess it's considered entry-level for a reason - but I'm not as in love with it as I was first listen.  Ibeyi - Ibeyi  Last night I decided to listen to something other than their KEXP performance, within seconds of listening to Ghosts I just screamed ""HOOOOLYYYY FUUCCKKK THIS IS GOOD"". Just got done listening to their mixtape on complex and it was...a lot to take in."
indieheads,3dm420,sara520,3,Fri Jul 17 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"last.fm    m.i.a. - matangi started listening to this again after her new song ""swords"" was released.  its not even my favorite album of hers, Kala is, but for some reason that one's not on apple.    mac d. - salad days demos mostly early in the morning, i have to leave for work at 7am and the instrumentals on this along with ""some other ones"" are really good for walking in the early morning.    animal collective - a little bit of everything, really anco2015 hype    tame impala - currents wilco - star wars listened to both of these passively yesterday but i'll be listening to both of them more this week probably."

The past couple of days I have been working through the AnCo studio discography to prepare my body for the new music coming soon. Also of note, I have the new Tame Impala album and it's a great summer listen.  Also, obligatory it's happening gif for new AnCo material:  It's Happening"
indieheads,3dm420,HomesickSubterranean,3,Fri Jul 17 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"I just discovered a really cool three piece math rock band from Taiwan called Elephant Gym.  Here's their album Angle.  My favorite track is probably ""Strong Ladder,"" check it out if you're interested.  It's really smooth, enjoyable stuff.  I found them when I had been listening to the band Toe a lot — saw them a few days ago.  Incredible show.    Elephant Gym is on hiatus right now, because of their conscription in the Taiwanese army.  That kinda shocked me.  I hope they come to the U.S. If they get enough popularity.  The cool part about their music is that the bass is the lead instrument, as opposed to the guitar.  Some nice melodic bass lines in there."
indieheads,3dm420,candepoccus,6,Fri Jul 17 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"5x5 last.fm    Destroyer – Poison Season AOTYSF for me. Absolutely wonderful, I can’t get enough. In the last week I’ve listened to this more than anything else in the past 3 months. In this album I think Dan has perfected his vision of Rock as Art, in the sense of your big hitter 70s albums. He’s really taken the cheesiness of Kaputt, but stripped away all the synths (except for one small appearance in the first track) and recreated it orchestrally. I have described the album before as a grower, but looking back now, it took like 6-8 months for both Kaputt and Rubies to really click for me, so I don’t know about that. For me, the magic in this album is all in the small moments, like those brief synths in the first track, the trumpet over the strings in the first half of Hell, or the flutes in the second, or the sax in the second half of Bangkok.  The Scene Is Now – Burn All Your Records Wikipedia describes them as an avant-garde jug band — I get a real post-punk crossed with Captain Beefheart vibe. I found this group through Yo La Tengo, as YLT covers their track Yellow Sarong on Fakebook. It’s a very weird album, I feel like I need to give it some more listens.    Beach House – Depression Cherry I blared this out over speakers while I was in the shower, in the dark, with a drink. 10/10 would recommend.  Condo Fucks – Fuckbook Actually Yo La Tengo under another name, doing an album of lo-fi garage-y covers. A fun listen for YLT fans, I particularly like the cover of one of my favourite Kinks songs    Julia Holter – Ekstasis I’ve been listening to this a bit over the past few months — it’s a really great Sunday afternoon record — and the announcement of a new album has spurred me to listen to it a few more times. Very sunny and enjoyable.    Big Star – #1 Record An old fave, listening to Facebook so much of late has made me want to revisit its jangle-y sound. I’ve come to appreciate the back half far more.      Wilco – Star Wars Is this meant to be a proper album? It feels very slight to me, and not fully formed, but enjoyable nonetheless. Taste the Ceiling has particularly stood out to me.    Xiu Xiu – A Promise Haven’t listened to Xiu Xiu before, given this a couple spins. I don’t know what to think.    Silver Jews – The Natural Bridge This has been my favourite discovery this year, and my most listened to album so far — it’s always in regular rotation.    not pictured because I’ve listened to too much but I want to mention:    Tame Impala – Currents I liked this at first, but I’ve already bored of it after a few listens. I think I’m too tired of the whole 80s pop nostalgia thing, it reminds me too much of Random Access Memories. There’s a few tracks i keep coming back to, particularly The Less I Know the Better, but I find the whole thing too saccharine to listen straight through.    Mac Demarco – Another One A resounding meh. There’s been a lot of talk lately around here about the issue of developing sound across albums, but I think that’s less the issue here than the need to develop sound across songs. This is another one that I think is best served in moderation, or else it gets too cloying. I think probably if I hadn’t heard any other Mac, I’d like this far more  WU LYF – Go Tell Fire To The Mountain Also listened to this in the shower (on a separate occasion). Also 10/10. RIP"
indieheads,3dm420,mattyb712,3,Fri Jul 17 11:38:56 2015 UTC,"Glad to see so much enthusiasm for Destroyer! I really like it too. I find that I like the second half (starting with The River - my favourite so far) better than the first.  I feel like he washed away the dreamy, whimsical nature of Kaputt in favour of a more serious, world-weary shadow... but the jazz influences persisted.  I like it more each listen. It feels kind of autumnal for me so I can see myself being really into it by the time September-October rolls around."
indieheads,3dm420,candepoccus,4,Fri Jul 17 13:29:36 2015 UTC,"It feels kind of autumnal   I agree, it definitely has a colder feel, it seems to perfectly match the cloudy, cold, wintry weather we've been having here. I'll be interested to see how its release date affects its reception because it's definitely not a summer record."
indieheads,3dm420,mattyb712,2,Fri Jul 17 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"I was thinking yesterday that this album probably suffered the most from the leaks. It was totally overshadowed by Beach House. It isn't a summer album. Destroyer's discography has been a little sporadic so I'm not sure if non-fans were really aware of it in the first place.  By the end of the year, when all the retrospective conversations are happening, I wouldn't be surprised if this comes out as the overlooked/underrated/low-key album of the year."
indieheads,3dm420,E-Rok,3,Fri Jul 17 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"I have American Water in my car, but I should really swap it out with the Natural Bridge. Goddamn I love that band."
indieheads,3dm420,ManlyDrinks,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"I think probably if I hadn’t heard any other Mac, I’d like this far more   My first time with Ratatat was with the new album Magnifique, I really liked it but a P4K review gave it a 5.0 because they've been sounding the same for the last 5 albums. Guess I'll have to check Classics as apparently it's the best one."
indieheads,3dm420,parots,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"3x3 jawn Funny how Can You Feel My Heart Beating? is directly above I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One I swear I didn't do that on purpose.   The Districts' album A Flourish And A Spoil is the only 2015 release on this week's 3x3 for me. It'll probably end up in my Top 10 (maybe top 5) AOTY.   I also went into bandcamp and listened to RadHos' first album, Something Wild for the first time recently. It's really good if you like their other work and I'm not quite sure why I didn't listen to it sooner."

indieheads,3dm420,Azersam,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"5x5: http://imgur.com/kgefuIW  ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" is still album of the year for me and ""Currents"" is a great, great album. Didn't really like The Chemical Brothers' new album on first listen but that last track featuring Beck is definitely the best song of the album for me. It's just fantastic! I FINALLY listened to Deerhunter's Microcastle. Definitely one of the best indie rock albums I've heard. Destroyer's ""Poison Season"" is amazing! Definitely one of my favorites from this year"
indieheads,3dm420,Mep0077,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"3x3  Depression Cherry // Beach House  Haven't listened enough to rate this album, but I definitely like it. While it's not a huge change in style, they still came through with a great album. I only discovered Beach House last year, and when I did, I exclusively listened to Bloom and Teen Dream for weeks. ?/10  The Beyond / Where Giants Roam // Thundercat   Easily my favorite EP of this year thus far. Feels too short everytime I listen to it. Have't listened to Thundercat before this but will definitely start now. 8/10  Currents // Tame Impala  I think this album is a great progression for this band. The lyrics aren't revolutionary, but I find myself jamming whenever I listen to it, which has been a lot recently. It's not Lonerism, but I prefer this progression over Parker not changing up the sound and making another Lonerism. Definitely one of my top 5 albums of this year thus far. 8.5/10  Another One // Mac Demarco  I've only listened through a few times, but definitely enjoy this EP. It's just good ole Mac, and employs a similar sound (though slight muddled) to Salad Days, which I love. 6.5/10"
indieheads,3dm420,TheKingOfGhana,2,Fri Jul 17 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"Julia Holter's Ekstasis and Loud City Songs, both of which are amazing.  Depression Cherry which is my AOTY so far.  Another One by Mac DeMarco which is so goofy but strangle poignant.   Solid week."
indieheads,3dm420,princesa-real,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"PBVGR - Panda Bear. Since it came out I've been listening to it nonstop. Fav Track: Principe Real and Tropic of Cancer. (Side note HAPPY BIRTHDAY PANDA)  Anything in Return - Toro y Moi. Specifically the track ""Never Matter"". This guy is just so cool. Unfortunately I don't think his new album sounds like this one so I passed up the chance to see him in Philly a couple months ago :/ Fav Track: Harm in Change.  Life of Leisure EP - Washed Out. It just occured to me the other day that I still love chillwave so I randomly downloaded this. This summer is now officially the second summer of chillwave for me. Fav Track: Lately."
indieheads,3dm420,TheAllStarrBand,2,Fri Jul 17 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"4x4 for this week  Ugly Casanova- Sharpen Your Teeth  This album is a sideproject of Isaac Brock (Modest Mouse) featuring some other members/vocals. It's more folky than MM and very good. I highly recommend this album to any MM fans. 8/10  Ratatat- Magnifique  Enjoying this so far, not a huge fan of the slower songs but it's pretty good. 7/10  Of Montreal- Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?  This is already one of my favorites, fantastically crafted pop and great lyrics on this. 9/10  Wingnut Dishwashers Union- Burn the Earth, Leave It Behind  One of my least favorite projects by Pat the Bunny but I would still recommend it to any folk-punk fans. My only complaint is that I'm not a huge fan of the faster and harder songs. 7/10  Death Grips- The Powers That B  Was listening to my vinyl copy of this, still one of my favorites of the year. I've nver been a fan of DG's guitar-based tracks so there are a couple I don't like but overall it's great. 8/10  Radiohead- OK Computer 9/10  The National- Boxer  I've always been kind of a National fan but damn this is a great album. Slow Show is devastating and is definitely my favorite. 8/10  The Black Keys- Brothers  I've been playing this CD a lot in the car and it's really fun to listen to. It's kinda generic but it's still very good. 8/10  Tame Impala- Currents  First half is pretty great, second half has some good ones too but ultimately feels repetitive. 7/10  Radiohead- In Rainbows 9/10  Have A Nice Life- Deathconciousness  I haven't dug too far into this, but there are a fair amount of tracks I really like and also a lot that drag on for me. 7/10  Johnny Hobo And The Freight Trains- Love Songs for the Apocalypse  One of my favorite Pat the Bunny projects. Every song is full of witty and great lyrics and Pat's voice is in his prime state of anger here. Definitely recommended to anyone looking to get into Pat's music or folk-punk in general. 8/10  Jeff Rosenstock- We Cool?  One of my favorites of 2015, Jeff's lyrics are fantastic on this one. I find it very easy to relate to a lot of the themes even though my life is nothing like Jeff's. The sound is kinda similar to the Blue Album I think so any fans of that should check this out. 8/10  Radiohead- Kid A 8/10  Wilco- Star Wars  I've only given this one listen but so far it's very enjoyable. I'm gonna have to listen to it more. 7/10 so far  LCD Soundsystem- This is Happening  I watched Shut Up And Play The Hits so I was listening to some songs off of this, still a great album. 8/10"
indieheads,3dm420,vandals_in_cardigans,2,Sat Jul 18 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"Went on a downloading spree this week.  Alvvways - ""Alvvays"": I heard Adult Diversion at American Eagle. It was pleasant sounding enough that I had to shazam it. Overall, I felt it was an okay album, nothing too impressive nor disappointing. I get a major Best Coast vibe, and hope they're not just a carbon copy of Best Coast.  Lil Wayne - ""Free Weezy"": All this recent talk of Wayne and his departure from Cash Money Records made me feel like I had to reconnect with Wayne.  I felt the album started off strong but diluted towards the middle, though Wayne can hold his own over the beats.  Cloud Nothings - ""Here and Nowhere Else"": As of late, I've been listening to Beach House, Vampire Weekend, and Arcade Fire and not so much lo-fi garage rock so it was nice to switch it up. From the start of this album I fell in love with it, the fast-paced drumming, rapid and deep bass lines, and thick guitars sucked me in. I really loved ""Pattern Walks"" especially what sounds like a small jam session towards the end of the song!  2 Chainz - ""T.R.U. REALigion"": Not really listening to this mixtape for serious content, I love 2 Chainz's humorous lyrics, such as (but not limited to): ""You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment"". I just think some of his lines are clever and/or non-sensical, which is why I appreciate his music.   Sigur Rós - ""Kveikur"": literally just started this and the opening track left me speechless."
indieheads,3dm420,PieBlaCon,4,Sat Jul 18 04:55:21 2015 UTC,"Sufjan Stevens - Carrie and Lowell - My first Sufjan album (I know I'm late), and I quite enjoy it. It's a bit outside my normal tastes (Future Islands/80s new wave and a heavy dose of U2), but I can't stop listening. I'm considering just going backwards through his discography because Age of Adz (from what I've gathered) seems like something I'd dig. Let me know if that'd be an unwise approach, though.  Anyway, with regards to C&L my favorites are Death with Dignity, No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross (would have made for a better closer, though), and Should Have Known Better, though I like them all on some level. Great album.  La Roux - Trouble in Paradise - I bought this the night before I bought C&L (Sunday night), so I kind of stopped listening, but I dug what I heard. The synth nature is more my speed. There's no absolute powerhouse like Bulletproof, but I still enjoy it. Good not great.   Assorted U2 - I'm always listening to U2 here and there, but it really spiked after Scott and Scott got their butts back in the studio for another good ep of UTU2TM?. Caused me to watch some footage of the new tour. Bullet the Blue Sky is probably the best sounding song so far. It's incredible. Bad is also a standout. On the studio recording side, highlights included Acrobat, Stay, and New Year's Day."
indieheads,3dm420,MarryMe_StVincent,3,Fri Jul 17 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"In regards to what you said about Sufjan, I was going to suggest Age of Adz after reading the first half of that paragraph.  It's my favorite from him and seems pretty popular on this sub.  It's definitely an album you need to listen to all the way through.  I think it's utterly fantastic."
indieheads,3dm420,LordSifter,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:55 2015 UTC,"This is going to be long  Cleared a lot of my un-listened-to-music back-up this week. Sadly that meant I listened to a lot of stuff that I ultimately thought was poor, or if I was lucky mediocre. Some good shit too though.    LA Priest - ‘Inji’ RYM Rating: 4.5 Stars What a record. I enjoyed this as much as I thought I’d expect Jamie xx’s album (which I did enjoy, but not like this). Probably my current second favourite record to come out in 2015. ‘Oino’ is just about tune of the year.    Christopher Owens - ‘Chrissybaby Forever’ RYM Rating: 2 Stars Disappointing. I was pumped for this off reviews & descriptions of the sound, but let down horribly. First of all it’s way too long - 55 minutes, 16 tracks. Second of all, the dude’s voice is grating. It seems like he’s trying to sound like he can’t sing. And last of all he has aped some melodies from old songs. I’m by no means against that - my favourite songwriter is Noel Gallagher - but Owens borrows from shit songs. ‘Heroine (Got Nothing on You)’ obviously borrows from, of all things, ‘The Tide Is High’. The one thing that did love up to expectations were the guitar sounds.    The Chemical Brothers - ‘Born in the Echoes’ RYM Rating: 4.5 Stars Holy shit, yeah, this is for me! I’m a fan of the Chemical Brothers, but not a hardcore. Prior to this the only records really worth anything are ‘Dig Your Own Hole’ & ‘Surrender’. This is just a great electronic record, combining their classic style with modern collaborations (eg. St. Vincent, Kele) & a pop sensibility. I love it! Currently in third for my top records OTY so far.    Beach House - 'Depression Cherry' RYM Rating: 4 Stars Yeah I really like it, but I think it’s a little bit over hyped. It’s a really good dream pop/shoegaze album, but at the end of the day it’s just another dream pop/shoegaze album.    Destroyer - 'Poison Season' RYM Rating: 3.5 Stars This was my first experience with Destroyer, & I enjoyed this record, to a point. My favourite part of this record is the instrumentation & arrangements. So lush. I looked past some of the obvious Bowie impersonations in the melody department. Where this album fails are the vocals. They became very annoying, very quickly.    Ratatat - ‘Magnifique’ RYM Rating: 1.5 Stars Surely I’m not the only one who find Ratatat incredibly… boring? This sounds like the music they were making a decade ago. I found that boring, I find this boring. Sorry.    Star Tropics - 'Summer Rain // Swept Away’ RYM Rating: 4 Stars A double-sided single from a young band. Jangly & fun. Me likey.    Burt Bacharach & Dionne Warwick comps I have like 50 compilation albums that I need to get around to. Burt Bacharach is an absolute legend & Warwick was something of a muse to him. ‘Walk On By’ makes me feel all gooey inside <3    Bee Gees - ‘Best of Bee Gees’ RYM Rating: 4 Stars Strange to know that I enjoy some of the Bee gees’ work. This comp was released in 1969 & is great. It encapsulates their early, psych-baroque pop work. ‘Massachusetts’ is fucking classic.    Bilal - 'In Another Life’ RYM Rating: 1.5 Stars ""Extra extra! Read all about it: Turn of the century neo-soul hero releases droll album 15 years later.” Sadly that’s becoming a common occurrence.    Andreya Triana - ‘Giants’ RYM Rating: 2 Stars ""Extra extra! Read all about it: Young singer releases droll faux-neo-soul album 15 years after neo-soul was a thing.” It does have one good tune though ('That's Alright With Me’)    Ghostface Killah & Adrian Younge - ‘Twelve Reasons to Die II’ RYM Rating: 2 Stars Innoffensive, but I’ve struggled to enjoy much hip-hop this year. It’s all starting to sound the same. Ghostface is a brilliant rapper, but he’s very unadventurous.    Freddie Gibbs - ‘Pronto EP’ RYM Rating: 3 Stars Dead End Hip-Hop did their mid-year top 5 lists & they gave this glowing praise. It’s only 3 songs but it’s fairly good.    Vince Staples - ‘Summertime ’06’ RYM Rating: 2 Stars It’s too goddamn long for a hip-hop album. I’ll give it another go eventually, but I just struggled on this first listen.    Meek Mill - ‘Dreams Worth More Than Money’ RYM Rating: 0.5 Stars Truly awful.    Years & Years - 'Communion’ RYM Rating: 2 Stars So boring. Sounds like they should be uploading downtempo covers of ‘No Diggity’ to their Soundcloud account."
indieheads,3dm420,_lucabear,3,Fri Jul 17 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Check out Kaputt next for Destroyer, I haven't checked out the new album yet, but the instrumentation on there is great. It's pretty 80s inspired though, at least with its usage of saxophone, so if you don't like that, never mind."
indieheads,3dm420,LordSifter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest my favourite parts of this record were the strings & older sounding brass, so 80's-sounding sax doesn't appeal to me too much.    And the dude's voice drove me nuts.    I liked this record, but theirs is a discography I can't see myself plunging into."
indieheads,3dm420,willforthrill,3,Fri Jul 17 14:13:26 2015 UTC,Summertime '06 is technically a double album but it's only 59 minutes so I don't think the length is a problem. I'm kind of torn on the album myself though because No I.D.'s production is stellar but Vince Staples just isn't that interesting an MC to me. Idk.
indieheads,3dm420,LordSifter,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:09:20 2015 UTC,"59 minutes feels way too long for a rap album, & really rappers have no business making double albums (actually no-one does in this day & age, IMO).    Yeah the beats were great, Staples just couldn't keep my interest for an hour."
indieheads,3dm420,TheAllStarrBand,3,Fri Jul 17 14:11:34 2015 UTC,Why do you think people shouldn't make double albums?
indieheads,3dm420,LordSifter,-2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:03 2015 UTC,"I just think society has grown out of them. The average person doesn't have enough time to devote to an album of 20+ songs & 70+ minutes.    In days gone by when you could get that huge vinyl pack & have the ornamental side then maybe, but it's not tailored to the digital age.    Bands can't hold the average person's attention for that long, & I think there's a level of arrogance in any band attempts to steal that much time from people. You can't have 75 minutes of absolutely essential music. The average listener struggles to listen to a 40 minute long single album.         Obviously they're great for non-average listeners - ie. the hardcore fans of the particular band, but a band's scope isn't just their absolute hardcore fans who would listen to every second of whatever they do.    I can't think of a double album I've enjoyed that's come out in the last 10 years, at least.    I think we'll see albums become shorter & shorter."

I'll be listening, and think ""yeah this is pretty good, I can get behind this"" but only of I'm actively listening with lyrics up to follow. Otherwise her voice is just annoying... I dunno, I think this is a grower. Is all her music like Debut and Post? I want to work my through her discography but not if its going to sound the same.  Also what genre is she? I'm having a hard time fitting her into my music library"

indieheads,3dm420,wehaveherpes,3,Fri Jul 17 12:15:24 2015 UTC,"Bjork's genre really varies depending on the album that you're listening to honestly. For her earlier stuff, Debut and Post could honestly be considered alternative or trip hop, and I would say Homogenic is almost purely a trip hop record."

With only one V it seems like it would be the first part...like before vv and vvv. Also, it makes me think it would be super lo-fi like the first two and have an old skateboarding pic as the cover - and all the lyrics are about weed and being angsty.   I've loved Wavves from the start and I'm hyped for this record, but I don't see how this relates to the Wavves and Wavvves albums. The first song he shared from it feels way more like King of the Beach and Afraid of Highs."

However, Watching The Detectives is a killer track"
indieheads,3digar,Woolite123,27,Thu Jul 16 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"As a huge Strokes stan, I've always thought First Impressions got unfairly criticized. You Only Live Once is one of my favorite tracks by them, and I love Red Light, Juice Box, Razorblade, and Vision of Division. If First.. was released by any other band, it would be a breakout record. The only reason why it was panned by critics is because of context. The strength of their first two albums was so strong, and fans didn't reward the change in direction."
indieheads,3digar,JeremyF,17,Thu Jul 16 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"""First Impressions"" is a good album, but it's problem is that there's just too much filler. Compare ""First Impressions"" to the first two Strokes albums...  Is This It- 11 songs, 36 minutes  Room on Fire- 11 songs, 33 minutes  First Impressions of Earth- 14 songs, 52 minutes  Cut out 15 minutes from ""First Impressions"" (which would only take about 4 songs or so) and you've got an album about as good as ""Room on Fire""."

indieheads,3digar,regularhuman1,7,Thu Jul 16 19:00:22 2015 UTC,how the HECK u gonna get rid of electricityscape
indieheads,3digar,insufferabletoolbag,5,Fri Jul 17 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I haven't heard the album in a while, so I don't have any specific songs in mind. I do recall that the first section of the album is a lot stronger than the middle or end sections (which, as a side note, is another problem the album has. It's way too front loaded). So if I had to cut anything, it would be from the middle or end."
indieheads,3digar,lifeinaglasshouse,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"Had to go back and re-listen to First Impressions because I couldn't really remember much of any of the songs from the second half. Would probably cut Ize and Killing Lies personally (the latter sounds more like a Walkmen song, oddly enough).   I think the sequencing could use some work too—the first four songs have so much energy, and after that things feel a bit too mid-tempo. I think dispersing these into the rest of the album could make it stronger."
indieheads,3digar,double_shadow,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"""Cut out 15 minutes"" hahaha I thought you were talking about the song. I think that's spot on though. It could have done without a couple songs, definitely ""Killing Lies"" and maybe ""Electricityscape"""
indieheads,3digar,Hummels,8,Thu Jul 16 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"I've always thought First Impressions got unfairly criticized   I agree, critics act like First Impressions is absolutely terrible when it's really just a different style. I agree that it could've been a breakout album for another band. I see it as their weakest album but I'm still a fan.   I think what makes it weaker to me is it's ""repeat-ability"" or whatever you want to call it. I absolutely loved it at first but I think it's just worn on me over time. I can still throw on Is This It or Room on Fire and sit through the whole thing entertained, while I find myself a bit bored by the middle of First Impressions of Earth. It's not as easy of a listen if that makes sense."

I've thought a lot about that song over the years since I first heard it, and I still can't explain why I think that it's one of the best pieces of music of the past decade.   I don't know why, but it resonates with me in a way that very few other songs do. Pretty weird, actually"

Saw them a few weeks back at Hyde Park and they put on a good show still, with a the whole crowd singing along it was an awesome gig. The new material may not but the best of their stuff but I want them to keep going."
indieheads,3digar,thomasmar,5,Thu Jul 16 17:21:01 2015 UTC,The first two albums are obviously their best ones but I don't think the newer albums are at all bad. They changed their sound and tried some new things but the songwriting was always pretty great. Every album has some songs I would consider among their best. Everyone wanted an album better than Is This It but thats a near impossible expectation to have. Also just personal preference I think Room on Fire is their best album.
indieheads,3digar,thequietthingsthat,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed absolutely. Room on fire > Is This It, which ties with Comedown Machine, > First impressions, > Angles. IMO"
indieheads,3digar,PSkip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:50:03 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. Comedown Machine was a great album that no one really gave a chance
indieheads,3digar,blonde_like_malfoy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people whined about the falsetto that Julian sings in, but it works well with the album. It also has more variety than any of their other albums and is pretty interesting musically. Room on fire is more raw and classic imo but comedown is good af and miles ahead of first impressions and angles."
indieheads,3digar,superindian25,5,Fri Jul 17 22:55:27 2015 UTC,One of my favorite bands ever. I like all their albums for different reasons.
indieheads,3digar,americanczar,4,Thu Jul 16 17:25:15 2015 UTC,Nice read. I really only listen to Is This It? and Room on Fire (with the exception of a few tracks from later albums) and I'd always wondered why Julian's voice seemed to change so drastically after Room on Fire.
indieheads,3digar,americanczar,4,Thu Jul 16 16:22:55 2015 UTC,Probably because they moved away from lo-fi.

As the volume was raising, Saun was going ""it's comin up....it's comin up....it's there"" but his thick accent made it sound like ""Dare"". A lot of people think this song is about masturbation, but really it's an improvisation on Saun's catchy way of talking."

What I like to think as a reference to ecstasy.  Shaun was the lead singer of The Happy Monday's, an iconic Brit pop band and a bit of a raver, from Manchester or Salford). Being a  Mancunian working boy  the word ""there"" can be heard as dare.  In other words, Shaun was big into Benny Hills and Chezza. He is talking about getting a buzz on.

This summer I've been listening to a bit of Pavement, Mercury Rev, Animal Collective, Built to Spill and stuff like that."
indieheads,3dixvk,heavy-pop,22,Thu Jul 16 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like this thread was made for me. I've often times discussed with friends how the summer of 2005 is my favorite summer ever, and the music played a big role with that. It was the summer after my freshman year in high school and the last summer before I worked a part time job each year. My parents had a house with a big yard, so I would spend 2 hours mowing the lawn every week in which I would listen to burnt CDs on my walkman. I also had an in-ground pool so I would go swimming every night and listen to a radio show on the local alt-rock station in Pittsburgh. Each night at 9 the DJ would play the top 5 and 1/2 songs that were requested by listeners throughout the day. My brother and I would call in almost every day and we would get excited on the off-occasion that we made it to air (we were 15 years old, ahhhhh the simple pleasures). That was how I grew to find some of my favorite acts that defined my youth. Feel free to judge my music tastes from my teenage years, I wouldn't trade them for anything. Here are some that come to mind:   The Killers - Mr. Brightside  30 Seconds to Mars - Attack Beck - E-pro Gorillaz - Feel Good, Inc. Audioslave - Be Yourself Weezer - Beverly Hills Disturbed - Gaurded Seether - Remedy Coheed & Cambria - Welcome Home My Chemical Romance - Helena Fall Out Boy - Sugar We're Going Down Coldplay - Fix You Kanye West - Gold Digger Avenged Sevenfold - Bat Country  Foo Fighters - Best of You Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams Rob Thomas - Lonely No More Nine Inch Nails - The Hand That Feeds System of a Down - B.Y.O.B. The White Stripes - Blue Orchid   Honestly, I'm gonna sound like an old man right now, but I honestly think 2005 was one of the last golden years of radio rock. Many of these songs/albums I listen to on some regular basis. Occasionally I'll flip on the same station, but they hardly play any newer tracks and there is no variety.  As far as how my tastes have changed, I'm now 25 and work full-time. I interned at music venue in college and also briefly had a stint on college radio. Shortly after 2005/2006, I started really delving into different music genres and branching out. Alt-rock was definitely my favorite music in 2005, and by 2008 it had completely switched to indie by discovering bands like LDC Soundsystem, The National, Bright Eyes, The Strokes, Interpol, Bloc Party, etc. Indie still is my most listened to genre. HERE is a playlist of my favorite songs for this summer."
indieheads,3dixvk,art36,4,Thu Jul 16 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"This was the same summer for me! The feels ugh.....listening to cds on the lawnmower and hitting a bump and having the whole thing skip and stopping the mower to cuss out your walkman...lolz. I had just started getting into indie stuff, for the life of me I can't remember what all I was listening to, I wish I could access my Itunes from back then."

There would have been a lot of Fall Out Boy, Foo Fighters, and Bowling For Soup because ya boy was angsty like that.  2015 summer jams are Mac DeMarco, Chance the Rapper, Animal Collective, and Modern Baseball because ya boy still likes a little angst.  My taste is i dunno, it's definitely different.  There's no way for me to articulate it without ostensibly saying ""it's better now lol.""  I feel that it's definitely more refined now, and more exploring. I also just have a more genuine interest in music now, so that plays a hand in it."

indieheads,3dixvk,neon_lemons,5,Thu Jul 16 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"2005 - Lots of my favorite artists of the time were putting out new records that year: Doves, The Raveonettes, White Stripes, Depeche Mode, Gorillaz, Oasis, Weezer, Coldplay, Röyksopp, Sloan (best of really) - your typical 'mainstream' alt/indie stuff.  2015 - Some of my favorites of the year have been The Dø, Dinner, Inouwee, mitch murder, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Susanne Sundfør, HAERTS, Paperwhite, C'Mere, Ren Harvieu, Parralox...  That's just a sliver of my listening habits, but those artists stand out. I still listen to everything I played a decade ago too - everything accumulates over time I guess. For me personally, the biggest change nowadays is that I rely on places like Soundcloud, Mixcloud, and Bandcamp to discover independent artists/labels.  On a side note, I had (and still use) Last.fm/audioscrobbler back in 2005 but I never used it as a music recommendation service like so many hyped it up to be. It was always to log my own listening habits. It's actually cool that I still use it nearly 11 years later, which means 11 years worth of that listening data to look back on. :)"
indieheads,3dixvk,heart_BURN,2,Thu Jul 16 20:24:40 2015 UTC,I still use my last.fm from around that time. I absolutely love going back and looking at charts and data from the last decade. I hope it is still around for a while so I can look back at like 40 years of data one day. haha

Nowadays, my music taste has immensely diversified, and I basically listen to everything. Lots of New Wave lately, but I still do listen to Hip-Hop.

I posted this on my Instagram the other day which is pretty much my music taste around that time. I was really heavy into post-hardcore/hardcore/punk stuff around that time, especially screamo stuff. I want to say that summer was the first time I was introduced to Bear Vs Shark and Circle Takes The Square which were two of my absolute favorite bands for the longest time. There are some indie classics on there like trusty Sufjan, Modest Mouse, the Postal Service. Bomb the Music Industry! was probably my single most listened to band from high school and 05 was right around when those first two albums came out so those would have definitely got a lot of play. I have always had an eclectic taste so it doesn't surprise me Hammock, a post-rock band, and Sun Ra, an absolutely crazy jazz composer/band leader are on that list.   My last.fm from the last three months surprisingly doesn't look that much different in 2015. Some indie classics from this summer like Tame Impala, Sufjan Stevens, Mac DeMarco, Alabama Shakes, Modest Mouse all have gotten heavy spins this summer. More rap appearances now than 10 years ago, like Vince Staples and Flying Lotus. I've also been listening to more jazz this summer than ever before with Kamasi Washington taking up most of that space with The Epic but also some Robert Glasper trio, Charles Mingus and of course Sun Ra. Some other notable spins from this summer include a return to Black Moth Super Rainbow, Foxygen, King Gizzard and the Lizzard Wizard and the Avett Brothers.  A lot of things have gotten forgotten by only using last.fm to base my music taste though. All the car music from 05 wouldn't have gotten recorded since I exclusively used CDs. Lots of Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy. Led Zepplin is also mandatory car music. Now-a-days anything that isn't picked up by last.fm is usually vinyl spins. I have been listening to a lot of P-Funk on vinyl and that is missing completely. Prince as well.   This has been a nice trip down memory lane. Quality post OP. Thanks."

I was also listening to a lot of Weezer, RHCP, Foo Fighters, and also older bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Beatles, Led Zeppelin. I causally listened to bands like Radiohead (mostly The Bends) and Muse (mostly Showbiz), but I ended up loving them a lot more in the next few years.  I still listen to all of those bands to some extent, but nowadays my taste has really expanded. Most markedly different I'd say is how much more I listen to female-fronted bands than before. Bands like St. Vincent, Wolf Alice, Portishead, Little Dragon, Hiatus Kaiyote are some of my current favorites. Psychedelic Rock has also become one of my favorite genres, with bands like Tame Impala, Temples, Elephant Stone, Dungen, and Mini Manshions being some of my other favorites right now."

The first and second Times Square songs, Dream Lover, Solace's Bride and Bangkok stand out for me."
indieheads,3dixvk,pajamalamaobama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"I really like it too. It's definitely an evolution from Kaputt - - it sort of trades out Kaputt's dreamy wistfulness for this mature, world-weary shadow, but still keeps the jazz influence that makes me love both these albums so much.  My #1 track right now is The River, but I also really like all the ones you mentioned as well as this new version of Archer on a Beach."

I also started getting into Nirvana and Eminem but that was probably later that year.  This summer I've been listening to Kendrick Lamar, Death Grips, Crystal Castles, and I made my way through the complete Beatles discography for the first time in chronological order. And I would be lying if I said I didn't like ""Bad Blood"" and ""Shake It Off""."

Mostly Sports Talk with Dan Russell, and Coast 2 Coast AM with Art Bell. In hindsight, I didn't even really like these shows. That goes without mentioning the Shrek 2 soundtrack that was permanently spinning in my cd player  Right now, my summer jams are  Big Brother and the Holding Company - Cheap Thrills  Dead Kennedys - Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables  Butthole Surfers - Psychic...

I'm now 17, into Father John Misty, Mac Demarco, Teen Suicide, Radiohead, Beach House, Miniature Tigers, and Ski Lodge. Still listen to MCR on occasion."
indieheads,3dixvk,schmorgyborgy,4,Sat Jul 18 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"I was just reminiscing a bit. 2005 was the summer before I entered high school, and I was pretty into upbeat pop music. Black Eyed Peas released an album that year that my friends and I were into. Rihanna got her start that year. I was also getting seriously into Kanye. For some reason I remember listening to Deliverance by Bubba Sparxxx that summer. And I still remember the first time I heard/watched the video for All These Things I've Done by the Killers.  One song that takes me back to those couple years is Audioslave's Be Yourself. They were one of mine and my friends' favourite bands for a little while, and I loved Chris Cornell's voice.    Now, in summer 2015, at 24, I'm less into current pop. Unsurprisingly. But I'm not ""above"" pop music.  Some of my favourite kinda poppy songs this summer have been Donnie Trumpet's Sunday Candy, Jamie xx's I Know There's Gonna Be Good Times, and Brandon Flowers' Lonely Town.  I've also been seriously into Kendrick, D'Angelo, Rhye, Erykah Badu and Beach House.  So I got more into indie, can still fuck with pop (but maybe not the top 40 kind), and I still love soul. My enduring love of soul began when I got into Kanye in 2005-2006, and I've really been diving back into it lately."

indieheads,3dhqi8,BatmansProstate,30,Thu Jul 16 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"I really, really like it. It's not a huge departure from the first album but there's subtle differences that keep me hooked.  Anyone else feeling a real Frightened Rabbit vibe in the chorus? Just in the way the vocals are structured in that kind of stop/start way.  I also like the pre-chorus build up (0.48-1.07), it's really poppy, something I can almost imagine hearing on a Taylor Swift song, but in a good way.  Pretty hyped for the new album now."
indieheads,3dhqi8,Cyclone-Bill,19,Thu Jul 16 11:40:56 2015 UTC,"something I can almost imagine hearing on a Taylor Swift song, but in a good way.   I mean this has come up before but 1989 really fits in with a lot of current indie eg Haim, Chvrches, Chairlift"
indieheads,3dhqi8,kickit,14,Thu Jul 16 12:13:48 2015 UTC,"Not that it really matters, but I think it's pretty safe to say that those groups all have pretty strong pop sensibilities, and aren't exactly the prototypical indie groups. It might be more accurate to say that Haim/ CHVRCHES fit in with a lot of current pop. I mean, Taylor Swift has Max Martin writing for her. That's not to discredit any of their music - I don't believe in any sort of hierarchy of genre. But I think it might be a mistake to assume that the similarities between them are indicative of some sort of indie mentality in Taylor Swift."
indieheads,3dhqi8,jake_dpp,2,Thu Jul 16 13:21:51 2015 UTC,Taylor doesn't have Max Martin writing for her. She has him working with her.

indieheads,3dhqi8,jake_dpp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's hard to pin down the 'typical indie group'. No, Taylor isn't a step away from being a pavement cover band.

indieheads,3dhqi8,kickit,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"The melody on this song is straight pop though, that's really my point. It's much closer to pop than it is indie, which has its roots in a punk mentality. Indie and pop aren't all-or-nothing checkboxes, but probably more of a relative thing."
indieheads,3dhqi8,jake_dpp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:45 2015 UTC,Punk is pop my friend  Too lazy to link you to a charli xcx video  Nirvana is another famous pop group
indieheads,3dhqi8,kickit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:14 2015 UTC,"Not post-punk, though. When punk started to become stale and commercialized, bands started to experiment and dropped the catchy hooks and simple song structures. They formed into labels that set the groundwork for indie music. It started with punk, but pretty quickly shifted. Then other bands with similar ideals but different sounds (Violent Femmes, R.E.M., etc.) came out and really started indie rock.   This stuff is sort of the opposite of that. Nirvana pretty quickly wasn't considered indie, and didn't think of themselves as indie. Charlie XCX is on the fringes of indie, but is certainly more pop."

indieheads,3dhqi8,kickit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:04:51 2015 UTC,"I said a punk mentality. Punk started off simple with catchy hooks because it was satirizing a lot of the self-indulgent music at the time, but quickly became just as constricting as the pop of its day, so it morphed into post-punk."

I like parquet courts, but they're not really doing anything super new.  A lot of this is just mining different traditions though. That's part of how artists line Chvrches are so successful  But holy shit there's a lot of indie pop"
indieheads,3dhqi8,kickit,7,Fri Jul 17 18:55:38 2015 UTC,I couldn't comment as I haven't listened to it. Maybe 'but in a good way' is a bit unfair; I don't dislike the songs I've heard and I'm certainly not anti-Taylor Swift just for the sake of it.

indieheads,3dhqi8,blockdmyownshot,6,Thu Jul 16 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"for srure for sure. and even though most of the topics on their songs are pretty straightforward, the way they talk about them is a style of their own and pretty original. They don't just slap you in the face with catchy, used up lines on the choruses. With CHVRCHES their sincerity works because they go about it a different way. Take Tether for example: it's a tether, we get the analogy, but the chorus is ""Trade our places/Take no chances/Bind me 'till my lips are silent"". And when they go full sincere and straightforward like they do on the outro ""I feel incapable of/Saying it's over"", the intensity of the synths and Lauren's voice sells it perfectly. I'm a fanboy but still."
indieheads,3dhqi8,timetostayuseless,7,Thu Jul 16 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really like to hear singles, I need the whole albuuum. But I think I like it... didn't blow me away.  BTW, I don't get why people keep saying they need to change sound. they only put out one album and have almost no new songs since then... why can't they make another very good album in the same vein? I'm hoping it's slightly different, but this new trend of bands having to mix it up is said in double when CHVRCHES is up for discussion and I don't really get why"
indieheads,3dhqi8,timetostayuseless,8,Thu Jul 16 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but it didn't have that signature hooks that I really loved with their older material (think ""Gun,"" ""We Sink,"" ""Mother We Share,"" ""Recover"")."

I'm also listening to Talking Heads more because I just got David Byrne's book from the library and I'm enjoying that so far as well."
indieheads,3diafo,sara520,5,Thu Jul 16 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Jay Reatard - Watch Me Fall for me. I am a big fan of Blood Visions but for some reason that was the only album of Jay's I had ever heard. Watch Me Fall surprised me with its poppy/generally clean sound compared to Blood Visions. An album full of really great, catchy garage rock."
indieheads,3diafo,dewg0ng,3,Thu Jul 16 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"maaan i havent heard blood visions in so long, such a ridiculous album. thanks for the reminder, i'll definitely check that other album out since i'm in the same boat that you were - blood visions is the only thing of jay's i'm familiar with."
indieheads,3diafo,hiplink,5,Thu Jul 16 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be Wowee Zowee by Pavement. After years off putting off pavement, I finally got around to them. Very strong album, although this is still the first album I've heard by them."
indieheads,3diafo,Runstradamus,3,Thu Jul 16 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same boat, it took me forever to finally get around to listening to Pavement, but now I find Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain and Wowee Zowee to both be great albums."

I've listened to it a ton since my first listen (in which I listened to it three times in a row) and am so glad I decided to check it out."
indieheads,3diafo,tttigre,4,Thu Jul 16 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"Man, I love love love that album but it has a lot of painful ex-girlfriend connotations so I never listen to it anymore.

indieheads,3diafo,Parkmayn,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:58 2015 UTC,My favourite is probably Frances the Mute. I think there is a flowchart for the Omar solo stuff as it is kind of all over the place. It is quite a bit more experimental than TMV. His new band with Cedric Antemasque was alright but kind of just sounded like a less interesting At The Drive-In.  e; here is the flowchart.
indieheads,3diafo,TheYuppieWord,3,Thu Jul 16 18:44:15 2015 UTC,At The Drive-In is one of my favorite bands but I never really got into their post-breakup stuff. Maybe I should retry TMV

Makes me really look forward to exploring radiohead further."

Their last album Avalanche as some nice stuff on it.  Sea Salt  Better Off Without You ft Kendrick Lamar  LFT  older stuff  Slippin  Pressure  Baby Be Mine wherein they slow down Michael Jackson's supremely underrated Baby Be Mine almost down to nothing, and it is disgustingly gorgeous."

indieheads,3diafo,gugs,13,Fri Jul 17 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else feel like every of Montreal album is a grower? I also think that this causes to Paralytic Stalks and Skeletal Lamping being very underrated. I see this albums getting panned a lot but:   Paralytic Stalks is a great and bold record with strong musical ideas and cool lyrics. Skeletal Lamping is a fantastic glammy pop record.    I can understand that most of Montreal records may sound too all over the place at first, too weird (Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies), too glammy (Skeletal Lamping, False Priest) or too dense (Paralytic Stalks). But the more you listen to them the more you discover and the more you click. I think that the same goes for their accessible records (Hissing Fauna, Satanic Panic, Sunlandic Twins). Even when you like them at first, they can only grow on you."
indieheads,3diafo,Byud08,4,Thu Jul 16 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I kind of really disliked them at first, but I just wasn't used to the whole kind of glammy vibe. It's a bit jarring to someone who usually listens to music so far removed from that.   The only of Montreal album that clicked instantly was probably The Gay Parade."
indieheads,3diafo,Listeningtosufjan,4,Thu Jul 16 15:55:59 2015 UTC,This comforts me because I've had trouble getting into the discography beyond Hissing Fauna. Aureate Gloom is starting to click for me a bit but the other times I've tried to explore further I've lost interest pretty quickly. I'm gonna give Skeletal Lamping another go before I try to delve a little deeper.
indieheads,3diafo,MarryMe_StVincent,3,Thu Jul 16 16:08:50 2015 UTC,You simply must listen to the gay parade
indieheads,3diafo,ClassyMidget,3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:20 2015 UTC,I like Skeletal Lampung (probably my fave Of Montreal album tbh) but I think that album is also overtly sexual. That forwardness definitely can turn people off.
indieheads,3diafo,gugs,11,Thu Jul 16 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"So I've been completely hooked on Surf, and Sunday Candy in particular.  Anyone have any recommendations, hip hop or no, that kind of follows that uplifting, positive, summer vibes kind of stuff?"
indieheads,3diafo,f1int,5,Thu Jul 16 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"Traphouse Rock - Kids these Days.   Vic Mensa's old band. Very upbeat, some killer trumpets, but a little more off the wall than Surf.   Also, tons of hidden popular riffs from the last 20 years of music. Cool to break down and find them all."
indieheads,3diafo,ClassyMidget,5,Thu Jul 16 16:04:14 2015 UTC,Perfect rec if you want to trace the evolution of Surf. Donnie was in Kids These Days too
indieheads,3diafo,gaminauvelo,6,Thu Jul 16 16:19:57 2015 UTC,Also this album/mixtape was produced by Jeff Tweedy

indieheads,3diafo,MarryMe_StVincent,3,Thu Jul 16 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really liked Traphouse Rock more than surf. More energy"

indieheads,3diafo,gugs,5,Thu Jul 16 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"yeah I dunno, I loved it right off the bat.  It's certainly not flawless, but I'll be damned if it isn't one of my favorite summer listens right now. It's nice having the positive vibes around a bit more."
indieheads,3diafo,MarryMe_StVincent,5,Thu Jul 16 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"HHH didn't like it that much, but I think they wanted Acid Rap part II. I feel like many users there listen to hip hop exclusively and this wasn't hip-hoppy enough for them."
indieheads,3diafo,thithiths,7,Thu Jul 16 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"If you're not familiar with the rest of savemoney beyond Surf and SoX's stuff, definitely check out Saba's ComfortZone and Vic's Innanetape. Both great summer albums -- ComfortZone in particular has similar vibes to Surf (Saba is lowkey my favorite member of the crew, way more talented than Towkio, who they pushed pretty hard when his mixtape came out).   Beyond savemoney, Olu has some very chill summer music. The indie samples are usually a little on-the-nose, but enjoyable rap nonetheless. A lot of Kool A.D.'s solo stuff has that jazzy, summery vibe to it too.   I feel dirty talking about hip-hop in here"

So I'm currently on my bi-monthly Fleet Foxes kick, just got Helplessness Blues on vinyl, and I'm getting increasingly impatient.  That's awesome that Robin is in college but whenever (if ever) they decide to start recording a third album, it will probably be my most hyped album ever.  Also, Joanna Newsom / Robin Pecknold collab when?"
indieheads,3diafo,heart_BURN,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'd always thought Fleet Foxes were pretty good, but I was never a huge fan.

Unbelievable album"

indieheads,3diafo,TheYuppieWord,12,Thu Jul 16 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"Thing about Pavement is they never made it easy. That was part of their M.O. when they were defining themselves against the alt-rock moment. Where the big bands of the mid-90s were filling theaters and copping the arena-rock moves that had ossified somewhere back in the 70s, Pavement went around like regular schlubs and played messy shows with songs that took strange turns and didn't quite sound like guitar rock songs are supposed to sound. The Red Hot Chili Peppers said ""Give it away now!"" and stripped to the waist and jumped around and wanted desperately for you to notice them; Pavement always seemed to be holding something back, and they weren't about to give it away. ""Gold Soundz"" is as close as they ever got.  It was the second single from their second album, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. The first, ""Cut Your Hair"", was a surprise hit, going to #10 on the modern rock chart in a time when that meant something. ""Cut Your Hair"" was the indie rock ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", to an extent: It was topical and had a sneer, but it was also melodic and you pretty much knew how you felt about Pavement from the first time you heard it. Also like ""Smells Like"", after you heard ""Cut Your Hair"" a million times you were ready to put it away for a while. But ""Gold Soundz"" was different. It sounded like a memory in the best possible way. The first two words are ""go back,"" and that's exactly what it does: It was easy, light, and tinged with nostalgia, with a radiant guitar tone and drums that float along, joyously uncommitted. Some of the lyrics match the music's wistfulness (""so drunk in the August sun"" is the one many remember, because it sounds like the first line of good yarn), but Stephen Malkmus always did like a good puzzle, so there are cryptic lines that hint at uncertainty, confusion, and doubt, too. But this song feels especially hard to pull apart; everything seems to fuse together into one thing. And damn, it is ever short-- verses and choruses and a super nice guitar break all in 2:40.  There are a lot of ways to think about the music of a decade. Sometimes when you sit down to make a list like this, you think about songs that seemed important-- maybe they changed music or were emblematic of prevailing trends in culture. And then sometimes you think about songs that make you feel good whenever they come on. You hear the first few notes, remember how much the song does for you, the excitement builds, you want to sing along, and hey-- they're coming to the chorus now.."

indieheads,3diafo,ProbablyGood,3,Thu Jul 16 19:42:35 2015 UTC,Idk how you feel about sludge but most definitely check out Secret Cutter. They are a two piece and implement a lot of noise into the sound. Its pretty damn gnar. Another Sludge/Doom band I've been digging lately is Cult of Occult. They're from France and have got a pretty killer sound.
indieheads,3diafo,barkjon,3,Thu Jul 16 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Listen to Oceanic by Panopticon. It's sludge/post-metal.  Teethed Glory and Injury by Altar of Plagues for industrial black metal.  Souvenirs d'un autre monde by the French shoegaze/black metal band Alcest. They were a big influence on Deafheaven.  Dopethrone by Electric Wizard is a great stoner metal album  Houdini by the Melvins is a classic stoner/sludge metal album that was partially produced by Kurt Kobain. The Melvins were a big influence on the grunge scene.   Colored Sands by Gorguts is a great technical death metal concept album about Tibet. It's a really elegant, orchestral album."
indieheads,3diafo,jake_dpp,2,Thu Jul 16 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"These sound cool, thank you!"
indieheads,3diafo,art36,3,Fri Jul 17 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for some more ambient-related artists that experiment with reverb and echo. Preferably with vocals. Grouper, Arthur Russell, Cocteau Twins, Brian Eno, etc. More minimal sounding stuff."
indieheads,3diafo,Trionout,8,Thu Jul 16 14:59:10 2015 UTC,julianna barwick's album 'nepenthe' is right up yr alley

indieheads,3diafo,staralfurs,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:58 2015 UTC,Anamai - Sallows  They're from Toronto and released their debut earlier this year.  Seems to match your description pretty well.
indieheads,3diafo,art36,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:27 2015 UTC,Colleen - Captain of None
indieheads,3diafo,MAN_KEGELS,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:51 2015 UTC,Pygmalion by Slowdive

indieheads,3diafo,MAN_KEGELS,2,Thu Jul 16 18:07:31 2015 UTC,Seeing him in a few weeks as well! 11 year old me is so jazzed.
indieheads,3diafo,gugs,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:57 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. And honestly I think Day & Age is my favorite album of theirs.
indieheads,3diafo,MAN_KEGELS,3,Thu Jul 16 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"So far I'm loving the daily discussion threads. Only half of the comments are dank memes.   Anyway, I listened through Depression Cherry once against my better judgment and now I'm cutting myself off until it's officially released (since I preordered the vinyl). But after one listen it's definitely another fantastic album and I can't wait to listen deeper into it once it's released."

indieheads,3diafo,hiplink,3,Thu Jul 16 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"all right, indieheads, who are your favorite contemporary country artists? I've never been the biggest fan or anything even though it's  omnipresent where I'm from, but ever since last year I've been trying to get more into country as a whole, but sometimes I'll listen to, say, a Sam Hunt song and I just won't get it. At all. I'm trying to change that (don't think I'm ever gonna be a Sam Hunt fan though)  So, who do you guys like? For reference, I'm into artists like Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert right now."
indieheads,3diafo,justrollinwithit,5,Thu Jul 16 16:09:28 2015 UTC,Sturgill Simpson is the correct answer.
indieheads,3diafo,nietzscheispeachy,3,Thu Jul 16 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"oh yeah I forgot that I like him too lol  edit: i, like, really don't have the $$ right now but this would be a killer show"
indieheads,3diafo,justrollinwithit,3,Thu Jul 16 16:14:49 2015 UTC,So much yes to this. I recently bought Metamodern Sounds in Country Music on vinyl. Such a great record. Hoping to see him in two weeks open for Old Crow Medicine Show.
indieheads,3diafo,nietzscheispeachy,3,Thu Jul 16 16:24:13 2015 UTC,Where could one start with Brian Eno? Seeing Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and loving the score reminded me of one of my giant blind spots

indieheads,3diafo,giraffeking,2,Thu Jul 16 16:44:39 2015 UTC,+1 for Another Green World. St Elmo's Fire is a tune
indieheads,3diafo,jackieclay,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"Here Come The Warm Jets is an excellent album. Definitely check out Taking Tiger Mountain if you like it, some great songs on there too. The True Wheel is a blast to listen to."

indieheads,3diafo,RedKamo,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:29 2015 UTC,There are quite a few good albums on here. Nice picks man

I listen to new albums very frequently trying to catch up on everything but I don't think I spend enough time absorbing some music. It sometimes feels like a chore.   I know people are gonna say ""just consume at your own pace"" but dammit I don't think I can.  Maybe once I've heard every combination of sound conceivable I'll settle down and give certain music its due."
indieheads,3diafo,clockwork_watermelon,6,Thu Jul 16 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't care, anymore. By that I mean I don't feel obligated to stay current with every new release. I love listening to brand new music, but I definitely do it at a leisurely pace. Above everything else, I want the music to feel personally important and have some story or memory attached to it. I would hate to treat music the way I treat current affairs.  I'm curious, do you consume all this new music so fastidiously because of a sense of curiosity or exploration, or do you not want to be caught in a conversation where you haven't heard of something?"
indieheads,3diafo,Not_an_Author,3,Thu Jul 16 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"It's not even new music, it's the vast amount of stuff that exists already! It's like a rabbit hole.  Bit of both.

It's 2001, so according to most the band were past their recording prime, but they continued being one of the best live acts around throughout their entire career - not the tightest, but no-one could create an atmosphere like them.

By the sounds of it, their sound is only getting duller. I mean it's still great. It's still Godspeed doing some pretty solid post-rock, but I do not foresee an awesome comeback. I.e. I doubt we're ever gonna get anything as good as their most seminal work."

indieheads,3dj9vt,WilliamtheIV,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I play my acoustic way more. Also it's more convenient to transport, and I think it's easier to write with"
indieheads,3dj9vt,jamaicanhopscotch,2,Thu Jul 16 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah. For a long time I was playing acoustic almost exclusively to write songs and not get distracted. I broke a string, though, and lately I've been playing the electric and falling back in love with it."
indieheads,3dj9vt,nietzscheispeachy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. I primarily learned on acoustic guitar, but I play electric a lot anyway when I want to play genres that don't really make sense on acoustic."

indieheads,3dj9vt,jamaicanhopscotch,3,Thu Jul 16 19:02:02 2015 UTC,I play the guitar and (kinda sorta) the piano but I never really made anything original besides a few riffs and melodies here and there. I told myself I'd write an instrumental song this year before I start university in September and I still haven't. I always just come up with melodies that I think sound nice at the time and then if I play it again another day it just sounds terrible and corny. :( And of course I know absolutely nothing about recording anyway.
indieheads,3dj9vt,jufakrn,3,Thu Jul 16 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Right, firstly you should calm down. It is entirely possible for you to compose an instrumental track between now and September. What style are you wanting to write in ? Whose sound are you inspired by ? Also, what is your current writing process ?"
indieheads,3dj9vt,hiplink,3,Thu Jul 16 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly my current writing process just consists of improvising on the guitar. I want to write a post-rock song and I actually have a couple melodies that I don't think are completely horrible (but some do sound like an EITS rip-off so I guess you could say they're abig influence). I never know how to..like.. expand on them though. I guess learning more theory will make that easier, I don't know. I'm also trying to learn more theory beyond a typical guitarist's knowledge of scales and modes but I'll be honest, I'm really delinquent with that. I know enough to write down something just in case I forget it though."
indieheads,3dj9vt,jufakrn,2,Thu Jul 16 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"Okay. Firstly, I would suggest you should have a definite song structure. As in, Intro - Verse - Chorus - Verse - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus. Obviously a post rock song might not have these features but it is just an example.   Before melodies, it would be far easier for you to write a chord progression first. This means it is easier to write melodies. Are you familiar with any theory regarding chords ?"
indieheads,3dj9vt,hiplink,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I have a couple chord progressions that sound pretty generic but not necessarily bad. And I am.

indieheads,3dj9vt,RockoBOOM,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily looking into making it, but how is electronic music made? Can I get the basic run down? I've seen things from software to weird noise making machines ?"
indieheads,3dj9vt,justrollinwithit,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of modern electronic music is made on a computer. Download a trial of FL Studio and follow some tutorials if you want to try software-based electronic music making. A MIDI keyboard will simplify things as well, but you can use the software without it.  The alternative to software based is, of course, hardware based. These are usually compounded analog synths, effect boxes, modulators, loopers, etc. It's rarely a one-machine operation. Things get very expensive if you go this route. Composition is the same as non-electronic for the most part, you lay down some chords or basslines, then layer over them and see what works.   DISCLAIMER: I might have no idea what I'm talking about."

I've been searching craigslist and I've found someone offering an alesis  dm10 electric set for $550. I've been trying to research it that's a good deal or not.

indieheads,3dj9vt,Doggie__,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"i personally really dislike electric sets for non-electric music because, especially when under a thousand, they don't feel or sound like an accoustic set.

indieheads,3dj9vt,Doggie__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate. It looks like this is gonna be a difficult thing to balance physical space issues, volume issues, pricing, and quality while looking for a set. What was your first set?"
indieheads,3dj9vt,Doggie__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"my first set was a Tama Rockstar, which i got used from one of my dads friends. If volume and space are a problem for you, I would suggest getting a 14/16/18 inch bass drum sized kit.  But if it's your first drum set, I'd strongly recommend going used and maybe take a drummer friend with you to help you out. Used sets are also easier for beginners because a lot of times they come with cymbals (which are what makes drums so expensive). Plus, good old used cymbals are better than new average cymbals.  cymbals are important"

indieheads,3di7zi,jackieclay,3,Thu Jul 16 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"At least on Windows, it's extremely slow, and syncing is an absolute disaster. There's no way to just drag files onto an iPod, you have to cooperate with iTunes and if something changes on the iPod (you use another computer and add something new) it ruins the entire process. I just wish Apple would enable some sort of MTP thing for iPods and iPhones so I could drag files in and not have to deal with a whole extra program."

indieheads,3dgdpv,American_Soviet,7,Thu Jul 16 03:51:01 2015 UTC,I'm impressed how someone can be so angry for which content is discussed in a sub.
indieheads,3dgdpv,Travkin2,9,Thu Jul 16 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"I am amazed that said person can't find a way to unsubscribe, considering how ""embarrassing"" s/he finds this subreddit.  It must be hard to live in a world we you are forced to read this sub...  I don't mind Chvrchrs being discussed on this subreddit.  After all, they started on an indie label (Chvrches signed with independent label Glassnote Records in 2013).  I don't know their current label, but I think their first album was released in the US by Goodbye Records, also an indie label.    In addition to that, I really like their sound.  I just hope album number two will be as good, if not better than the first one."

indieheads,3debua,Reckoner84,10,Wed Jul 15 16:51:14 2015 UTC,so i'm in a group message with some friends and we all love animal collective.  and it is somewhat a tradition now to crop all their faces in a picture and send them as individual messages.  so of course we did it with this picture as you did.  here's another one.
indieheads,3debua,sara520,14,Wed Jul 15 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"OT but you're so lucky, no one I know likes the bands I like </3"
indieheads,3debua,princesa-real,11,Wed Jul 15 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"i am very grateful that i have a group to be idiots about anco with, but guess what, i met them online!  so while i am lucky to have found them it was because we all bonded over a similar interest.  so you will find that someday :)"
indieheads,3debua,sara520,2,Wed Jul 15 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"Aw, thank you!"
indieheads,3debua,princesa-real,3,Thu Jul 16 00:27:42 2015 UTC,Are you Portuguese by any chance?
indieheads,3debua,Fondofboobs,3,Thu Jul 16 09:02:26 2015 UTC,"I'm Portugese on my dad's side but I'm technically American. My username is from the Panda Bear song ""Principe Real"" but with switched genders :)"
indieheads,3debua,princesa-real,2,Thu Jul 16 13:20:08 2015 UTC,"Yea I noticed your username, that's why I asked. I'm Portuguese as well, but I live in Lisbon. That's pretty cool."
indieheads,3debua,Fondofboobs,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:47 2015 UTC,You're so lucky! I've always wanted to visit there
indieheads,3debua,princesa-real,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:01 2015 UTC,You've never been to Portugal? Where do you live in the US?
indieheads,3debua,Fondofboobs,2,Thu Jul 16 16:32:53 2015 UTC,Pennsylvania. I've never even travelled outside of the states :/
indieheads,3debua,princesa-real,2,Thu Jul 16 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"Tbh it's probably a lot cooler to live in Penn than in Portugal. At least everyone tours Philly/Pittsburgh. Artists seem to ignore Portugal, for some reason."
indieheads,3debua,Fondofboobs,45,Thu Jul 16 19:06:48 2015 UTC,Deakin is looking good these days.

indieheads,3debua,Segal-train,17,Wed Jul 15 16:42:48 2015 UTC,I was looking through pictures of the studio and it looks nice. So I guess I know that is a cool looking place.
indieheads,3debua,hephephippo,3,Wed Jul 15 16:47:42 2015 UTC,haha did you actually scream?!

indieheads,3debua,TateosNG,21,Wed Jul 15 16:44:03 2015 UTC,That was my response. It took them so little time to record this.  hype
indieheads,3debua,Apotheosis91,19,Wed Jul 15 16:55:36 2015 UTC,Don't AnCo generally record pretty quickly? MMP took like three weeks IIRC
indieheads,3debua,mattmanflash,3,Wed Jul 15 17:16:04 2015 UTC,This album seems like it came together so fassst
indieheads,3debua,Reckoner84,24,Wed Jul 15 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"Incredibly broad/ignorant question, but how long does it typically take a band/artist to go from the ""finished recording"" stage to announcing artwork/release date/tracklist?  pls, i need to kno"
indieheads,3debua,lushacrous,28,Wed Jul 15 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry but there is no set answer to this, it all just depends on the artist. However, it wouldn't be unrealistic to expect that sort of stuff to start to come out in the next couple months."
indieheads,3debua,jamaicanhopscotch,15,Wed Jul 15 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"it depends greatly. if they're just done recording, they need to figure out the artwork, LP package (which includes inserts, and center labels, etc), at which point there's probably a 4-5 month safety net because of pressing plant delays. they also need to get it mastered which predicting how long that takes is like throwing out a random number, though it could also be fairly quick as much as it might take a month. we likely won't hear anything else for a month at least, likely longer as they have to figure out the single and any pre-release stuff (like a preorder page, music videos, new tour dates), the album probably won't release until a couple months into next year. if the stars align, it could be a little less, but especially with december right smack in the middle there, i wouldn't get my hopes too up about it."
indieheads,3debua,heydelinquent,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:43 2015 UTC,it depends but anywhere from a few to several months
indieheads,3debua,slmanifesto05,3,Wed Jul 15 16:57:35 2015 UTC,"So, time."

indieheads,3debua,hiplink,57,Wed Jul 15 16:46:54 2015 UTC,Maybe he's the one that took the photos.
indieheads,3debua,ChallengerDeepHouse,21,Wed Jul 15 16:53:37 2015 UTC,So you are suggesting surprise deak ?  I actually would rather a deakin no show if we get a solo album from him.

indieheads,3debua,hiplink,10,Wed Jul 15 17:17:45 2015 UTC,He was in one of Avey's photos not too long ago
indieheads,3debua,niceworksara,8,Wed Jul 15 17:23:02 2015 UTC,maybe he just blends in with the surroundings really well
indieheads,3debua,ChallengerDeepHouse,14,Wed Jul 15 16:51:18 2015 UTC,maybe he is deakin into cover ?  good joke yes ?

indieheads,3debua,uncrew,63,Wed Jul 15 16:46:12 2015 UTC,All we know for sure is it won't sound like any AnCo album to date
indieheads,3debua,aroomacanvas,14,Wed Jul 15 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"Neither did Centipede, and we all know how that went."
indieheads,3debua,uncrew,51,Wed Jul 15 17:17:03 2015 UTC,Neither did Feels when it came out. Neither did Strawberry Jam when it came out. Neither did Merriweather Post Pavilion when it came out.  We all know how that went
indieheads,3debua,hiplink,11,Wed Jul 15 20:09:49 2015 UTC,That album is one of their best but I don't ever want another like it.
indieheads,3debua,Tom_Anks,19,Wed Jul 15 17:28:02 2015 UTC,It's so overproduced it feels like sound vomit
indieheads,3debua,barkjon,18,Wed Jul 15 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Always seemed to me like a matter of ""concept,"" like they're broadcasting through frequencies already occupied. It's an album about finding our own grooves and movements while dealing with overstimulation. New sound burnout, maybe."
indieheads,3debua,aroomacanvas,13,Wed Jul 15 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really enjoy how tight the and clustered the mix feels. It really gives the vibe that they are surfing through the radio waves, like a big deakin centipede"

indieheads,3debua,GoodMolemanToYou,9,Thu Jul 16 00:42:07 2015 UTC,A cool concept doesn't make it sound any less like a jumbled mess though. It's a matter of personal taste though I suppose.
indieheads,3debua,clockwork_watermelon,6,Wed Jul 15 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"i love the album, but also i agree with this.  i was listening to the song ""mercury man"" a few weeks ago and noticed some instrumentation in the song that i'd never heard before.  i'd been listening to that album for years and never heard it?!!  there's just SO MUCH going on that in some songs it's really hard to process all at once, which is ok for some people and unlistenable to others."

indieheads,3debua,staralfurs,2,Wed Jul 15 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for this too, though whatever they do I'm sure it will confound expectations.  I've been missing the acoustic guitars since Sung Tongs though :_("
indieheads,3debua,clockwork_watermelon,2,Wed Jul 15 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"Well this is a complete guess, but considering the dense, frantic sound of CHz, I don't think it would be unreasonable to think that they could move in a more Talking Heads/new-wave inspired direction."

I think it was called ""That's Life Though"", and it was amazing. A bit more a darker, Smoke Ring For My Halo vibe than the Pretty Day sound. The guitar work was as beautiful and ever-evolving as ever, with kind of rambly, stoner philosophical lyrics that have a kind of slice of life story in there too. He also ripped a sweet solo. So, not really different from his past stuff, but still damn good.  Here's a link to a past performance I think it changed a little bit from that version with a more definite vocal melody, but pretty similar."

I always wondered what would Chvrches do after ""The Bones of What You Believe"", I can't see myself enjoying another 14 tracks sounding like their debut and yet, I didn't think they can really change their sound too much without it being a mess.  I'll just say Chvrches is probably going to go in the same path as Mac Demarco. Which is a shame but who knows, it's just one song, they can always switch it up."

indieheads,3dh5kx,Isthisgoodenough69,10,Thu Jul 16 11:27:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While I agree that it's not a huge departure, it's not ""same-y"". I feel like some of the recent singles they've done (""Dead Air"", ""Leave a Trace"") feel ""bigger"" than most songs on TBOWYB. (""Get Away"", which is a bonus track on the deluxe edition of the new album, however, feels a lot different.) I think the Mac DeMarco comparison is a little exaggerated, as all his released tend to sound exactly the same. CHVRCHES can still sound like themselves without doing the same thing over. I think they are growing as a band. I especially love the artwork. I feel it's much more interesting than the style of all their EPs and debut album. Overall, I have no reason to worry about the new album."

I liked TBoWYB, it was catchy at times, but it still felt like a debut that could be built upon.  The world of synthpop is just begging to be explored by them, and it's a shame that they're limiting themselves just to what worked last time.  Of course I am kind of talking out of my ass since we don't have shit yet, but if it's true I will be disappointed."
indieheads,3dh5kx,red_280,2,Thu Jul 16 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"It is similar to Bones, but it's got a more polished and sleeker sound about it - actually, it's even more markedly poppier sounding than anything they've done so far. I like that. Some people want to be challenged more, but I love a quality pop song. They've stated they're against making obscure music just for the hell of it, and I'm glad that's the case. There's plenty of more hipster friendly music out there, and I'm happy CHVRCHES choose to make music they like."
indieheads,3dh5kx,TRILLWAVVVE,5,Thu Jul 16 08:22:00 2015 UTC,"Too much of the same, it won't hit the community as hard as their debut though.

indieheads,3dfhgd,the_killingjoke,4,Wed Jul 15 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"Me too. So many people harp on the changes that they never really get around to appreciating it. Call me crazy, but it's my second favorite AF album behind Neon Bible."
indieheads,3dfhgd,art36,6,Thu Jul 16 12:19:08 2015 UTC,Really?? It's probably my second favorite song on the album. Porno into Afterlife is so fucking good.
indieheads,3dfhgd,DrKushnstein,6,Thu Jul 16 00:48:44 2015 UTC,My absolutely favorite track on the record.
indieheads,3dfhgd,Maridiem,7,Thu Jul 16 01:38:00 2015 UTC,This is so weird. I love it.
indieheads,3dfhgd,Trionout,7,Wed Jul 15 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"After seeing them last year in Detroit, the trailer section for the movie gave me absolute chills all over again. September 24 can't come soon enough."
indieheads,3dfhgd,ndwelp,7,Wed Jul 15 22:20:37 2015 UTC,They never performed PORNO live. Probably my favorite song on the album.
indieheads,3dfhgd,gaminauvelo,12,Wed Jul 15 22:45:27 2015 UTC,"They used the porno beats on My Body is a Cage at pretty much every show, however."
indieheads,3dfhgd,arcainzor,4,Wed Jul 15 23:47:55 2015 UTC,I belive they said that they never figured out how to play it live.

indieheads,3dfhgd,zeisss,7,Thu Jul 16 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest mistakes was having this album playing when me and my ex broke up. It happened like a week after it came out and now that will forever be associated with this album. Anyway, I do love this song and this band so I'm still very excited for this. Also I've seen them twice, so seeing live footage gives me instant chills."

indieheads,3dfv12,sedgwickian,21,Thu Jul 16 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna take this opportunity to say that she's fucking awesome and probably deserves more attention around here. I haven't listened to her much myself lately but I think I'm going to revisit her now that I've been reminded.  Her voice is really something special, and I think she's, without a doubt, the most consistent Broken Social Scene member in her solo work.  Looking forward to whatever she does next!"
indieheads,3dfv12,mattyb712,5,Thu Jul 16 02:07:16 2015 UTC,Yeaaaaah Metals is one of my most favourite winter albums. Feist needs more attention. To whomever is reading this. Go listen to Metals. It's fucking great.
indieheads,3dfv12,Rhythmist,15,Thu Jul 16 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"She's probably holed up somewhere writing music and hanging out. She has generally long breaks between albums (five years between Monarch and Let It Die, four years between The Reminder and Metals), so I wouldn't be surprised to hear an album announcement from her in the next eighteen months"
indieheads,3dfv12,Apotheosis91,5,Wed Jul 15 23:26:23 2015 UTC,"She's around still for sure. I loved Metals and caught her on that tour. Show was great, can't wait for her next project."
indieheads,3dfv12,poopsonlawn,5,Thu Jul 16 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"To me she seems like a wanderer who doesn't release music unless she's really invested in it. She's only released four albums since 1999, but part of that was probably due to her involvement with Broken Social Scene, at least early on. But I miss her. Her voice is one of the all-time greats and Metals was a beautiful record that should have received more attention. If the trend persists, I think we'll hear some sort of announcement from her before the end of the year."
indieheads,3dfv12,pbmummy,4,Thu Jul 16 10:14:00 2015 UTC,"She won the Polaris prize for Metals over Drake's Take Care. But yeah, her last three albums have all been aural brilliance. She did have a photo of herself playing the guitar on Instagram in March so fingers crossed she's recording some new stuff."
indieheads,3dfv12,Listeningtosufjan,4,Thu Jul 16 10:42:11 2015 UTC,She had a cameo in Jenny Lewis' music video last year.  Probably just chilling. Before Metals she took a year off from even picking up a guitar.
indieheads,3dfv12,Jreynold,2,Thu Jul 16 09:52:05 2015 UTC,Whenever I miss her or BSS I always go back to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6NLkioP3ks

indieheads,3ddkjg,mrjfray,31,Wed Jul 15 13:33:15 2015 UTC,Cave's music has helped me through some of the most difficult moments of my life. My thoughts and sympathy will be with him and his family.
indieheads,3ddkjg,ElitistHatPropaganda,28,Wed Jul 15 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"All of this is heartbreaking, but it's made a little worse by the fact that he's a twin! Just terrible - RIP"

indieheads,3ddkjg,ElitistHatPropaganda,37,Wed Jul 15 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a lot worse. When one twin died, it's common for the other twin to feel like they have literally lost of part of themselves."
indieheads,3ddkjg,2_CHAINSAWEDVAGINAS,-75,Wed Jul 15 14:25:36 2015 UTC,I'm sure lots of people will feel bad about it in their own way but the fact is that this kid has a nearly exact copy walking around to replace him with.

indieheads,3ddkjg,TheKidsCallMeHoJu,11,Wed Jul 15 14:33:11 2015 UTC,All I can think about is that scene in 20000 Days when Nick is sitting with his two sons watching Scarface and he seems the most human I've ever seen him. Going to be heart breaking to watch now.
indieheads,3ddkjg,Alexohmygollypixies,5,Wed Jul 15 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"ikr, so much of that movie is him being sad and dark, but there he's so at peace - just watching a movie and eating some junk food with his kids."

indieheads,3ddkjg,themanwithnoreddit,8,Wed Jul 15 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"Fuck. That's genuinely terrible.   His music has has an extraordinary influence on me both artistically and personally, and it feels especially bad having something this awful happen to someone I respect and admire so much.   I sincerely hope the family gets the time and space they need to recover (as much as can be expected)."

indieheads,3ddkjg,art36,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm considering writing an essay about this news breaking. I follow most of the major music news publications. They've all blasted this story.  My thoughts somewhat summarized: we live in a 24 hour news cycle that is driven by internet traffic and everyone is constantly swiveling their head back and forth to see what new content thy can post onto their site. There are lots of great/positive examples of this: new albums or singles being released means that consumers and fans can instantaneously enter the ""know"" and can more easily find and immerse themselves into their favorite music. The bad: seeing a story about a man's son tragically dying plastered all over my newsfeed on every social media site. The thing is, though, it's not something you can just opt out of; it truly is an all-or-nothing ordeal.  My main question: why should it be the public's right to know these sort of details as soon as they unfold if at all? At a time where we lived in print, stories like this would likely be skirted under the rug and never really mentioned. These sort of stories would only be for A-list stars or celebrities. Not knocking nick Cave, but he's hardly a household name to the average citizen (I know that might rub some /r/indieheads users the wrong way, but it's true). You can only run so many stories at once, so there was more content hitting the cutting room floor; and (frankly) there seems to be a shred of decency and standards for private matters that has really been blown to the wayside.   Why should the world know the tragic personal details of a man or woman's life, even if they are a celebrity? I know people busted Jack White for his vocal distaste of the media circus surrounding him. I didn't agree with everything he said, but I do believe in the general concept that boundaries are being crossed that shouldn't be and serve no real purpose. If Nick Cave were to openly discuss this incident in an interview or perhaps in the future cite it as a reference point for his creative process on a new record, than it's fair game. But it's sad we live in a day and age where plastering a poor man's dead son onto the web in order to get clicks to make money is the new standard for music journalism.  My solution: there needs to be a serious discussion on code of ethics for online content for major publications. What should be on-and-off limits. I think posting stories related to personal affairs that are not directly involved with the artist's professional career should be strictly off limits. There are certainly always exceptions to this. If an artist chooses to be in the limelight or does something in a public place or forum, that should be fair game. There will certainly be grey area, no question, but I think it's crystal clear that a story of a dead son has no place on Pitchfork, Spin, Consequence of Sound, Stereogum, Rolling Stone, or any other music publication web site."
indieheads,3ddkjg,art36,6,Wed Jul 15 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand your point, and I have to say my reason for posting this wasn't to sensationalize a man's tragedy. As music listeners, we form bonds, real or imaginary, with musicians and artists. If anything, I simply thought it could be valuable for people to express their sympathy while taking a moment to reflect on Cave's work and art. But I agree wholeheartedly that it shouldn't be used to generate revenue or press for a  publication."
indieheads,3ddkjg,chuckzz,4,Wed Jul 15 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, this wasn't a dig at you for posting it (far from it). I don't blame anyone for sharing this story."
indieheads,3ddkjg,IGetNoSlack,3,Wed Jul 15 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but the other side of the coin is that when you choose a career in music, you basically sell a piece of yourself to the population, people buy a work of art you created, a glimpse into your world, and thus create a bond. Even if the two never met.     The moment people share a connection there is an interest in the individual. Which creates a demand for information. And when there is a demand, there is a supply. I really doubt music press will stop posting when there is a demand.     I feel very sorry for Cave, (the documentary is going to heartbreaking with this context) but a little piece of me is glad to get this information, the moment i saw the news, i started googling like a maniac to learn more about it."
indieheads,3ddkjg,plurntup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"When you become a celebrity (willing or no), your entire life becomes subject to public scrutiny and discussion.   It's like buying a ticket to any event: in buying said ticket, you assume all risks involved."

Prince put out one of his best albums after his girlfriend had a miscarriage.   Obviously, the focus isn't on new music at the moment and I'm sure it'll be a while until we get any following this tragedy."

indieheads,3ddkjg,plurntup,2,Thu Jul 16 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a little searching and the closest I've come to finding this answer is Emancipation, but: 1. It came out only a month after, so the quality was likely not a result of finding brilliance in the face of tragedy 2. It wasn't a miscarriage, their son was born a month early and died a week later from Pfeiffer Syndrome    Unless /u/plurntup is referring to something else. This info was gained from a brief Google search, and I didn't find anything else when searching for ""Prince girlfriend miscarriage"""

Get Away and Dead Air, their two post-Bones singles, are divisive. Personally I love them. They could point toward the LP2 sound? But maybe not since they were one-off singles?"

indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,9,Wed Jul 15 16:27:53 2015 UTC,I like the one month idea too.  There have been multiple occasions where I have come across something a few weeks old that still hasn't been posted here and I think it feels pretty [FRESH].
indieheads,3de6mk,Thunder-Fist,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:11 2015 UTC,Month sounds better. Big releases will be up the day of and it gives a little more time for more obscure tracks to be considered fresh. They usually take a little longer to discover.
indieheads,3de6mk,Mep0077,13,Thu Jul 16 14:11:28 2015 UTC,I think 7 days might be a bit short for FRESH. I think anywhere between 14-30 days is fine.
indieheads,3de6mk,Mep0077,6,Wed Jul 15 16:21:39 2015 UTC,I think those are perfect.
indieheads,3de6mk,bubba_ra,4,Wed Jul 15 16:13:16 2015 UTC,What about new music reviews?
indieheads,3de6mk,lushacrous,10,Wed Jul 15 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of putting them all in a single album discussion thread, but if we don't go with that a [REVIEW] tag should be used."
indieheads,3de6mk,RickSandmann,9,Wed Jul 15 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"I actually like the idea of putting them in the appropriate album discussion thread, because that could help promote converstation on said album."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:26:21 2015 UTC,[ORIGINAL] is a great idea. There's a lot of musicians on here and I bet a lot of people would like each other's music and enjoy opening up conversations and critiques.
indieheads,3de6mk,lushacrous,35,Thu Jul 16 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think daily discussion posts is the way to go. Asking rando questions (""what is your least favorite second track on an album by your favorite artist?"") and posting pics with your favorite band you met last night isn't something we're discouraging altogether, but to an extent, it clogs up the front page from the real newsworthy stuff.   doing daily discussions where we can direct this stuff instead seems like a perfect compromise between those that can't go another day without knowing your peers' unpopular but actually not unpopular opinions every day, and those that don't want that to detract from the (if I can say) more worthwhile content"
indieheads,3de6mk,Killatrap,20,Wed Jul 15 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"Going along with the ""rando questions,"" we should find somewhere (like the trash) to put all of the questions when people are asking for recommendations for (example:) ""music for when I'm riding my bike down a big hill but it's not too big but my hand itches a little bit and I regret going on this ride."""
indieheads,3de6mk,CharminglyIrreverent,7,Wed Jul 15 16:25:56 2015 UTC,We have been trying to get all of those into the weekly suggestions threads. I try to be as vigilant as possible but still miss some. I think it makes sense to keep a couple suggestions threads outside of the daily music threads.
indieheads,3de6mk,jamaicanhopscotch,3,Wed Jul 15 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"We have suggestions posts 2 times a week that are for that exact purpose, but just people don't direct users to it as much as they should, and I'm not omnipotent enough to redirect every one of them as soon as they're created"
indieheads,3de6mk,regularhuman1,22,Wed Jul 15 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"and this way we can have ""Home"" by LCD Soundsystem voted the best closer to an album every day!"

indieheads,3de6mk,TheHoundsOFLove,7,Wed Jul 15 16:23:36 2015 UTC,What do we want to do with pictures of people with bands? I am leaning towards not allowing them.
indieheads,3de6mk,lushacrous,18,Wed Jul 15 23:25:41 2015 UTC,They can be in the daily discussions for sure
indieheads,3de6mk,heart_BURN,10,Wed Jul 15 16:22:43 2015 UTC,Sorry yeah - I meant as their own post. I have no issue with them in general discussions.
indieheads,3de6mk,jake_dpp,7,Wed Jul 15 16:24:02 2015 UTC,What if they're nudes
indieheads,3de6mk,jake_dpp,11,Wed Jul 15 16:26:18 2015 UTC,Make sure they're tasteful. We need to maintain at least a little mutual respect here in this community.
indieheads,3de6mk,breadburger,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think a general daily discussion post would be a great way to build and foster more of an active community. The open daily discussion posts I think were integral in growing such a large and active in /r/hiphopheads. Just having a place to chat with mostly the same people on a regular basis, centered around indie music, is definitely something I support.   As the sub grows, we could consider putting more restrictions on the discussions but having a laissez faire approach early on is the best way to go."
indieheads,3de6mk,breadburger,10,Wed Jul 15 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think the daily music discussion is a great idea. I feel like an ass telling people to wait 5 days and repost in the appropriate thread.  I think a good rule of thumb is that anything that's only of personal interest to the person posting should be posted in the daily discussion threads. I think maybe if we restrict separate participation/discussion posts to [Fresh] albums or the scheduled AOTY posts, and things of that nature, it could be an easy rule to enforce. That keeps the feed focused on music news. With daily music threads, there's really no need for the usual ""what's your favorite ___?"" threads that are low effort/high participation. Those are fun, but might be best as individual posts within the big daily music discussion threads."
indieheads,3de6mk,PCCP82,3,Wed Jul 15 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"what kind of non personal posts would you allow? I think anything that basically encourages responders to actually justify and talk about their answers is good, but how would you say that as a rule?"
indieheads,3de6mk,Moon-Safari,3,Wed Jul 15 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"I think guides or posts like the Pitchfork one yesterday encourage real discussion. I don't know of a consistent guideline though.   What type of threads stick out to you or anyone else for encouraging good discussion? They're definitely rare, but are great when they happen."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,3,Wed Jul 15 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am fine with any 'high-effort' post getting its own thread. They can be about anything, like that guy meeting Sharon Van Etten, as long as it actually brings something worth discussing.  As for what type of post encourage good discusion, I'm not so sure either. I think topster top 50 posts, while they don't bring great discussion, can get their own thread as long as it isn't posted constantly. I find threads around debating the essentials list often brings good discussion because people have strong opinions about it."
indieheads,3de6mk,Moon-Safari,22,Wed Jul 15 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Just going to say. I LOATHE megathreads. What's the point of having pages and pages of content if it is all shittily organized in one huge thread? Also an off-topic thread is stupid, just let people talk about things they want to talk about.  But I like the fresh stuff."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"So the thing with mega threads is if you either don't like them or you don't like all the reposts we see. Everyone is going to fall on one side of the fence so its going to be tough to make everyone happy.  But we have 3 off topic threads a week now, and they are extremely popular within the community, so thats not changing. There whole point is they give people a place to talk about anything they want, so I'm not sure what your point is here."
indieheads,3de6mk,jake_dpp,10,Wed Jul 15 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I just don't like forced organization. if people go somewhat off topic, let them, but starting a thread about something off topic? that should be deleted. that's my view. I don't see why people should wait until a certain day to talk about things."
indieheads,3de6mk,PCCP82,4,Wed Jul 15 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"You there! Stop where you are!  I agree with this 1000 percent. If we were molooks at a bar, we would meander all over the place"
indieheads,3de6mk,HoldenH,3,Wed Jul 15 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"I don't get your point. If someone wants to talk about something that  does have nothing to do with music (like anecdotes, personal issues, daily life, other media...), where should this be discussed? That's exactly where the General Discussion threads are for."
indieheads,3de6mk,Killatrap,2,Wed Jul 15 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Right, and its not like were censoring off topic discussion in other threads, there's a just a place we choose to do most of it."
indieheads,3de6mk,jake_dpp,6,Wed Jul 15 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Some opinions:   a month time limit on FRESH seems fair will FRESH VIDEO be used for any video released for an artist's most recent album? Regarding new albums - with the new sticky I think we could have an album of the week that gets a stickied discussion every week. I am not sure how the album would be selected. For weeks with multiple marquee albums we could rotate sticky every third day or something I still think we should centralize all reviews into a single thread. I don't think anybody is really on board with that idea though Do we still want to have Throwback, Suggestions, Live Music and all of those reoccurring threads once we get going with the daily music threads? If so, how can we better promote discussion within those threads?   e; We have some more exciting things in the works which means we are going to start getting a larger population here (1000 subs in the past 2 days...); so any 'old timers' will need to help us out."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,6,Wed Jul 15 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"For weeks with multiple marquee albums we could rotate sticky every third day or something   New mod tools allow to have multiple stickies. (Like on /r/askreddit right now)   Do we still want to have Throwback, Suggestions, Live Music and all of those reoccurring threads once we get going with the daily music threads?   There are quite a few threads that get a low amount of comments. I think it should be considered to get rid of some. I also find it annoying that you have to wait a week for posting about live music or pick-ups. Throwback is also a little useless and unpopular imo."
indieheads,3de6mk,jake_dpp,3,Wed Jul 15 16:08:41 2015 UTC,My thought was we would use the first sticky for something more permanent than album discussions. I guess we could have two albums at a time for larger releases.   I think you are right about getting rid of the recurring threads as all of that content fits fine within the general music discussion.
indieheads,3de6mk,Thunder-Fist,3,Wed Jul 15 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"The two stickies is nice, but there are too many weeks where there are more then two albums worth disscusing, plus we have other things we want to sticky."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,7,Wed Jul 15 16:34:38 2015 UTC,I also think that stickying big album release discussions might magnify the circlejerks unnecessarily. Bigger artists are going to take even more precedence over smaller releases who aren't as well known. Then it becomes a judgement call to determine which albums are or aren't stickied.
indieheads,3de6mk,Thunder-Fist,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:01 2015 UTC,I'm going to go ahead and out indie you by saying it's my fave thread though I never listen to it on spotify
indieheads,3de6mk,TheRoyalGodfrey,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your asking about with the fresh video. Any newly released video, even after the album has been out would qualify. I thought of the sticky idea as well, but I feel it would discourage diversity if a single album gets the discussion. I was think either on the side bar or on the calendar have a link to all the recent albums discussions, so even 2+ weeks down the line it could still be active I'm with you on the single place for reviews. We place too much importance in specific reviewers/publications and how their opinions are drawn battle lines for later discussions(Im with Fantano/against Pitchfork). If we did something where we listed all the reviews in the top post it would hopefully encourage more independent attitudes. I think we merge the suggestion threads for sure, but keep the other ones. It might help the smaller discussions (weekly pickups, live music) if we themed that day around it though  (ie. encourage live music talk on Wednesday well still allowing other discusions.)"
indieheads,3de6mk,TheRoyalGodfrey,3,Wed Jul 15 16:49:36 2015 UTC,I don't think a month after is fresh at all
indieheads,3de6mk,hiplink,5,Wed Jul 15 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think we should still have at least he suggestions thread if we go to a daily discussion format, that way we can have a dedicated place to get recommendations etc because those are some of the posts that get deleted the most. I think upping those to maybe 3 a week would be good."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,6,Wed Jul 15 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Or conversely, it could just be redundant and detract from both discussions. What does it offer that a daily music discussion doesn't, and what's the advantage of me asking for recommendations in one vs the other?  I also think the line between recommendations and participation threads is blurry at times too. ""What's your favorite album for the summer?"" is sort of both."
indieheads,3de6mk,eklxtreme,5,Wed Jul 15 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from with the redundancy, but I can't help but think any posts asking for suggestions will start being ignored within the general threads especially if they become as popular as the non-music threads. So I think it has a dual benefit of removing clutter from the daily threads and making it easier to ask/receive suggestions.  e; that isn't to say you can't ask for suggestions in the general thread. Especially for questions like favourite album for summer. Just keep the thread open to give people the option."
indieheads,3de6mk,jamaicanhopscotch,5,Wed Jul 15 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I tend to think that recommendation type posts will probably be as popular as any of the others. Other than recommendations, there's probably just going to be the ""what's your favorite?"" posts, ""why isn't _ talked about?"" posts, and then pics, etc. Those threads are already going to be getting more traffic, so I would personally rather ask for recommendations where more people might see it. I'm an information systems guy, so maybe that's why the idea of two redundant threads is bothering me more than it should haha.  But we can always experiment either way and see what happens"
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,8,Wed Jul 15 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"I am all for those last three new rules being added. I think that a daily MUSIC discussion thread would be very helpful to have. I'm assuming it would be similar or the same as the HHH threads? I think it would really help to clean up a lot of the crap posts we get, and it would also provide for interesting discussions. I often come up with thoughts/questions that I don't deem worthy of a post, but don't really have a place to put them, and this would be great.  As for the last point - a weekly album discussion thread - I am so for it. It would a) help consolidate a lot of redundant posts (Oh look, P4k, TND, Here Lies Music, CoS, have all reviewed this album, let's have each of them be a different post and sit on the front page while we all post our thoughts on the album in question on each thread AND every shit post about said album), and b) it would help to add a little time between the album's release and its discussion. Since album release day is Friday, maybe have Tuesday or Thursday be album review day so we have time to digest the album before tossing out critiques. Those are just my thoughts, though."
indieheads,3de6mk,jamaicanhopscotch,6,Wed Jul 15 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am baseing the General Music discussion on HHH. It would also be the ideal place to post and talk about music inappropriate to the sub (ie. hip-hop).  I get your point on wanting to add time before the album discussion, and Im not against it, but the only thing is sometimes albums have been leaked/streaming for weeks, so it seems silly to make people wait even longer to talk about it. idk, I could go either way on adding time"
indieheads,3de6mk,HyperbolicInvective,7,Wed Jul 15 16:11:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I am not sure how to approach this either because of leaks. I think enough people listen to them that an earlier discussion thread would be beneficial. At the same time anyone listening to the leak could just discuss in the general threads until official release date. That would also allow us to link any reviews to the discussion.
indieheads,3de6mk,candepoccus,5,Wed Jul 15 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"That's true if we wait a bit we wouldn't have to keep adding reviews as they come in (well we still would, just not all of them)"
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,3,Wed Jul 15 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"That was the other thing I was thinking about. If we save it until 4 or 5 days after the release, it gives time to get all of the reviews out. Obviously this won't always help (ie Universal Themes P4K review coming out weeks late), but it would at least give time to get a good amount of reviews out."
indieheads,3de6mk,candepoccus,3,Wed Jul 15 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"Reviews come out at different times, it might just be better to let each review have it's independent post and then have the album discussion thread 24 hrs after the leak or whenever."
indieheads,3de6mk,boonvincent,3,Wed Jul 15 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"So the problem with that is only the needle drop, pitchfork & Here Lies music reviews end up getting posted, and then the whole discussion becomes a debate around their opinions."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:57 2015 UTC,Is that necessarily a problem though? It generates discuss about the album which isn't necessarily a bad thing and I feel like there's not enough [FRESH] music and other stuff that goes on in this sub for it to be pushing other discussion off the front page.  I feel like this sub is better about not immediately developing a consensus about an album (unlike HHH) and people are more civil in their discussion and actually discuss things rather than just babbling 1-2 talking points
indieheads,3de6mk,VanillaSweat,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like it can be a crutch honestly, people shouldn't have to compare themselves to a few reviewers, it seems like we to often need to feel validated that their opinion fits with others. If people only posted pitchfork reviews when they thought they were fantastic reviews and did likewise with other publications it wouldn't be a problem, but you know thats not the case.  I will agree that they don't take up too much space and we aren't that rash, but I think having them in daily music discussion and album discussion threads is the right way to go."
indieheads,3de6mk,PCCP82,7,Wed Jul 15 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"Also just so it's totally clear and out there in writing, regarding leaks and spreading illegal downloads, we're cracking down on posting leak links ( :/ ), asking for more info or help in illegally downloading something, being cheeky and bolding random letters to spell out a secret message about downloading/getting help downloading a link, etc and will be somewhat quick to give out temporary bans for breaking this. This is in order to maintain a level of respect for artists and labels for getting them to participate in AMAs and beyond here. You absolutely don't need to agree with our reasons for this, but just move this kind of behavior to the myriad of other places on the internet (even within this same site) where it is encouraged to do it."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,4,Wed Jul 15 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"Not daily general discussions, but daily music discussions perhaps ?  Obviously, we keep the current days for general discussions."
indieheads,3de6mk,PCCP82,7,Wed Jul 15 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's better. I'd be fine allowing discussion of non indie music in those threads too, at least try it out."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,4,Wed Jul 15 16:41:01 2015 UTC,That is the plan. We will keep the 3 general and then also have likely daily music discussions.
indieheads,3de6mk,PCCP82,5,Wed Jul 15 16:43:26 2015 UTC,Oops I think my post about avoiding ticket scams kinda triggered this :(  So hopefully Pitchfork ratings can be deemed non-newsworthy after this
indieheads,3de6mk,evacipated,6,Wed Jul 15 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"Not at all, this is long overdue. Your post was totally fine bc you don't have another place where you could post it now.  And yeah people can talk about P4k reviews in the album discussion or daily music discussion thread, but I do want to eliminate their importance here."
indieheads,3de6mk,cgreg92,5,Wed Jul 15 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that I really like all of these ideas.  As for the 'All notable albums thread""  I think that those threads should be released  without taking leaks into account.  If you put a thread up for an album maybe a few days after it's officially released, it will be easier to discuss because, a) not everyone listens to leaks, and b) there won't be need for any ""Here's what Anthony Fantano thinks about this album"" threads, because if there was a discussion thread for an album before it's actually released, people wouldn't be able to talk about review scores in the thread (because no one has reviewed it yet) so we'd still probably get a bunch of ""Fantano Review/P4K Review/Here Lies Music Review"" threads... If that makes sense.    But I absolutely love the daily music discussion thread idea, 10/10"
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,3,Wed Jul 15 16:54:01 2015 UTC,People could also talk about leaks in the daily threads.
indieheads,3de6mk,cgreg92,4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. So probably best to keep new album discussions after the official release
indieheads,3de6mk,eklxtreme,2,Wed Jul 15 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't posted much to this sub because I feel that the whole point of an indie music sub would be discussing music that might have flown under the radar for quite a long time, perhaps a few years. I really don't understand what's wrong with posting new-to-you music, so long as the artist hasn't been discussed before. There is some really good stuff that deserves attention, yet this subreddit is simply not the place to do it, as the rules currently exist.  Please don't downvote me; I'm here to have a discussion. Change my view?  Edit: I think that a possible solution to this problem is the daily conversation thread that has been discussed on here. As long as it allowed top-level posts of older (1-2 years) music, it would go a long way towards making the sub a lot more friendly and open."
indieheads,3de6mk,HoldenH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, old music would be allowed in them"
indieheads,3de6mk,artboiz,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"A few concerns/ideas/suggestions I have, sorry for the length:  Thread death: What time would the daily music discussion threads be posted? With timezones and everything, I know that I personally am never around for the general discussion threads, and if we push all rando questions into daily threads, you could end up excluding a lot of people from participation because they'll never get a reply. Should there be maybe a clear time threshold then, i.e. your post will be removed if its within 5-6 hours of the daily thread? Just an idea maybe.    Suggestions: I am for leaving these as their separate threads, as in general I think they tend to get enough traffic to justify their existence, but I do like the idea of stricter enforcement of removing low effort requests. On that, I think that should probably be added to the sidebar rules, and maybe the rules thing that pops up when you go to submit a post. On this...  Enforcement: What is your preferred method of having the community deal with low effort posts. Do you want us to report such things, or just comment that they should be posted somewhere else (or both)?  Repetition: Should we have a clear threshold rule for when it's okay to repost the same kinds of questions? I often see complaints that a similar question was raised in the past month etc. There is a certain point after which I think this doesn't really matter, and I think personally that's probably about a month  [Fresh]: Personally, I like the idea of a short timeframe for fresh, like a week so you know it's really new. I don't really see the issue of people wanting to post older things, as we tend to be pretty on top of everything, but if people are really concerned, maybe a [Fresh-ish] tag or something can be used to differentiate if you want to post something three weeks old   Consolidated Review Threads: I really like this idea, because sometimes there are so many redundant reviews posted, but I'm not sure how this could really practically work with reviews being released at different times. We've had pinned threads up the top, and stickies, but I haven't ever noticed much activity in these the day after they've been posted. Maybe they can just be posted in the daily music threads?"
indieheads,3de6mk,Farsided1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"I think the posting time is the biggest issue we are going to face with the discussion threads, and one I am not entirely sure how we can address. I am not sure what you mean with removing posts within 5-6 hours of the daily thread.  Enforcement will be easier for the mods/users with the general threads as we could normally just direct people. I think the mods have a pretty good idea on what constitutes a low-effort post but feel free to report or comment if you think something should be removed/moved. I don't care if you report or comment.   I think 14 days is the magic number for FRESH posts.  I don't care if we have all reviews in one thread or if they get posted in general threads, I just don't think each individual review should get its own post."
indieheads,3de6mk,Segal-train,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what you mean with removing posts within 5-6 hours of the daily thread.   On this, I was just suggesting that while the daily thread is still fresh and active, be liberal with moving any posts that would fit better there, but after that once you're not as likely to get a response, it doesn't make as much sense to redirect people, so maybe at that point some ""lighter"" discussion posts become acceptable, as long as they're not scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel low effort posts (just an idea)   I think the mods have a pretty good idea on what constitutes a low-effort post but feel free to report or comment if you think something should be removed/moved   This I was referring mainly to posts that come through when you guys are inactive during your night, which is the only time I really notice them because they're otherwise burried or removed by my morning   I think 14 days is the magic number for FRESH posts.  I don't care if we have all reviews in one thread or if they get posted in general threads, I just don't think each individual review should get its own post.   I agree completely. I think two weeks is especially a good compromise for [Fresh]."
indieheads,3de6mk,Moon-Safari,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"so the best thing we an do for thread death would be better varying when the threads get posted, some at night, some early morning etc. I think the 5-6 hours idea could also work We will be adding this to the sidebar/post message once we decide on the new rules I think both would be best, as long as the comments aren't angry/rude about it. This is a tricky thing to decide on because everyone is going to have a different opinion on the time frame. I think repetition will be less of an issue with general discussion threads, so that might solve the problem I agree with you on the week thing, but also don't mind the compromise of the month. I think adding an extra tag ther is overkill Your right, I dont know how we can keep discussions going over a long time frame. Maybe the fact that there is something new worth talking about will help"

indieheads,3ddrub,hypermagic-mountain,8,Wed Jul 15 14:35:23 2015 UTC,The inevitable album announcement. That tracklisting and artwork is already making me excited.

indieheads,3df0fh,Schmecca,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:31:41 2015 UTC,Get back to guitars! I don't want Radiohead to just be an extension of Thom Yorke solo work.
indieheads,3df0fh,burritoman12,9,Wed Jul 15 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"I am with you....while I liked TKOL, Atoms for Peace and the solo album, this trend with a lot of bands shifting into mainly electronic-format is becoming tired. Though I don't suppose it will stop anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, I really like a lot of trance/house/ambient/experimental electronic. But, for example Beck has always kind of hand a hand in many different genres without getting ""stuck"" in one mode for too long."
indieheads,3df0fh,hiplink,8,Wed Jul 15 19:59:28 2015 UTC,Back to guitars ?  There are guitars all over TKOL...
indieheads,3df0fh,burritoman12,2,Wed Jul 15 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"yes but the band is turning to looped and produced tracks in such a way to sound like samples, and less of an organic rock performance. IMO their best work comes from a foundation of rock music and song structure rather than Yorke's solo project song structures that he brought to TKOL   TKOL is very much like 'The Eraser' and Atoms for Peace  ex. Feral, Separator, Bloom"
indieheads,3df0fh,hiplink,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"I would actually argue that the TKOL sounding the way it does isn't wholly down to Thom. In fact, I believe the idea of looping samples came from Jonny."
indieheads,3df0fh,nietzscheispeachy,3,Thu Jul 16 08:40:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that a lot of bands are neglecting the guitar, and it has been a bit fashionable to do so for quite some time.   As a guitarist, I have to say that it is really the most versatile instrument I can imagine. You have endless possibilities with the tones you can paint with, and the instrument gives you a lot of control if you're familiar enough with it.  I'm not saying indie needs more AC/DC licks, but just look at ""When You're Smiling And Astride Me,"" and what the soulful guitar fills do for that song."
indieheads,3df0fh,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the loops and overdone higher-pitched falsetto are getting old. I love Thom and I'm glad he's doing what he enjoys, but he's way too talented a musician to stagnate into boring and predictable electronica. Not saying their electronic stuff is bad by any means, but lately they've lost the highs, lows, dramatic changes, and anger/paranoia/passion that used to define their work. TKOL, AMOK, and TMB are all very similar in terms of style and song structure. It'd be nice to hear some melodic songwriting like In Rainbows again, and I'd definitely love to hear Jonny shred again."

indieheads,3dejei,Lets-Tessellate,46,Wed Jul 15 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I don't normally post in these, but I feel like I need to share this with you guys. I've had one of the craziest weeks of my life, super highs and terrible lows, those lows being crippling depression for the past couple days.  My friends don't listen to Future Islands (so they won't understand this) and the guy I was supposed to go to the concert with bailed on me because of the weather.  So there I was, solo going to see Future Islands, sober and straight as hell. I've never been to a concert alone. I got there early and got front row, tried to make some small talk with people around me but they were meh, so I kept to myself.  Three major highlights. Before they played Balance, Sam said something to the effect of ""this song is about when you're young and you think everything matters more than it does"". In the middle of the song, he crouched down, stared into my eyes and said ""it just takes time"", hoooly shit.   After that they played A Song for Our Grandfathers as the storm clouds were coming in, it was super epic and he ended the song staring into the sky. And of course it started pouring rain when they played Seasons as it was coming down on us, and the rain did not stop them from going as hard as they could. Which also didn't stop them from doing an encore with Spirit.   Amazing concert, fed my soul and changed my life. Go see Future Islands."

This week I discovered an illustrator because I saw someone (on the sub's Facebook event for Mac DeMarco AMA) with a beautiful illustration of her. I googled it and I found the stunning work of Yelena Bryksenkova.  I'm so in love with these drawings. She draws a lot of girls that look a little troubled, depressed or slightly absent minded. Yet, they are all portrayed in a gracious and elegant way. Her work is very intriguing. I absolutely love the color schemes, patterns and textures she uses, they really add to the charm of her illustrations. The weird perspective and Russian infuences are very cool too.  I want to post some of my favorites, but there are so many great ones. You should just check out the link above.  What are your favorite illustrators?"

indieheads,3dejei,Apotheosis91,4,Wed Jul 15 18:19:16 2015 UTC,My Girls and The Purple Bottle are fucking jams   There. Although I do feel like Person Pitch is quasi-AnCo given how closely related in approach to MPP it is.
indieheads,3dejei,niceworksara,5,Wed Jul 15 18:30:03 2015 UTC,I only hesitate to agree bc anco is a collaboration of musicians and pb solo stuff is inherently not a collaboration.  but they go nicely together - PP is like the spongy sweet dessert to the v filling MPP entree

indieheads,3dejei,Segal-train,9,Wed Jul 15 18:43:41 2015 UTC,I bought tickets to see King Gizzard in Missoula Montana in September. It is a ten hour drive but tickets were only five dollars so I think I end up around even.   I am going to Anaheim with my family next Sunday which will be super fun. I think Disneyland is the coolest place in the world so it is going to be a blast.
indieheads,3dejei,heart_BURN,4,Wed Jul 15 17:41:20 2015 UTC,Are trips to Montana like a regular thing for people? Seems like a state that doesn't have a lot going for it outside of being in the middle of nowhere.
indieheads,3dejei,Segal-train,5,Wed Jul 15 18:17:39 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I am from Saskatchewan so it is the closest state to me. King Gizzard are on the verge of breaking out so thought this might be one of last chances to see them in a smaller place. Missoula happened to be the closest show.

And by meditation i just mean finding someplace where you can get away from the people you know and occupy yourself with your thoughts on their own. I usually sit under/in a tree.

indieheads,3dejei,TheMummyDetective,4,Wed Jul 15 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Exercise helps immensely. I've also discovered recently how much treating your flesh vessel (your human form) with respect can drastically improve the health of your mind. Try to get decent sleep, assuming you're not already. And, maybe most important: eat well and drink water regularly. I'd typically skip breakfast or lunch due to simply forgetting to eat. Same goes with water: I'd just totally forget to drink it. Staying hydrated -- fer real hydrated, like, 8 bottles of water a day hydrated -- is totally important and makes your brain feel way better.  Or, maybe, none of this works. Tough to tell. Report back with results."

indieheads,3dejei,Thunder-Fist,8,Wed Jul 15 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"MERRY EAUX CLAIRES EVE!  This time tomorrow, I will be in Eau Claires getting ready for this fucking amazing music festival. I am soooooo insanely stoked. Like I haven't eaten anything today I'm to anxiously excited. There's no way in hell I'm sleeping tonight (unless I break into the eight of dope I picked up for this weekend)......  What are y'all most excited for? For me its seeing The Natty's, Suffy, and Bone Ivory's first (and last?) show in years, obviously, but really I'm most excited for all of the biggest suprises. Any predictions?  Thunder-Fist's EC Dream Suprises:  OBVIOUSLY everyone wants a Kanye show up. Odds of it happening? Who the fuck knows. But we'll all be fucking lit if it happens.  Other than that, I'm praying for a Gayngs set. A bunch of the members are already playing with their respective bands, and this would be fucking cool. IF we get a Gayngs set, how about some Har Mar Superstar? Gayngs member/solo artist Sean Tillmann AKA Har Mar Superstar puts on AMAZING live shows, and I'd kill for a set from him.  How about some more Minnesota music? Doomtree is playing, so I can pray for some of the members to do solo sets. That'd be bitchin. Maybe a Lazerbeak late night DJ set? How about Astronautalis? I know Andy has played some part as he's the festival's ""reverand"" or whatever, so we'll probably get a set from him. If he's there and P.O.S. (member of Doomtree and Marijuana Deathsquads) is there, they could break out some Four Fists songs (their colab group). Speaking of P.O.S, how about Justin Vernon coming out to do his verse on P.O.S's ""How We Land"" during Doomtree's set? $5 says he does - anyone want to take that bet? How about Aby Wolf? Last few times I saw Doomtree, she was up there singing. Could she be there? If she did a set, herself, I'd loooooovvvee it (If she does, DO NOT miss it).   What about Justin's other groups? Any chance we get a surprise Volcano Choir or The Shouting Matches set? That'd be killer.   My biggest hope for a surprise, though, is Pfarmers. Bryan Devendorf of The National's new super-ish-group kicks ASS, and I would KILL to see a surprise set from them. Odds? No clue. But I'll cry if they do.   What are y'all hoping happens? Any can't miss sets from artists I should know about - Liturgy or Sturgill Simpson is my biggest dilema right now... thoughts? How about a meet-up? Can we get an official EC meetup thread, mods? Who's camping this weekend? If anyone wants, we can meet up in the campgrounds and share a J/stories/excitement/friendship. GODDAMN I'M EXCITED."
indieheads,3dejei,_lucabear,3,Wed Jul 15 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Oh man I'd be so stoked if Pfarmers showed up. I'm wondering if Justin Vernon or Sufjan will show up during The National to do the backup vocals they've done for them in the past!

indieheads,3dejei,Apotheosis91,6,Wed Jul 15 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"I went to China in high school and had a weird airport experience basically every other day. Highlights include my friend making a rape joke while going through security behind a four-star general, one of our group getting detained because according to the border agent ""sightseeing is a sport,"" and my friends and I thinking we were going to get stranded in the Beijing airport because we tried to order a pizza.  Edit: The Pizza Story in full detail, as told on /r/aviation from the perspective of a closeted plane nerd.    I remember my first time seeing one clear as day.  The end of a 10 day school trip to China, and the whole group is completely drained, meanwhile I'm in planewatching heaven in the middle of Beijing Capital's Terminal 3. Largest airport in the world? I couldn't complain if I tried.  We have an hour to kill before our flight, and so we're desparate to find (western) food. Me and two friends embark on the hunt, but it's Sunday, nothing is open, and the terminal is so huge that it's a half hour to boarding by the time we find a restaurant. We see the menu, ask if they can make us a pizza in 20 minutes, they say yes, and we take a table. And so we wait  10, 15, almost 20 minutes.  Now being late to boarding might seem like a trifling matter, but keep in mind we're talking about three exhausted, anxious sixteen-year olds on the other side of the world for the first time in their lives. In our irrational heads, if we were two seconds late for boarding, we'd be stranded in China for the rest of our lives. 21 minutes and we're freaking out. My friend asks the waiter if it's almost ready, they say yes. 22. At this point we're considering just abandoning the pizza and running pack, seeing as we're at least a ten minute walk from our gate. One guy wants to leave, one wants to take the risk, they're bickering, I don't know what to do. 23 minutes. And then...  There she is.  Emirates A380, coming in for landing, graceful as a whale. The plane I've been waiting five years to see, and in the last seconds of the trip I finally saw it. I almost tear up.  ""You guys!' I say, almost leaping out of my seat. ""Look! An A380! Right there! Can you believe it! Guys, forget the pizza just come and look at this!""  Their response to my awestruck babbling is a swift ""SHUT THE FUCK UP""  ""Dude, we're fucked, nobody gives a shit about a plane, we have to go now!""  24 minutes, the pizza arrives. We grab all our Yuan, throw it on the table, and bolt. We don't have time to eat it, so we dine on the go. Three teenagers eating a pizza while sprinting through PEK as if their lives depended on it. It was quite the scene.  One minute before boarding, we arrive at our gate, winded and on the verge of tears with an empty pizza box in hand, greeted by all manner of strange looks from our travel group. We sit down, redfaced and exhausted, and as a final bit of humiliation we don't board the plane for another 20 minutes. But I didn't care. The A380 I had seen land pulled up to the gate right next to ours. I couldn't have been happier."

I went in expecting to get diagnosed with a chronic disease, and I didn't, which is good. Everything else was bad. Doctor wrote off all of my other symptoms after focusing in on pain in my elbow (even though my whole body has hurt for 4 months) and told me to double how much ibuprofen I'm taking, then refused to do a procedure to see if I really had the chronic disease that I thought I did (which was why another doctor referred me to her) because ""she hadn't done it in a year and was probably bad at it!"" She then told me to wait 2 weeks to see if my pain got worse, and if it did it was probably that chronic disease. I'm fucking pissed and frustrated and being sick is garbage."

Weird that they're releasing on Run for Cover considering DDW is their own label, but I guess RfC is pretty hot this year..."
indieheads,3dfq6z,finturf9012,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"For sure, they're honestly one of my favorite bands of recent years, and this 7"" is definitely a really cool refinement of their sound. As far as labels go, maybe they're on RFC for wider distribution opportunities. DDW is a great label, but as far as i know it's pretty much just Mike and Dave from LVL UP who run it themselves, so they may be limited in the number of orders they can handle at a time for a popular release. Then again, this may just be a one-off joint release, and everything else they do will be on DDW."
indieheads,3dfq6z,finturf9012,2,Fri Jul 17 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, it's one of the best groups in indie rock atm. I get what you're saying about the distribution issue at DDW, and I guess they've worked with EIS too, so its hardly unprecedented. Also saw they're touring with Basement and Adventures who're both on RFC, so it seems like a kindred spirits thing."

indieheads,3deuz6,calfman,10,Wed Jul 15 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will ever have another Red, Yellow, and Blue"
indieheads,3deuz6,MontyMoleMan,4,Wed Jul 15 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"That may be so, matching Red, Yellow and Blue is a tall order. I do still find each of their albums incredibly enjoyable and consistently good. Luke Lalonde's solo album is pretty great too. If they can keep churning out good albums, even if they aren't quite as good as Red, Yellow And Blue, I'll be very happy"
indieheads,3deuz6,jackieclay,2,Thu Jul 16 02:19:19 2015 UTC,I found their last release a bit forgettable but I'm actually really digging this song so far.

indieheads,3dg7ay,Fondofboobs,2,Thu Jul 16 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love HEALTH and I am really hyped for this album, but I kinda feel that the album would be a better listening experience if they had just released one or two songs.   Currents also suffered that problem in my opinion, they released too many singles and by the point the album leaked, people had already overplayed half of the album."
indieheads,3ddq0d,DeCrackers,11,Wed Jul 15 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck yes, I mess with this way more than the 40oz.  It kind of gets back to the Mac DeMarco argument of evolving your sound, but this sounds like some quintessential FIDLAR and I dig it.  My excitement for the new album is way up.  Ready to get drunk and scream along to this just like the s/t now."
indieheads,3ddq0d,MarryMe_StVincent,9,Wed Jul 15 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"This song is actually a year or two old, but I think this is a new version with an additional verse. This is a new video, though, and the old one, official or not, features Henry Rollins."
indieheads,3ddq0d,MarryMe_StVincent,5,Wed Jul 15 14:26:51 2015 UTC,well I certainly feel foolish.
indieheads,3ddq0d,MickChickenn,3,Wed Jul 15 14:31:28 2015 UTC,I actually just found out about it recently when searching the songs on the tracklist to see if any had leaked or been played live. But that explains why it sounds like their classic stuff I guess!
indieheads,3ddq0d,MarryMe_StVincent,5,Wed Jul 15 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel like 40oz represent an evolution in their sound. It was much slower and differently produced than the songs on their s/t. Also acoustic guitar (even if it is used sorta ironically)"
indieheads,3ddq0d,MickChickenn,6,Wed Jul 15 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"I did word this kind of poorly...  I meant that this single is a return to their old sound, which I like.  I think I'm in the minority here, but not every band needs to experiment and change up their sound that much.  FIDLAR is just a feel good, high energy, ""let's get fucked up"" kind of band for me.  The more they stay on the surf rock path and avoid the pop punk world, the better in my opinion."
indieheads,3ddq0d,The_Elder_Steak,3,Wed Jul 15 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I like 40oz, but it's definitely more pop punk than their usual stuff. If they released an entire album of Cheap Beer/Wake Bake Skate style surf rock tracks I'd be ecstatic"
indieheads,3ddq0d,canireddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"I feel this. If FIDLAR made three more albums of fun, upbeat, childish songs like the first album, I'd be totally fucking okay with that.

indieheads,3ddq0d,Pedrinho21,3,Wed Jul 15 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"I legitimately like the demos they uploaded on youtube way more than anything they have actually released (the original of this song included). The production value doesn't really mesh with their sound, I think. Plus only a couple of their good songs made it onto their LP, which I felt was full of filler. Still would like to see them live though."

They got 3 songs in, then we got dumped on. The rain and wind were something fierce. They had to call of the show, man I was soo bummed. They've been one of my favorite bands for over a decade now. I was gutted, but I understood that it wouldn't be safe to continue with the performance. Music was great however short lived it was. I just wanted to share cause I don't have anyone to tell haha. Hopefully I'll get another chance to see them soon, and hopefully in a inside venue so weather will NOT be a factor.   Alright indieheads, that's it. Love music and stay gold."

indieheads,3deokd,royo22,7,Wed Jul 15 18:05:36 2015 UTC,It depends. Sometimes I'm in the mood for some Swans or like a Sunn O))) or Godspeed (not really noise but drone-y). However I have to be in the mood for it or else the music does nothing for me.
indieheads,3deokd,OptimalAudio,6,Wed Jul 15 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Not usually. I enjoy Boris' more noisey/droney moments when they're contrasted to the usual pysch metal, but I can't listen to a full Sunn O))) record or Earth 2 without getting bored (The Bees Made Honey is fantastic though)."

I have a good friend who is really into noise and he put me onto it. Pure noise can be hard to listen to though. I love it when its mixed in with other genres, especially rock and metal. Hell even indie bands are very influenced by noise especially guys like Animal Collective. Their first album features quite a bit of noise."

I still feel that many of these artists fall under ""indie"" though.  Take a look at the Saint Heron compilation album - - a lot of great artists in there."
indieheads,3davql,mattyb712,5,Tue Jul 14 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Can we just kill the PBR&B tag already, please? I don't think any artist would like their music to be labeled as such.

indieheads,3davql,WhatWouldSpaderDo,5,Wed Jul 15 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, and I agree. I really love the genre so I want to respect it, but unfortunately that tag is one that everybody understands. ""Indie R&B"" doesn't sound right, you know?

If something works so that fans can, in general, know what sort of music you're talking about when you use that label, it works for me."

indieheads,3davql,_lucabear,31,Thu Jul 16 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're already familiar with both of these, but Young Fathers and Algiers both released really good albums this year, both of which might end up in my top 10. For anyone not familiar: Young Fathers have had a few different sounds over the years, most commonly though being a mix of hip hop, rock, pop, and other genres to create their own sound. Their album that came out this year, White Men Are Black Men Too is very akin to TV On The Radio, another important band in this discussion. Algiers on the other hand mix post-punk with soul and gospel, to create a very invigorating sound that gets you charged up. Their songs ""And When You Fall"" and ""Irony. Utility. Pretext"" actually touch on the ideas of bands using African music, which prompts a good discussion on influence vs. theft. A more unknown group is the band Chicano Batman, which is a Chicano psych-funk group based in LA. I'd suggest just starting with their s/t, which you can check out on Bandcamp. An artist similar in some ways to Chicano Batman is one many of you probably know, Devendra Banhart, who is part Venezuelan. With this, many of his songs are in Spanish. He's best described as freak folk, and I would suggest listening to Cripple Crow. He's also had some releases on Michael Gira's Young God Records, so that's cool. Last, someone who has done quite a bit of work and performances with Devendra, Rodrigo Amarante. He's a Brazilian singer who has played in bands before, but released his solo debut, Cavalo in 2013. His style is pretty close to Devendra, so if you like that, check this guy out! He's also at least trilingual, singing in Portuguese, English, and French!"

Their latest album, 2013's Idle No More, isn't quite as good as its predecessor - the second half of the album is a bit weak - but still has plenty of good tunes like ""Bite My Tongue"".  On the other hand, The King Khan & BBQ Show is a simple rock-and-roll duo. 50s and 60s sounds seem to be the primary influence. Check out ""I'll Be Loving You"" (2009) and ""Alone Again"" (2015)."

What does race even have to do with anything?     Uh, everything? At least in the U.S., (and I'm sure other places in the world, I'm just writing from my experience) race is a very important matter that music is inevitably tied up in because it is also a part of the culture. The musicians may not discuss it in the music, but some mentioned here do talk about issues or just celebrate their culture in their music which is also an important part of this."
indieheads,3davql,Rushdownsouth,0,Thu Jul 16 14:08:37 2015 UTC,"But music should be based off merit, not superficial aspects. I gave a list of artists that included people from all different backgrounds and honestly indie music has one of the most tolerant group of fans. If you honestly believe you will enjoy one artist more than another because they are your own race, that's lowkey racist.  ""I only listen to white artists because I'm proud to be white and I like listening to my own people."" Sounds fucked up, but hey, that's my opinion. I don't feel that race should have anything to do with music in America because our culture is shared universally.   If your opinion on someone is based solely by their race (good or bad), that's racist. Full stop."

Bands from their country of origin? Not being happy at token minorities?"
indieheads,3davql,Rushdownsouth,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"So then it's only tokenness when you listen to a band that has a solitary person of color? OP didn't ask, ""hey can you guys give me bands that are all white except for one person,"" it just so happened that many results ended up that way, even in my own comment with a band such as Algiers. But that doesn't make these bands any less important. People still could have and may suggest more traditional music.

The current obsession with race, trying to balance it one way or another, is what causes racism in my opinion. I think actively seeking music made by someone ethnic is just as bad as avoiding it, because you aren't judging the music on its merits. If people just stopped seeing things as ""a great album by a white rapper"" or ""a great metal band with blacks"" then the race obsession on both sides would dissolve. Maybe I exaggerated by saying race really doesn't matter, but the point I'm trying to make is that the best way to end racism isn't (again my opinion) to promote non whites but to just try as much as possible to stop thinking about it/obsessing over it. People are people and art is made by people regardless of color. It should be judged based on its quality, not its creator."

indieheads,3d99i6,cobbutkssotraoobat,37,Wed Jul 15 05:20:35 2015 UTC,"In case you don't want to watch an eight-minute video, here are all the points he makes.   Tame Impala appeared on the scene about 5 years ago with Innerspeaker.  I didn't like Innerspeaker as much as everyone else did because it was too Beatles and not that unique.  Lonerism was better in every way, vocally, instrumentally, and production-wise.  Unsurprisingly, Kevin became the new face of psych-rock revival because of that album.  But Kevin makes the change from psychedelic pop to something more synthetic this time around.  HI CAL! (go to 1:29 for this, I'm not spoiling it. It lasts 30 seconds.)  There are still some memorable guitar parts despite the album's change in sound.  I think the use of synthesizers is really creative. He uses lots of effects to make them sound dynamic. It's a good aesthetic change.  ""Yes I'm Changing"" and ""Eventually"" show Kevin's growth as a songwriter. I dig both of these.  Some new wave influences appear on the super-catchy ""The Moment"", which is reminiscent of ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"".  The disco-tinged ""The Less I Know the Better"" is also great.  There are also a few really short tracks to relax us from the really long ones.  ""Let It Happen"" is good and really creative. The repeated loop in the middle sounds like EDM.  The album remains colorful and engaging despite being more stylistically diverse than Lonerism. The production is fantastic.  My main issue is with the vocals. It's often a nasal falsetto, washed out with effects. Everyone does that these days.  The vocals aren't unlistenable, but they get less bearable as the album goes on. It makes something like ""Cause I'm a Man"" a little hard to listen to.  ""Past Life"" also has this problem, but it's overshadowed by the weird spoken word bits.  ""Reality in Motion"" has flavorless vocals. ""Disciples"" sounds inexplicably unfinished.  The second half of this album feels really lackluster compared to the first.  The album ends semi-strong, but the last track fades out. Odd way to end the album.  A weird album overall, because of how quickly it loses focus as it progresses.  Not as good as Lonerism, but I'm still excited for Kevin's future music since he took risks on this album. And it was pretty decent.  Strong 6 to light 7."
indieheads,3d99i6,two_bagels_please,14,Tue Jul 14 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a fair review, and it's probably the one that best reflects my feelings on Currents. Parker is clearly a strong musician who successfully sees his ideas out. Still, some parts are lackluster and are a bit too drawn out. Also, ""Disciples"" is unjustly abrupt! That song has the best hook, but it's a paltry 1:40 song! With more thought and effort, that could have been the standout track of the album."
indieheads,3d99i6,cobbutkssotraoobat,13,Tue Jul 14 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"That last part I disagree with. Because ""Disciples"" repeats the same melody every six seconds, it would be too exhausting if it went on any longer. Also, the part where he turns on and off the switch to change the production style is just fantastic."
indieheads,3d99i6,plantmouth,2,Tue Jul 14 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it doesn't need to be any longer than it is at all. It's fully formed at the length it's at."

indieheads,3d99i6,BiBoJuFru,66,Tue Jul 14 22:57:04 2015 UTC,"Innerspeaker sounded like a Beatles cover band for the indie generation   Am I the only one who doesn't hear that... at all? I am a huge fan The Beatles, obviously, but, other than Parker's voice, I don't see any significant similarities. The only other connection is that the two bands make poppy guitar music. But that's vague and general as hell."
indieheads,3d99i6,LordSifter,33,Tue Jul 14 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"Me neither, it always seemed a lazy comparison. He does have a very Lennon- esque voice, but the songs are nothing like Beatles songs."
indieheads,3d99i6,1apacherosepeacock,16,Tue Jul 14 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Parker's voice is also not really an intentional Lennon knock-off. During his AMA he said something about learning to sing by listening to his dad's Beatles records, and that coupled with his accent makes him sort of sound like John Lennon."
indieheads,3d99i6,double_shadow,11,Tue Jul 14 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I actually never even realized that he sounded like Lennon until it was pointed out so much in reviews. I think because Lennon's singing was so multi-faceted, and Parker sings in only one of those styles Lennon used."
indieheads,3d99i6,yikesagoo,7,Tue Jul 14 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"I did not hear the comparison at all until a friend recently pointed that out after listening to them for the first time. I had to agree with him, but I was so surprised I never thought about it (or remembered thinking it) before."
indieheads,3d99i6,nietzscheispeachy,4,Tue Jul 14 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. Honestly, Tame Impala has never been as big of a 'nostalgia' trip as they are on Currents, for better or for worse. Still, a lot of people dismissed them in the past for wearing their influences on their sleeves. I love The Beatles and wouldn't listen to Tame Impala if I thought all they do is imitate The Beatles. It's really just Parker's voice, and at this stage I'm not even sure if he can help it. The songwriting isn't similar at all."
indieheads,3d99i6,RedKamo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"First time I heard a Tame Impala song, the very first thing I remember thinking about was how he sounded just like Lennon. But I agree, the music itself doesn't bear too much resemblance to The Beatles."

The production is stellar and it makes me think of candy though, so that's good."
indieheads,3d99i6,OptimalAudio,11,Tue Jul 14 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, this review absolutely nailed how I feel. Strong beginning, stellar production, some really strong tracks. But the album just kind of drags around the halfway point, and part of the problem is his vocals and also the synthesizer tones, both eventually feel a bit samey.  Still, not bad on the whole."
indieheads,3d99i6,TheDWhitehouse,5,Tue Jul 14 14:40:29 2015 UTC,Yeah the second half was terrible and Past Life sucks.
indieheads,3d99i6,FrozenBum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:44 2015 UTC,I really like past life ( :( ) but I can see why some wouldn't
indieheads,3d99i6,TheKingOfGhana,2,Tue Jul 14 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's an absolutely stellar track. Sonically and texturally there's a lot going on. It's like if someone had a synth orgasm. The voice speaking adds tension and refrain, until you're just itching for the gushing melody again."
indieheads,3d99i6,willforthrill,2,Wed Jul 15 00:42:01 2015 UTC,like that's low-key the dankest thing out this year   Is this some new dank meme I wasn't aware of or are you for reals right now?
indieheads,3d99i6,farfle10,25,Wed Jul 15 02:56:40 2015 UTC,I ultimately fall somewhere between Fantano and Pitchfork but leaning towards Pitchfork. While I acknowledge most of the flaws Anthony mentioned they don't bother me quite as much and I'm ultimately really enjoying the hell out of this album.
indieheads,3d99i6,alabrasa301,6,Wed Jul 15 05:52:22 2015 UTC,"Sometimes Anthony gets hung up about stuff that I and many others just do not see at all. He spent a lot of time complaining about the vocals which makes him the first person I've heard complain about that. This has happened with many other reviews too, which is a shame, because more often then not I think AF is on point."
indieheads,3d99i6,gugs,-29,Tue Jul 14 14:49:44 2015 UTC,or maybe you don't have to have your opinions dictated by music reviews?
indieheads,3d99i6,alabrasa301,42,Tue Jul 14 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Are we going to do this every time there's a review post? A lot of people use reviews to flesh out their ideas around an album. There's a contingent on this sub of commenters who always add things like this, and these comments don't contribute to the discussion at all. It's some shitty attempt to judge people on how they're consuming and interacting with new music. Just let people absorb reviews as much or as little as they want."
indieheads,3d99i6,gugs,-14,Tue Jul 14 15:07:29 2015 UTC,yes it seems that we do have to do this every time because people get too butthurt over a review they don't agree with.
indieheads,3d99i6,chillinwithkrillin,10,Tue Jul 14 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"People discussing why they agree or disagree with the posted review is why we have these threads. I don't think anyone gets overly upset in here -- that's one of the reasons I like this sub, people put time and thought into their reactions to these things. Even if they weren't as well-thought out, don't you think there's something to be said for just letting people have their reactions?"
indieheads,3d99i6,bobpndrgn,32,Tue Jul 14 15:16:19 2015 UTC,Cal's meltdown perfectly portraying a majority of this sub lmao
indieheads,3d99i6,nietzscheispeachy,14,Tue Jul 14 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"I like the change, it's just too divisive. So many people either love it or hate it and I personally just like it - I don't think it deserves a 9.3 from Pitchfork."
indieheads,3d99i6,CharminglyIrreverent,3,Tue Jul 14 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"Not really. I don't think anyone could have possibly expected them to stay the same. I think this is a straw man argument, and no one was actually expecting Lonerism II. Really, the most common complaints are about the songwriting."
indieheads,3d99i6,farfle10,4,Tue Jul 14 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"i've yet see someone argue that they didn't like it because he changed, only that the change in direction wasn't one that....was....good."
indieheads,3d99i6,Downvote_for_peter,3,Tue Jul 14 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like the guy above you said, it's easier for people who love this album to justify why it's great to people that don't love it by telling them they just can't accept change."
indieheads,3d99i6,TheSimonToUrGarfunkl,13,Tue Jul 14 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'm guilty of occasionally riding the hype train around bands like Tame Impala. I enjoy Fantano's reviews because he usually brings me back to reality with a more objective view of an album. While I enjoyed the 2nd half upon first listen, I tend to skip 2 or 3 of the later songs now that I'm on my 1000th spin just so I can get back to the better songs. But it's partially because those good songs are REAL good. He tends to be harsher in his reviews than I am, especially on albums that flirt with the pop genre. Fair enough. I'd probably give it an 8.5. P'forks 9.3 feels too high. Currents doesn't have the impact that C&L did this year. It's hard to call them equals."

indieheads,3d99i6,double_shadow,19,Tue Jul 14 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"7/10 sounds about right, at least after a first listen.  Fantano gets a lot of flack, but regardless of whether you agree with his opinion or not, the guy knows his stuff and does a very good job portraying it. Respect."
indieheads,3d99i6,versaceglock,11,Tue Jul 14 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"I get a bit fed up with him at time, but when he stays on point like he did for this review, he's really articulate and insightful."
indieheads,3d99i6,role34,11,Tue Jul 14 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"he knows his opinion, and that's what he provides. most of his reviews are just him saying what he likes or doesn't like  personally, i don't find his analysis interesting or even all that valuable 9 times out of 10, especially compared to other youtube critics (dead end hip hop, spectrumpulse) who really get into their material. Fantano just sorta says ""instrumentation"" a lot and creates subgenres of pop music twice per sentence ""here we have a great mall-pop record for those of you who like their pop music to be bookstore-pop"" type shit  i probably take his channel less seriously than every other critic channel or website i visit, tbh"
indieheads,3d99i6,thithiths,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"tru, I find him to be a dick at it times  the DGD album was just him trashing on someone's work. He had no reason to review it   he likes what he likes, he's good at influencing people more then anything."
indieheads,3d99i6,LavenderQuackz,4,Tue Jul 14 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"Fantano's range of genres that his opinion is well-informed and useful is quite a bit narrower than he thinks it is. He said that Pianos Become the Teeth's The Lack Long After sounded too much like American Football. He said that Every Time I Die has bad lyrics. If it isn't indie rock, black metal, or alt rap, then I don't give his opinion a second thought."
indieheads,3d99i6,11trobo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"Instant Gratification definitely did not deserve a 1. Even if it's not his kind of music, it's a ridiculous score. I don't understand why he even took his time for that review"
indieheads,3d99i6,csklr,5,Tue Jul 14 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Just a question, are all of these reviews reviewing the leak, or is it out offically?"
indieheads,3d99i6,AustinMatthew,11,Tue Jul 14 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Don't know about Fantano specifically, but critics get advance copies, so there's no need to review a leak. In fact, advance copies are why we have leaks."
indieheads,3d99i6,SinceCirca,6,Tue Jul 14 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"I think they put it on NPR last week, so semi-official though we haven't met the release date yet."

indieheads,3d99i6,cobbutkssotraoobat,3,Tue Jul 14 19:01:43 2015 UTC,Didn't like Disciples.   Fucking fight me Anthony
indieheads,3d99i6,bobpndrgn,5,Tue Jul 14 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Slightly higher than my personal score, but okay.  Also, ""Disciples"" is awesome."
indieheads,3d99i6,auroblamp,2,Wed Jul 15 05:20:01 2015 UTC,I feel this review is more accurate than Pitchforks.  Fantano summed up a lot of my opinions - with the major complaint being that this LP sounds generic at times.
indieheads,3d99i6,Downvote_for_peter,3,Tue Jul 14 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"The production really is better then any other Tame Impala album, but I still feel like half the songs have no need to be on here. Let It Happen is a terrible opener and feels completely different from the other songs on this album, Nangs is a two minute build up song that decides to fade out at the end, Past Life is insanely lazy songwriting, I forget that Gossip and Love/Paranoia are even on this album, and NP, SM doesn't work as a closer. The songs on this album that are good are fantastic, but the album as a whole is too disjointed and up-and-down  7.5/10"
indieheads,3d99i6,FyuuR,26,Tue Jul 14 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"Do you not like Let It Happen as an opener specifically, or not like it at all? Because quite frankly I think it's one of the best songs I've heard in years and I'd enjoy it no matter where it fell on the track list."
indieheads,3d99i6,bladdy,22,Tue Jul 14 14:56:01 2015 UTC,It's the best track on the album for me
indieheads,3d99i6,shirim,14,Tue Jul 14 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"Man my biggest gripe about this album is the release of the singles.  Imagine if we never heard Let It Happen up until the albums release? It would've been such a great surprise and amazing intro into the album.   ""Eventually"" and ""The Less I Know the Better"" should've been the two singles."
indieheads,3d99i6,breadburger,8,Tue Jul 14 15:24:20 2015 UTC,Totally agree with this. It would have totally been a different reception.
indieheads,3d99i6,craigthecrayfish,5,Tue Jul 14 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"I only heard cause I'm a man before listening to currents and let me agree with you. this album was sonically amazing, coming from a person who disliked the previous two."
indieheads,3d99i6,auroblamp,5,Tue Jul 14 16:53:33 2015 UTC,I like the track by itself but I don't like it as an album opener. I almost think it works best as a standalone track. It's long and unfocused and doesn't really sound like anything else on the album.
indieheads,3d99i6,heart_BURN,3,Tue Jul 14 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it should have just been a one off tame impala song"
indieheads,3d99i6,auroblamp,4,Tue Jul 14 16:31:49 2015 UTC,I agree. It is probably my favorite Tame Impala songs if we are getting all frankly around here.
indieheads,3d99i6,ArnoldClaudeStallone,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"The song on its own is great, but it doesn't work for me as an opener or in the context of this album"
indieheads,3d99i6,PepeSylvia11,2,Tue Jul 14 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of his criticism and his score (I'd give it a 6.5 which would translate to a strong 6/light 7 in Fantano numbers), but I think Disciples is a good track, it should be longer but it's catchy and upbeat."
indieheads,3d99i6,breadburger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with Fantano a bit more here. Pitchfork just has a seething love for Tame Impala and I don't get it. Once the nostalgic factor wears off you see Parker is quite one-dimensional. Not discounting his music, he's talented as hell, and Currents sounds excellent. I just have too many problems with it to decide to hail it. Overall a fine record that's fun to listen to."

indieheads,3d99i6,breadburger,-5,Tue Jul 14 17:08:03 2015 UTC,There is no joke. He's just overly animated and annoying. I guess that's what YouTube is now. People have no attention span so you have to scream and be loud and annoying as fuck to get the kids watching. Straight up he's just annoying.
indieheads,3d99i6,emd2013,2,Tue Jul 14 17:26:18 2015 UTC,It's his character Cal Chuchesta. And it's a pretty funny character to be honest. You have to watch his other videos to get context.

indieheads,3d9x2k,ReconEG,4,Tue Jul 14 17:18:39 2015 UTC,Talk Talk this week and Explosions in the Sky next Tuesday. Post-Rock double feature here in FYC.
indieheads,3d9x2k,waffel113,3,Tue Jul 14 17:35:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reminder to check this album out again. I listened to a bit of it a long time ago but never got back to it.
indieheads,3d9x2k,justrollinwithit,4,Tue Jul 14 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered what the reaction was amongst fans of the pop Talk Talk when they transitioned into this kinda stuff. I mean they acquired a large fanbase and received considerable mainstream attention, and then went on to make inaccessible anti-rock and arguably invent a genre in the process. That's ballsy, and quite a shift.  Oh and this is easily one of my top 10 favourite albums of all time. It's really beautiful for something so loose and out there."
indieheads,3d9x2k,DisgruntledPorcupine,5,Tue Jul 14 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that Spiderland and Laughing Stock are credited as the two albums that created post-rock. I don't deny this claim (it's probably right!), but what is intriguing is that LS's relationship to post-rock. Spiderland's influence is obvious and its imitators more so, pulling out their time-shifts and dynamic changes in volume and keys. It's angular approach -- perfected on Spiderland -- is easy mime (but hard to do well).   LS is stranger. In contrast to most post-rock artists, this album favors anti-climaxes and uncertainty, each moment hanging on a string. Whereas many post-rockers build a steady momentum (like Slint), Talk Talk have little more than airy ambience to support the frail structure of this record. It's a much harder record to replicate. Indeed, I'm not even sure if any of the songs on LS have even been performed for an audience."
indieheads,3d9x2k,two_bagels_please,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"I think artists making that dramatic of a change is always a good thing. The Colour of Spring was already a dramatic change in itself, to put in a modern context, it is a bigger change then Tame Impala on Currents or Arcade Fire with Reflektor IMO. But what transpired in The Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock is a musical miracle, inspiring not only the creation of the post-rock genre but rock music as a whole (does anyone see Ok Computer without it?). Ascension Day is my favorite track, I can't pick out favourite lyrics without feeling guilty. The most under discussed and under appreciated part of the two albums is Mark's lyrics. I think this partially due to his delivery they serve more as another instrumental piece to the album, but take your time and examine them and you can see how powerful they are. I am not  a religious man, but listening to the two albums is as close of a spiritual experience as I need. Just to pick one passage   Westward/ Evening sun recedent/ Set my resting / Hold in open heart  I love this album, an easy 10/10 and probably if hard pressed right now, I would be in my top 10, I still think Spirit of Eden is better. I can't really explain why, just everything I love about Laughing Stock I like about Spirit of Eden a tiny bit more."

indieheads,3dame9,heart_BURN,3,Tue Jul 14 21:27:00 2015 UTC,I am listening to The Monitor by Titus Andronicus right not and this album probably fits exactly that concept/musical narrative you're looking for.

I gave The Monitor a shot about a week or two ago and it was definitely what I'm looking for. No Future Pt. 3 perfectly describes the last three years of my life and the war themed quotes scattered throughout the album really tie the album together. Thanks for the recommendation!"
indieheads,3dame9,_lucabear,3,Tue Jul 14 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"For one that is kind of similar music to Newsom, check out Timbre's Sun & Moon. It's a very loose concept album, but it's also just a great album anyways. Probably my favorite concept album is Anais Mitchell's Hadestown, which is a folk opera about the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. It also features some other indie musicians as the characters, with Justin Vernon being the most notable as Orpheus."

indieheads,3d9ofj,skymind,9,Tue Jul 14 16:18:54 2015 UTC,"I've been torn for months about going given I only live a few hours away and the chance to see Bon Iver reunite (not to mention The National, Sufjan, and everybody else) seems too good to pass up.  BUT, I can't find anybody to go with and going alone seems kind of depressing.  Any interest in an indieheads meet-up?  Having a few friendly faces in the crowd just might tip the scales in favor of me making the trip."
indieheads,3d9ofj,MrNovember14,3,Tue Jul 14 16:31:24 2015 UTC,I guarantee you will not regret going alone. No one's there to make fun of you. Just went to Primavera Sound solo (i live in california) and i had the time of my life. You just got to be willing to put yourself out there.

Also, I have not personally seen Low, but a couple of my friends saw them in a really small venue.  They said it was the best show of their lives and that Low was great.  I'm not very familiar with The Staves so I can't say anything for or against them.  Regardless, you can't go wrong.  It's gonna be an awesome festival."

The only reason they have a bad taste in their mouth is because they've been listening to the radio too much. Pop itself is such an unspecific genre anyway, it can be found in just about all types of music and doesn't even have to be straight to the point. Plenty of artists experiment with the ""pop"" flavor such as Byork or Mac Demarco for examples."

indieheads,3d80r2,timetostayuseless,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:11:05 2015 UTC,I really liked the different direction of Empty Estate but obviously it's no where near on the level of Nocturne. I doubt I'd really enjoy a much greater departure from what made that album so incredible.
indieheads,3d80r2,cartman500,2,Tue Jul 14 22:07:10 2015 UTC,From what I heard when I saw them LA a few months back a lot of the new material sounds really promising. I'm sure something has to drop this year at some point.

indieheads,3d6kmi,VanillaSweat,14,Mon Jul 13 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Definitely check out the sidebar to familiarize yourself with the schedule. As a general rule of thumb, the only things that should be posted as new threads are either [Fresh] music/news or participation threads, and not requests for info/suggestions. You're new here so I get it though! There's plenty of opportunities to talk about older music here in some of the scheduled threads too - it's not exclusively new stuff.  For vinyl, you have a couple options on a budget. Definitely don't even look at the Crosleys or Crosley imposters. I'd really recommend buying vintage for the best quality and the best bang for your buck. The only things that you should even consider buying new on a budget are the U-Turn Orbit and the Audio Technica LP-120, and those aren't ""cheap"". Vinyl is expensive. If you're looking for a cheap hobby, be warned that this is not it. You want to make sure your turntable has a counterweight or else it'll damage your records. Also don't get any of those ""all-in-one"" systems. You'll want a receiver/amp, passive speakers, and a preamp if it isn't built in already.  Let me know if you have any questions!"
indieheads,3d6kmi,jake_dpp,3,Mon Jul 13 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"My apologies friend, should I delete this subthread or is it okay to leave up? I appreciate the help, I'm still getting used to the site, it's a little cluttered but promising. And very good, I like the scheduling you guys have!  Yeah normally I only buy cd's to play in the car because I enjoy physical copies, but I always wanted to try vinyl solely because of the enhanced quality and culture of it."
indieheads,3d6kmi,jake_dpp,5,Mon Jul 13 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"No worries! Keep it up, just for future reference. It's kind of fun seeing new people say hello anyway haha.   Before you pull the trigger on that LP60 btw, know that it doesn't have a counterweight and is not recommended on most vinyl communities.  Also, CDs are generally higher sound quality than vinyl. Just a warning. I like collecting them because they're cool pieces of history with unique inserts and big pieces of art, and it's fun to play them with friends."
indieheads,3d6kmi,number90901,2,Mon Jul 13 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"Huh, really? I'm not exactly sure why there's been a huge resurgence in the vinyl industry then...hmm...  Definitely agree, I love being able to have the large artwork and packaging that comes with particular records, but hmm, I'll have to think about it then if cd's have better quality. But it'd be cool to collect both when I have spare money around."
indieheads,3d6kmi,jake_dpp,3,Mon Jul 13 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"Vinyl doesn't just sound like it's worse sound quality though. Even though it's technically not as good, it does sound different than CD and is a nice way to get a slightly different experience with an album."
indieheads,3d6kmi,ModestMase,2,Tue Jul 14 00:58:24 2015 UTC,"There's also a cassette resurgence too, if that tells you anything! I still collect CDs too. I just like owning the physical music rather than just a licence to it. No one ever asks to scroll though my library when they're over (and I hardly have a digital library anymore thanks to streaming!)."
indieheads,3d6kmi,ubermencher,7,Tue Jul 14 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"Sup bud,  Like others have said.  Vinyl is expensive and addictive.  But it feels good to contribute to the music you love.  After years of stealing music, it lightens the guilt.  My personal recommendation would be to seek out an older vintage turntable for a couple of reasons.  You get more bang for your buck, you won't have the exact same goddamn Audiotechnica turntable that every new collector buys (not hating on anyone who got an LP-60, but it seems like EVERYONE got one in the last year or 2 and there are SO many vintage TT's just waiting to be brought back to life), and most importantly....there's a good chance you might have to do some adjusting/maintenance on an older model which is a great opportunity to learn a lot about turntables.  How they work, how they break, how to clean them, and what exactly everything does.  This will go a long way in the future.  Who's cooler than the guy you ask about turntable related inquiries?  Nobody."
indieheads,3d6kmi,willforthrill,3,Mon Jul 13 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"/r/vinyl would be a better place for this. They have lots of resources for that including these handy guides, but the gist is that has most of the feature present on this turnable, look at the base of the tonearm and you'll see the two most important parts in a solid turntable that won't damage your records, anti-skate, and counter weight adjustment. These make sure that the needle doesn't put too much weight on the record and that it doesn't hop or slide around on the disc. Brands to look for used include Technics, Pioneer, Hitachi, and Sanyo, new your best bets are U-turn, Pro-ject, and Audio-Technica (but not the LP60) Other than that you'll want a pre-amp and either headphones or speaker to listen through."
indieheads,3d6kmi,jake_dpp,4,Tue Jul 14 04:35:03 2015 UTC,Don't get a Crosley. Otherwise you are fine. If you are looking into a new turntable (which I would recommend to a beginner since you don't know what to look for in a used turntable) I would recommend Audio Technica. I got an AT-LP60 a few months ago as my first turntable and I haven't had any problems (yet)!
indieheads,3d6kmi,chareth_cutestory66,6,Mon Jul 13 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate here, the LP-60 is generally advised against because it doesn't have a counterweight. That leads to a lot of problems tracking on some records and will also cause damage to your records over time. Because you're going to spend so much money on records anyway, it's worth paying the extra money for the LP120.   Some people don't have problems playing records on the LP60, but /r/vinyl has people posting about issues with it pretty regularly.  Just want OP to have another perspective!"
indieheads,3d6kmi,Bert306,3,Mon Jul 13 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, I looked up the model, looks pretty nice!"
indieheads,3d6kmi,heart_BURN,3,Mon Jul 13 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a prick, but the LP60 is pretty much a Crosley."
indieheads,3d6kmi,Joff_Mengum,2,Tue Jul 14 04:26:37 2015 UTC,"Just get a turntable with anti-skate. Anti-skate is a force which counteracts the tone arm being pulled into the centre of the turntable and the side wall of the vinyl's groove. Generally the anti-skate setting should be the same as the tracking force on the cartridge, however this do not always work out correctly. I'd recommend a Dual turntable if you could find a used one.  If you want more information go to http://www.dual-reference.com/tableinx.htm"
indieheads,3d6kmi,garethom,2,Mon Jul 13 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"Hey man, don't forget to check out /r/vinyl ! As for suggestions, I know this might sound counter productive but if you want to start getting into buying vinyl, just go get some! Start building up your collection before you get your table. It'll be motivation to get one, and allows you to go shops and get an idea on how much the table and records cost.   I always recommend to newbies and broke college kids to start digging in the used bins at your local shops. Try looking for some classics for yourself and get collection fillers. Don't stress too much about the quality at this point. Just buy albums that you'd think you would want on vinyl. The added bonus of collecting before you get  table too is the increases the chances you'll get one as a gift.   It is a fun hobby to get into and you'll learn more as you get more into it. Don't stress about getting the ""best"" set in the beginning. There is a reason vinyl was replaced by easier and higher quality technology but there is also a reason it has seen a resurgence. Crate digging is also a fun, quirky date for all the girls you'll meet in college too.   Just be warned, like everyone is telling you, it is expensive and addictive. I have about 150 records total and a they are probably worth a couple grand.   Have fun though and support your local record stores."
indieheads,3d6kmi,aspl,2,Tue Jul 14 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"Just to check, you are aware that you need an amplifier and speakers as well as a turntable right? All in one set ups are available but they'll sound pretty bad and might damage any records you use on them.  Check /r/vinyl for further advice but generally if you want to work on a budget then your best bet is to look for vintage equipment. I had to splash out a bit on my amp and speakers but I got my turntable for £20 off my maths teacher."
indieheads,3d6kmi,defiant_taco,2,Tue Jul 14 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"As someone that tried to do it on a budget initially, my advice might sound counter-productive, but I'll go ahead anyway.  Just get a decent set of turntables from the off, but get them second hand. I don't really do much ""listening"" on turntables, it tends to just be DJing, but search craigslist/gumtree/ebay/etc. for a good set up.  Personally, I went for the Technics 1210s. They were 10 years old when I bought them about 5 years ago, all original pieces, built like an absolute tank, sleek design, no problems whatsoever. Platter still spins at the correct speed, everyting is nice. They cost me £300 for 2, but there are people out there that will sell individual decks.  Buy one, enjoy a better quality table, never buy another one again. Also, invest in a good stylus and cartridge, and set the weight on the tonearm properly!  Hope that was helpful. Oh, and when it comes to records, especially old records, don't just fork out for the £30 reissue at Urban Outfitters or whatever. Check out Discogs, and see if you can get it in great condition, second hand for a few £/$ instead!"
indieheads,3d6kmi,swik,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, here's some more general advise:   Don't buy a shitty record player, avoid the stuff that looks vintage, e.g. Crosleys, they'll fuck up your records. Honestly, with a slim budget you're better off buying a used ""vintage"" record player off ebay, the contemporary stuff is a lot more expensive. Store your records like books, don't stack them or they will warp."

I looked like Roy Neary from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I had to go to work like that. A year later, the other summer student still makes fun of me for that.

Context for anyone not following the /u/Killatrap romantic roller coaster: My best friend and I had been suppressing feelings for each other for a very long time and there was a lot of complicated non-relationship stuff going on and it was just a weird time. Anyways, she committed to West Point in March out of a combination of familial pressure and financial factors. They have to report to basic training on June 29th, which takes them all the way through to August, when the school year starts. Anyways, there was a lot of bad blood in June over things I won't talk about now, but a week before she had to leave we both got drunk independently and confessed our feelings for each other and then the next day we listened to Ceremony by New Order and everything went crazy and like we worked through all of our bad blood in a very positive and healthy way and we did everything we could possibly do in the last week before she left.  Anyways, because she's at Cadet Basic Training, they don't have anything, so the only way she can communicate is with letters, which has been surreal and archaic and I'm like a 19 year old girl from the 50s awaiting the letter of her deployed marine.   So letters are weird right, but anyways, I had to drop something off at her house the other day and so I went there and her dad answered the door. It was one of the most uncomfortable encounters in my life, which was weird because me and her dad are chill and I'm a fairly sociable and charming person and I was being all cool and stuff and I was wearing my work shirt to look extra wholesome too. Anyways, he was being really blunt and cold and just weird and kinda kicked me out the door and I was confused because i thought he liked me but I just assumed that maybe he thought my liberal views were getting in the way of her indoctrination? I had no idea....  until I got a letter 2 hours later that explained that her mom had asked about what we had done together in her last week and she told her mom about us and stuff etc etc and then HER MOM TOLD HER DAD  I HAD MY FIRST INTERACTION WITH A FATHER AFTER HE LEARNED I DID THINGS WITH HIS DAUGHTER  IM TRAUMATIZED  THE AWKWARDNESS MADE SO MUCH SENSE   HELP  also ""I Need My Girl"" by the national is 2 real"

It was the perfect job for a high schooler who was pretty introverted and just needed money to be a high schooler with. I worked full time, I worked week nights closing and would just be on my own for 5-6+ hours 3-4 times a week, which was amazing. I got my work done fast as fuck after a while and would just read books in the box office and we'd only see 10-20 people after 9PM or so on week nights. Very limited interactions with the public and my managers were cool with me doing homework/reading.  So after 5-6 months of that I was basically being payed to do my homework.  I got 'promoted' to doing inventory which left me on my own all night doing inventory which was also very nice because I could, then again, get my shit done quick and then do homework for the rest of my shift until we closed our money vault.   Cool shit for me. Free movies. I got to screen stuff early, saw Inherent Vice a week early, etc. I made enough to go to 2-3 concerts a month, get music I wanted, and take my girlfriend out whenever I wasn't working so overall good experience/worth it.  I'm working a higher paying job now for the city doing maintenance at a public recreation center which is also quite nice for what I need in a summer job. I get to listen to music and I work short 4-5 hour shifts in the morning so I'm left to do whatever I want for the rest of my day.  Only other job I've worked was being a server at a shitty diner which was way worse as it forced constant interaction and some days I was just not in the mood whatsoever to put on a good attitude for people relentlessly."

indieheads,3d4yl7,Apotheosis91,6,Mon Jul 13 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"Besides my part time job: I used to sell t-shirts on redbubble until they got removed and my account got shut down for copyright lol. I was making Game of Thrones designs and Breaking Bad ones cause that's whatever everyone else was making. Whilst they were my designs on these IPs, they weren't my IPs so it's fair they stopped me (although you'll still find plenty if you go on the site now). It was pretty shameless, but capitalism got the better of me (didn't have a job at this time if that makes it better).  Made about £600 over two years before it ended, and I didn't even do anything besides working on a design for an hour or two and uploading it - made about ten designs in total.   10/10 easy money."
indieheads,3d4yl7,gugs,5,Mon Jul 13 16:33:14 2015 UTC,How does it work with redbubble? What's your cut? Does users get removed for using artist logos/names?
indieheads,3d4yl7,MarryMe_StVincent,4,Mon Jul 13 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"There is a baseline amount (£15~ IIRC) that redbubble get, then you add any amount onto that and that's what you get, which was typically around £3 (for t-shirts, other items vary). So occasionally I'd get an email saying I've made a sale and get £3. At the end of the months I'd get what I've made into my paypal.  They will if they get caught but if you can go unnoticed you get away with it. Marvel's lawyers were very vigilant in removing anything that used their logos, superheroes, etc."

It's been really surreal and cool for me because it's one of my favorite shows and I'm lucky enough to be getting paid so it's a pretty sweet gig all around. Only downsides are the long hours and the fact that it's almost always go-go-go and everything is an emergency, but you kind of get used to it after a while and it makes it extra nice when it settles down (like now). Also running into famous people is fun/weird. 9/10.

How do you manage? Do you work in corporate?"
indieheads,3d4yl7,Rivolver,4,Mon Jul 13 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"I mean I didn't go to school for anything law related so I had to play catch up pretty quick.    It's not a bad job, and it is very easily.  The attorneys in my office don't know how to handle stress so that kind of trickles down to me which is by far the worst part of the job.  You read me correctly, I am very relaxed so when people are spazzing out and freaking out it really irks me.  I work with personal injury cases and then criminal/traffic.  If you stay on top of things it's easy and you have a lot of down time (hence why I'm on reddit all the time).  I would think if I went to school for law or just had more of an interest in it I would enjoy it more. This is strictly a paycheck for me.  I'm currently looking for a bartending job because that will probably be more my speed, then I can figure out what I want to do from there.  I used to work service industry jobs in school and I miss the social aspect of that.  I can go for hours without talking to anyone in my office.  It's small and I'm the youngest person here by 15+ years.  My situation is obviously pretty unique as well, I wouldn't say this is very indicative to the average office."

We're going to see Pluto tomorrow, for realsies. None of that blurry Hubble shit. It really is a lovely time to be alive.

indieheads,3d4yl7,hshehz,6,Mon Jul 13 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"Feeling pretty meh today. I've fallen into this weird emotional limbo where I'm stuck between a) feeling optimistic and happy about the gal  I've fallen for that's travelling in Europe, b) terribly missing my ex and feeling like somebody is taking a melon scooper to my chest, and c) thinking that I should just be content with my most recent ""thing"" and go back to that and pretend to be happy because it was mostly ok, and she's generally super sweet, but really I know we're toxic.  Y'all know about the first thing - she's in Europe, we're texting a lot, having some nice conversation and what not, and I'm optimistic about it because I think we have a good chance of maybe becoming something nice, and we've already talked about what kind of first date I want to take her on when she gets back, but also, I'm not going to hold my breath for her, especially because we've both got our own emotional complications that could easily get in the way.  Y'all also know a little about my ex, or at least how I'm working on getting over her, and sometimes it's working great, but sometimes it's a deep empty pit of missing. I was such a fucking idiot to break up with her. It was easily the biggest mistake of my life thus far. She was never anything but perfect to me, and I guess I took that for granted, and I didn't realize how special of a thing we had. I try not to look back on it and think about how badly I fucked up because I've changed a lot since then, and I recognize that as the biggest reason for these changes, and I feel like the changes are generally for the better, so maybe it's a good thing it happened, but still, I wish it didn't happen like that...  My most recent thing is real interesting, too. We were never an official, monogamous, relationship, but, for all intents and purposes, we were essentially boyfriend and girlfriend. When things are good with her, they're amazing, but when they're bad, they're hell. It's weird because it's not really either of our faults, I think we're just a bit toxic for each other, and that makes it real tough. She's a super sweet gal, one of my closer friends, but I think after a while, we were both pretty addicted to our relationship, and we both hurt each other a lot unintentionally. It's kind of been a weird relationship because it's not really ended. It's always been a pretty open ended thing, and now that we've not seen each other for a couple of months (she's on the other side of the country for the summer), I've kind of had the space to ween off the addiction to us, but I'm going to Eaux Claires with her this weekend, and I'm living in the same house as her next year, and a big part of me says I should just take the easy road of going back to her and what we had when school starts again because, despite the bad times, the good times were pretty effortless.  I know that is a terrible idea, though. I'll just fall back into the toxic mutual addiction, it's just how are relationship is and will always be, which is a shame because in a different life, I bet we'd end up together in the end, but it's not how I want to end up in this life. I know I should get over my ex, too, but it's so easy to fall into that trap of self loathing and ""what-ifs."" I suppose the whole problem stems from the fact that it is a lot easier to look back and yearn for the good times than it is to look forward, make new good times, and face the new obstacles that'll get in the way... I don't know, it helps typing this stuff out here. It's a good place to sort my thoughts."

indieheads,3d4gvj,alexvonrass,10,Mon Jul 13 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"This is certainly a change of pace. Definitely need a couple listens to get a full grasp of what's going on. It is definitely more up-beat and up-front than past works. \  In addition to his appearance mirroring her as /u/usefulchamber points out, I'm getting strong sonic inspirations from older St. Vincent on this.   Overall, I dig the instrumentation, but I really love the hazy, blended, distorted vocals of Powers in past works, so this was a little jarring to have his voice be the clear focal point. Definitely interested to see what the rest of the album will have to offer."
indieheads,3d4gvj,snowybrickman,2,Mon Jul 13 13:57:02 2015 UTC,"at first I didn't want to agree with the st. vincent idea, but the more I think about it, the more I see it. on actor especially, the beat machine diy approach, focus on voice, and natural instrumentation are all quite similar. st vincent feels more lush, focusing on more lines at once than this track, but I could see trevor following this up with something more in that style."

It's not the same here, but it feels like they applied that tendency to a real drum set and there's some weird sample there too."

indieheads,3d4py2,willforthrill,36,Mon Jul 13 15:13:07 2015 UTC,A good review usually has a couple of things. A strong handle on critical thinking is mandatory. Some context for the album is always important. What is interesting about this album (or not interesting). Things that were important or noteworthy. An expansion on influences or similar sounds is always nice.   And the mandatory hot take to get those clicks up.
indieheads,3d4py2,heart_BURN,33,Mon Jul 13 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Clicks Rule Everything Around Me. CREAM, get the traffic."
indieheads,3d4py2,kevfbrown,5,Mon Jul 13 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"This is a good summary. I also think that context is a fine line to walk in reviews. IMO, Pitchfork spends way too much time on context/comparisons, to the point that more than half of their reviews are either discussing the artist's other works, or about other big bands in the current musical landscape (Kanye, Daft Punk) that really have little bearing on the music being reviewed.  And yeah, just read their Tame Impala review, so that's pretty fresh in mind."
indieheads,3d4py2,double_shadow,10,Mon Jul 13 20:22:01 2015 UTC,One that keeps the authors feelings on unrelated subjects to the actual thing they're reviewing to a minimum. An awful lot of Pitchfork's worst offenders talk shit around the album they are reviewing rather than about it.
indieheads,3d4py2,MattN92,3,Mon Jul 13 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly. This has been my biggest pet peeve about them for a long time. Granted, it's hard to actually write about music (dancing about architecture, etc), so it seems like they take the easy way out by just reviewing trends and influences."
indieheads,3d4py2,double_shadow,2,Mon Jul 13 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"The worst review I've ever read from Pitchfork was terrible for the same reasons you're talking about, but it was a positive review instead of negative. Tune-Yards: Nikki Nack   The reviewer barely talks about the album, which while being far from a masterpiece is still insanely detailed and well produced."
indieheads,3d4py2,ceemarshallgaming,9,Mon Jul 13 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"Using the term ""jiggery pokery""."
indieheads,3d4py2,melotraumatic,13,Mon Jul 13 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't think there's one overarching definition of a good review, but the review's I enjoy reading, whether I agree with them or not, have a couple of elements in common.    Context of the album's place in recent music history (relationship with genre, movement, etc.)  Context of the album's relationship with relevant current events (for example, TPAB and Black Messiah's relationships with the Black Lives Matter movement) Context of an album's place in an artist's discography, especially relating to how the sound has developed and how the ambition of the artist has developed  General tone or mood of the album, and how the instrumentation, vocals, and other musical aspects capture those  How well an album achieves it's apparent goals (this one can be trickier to judge, because these goals are often projected by the reviewer)   I also like reviews that reserve judgement of an album's impact until after it's had some time to live in the world. Reviews trumpeting an album as a monumental change in music usually look pretty silly in a couple of months."
indieheads,3d4py2,gugs,6,Mon Jul 13 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"I hate reading reviews about the context of an album when what I need is a review about an album. A little background is nice, but so many writers have no sense of restraint when fleshing out the background. What surrounds an album, socially and historically speaking, is usually well-known. Review the actual music.  Also: 9 times out of 10, personal anecdotes about the reviewer are stupid and useless. Same goes for creative, little narratives that tenuously relate to what is being reviewed.  Review the fucking music."
indieheads,3d4py2,nietzscheispeachy,5,Mon Jul 13 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"It seems simple: a good review should provide necessary context for the album and provide the reviewer's informed, individual response.  A good reviewer knows that she isn't objective and that her response to the album is singular. But a responsible reviewer also communicates that singular response in a meaningful way and communicates a larger set of cultural/historical/political contexts that contributed to that singular response.  That's why the scores are so meaningless--particularly when they go down to the decimal point...looking at you, p4k. I don't care about the nuanced differences between a 7.8 and an 8.3. I care about how the reviewer responded to the album and why they responded that way."
indieheads,3d4py2,sedgwickian,10,Mon Jul 13 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"I don't read reviews to get my exact opinion of an album regurgitated to me, or to get my opinions validated.   I think the best reviews are ones that get you to really sit and think about the album and how you feel about it. My favorite reviews are ones I disagree with, because when I'm able to list out all the reasons I disagree with it, it gets me thinking in a bigger context about what I like in music and why I like it. That doesn't mean that a good review is just one that goes against the grain, but I think a reviewer should strive to challenge us, and get us thinking about the record in a new and unique way. I find if I just agree with every point the reviewer says, I come out of the review without having improved in any way."
indieheads,3d4py2,lushacrous,7,Mon Jul 13 14:53:40 2015 UTC,"I think that reviews you agree with can help you solidify what it is you like/dislike about the album too, though. I've read and seen reviews that helped me put into words what I couldn't otherwise lock down. The only reviews I'd say aren't that helpful are the ones where you go in saying ""this is the greatest piece of music ever"" and the review says ""this is the greatest piece of music ever"""
indieheads,3d4py2,gugs,3,Mon Jul 13 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"A good review should offer something I couldn't get elsewhere. Don't just describe the instrumentation and sound of each song. I can just listen to it myself. And for gods sake don't just talk about the history of the band for the first half of the review, I can just go to wiki for that.   Provide something new and interesting to think about."
indieheads,3d4py2,captainnignog,3,Mon Jul 13 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"It depends; do you want to read about the music or about the context surrounding the music? Every person's opinion/view of the album and artist making the album is different.   Easy Example: MBDTF and the context surrounding it- Kanye's past mistakes, ego etc. bleeding into the album and (imo) contributing to how I listen to it. A review for that album should have proper context laced into specific musical talking points, but that's just my opinion.   The whole ""Fantano vs Pitchfork"" dilemma is that Fantano is all about the music, (although he did make a video saying context impacts everything) while Pitchfork loves to rate something highly based off of context surrounding the music and not exactly describing how the music sounds to the reviewer personally. I fell as if Pitchfork were as bluntly honest as Fantano is sometimes, they would be a little better. Of course I still read their reviews on a weekly basis and enjoy the snarky ones (see their glorious pan of the latest Tyga album).      Tl;Dr: What makes a good review is entirely up to the beholder."
indieheads,3d4py2,OptimalAudio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"A good review has to untangle some knot in my head and help me better understand the music.  It has to touch on both the music's context (sub-genre, movement, artist's evolution) and the technical aspect (instrumentation, filters, time signatures, samples, whatever)  If at the end of the review if I feel like it put into words some feeling I couldn't put my finger on about the album it is good."
indieheads,3d4py2,Jreynold,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"This actually a great thread for me since I've started writing some recently.   I like reading reviews where the reviewer expresses what he/she feels when listening to the album in an unique, clear way. I just like reading something and nodding or going ""huh... didn't think of that"". Something that makes me listen to the album with another perspective. I don't really care about context within the artist's discography or the genre or the use of cliches and abstract phrases. I want the review to be clear and not pretentious or too complicated.  My own reviews usually start with an idea or a feeling that has stuck with me because of the album in question. Then I try to be funny whilst explaining how I feel throughout the album. I feel that humor might help get the message across, entertain the reader and most of all make him interested in the album. Swear words and tangents are not uncommon either... I also don't hide the fact that I'm a fan of the band in question, but try and reveal and explain why they have such an influence in me. Music is personal, so why not make the reader envy what you feel when it's good and understand why it doesn't appeal to you when you don't think it is? It's a review, not a description or a case study.  Do you guys not like humor in them? I feel like there's a lot of people mentioning context and technical stuff which I do not care about, it's always the same. I need something different and not just technical words, music is passion to me, not science."
indieheads,3d4py2,timetostayuseless,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:30:28 2015 UTC,"A meaningful eye for detail and being able to understand why those details are important to the album/subject as a whole. Context (on the other hand) is a double-edged sword, as an actually good album, and review, should, to a large extant do fine on its own merits as is, and is really only useful when you have the aforementioned ""eye"" anyway.  Obvious things one ought to be eye-ing for would be the technical aspects (the composition, production, songwriting, y'know), but also what the album's meant to do, to be, and how well that's met (that's more of a general art thing, but you see my point).  It's kind of vague, general in concept, but, hey, there are lots of ways to go about doing a good review (even if few, myself not included, can actually manage to do so)."
indieheads,3d4py2,IvanRambles,-9,Tue Jul 14 14:45:35 2015 UTC,Music reviews are always terrible. Why would anyone need someone else to tell the how to feel about an album?  Take 5 minutes and listen to it.
indieheads,3d4py2,lushacrous,8,Mon Jul 13 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Same with movies, video games, and every other form of art!   Nah just kidding, art and criticism have always gone hand in hand. People shouldn't go to reviews to be told how to feel about them, which is the only issue here, but reviews can be used to figure out if you want to listen to it, offer new and unique talking points on the album, and gain awareness for it in general."
indieheads,3d4py2,jake_dpp,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Nah if it's a review for a cell phone or something I can understand that.  If it's a review for a form of art, you should probably just experience it and have your own feelings about it rather than being told by someone beforehand and ruining the experience. More people need to think for themselves instead of asking google what they should do.  If you want to talk about it after? I get that. But that's not a review, that's just discussing something you like.   I think if you watch a review for every album or movie you're about to see, you'd be limiting yourself by the opinions of someone else and might be missing out on something you really enjoy."
indieheads,3d4py2,dinosaurjrjr,11,Mon Jul 13 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but then how do you prioritize what to listen to when there's so much out there?"
indieheads,3d4py2,happyparallel,3,Mon Jul 13 16:05:20 2015 UTC,What about book review? It takes anywhere from a couple days to a couple weeks to read a book. That's a huge time investment. Why would you not want a review to read before you decide if a book is worth reading?
indieheads,3d4py2,lifeinaglasshouse,2,Mon Jul 13 22:55:24 2015 UTC,That's another good exception.
indieheads,3d4py2,arcainzor,3,Mon Jul 13 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I think it's possible to enjoy criticism without it impeding on your own opinions.  An album review is a little more than just ""this is good"" or ""this is bad.""  It's fun to see how your experience with an album can differ from others.  It's fun to understand the place that the music you enjoy fills."
indieheads,3d4py2,JohnHenryAaron,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:45 2015 UTC,What's the point of art if you're not allowed to analyze it? That's all a review is. It's not the reviewers fault that some people are too dumb to make up their own mind independent of the review.

indieheads,3d4py2,sertman,3,Mon Jul 13 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Because albums are not five minutes long. You can't literally listen to everything, so you need some sort of way of filtering out the noise.

indieheads,3d4py2,happyparallel,0,Mon Jul 13 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"K and again, the 5 minutes is to determine whether or not the album is worth it.  So again, you can either spend 5 minutes listening to someone on the internet tell you what to listen to, or you can listen for yourself."

But if they were just a little edgier, they would have given this album its rightful score of a 7-8/10 and disregarded all the BNTs.

indieheads,3d3dlm,uncrew,21,Mon Jul 13 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"Out of the thousand or so albums they review ever year, only around 10 get a 9.0 or above. I'd say that's rather stingy."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Catholic_Spray,10,Mon Jul 13 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"Ten is not really stingy; it's also not true. Last year saw three. The year prior, maybe four. I think what we're seeing is Pitchfork conflating for influence; 9.0-9.3s are more in line with what used to be an 8.6-8.9."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Moon-Safari,2,Mon Jul 13 11:52:00 2015 UTC,In that regard you are probably right. My initial point was that I think the rating is really kind to a lot of albums with a higher rating than 9.
indieheads,3d3dlm,heart_BURN,19,Mon Jul 13 12:39:58 2015 UTC,Jamie XX got 9.3 because he plays on p4k fest
indieheads,3d3dlm,Vladith,24,Mon Jul 13 13:38:40 2015 UTC,Or maybe it got a 9.3 because it is a good album?
indieheads,3d3dlm,peppersmith67,2,Mon Jul 13 12:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's a good album, IMO, but I think it's patently absurd to say that it's as good as Carrie and Lowell or TPAB."
indieheads,3d3dlm,indievidual,57,Mon Jul 13 10:20:05 2015 UTC,I knew Pitchfork was gonna love this album but I'm really surprised with a 9.3 considering they gave Lonerism a 9.0 when it came out.
indieheads,3d3dlm,Akaforty,23,Mon Jul 13 13:35:49 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Beach House is getting a 9.4+ I swear if DC gets a 9.3
indieheads,3d3dlm,RhyssyhR,11,Thu Jul 16 19:59:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to be a very very sad cherry if it doesn't get higher than a 9.3

indieheads,3d3dlm,ryno21,5,Mon Jul 13 05:39:54 2015 UTC,Want cherry to bad... Where is it?
indieheads,3d3dlm,csklr,11,Mon Jul 13 08:54:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, don't murder me, but what am I missing with Depression Cherry? I've listened to it 5 or 6 times now and, well, it sounds like Beach House. There's almost no evolution there, and while there are some great songs on the album, several, I feel, are pretty weak. No way is it better than Teen Dream or Bloom. Can someone legitimately try to explain to me what they're seeing in this album that I'm not?"
indieheads,3d3dlm,aleatoric,9,Mon Jul 13 13:00:11 2015 UTC,"i've always kinda felt like beach house was very overrated.  not that i don't like their sound, but it's sort of a monotonous sound that just isn't all that interesting to me unless i'm in the exact right mood.  but for some reason they constantly get grouped in with a bunch of much better and more talented artists and I'll never quite understand it.  without having heard DC yet, I can pretty much guess in my head exactly what it will sound like."
indieheads,3d3dlm,cobbutkssotraoobat,4,Mon Jul 13 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"See, that's not me, though. I actually love Beach House. And I'm not saying I don't enjoy this album--I do--but people are calling for AOTY already, and there's no way this beats a) BH's previous stuff or b) C+L, TPAB, and Currents."
indieheads,3d3dlm,aleatoric,6,Mon Jul 13 14:50:28 2015 UTC,monotonous sound that just isn't all that interesting to me   Exactly how I feel about Tame Impala. The only difference is that Beach House's monotonous sound is interesting to me. I agree BH are overrated though. Their songwriting leaves a bit to be desired but I adore their textures and Victoria Legrand's voice.
indieheads,3d3dlm,snidelaughter,2,Mon Jul 13 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"I find Teen Dream to be far and away their best album because it has so many strong melodies. Not everyone likes Beach House, but I'm hard pressed to find something about songs like ""Zebra"" or ""10 Mile Stereo"" that I don't like.  I think Bloom and Depression Cherry are also really good, but they're not quite so strong in terms of melody. The textures are still spot-on."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Happyginger,2,Mon Jul 13 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, Teen Dream is my favorite of theirs by far. They nailed the songwriting and the textures on that one and it was in my top 5 of that year."

indieheads,3d3dlm,Akaforty,2,Mon Jul 13 12:53:06 2015 UTC,If Depression Cherry beats out TPAB for AOTY I'll be surprised. It was a great release but their single led me to believe they'd evolve their sound more.
indieheads,3d3dlm,McSwaggotron,34,Mon Jul 13 11:42:53 2015 UTC,Holy shit. I honestly thought it wasn't gonna be that high.  I give it a 7.5/10
indieheads,3d3dlm,easytoanother,16,Mon Jul 13 16:07:40 2015 UTC,I'd go lower.   Some of the tracks are just literally useless leftover filler serving no actual purpose. It's more like a mixtape of A and B-sides.
indieheads,3d3dlm,TheWarOnImpalas,3,Tue Jul 14 11:48:54 2015 UTC,probs best rating for it tbh. its not great and its not shit. if depression cherry doesn't get a better review than it tho i will be far from happy.
indieheads,3d3dlm,TRILLWAVVVE,31,Mon Jul 13 05:20:53 2015 UTC,It's definitely my favourite Tame Impala album. Always good to see an album you've been enjoying get a great review
indieheads,3d3dlm,t_penn,34,Mon Jul 13 08:50:58 2015 UTC,"People on this thread don't want you to feel good about it, sadly."
indieheads,3d3dlm,candepoccus,10,Mon Jul 13 13:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's the whole   2007-10 - Pitchfork Loves it = I love it  Pitchfork Didn't review it = Forgeable   2012-15 - Pitchfork Loves It - I hate it Pitchfork Didn't review it = True Art  Of course that's just what I've noticed and isn't true for every one. Opinions are opinions, from fans to critics.   And in all honesty I absolutely love this record but it was bittersweet when P4K loved it. I was happy to see something I enjoy being honored by others, but I knew all the shit storms of how people hate it would start /: eh can't please everyone."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Happyginger,25,Mon Jul 13 06:29:23 2015 UTC,This really just devalues the rating as a whole. Why choose the same score for four albums?
indieheads,3d3dlm,Happyginger,9,Mon Jul 13 07:50:21 2015 UTC,No idea.  Isn't it a voting system?
indieheads,3d3dlm,candepoccus,34,Mon Jul 13 11:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think that idea has been said so many times that people just assume it's true, but with these major releases the scores seem so perfectly manufactured to not give favouritism that there's no way it could simply be an average. I'm pretty sure that is what's done for the AOTY list though, so I think the idea has transferred from there"
indieheads,3d3dlm,PRYHMZ,23,Mon Jul 13 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I think Kendrick Lamar deserves AOTY, don't fuck it up P4K  DC is probably going to end up with a 9.3 as well"
indieheads,3d3dlm,Listeningtosufjan,5,Mon Jul 13 05:17:01 2015 UTC,I got super burnt out on TPAB so I'm sorta going with C&L. Don't know what it was I just wasn't digging it as much after listening to the final product.
indieheads,3d3dlm,Listeningtosufjan,27,Mon Jul 13 05:19:59 2015 UTC,"I just think TPAB is such an important record for this decade that if it goes to C&L, a fantastic record in its own right, Pitchfork would miss the mark."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Polyfauna,8,Mon Jul 13 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"you are very right about that. although they have been going year on year off on giving hip hop records AOTY since MBDTF came out, and since RTJ2 won last year it sorta makes me think that it'll go to Suf. who knows though. pitchfork is really dictated by its reader audience in a way, sorta pandering occasionally to whatever the readers expect in a way."
indieheads,3d3dlm,t_penn,17,Mon Jul 13 05:27:34 2015 UTC,"that hip-hop/non hip-hop alternating was also part of the theory of the guy who predicted MVOTC over Yeezus for AOTY, so maybe we'll se him vindicated again"
indieheads,3d3dlm,t_penn,9,Mon Jul 13 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"honestly, we all realize that pitchfork contributors are probably reading this sub reddit. Indieheads be tight."
indieheads,3d3dlm,candepoccus,10,Mon Jul 13 05:34:02 2015 UTC,This is similar to the showdown between Late Registration and Illinois 10 years ago for the best of 2004 (I think).
indieheads,3d3dlm,TheSimonToUrGarfunkl,9,Mon Jul 13 05:38:49 2015 UTC,2005  Except the stakes are higher.  We have 2 other albums to consider plus whatever Beach House gets.
indieheads,3d3dlm,studiousmaximus,10,Mon Jul 13 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that the themes behind TPAB will net it AOTY ahead of Sufjan (which is my AOTY), then comes Jamie xx, and then Tame Impala/beach house (haven't listened to either yet). But yeah, this AOTY is the first one I've been excited about in a long time."
indieheads,3d3dlm,StealthCode17,4,Mon Jul 13 05:35:47 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I see it as it stands now. Who knows though? If Franky O and Ye release albums they'll surely get great scores. Deerhunter has scored very well in the past, Grizzly Bear i believe is working on new stuff (could be this year). All of these could at least be top 10.  That's not even including Radiohead and Animal Collective if they somehow release this year. I'm 99% sure they'll both be 2016 though."
indieheads,3d3dlm,studiousmaximus,5,Mon Jul 13 05:36:12 2015 UTC,As it should imo in regards to TPAB

indieheads,3d3dlm,SPUNK_ON_THE_MONK,18,Mon Jul 13 05:31:06 2015 UTC,"Relevant section:   The approach varies a little bit from album to album. For the majority of the reviews, the rating is decided entirely by the critic, or largely by the critic. There is some editorial input, and if something seems a little bit high or the rating doesn't quite match the text, we may consult with the writer and then adjust the score one way or another.  But generally we look at the ratings as a form of consensus for what the staff feels as a whole. The Pitchfork staff and contributors are always talking about music and discussing music in secret areas of our website, so we're in constant dialogue about it. And when we're editorially assigning records, we'll try to assign the record to a critic who is largely in the consensus.  It's a little bit of editorial and a little bit from the writer, but it's a happy medium that's generally reflective of what we all feel.   So basically for your minor album reviews, the critic has the most say, but for these major releases, it's editorial consensus. They discuss these things and come up with an appropriate score, they don't just average their individual scores"
indieheads,3d3dlm,studiousmaximus,2,Mon Jul 13 05:32:30 2015 UTC,"We if they got to that rating naturally it's fine. I don't want them going ""well we already gave too many 9.3's this year, make it a 9.4 so people don't get suspicious."""
indieheads,3d3dlm,closetnerdjoe,65,Mon Jul 13 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"there's no way in hell this album is better than lonerism. p4k fucked up this time, imo  not to say it's not a good record, but it's not 9.3 good. that's higher than illinois, most animal collective records, teen dream, the idler wheel, etc. this is a solid record but not among the very best of the year (let alone decade)."
indieheads,3d3dlm,saddamhusseinguns,19,Mon Jul 13 06:46:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think the scale is absolute across all music ever, it depends on the current context, what the artist was trying to accomplish with this album, the expectations of for their genre of music, etc. Just because Currents got a 9.3 and Lonerism got a 9.0 doesn't mean pitchfork thinks Currents is objectively better if you get what I mean"
indieheads,3d3dlm,DannyButler,18,Mon Jul 13 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"i understand what you're saying, but even if you consider it in the present context, TPAB and Carrie & Lowell are leagues ahead of Currents. p4k is implying that they're all on the same level, which i think they're clearly not. perhaps they retroactively think lonerism is a 9.5 or something--fine, but the score is still far too high.   notice that ian cohen specifically tries to get out of a comparison early in the review--he can't have his cake (give currents a sky-high score) and eat it, too (separate lonerism from a conversation it 100% deserves to be in). p4k sucks at consistency, and this is yet another example. but in this case, they're sacrificing internal consistency for no real good reason--the record just isn't that great."
indieheads,3d3dlm,SPUNK_ON_THE_MONK,9,Mon Jul 13 05:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's my opinion that, in any context, Lonerism's got Currents straight beat."

indieheads,3d3dlm,PsychoSeven,16,Mon Jul 13 08:49:28 2015 UTC,"oops, confused that one. point still stands, though. it sort of devalues kendrick's and sufjan's achievements, too. (jamie xx was a bit overrated, but this one is more significantly overrated, i think)"
indieheads,3d3dlm,wilandhugs,22,Mon Jul 13 08:32:50 2015 UTC,"As a fan of undergroud dance music, I'd say Jamie xx was horrendously overrated and this was a bit overrated."
indieheads,3d3dlm,GloriousKind,14,Mon Jul 13 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"eh, i think jamie xx was quite good. he synthesized pop and electronic music better than most have (i preferred his take on the genre meld more than disclosure's, for example). different strokes"
indieheads,3d3dlm,heart_BURN,16,Mon Jul 13 05:52:08 2015 UTC,I feel like i'm one of very few that are in to underground dance music and also really liked jamie xx's record
indieheads,3d3dlm,GloriousKind,6,Mon Jul 13 09:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think most people recognize it as a good album, something that's not bad to listen to, but that it's not the revelation that the rest of the indie world seems to think it is."
indieheads,3d3dlm,itssowingseason,7,Mon Jul 13 09:37:46 2015 UTC,I keep hearing this from dance fans and as an outsider I'm just wondering what are considered to be the modern classics so I can understand why Jamie isn't as good as he's made out to be?
indieheads,3d3dlm,jamzedodger,10,Mon Jul 13 09:23:03 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that Jamie xx is a bad electronic artist but more of what the sound represents.  In Colour takes influences from many UK Bass genres such as Garage, Future Garage and different house genres. But it feels much more like an indie album appropriating UK Bass.  This may turn some heads but I see In Colour as an indie album before anything else. Indietronica at most generous.  But the music itself does not stand up. The muddy production can be interpreted both good or bad but it doesn't resonate with other electronic music. Aside from the singles there isn't much substance or anything of interest. Just watered down electronic music.  Since someone mentioned Disclosure, I'd like to compare. Disclosure's Settle fused the likeable aspects of pop with the excitement and energy of electronic music. Not to mention the (surprisingly) fantastic vocal performances. The production was clean and polished, easy to listen to and fun above all. Judging by their new singles, it seems Disclosure are falling off but they did a hell of a good job already.  Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed his 2011 remix album We're New Here, it felt low key and didn't feel much like dance music, because it wasn't. My problem with the new one in comparison is that it's dance music not worth dancing to.  Not to mention that god awful formulaic XX song.   As for modern electronic classics, the beauty of it is that there aren't any. Accessibility of electronic music has made it so that ""classics"" aren't as common.  I don't want to use ""real dance music"" as a phrase but when it comes to artists like Aphex Twin, Jamie XX, Daft Punk, Justice etc. they are album driven, which is very different from the structure of dance music releases. They cater to a slightly different group of people  Tl;Dr: If I wanted to listen to Four Tet, I would."
indieheads,3d3dlm,dullerkidb,2,Mon Jul 13 15:09:22 2015 UTC,To put both albums at the same level or near the same level as TPAB is baffling. I think both were overrated - less so Jamie XX in my opinion.
indieheads,3d3dlm,CharminglyIrreverent,12,Mon Jul 13 11:08:52 2015 UTC,I think Pitchfork forgot how to count past 9.3 this year
indieheads,3d3dlm,OptimalAudio,14,Mon Jul 13 11:54:11 2015 UTC,"Wow...honestly I thought it was a pretty solid 6, and I thought that their first two albums were 8's...I can't believe this was higher than Lonerism though, that just doesn't add up."
indieheads,3d3dlm,indievidual,14,Tue Jul 14 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"This review is fucking ridiculous. He manages to compare this album/Kevin Parker to:   Daft Punk Wilco Radiohead My Bloody Valentine Gwen Stefani and Akon (?!) Kanye West Michael Jackson John Lennon (obviously) ... and a handful of others   If I was Kevin Parker, I would be less psyched about this 9.3 and more offended that the reviewer apparently thinks he's only capable of derivative material."
indieheads,3d3dlm,OptimalAudio,3,Mon Jul 13 05:25:07 2015 UTC,Isn't Kevin's whole shtick that his music is incredibly derivative though? His first two albums were definitely derivative of the psych-rock movement and (obviously) John Lennon.
indieheads,3d3dlm,Suck_My_Zarflog,2,Mon Jul 13 06:17:27 2015 UTC,"For sure -- it's the first thing you notice about the albums. That being said, comparing it (and ranking it so high) to three VERY unique albums that received 10s seems a bit goofy. Don't get me wrong, I think Tame Impala is great... This review is just mailed in.   edit: I also think this is his most adventurous and creative album to date, which is why I don't think the review matches up."

This album would leave a much lesser impression if this fucking narrative wasn't beaten to dust all over the web lately. I love Tame Impala and probably will listen to this new album a lot, but this review seems to be premeditated. It's like they knew how they wanted to hear it before they heard it.  Edit: also, that whole line about ""emotions that can actually kill you if left unattended to""... Wow. This is why I hate Ian Cohen."

indieheads,3d3dlm,mattmanflash,26,Mon Jul 13 06:30:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously like all four singles were BNM it was definitely going to score highly, plus Pitchfork always had a hard on for Tame Impala."

indieheads,3d3dlm,PepeAndMrDuck,8,Mon Jul 13 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly ""Let It Happen"" could carry the album to a 10.0 on its own. It seems like Pitchfork agrees with me."

To quote you from a previous podcast episode, this album was incredibly lame. ""Lame Impala"" anyone?     Edit: And yes, I loved Lonerism and really enjoyed most of the band's music to this point. So I'm not just saying this as a ""hater"", I'm saying it as a actual fan who supported this project."
indieheads,3d3dlm,CharminglyIrreverent,13,Mon Jul 13 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this and in colour both got 9.3 bc p4k hyped them so hard. Also thought Kendrick and Sufjan deserved a couple points higher, but whatever"
indieheads,3d3dlm,james_is_lames,8,Mon Jul 13 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"i think it deserves it. maybe its just me, i think it's a really enjoyable and dancy record. there's honestly no bad songs on it imo."
indieheads,3d3dlm,CharminglyIrreverent,3,Mon Jul 13 14:27:53 2015 UTC,A lot of people I've talked to hate that pitched down voice [edit: on Past Life] and I can't believe they praised that so highly. That's the only song I pretty much hate. So I wouldn't say perfect. Everything else was great though. I'm surprised they didn't mention disciples that's my favorite one.
indieheads,3d3dlm,TheSentientIguana,2,Mon Jul 13 06:22:31 2015 UTC,The pitched down voice on Past Life? Thats my shit! Lol
indieheads,3d3dlm,nietzscheispeachy,9,Mon Jul 13 07:30:14 2015 UTC,"I thought Kendrick's album was the only that deserved above a 9. Sufjan's was stellar (as always) but in the context of his greater discography i considered a bit middling. Jamie XX's album bored me to tears, and this 9.3 is slapping me sideways at the moment.   Currents is weak, lackluster, shoddy stuff. I love Kevin and i'll give anything he does its fair shot. But 9.3? 9.3? I know, i know; getting worked up over a Pitchfork score has led to the premature death of many a blossoming young hip kid. I expected a mid-8 BNM (even though i personally think it should be a lot lower) but not this.  not this."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Rushdownsouth,6,Mon Jul 13 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"|weak, lackluster, shoddy  I can understand not enjoying the style of Currents, but shoddy?  Respect the work, not necessarily the results."

indieheads,3d3dlm,swagtastic_anarchist,15,Mon Jul 13 08:40:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like most people in this sub were expecting some kind of extension of Lonerism, some huge psych-rock opus, and the package that he delivered this time around just doesn't line up with that at all.  Personally, I was expecting the same, but the singles were all indicative of a huge shift, so I gave it a chance and honestly I can see myself growing to love this album over time much more than his past two records.   And if you thought this was getting anything under a 9, after the singles were BNM and Cohen literally tweeted about how Parker was the best rock bassist of this century... I dunno, you must just be looking for confirmation.   Congrats to K-park on another great record."
indieheads,3d3dlm,JohnHenryAaron,7,Mon Jul 13 14:32:37 2015 UTC,"I was expecting something like Lonerism only to the extent that I hoped Currents, like Lonerism would be good. And it just wasn't*.   I don't mind any shift in style; in fact, while i don't demand fidelity to a certain sound, I love when a band experiments. But i just thought the end results here were...limp. I listened to 'Let It Happen' when it first got released as a single, and i thought it was a stellar song. Then i listened to the other 300 hundred singles and watched my cautious optimism slide into disappointment. I love Tame Impala, and i'm gonna listen to anything they do from now until the sun dries out. But, i dunno. Currents was a bummer.   *in my opinion, it goes without sayin'"
indieheads,3d3dlm,cobbutkssotraoobat,5,Mon Jul 13 12:41:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you on the obvious problem of putting out all of those singles - seemed like such an obvious attempt by Interscope to try and cash in on what could be a 300k-400k indie rock record. I mean you have to wonder if 4 singles was a good idea, especially given the change of direction this album was taking. It's one thing to buy on speculation because you're willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt even if you're not a fan of a couple of tracks they've put out to promote the record. But it's another to show your entire hand two months out. That + the leak are most likely really going to hurt Currents sales."
indieheads,3d3dlm,oberholzer,3,Mon Jul 13 07:12:59 2015 UTC,"I think Currents'll do pretty well. I've seen a lot of people say much to the effect of 'well, i didn't dig their other stuff but i dig this' and i think those conversions are real, and they're gonna help Currents sales a bunch.   Yah, i'm confident Currents'll do alright in the end-with or without the neigh sayers."
indieheads,3d3dlm,ReconEG,6,Mon Jul 13 08:58:17 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I really enjoyed this album, and while I think this shouldn't have got 9.3, it should've got BNM.  But that's just my opinion"
indieheads,3d3dlm,mickyfitz,21,Mon Jul 13 09:26:00 2015 UTC,"The way Pitchfork has been treating Tame Impala is pretty dubious. That's just a stupidly high score. I mean, it has its merits, and I can see why people would enjoy it, but most of it feels like genre exercise. I just don't think it's very interesting art. I think it would be more at home in the late 7.0s, early 8.0s."
indieheads,3d3dlm,McSwaggotron,4,Mon Jul 13 09:39:31 2015 UTC,"You are saying that is seems excessive for give an album two previous write ups, 4 BNM for the singles, and then give BNA and a 9.3?"
indieheads,3d3dlm,HenryFuckinger,16,Mon Jul 13 13:35:22 2015 UTC,Tiny Mix Tapes Review  I think this is going to be a really polarizing album.
indieheads,3d3dlm,mickyfitz,26,Mon Jul 13 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"If you ever want to know whether a review is relevant to you as a listener, just simplify all the fancy language.  This one turns into   I don't like the way the drums sound, they're too compressed  His lyricism is sometimes okay  idk it just sounds like old stuff and I like the old stuff it's imitating better"
indieheads,3d3dlm,HenryFuckinger,11,Mon Jul 13 19:44:10 2015 UTC,It would be gratifying if someone actually wrote like that.  It would've saved me a few minutes of time reading him ramble about capitalism and social media to get to the actual criticisms.
indieheads,3d3dlm,mickyfitz,13,Mon Jul 13 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try that out on the Pitchfork review.   kevin parker sounds lonely and melancholy  let it happen is a masterpiece guys  look ma no guitar  i like how he's experimenting with soul, pop and r&b  have you heard this super awesome album called yeezus?  there's lots of self-aware lyrics that i like   Holy shit, that review is full of flowery language. I could barely see what point he was trying to make."
indieheads,3d3dlm,peppersmith67,2,Mon Jul 13 06:10:50 2015 UTC,We need a sub of shit like this for p4k...Almost like ELI5 or something haha
indieheads,3d3dlm,CharminglyIrreverent,7,Mon Jul 13 15:08:02 2015 UTC,Yeah man I read that one first and posted it in the sub thinking Pitchfork's review would come later haha.  But look at what is getting the most upvotes right now.
indieheads,3d3dlm,skymind,20,Mon Jul 13 17:43:39 2015 UTC,Tame Impala is the Instagram of rock bands.   B T F O  T  F  O
indieheads,3d3dlm,Polyfauna,10,Tue Jul 14 00:52:28 2015 UTC,Aren't these the people who said Run the Jewels 2 was about misogyny?
indieheads,3d3dlm,CharminglyIrreverent,7,Mon Jul 13 05:13:16 2015 UTC,"They didn't say it was about misogyny, they thought it was hypocritical to be misogynist in an album where the rest of the lyrical content is super righteous about other areas of civil rights. The reviewer said that he doesn't care about the same sort of lyrics about women in hip hop generally, but he just thought that if you're going to write a righteous album, still writing songs about get ya dick sucked is just weird. tbh i agree, although i still think RTJ has some great hype songs."
indieheads,3d3dlm,televisionceo,11,Mon Jul 13 05:21:07 2015 UTC,Just that reviewer.
indieheads,3d3dlm,ryno21,5,Mon Jul 13 06:01:02 2015 UTC,"Though it was just that one reviewer, I can't believe they'd allow their site as a whole to be represented by something that was so blantantly wrong."
indieheads,3d3dlm,indievidual,4,Mon Jul 13 13:35:36 2015 UTC,It's fine for people to have stupid opinions dude.
indieheads,3d3dlm,RedKamo,5,Mon Jul 13 06:06:59 2015 UTC,Well I suppose that's a pretty good point
indieheads,3d3dlm,heart_BURN,9,Mon Jul 13 06:13:12 2015 UTC,I feel like tiny mixtapes absolutely nail their reviews or miss them off the mark completely (like their review of RTJ2)
indieheads,3d3dlm,bladdy,9,Mon Jul 13 06:16:25 2015 UTC,"I thought that RTJ2 review was useful. It was from a totally different perspective than what i was coming in with, and while i didn't agree with that viewpoint i felt like it was an interesting take on an album that i thought was just alright."
indieheads,3d3dlm,indievidual,11,Mon Jul 13 06:20:49 2015 UTC,Always felt like they are the foil to Pitchfork
indieheads,3d3dlm,toastybeast,8,Mon Jul 13 05:18:55 2015 UTC,"WTF is with the first paragraph. None of that is relatable to people who aren't obsessed with social media. Do people's parents really use instagram nowadays? No one I know uses the filters either, barely anyone I know even uses it. Maybe I'm just out of the loop, but what a weirdly long opening paragraph that completely neglects talking about the album at all. Writing 101 was skipped."
indieheads,3d3dlm,DisgruntledPorcupine,6,Mon Jul 13 08:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hated that too. I'm definitely in the right demo (21M college student) and that was absolutely lost on me. That whole thing was just a preface to call TI the instagram of rock bands. All it did for me was make me want to quit reading. Use the comparison if you want because I can get on board with a good panning, but that was weak"
indieheads,3d3dlm,hiplink,3,Mon Jul 13 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone* i know uses those filters, so i could relate pretty well with what he was saying. That whole paragraph was basically his introductory thesis.   *not literally everyone but, well, you get it."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Infamaniac23,3,Mon Jul 13 05:35:58 2015 UTC,It was pretty obvious from the start
indieheads,3d3dlm,ThatParanoidPenguin,2,Mon Jul 13 11:57:33 2015 UTC,"that's sometimes how you know something is special.  stuff that is universally loved is often times blander and less challenging - that's why I really question how kanye will hold up over the next 20-30 years.    not that this album is definitely going to be a classic, but when i see a film or album getting super high and very low scores simultaneously, that usually indicates something interesting is going on.  often times, something is ahead of many people who are hating on it and it takes them awhile to catch up to it. see david bowie's entire career, where he kept changing his sound every album and people would initially push back and then realize it was another amazing turn he had made.  by the time they caught up, he had a new sound out and they weren't ready for that one yet either.    now again, is Tame the same as Bowie?  probably not.  but the shit that runs both hot and cold in terms of reviews is so much more interesting than the others imo.  Be interested to see how this sits with people 6 months from now, a lot of talk in this thread alone from people who are certain about this album they've had for like a week now.  give it some more time, imo."
indieheads,3d3dlm,udbettarecognize,14,Mon Jul 13 08:47:48 2015 UTC,"I was almost positive this was going to get a 9.5. Regardless, good for KPark!"
indieheads,3d3dlm,Lonerprism,12,Mon Jul 13 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"I think the 9.3 is accurate. Currents is a pretty polarizing album at the moment, but it's a grower. I get the feeling that, in the future, its going to be thought of as a classic as much as Lonerism. I think it is an impressive progression of Parker's aesthetic, its still psychedelic at its core even after he changes so much. And the bass in this record is so good! As long as he keeps making music with bass like this, I'll be a fan."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Futhermucker,8,Mon Jul 13 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"It is really interesting to see how divisive people are about this album. I think people are latching onto the ""Loveless or Kid A or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" than the preceding Random Access Memories comparison which is right on the nose for me.    People seem to get really short sighted right after an album is released. Kevin Parker was too talented a musician not to continuously evolve his sound. While I can understand there being a disconnect from the fans of his psych-rock influenced previous albums, lets not pretend that Lonerism wasn't already a precedent for this turn to pop. Elephant was as poppy, if not more so, than pretty much anything on this album.  This album isn't far removed from his previous work either. Songs like Let it Happen, The Moment and Eventually are some of his best works and are all still very much grounded in the psychedelia influence of the last two albums. It isn't as jarring as some of other polarizing stylistic changes albums like Age of Adz or To Pimp A Butterfly. I hate to keep harping on this comparison but the evolution of Tame Impala from psych-rock to synth-pop is more similar to the evolution of Daft Punk from French House to Disco and probably draws from the same core influences.   Overall, I think this album is great. People get too caught up in expectations to enjoy music properly these days. I think Let It Happen will be looked at one of the best Tame Impala songs by the end of their career. I can't wait to see where Kevin Parker takes us next. He has yet to let me down."
indieheads,3d3dlm,cobbutkssotraoobat,3,Mon Jul 13 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"9.3 is decent score for p4k in my opinion. Id give it a 8.5 personally with lonerism getting a 9.  I honestly think for me, that the release of all the singles impacted the score significantly. I can't help but think that if Tame Impala just released ""The Less I Know the Better"" as a single and kept the other tracks as surprises, my score would be significantly higher."
indieheads,3d3dlm,two_bagels_please,3,Mon Jul 13 12:24:18 2015 UTC,Currents is the Reflektor of 2015.
indieheads,3d3dlm,cobbutkssotraoobat,11,Mon Jul 13 14:03:59 2015 UTC,Not many places could be so negative about a good record.  Y'all need to chill.
indieheads,3d3dlm,Jreynold,9,Mon Jul 13 12:12:36 2015 UTC,After a few listens this is honestly my favourite Tame Impala album. 9.3 is a bit astonishing though.
indieheads,3d3dlm,Pepperkin,6,Mon Jul 13 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"I massively disagree with this. When I first heard the leak last weekend, the album sat quite well with me, but even then, I would only consider it be around an 8 anyway. After listening to it a few more times, I kinda think the record drags on far too much and in my opinion, it lacks soul. Only a few tracks stood out to me and even then, they were just okay pop songs. No amount of effects and synthesizers can hide boring songwriting. A score of 7.0 to 7.5 would have been more apt in my opinion."
indieheads,3d3dlm,LordSifter,9,Mon Jul 13 13:59:54 2015 UTC,I'd give a strong 6/10. Maybe I'm missing something
indieheads,3d3dlm,TRILLWAVVVE,5,Mon Jul 13 07:37:34 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that's a high score. Personally, I loved it, but some people in this sub didn't really like it, so I'm surprised that it got a 9.3. I'm wondering if the album will receive critical acclaim across the board and then get mixed reviews from fans a la Yeezus and Reflektor."
indieheads,3d3dlm,LordSifter,7,Mon Jul 13 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"I don't like Currents.  But, I didn't like Reflektor or Yeezus when they first came out, so, thanks to your deft comparison, I think I'll owe it to Tame Impala to revisit Currents in a couple months..."
indieheads,3d3dlm,Nice_Dude,5,Mon Jul 13 12:10:13 2015 UTC,I think it's more of like a 7.5. :( it's all one ear out the other with this
indieheads,3d3dlm,HenryFuckinger,6,Mon Jul 13 05:08:51 2015 UTC,9.3 is a meme
