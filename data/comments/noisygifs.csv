noisygifs,3dg01h,throwaway049450,18,Thu Jul 16 03:26:54 2015 UTC,There's some name for it. Some sort of Olympic lift. Clean and jerk or some shit. It's safe when it isn't done for reps like the crossfit morons do when they do it 50 times in a row to try and prove who can destroy their joints the fastest.
noisygifs,3dg01h,Okama_G_Sphere,5,Thu Jul 16 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"All jokes aside, I believe that's called a snatch."
noisygifs,3dg01h,GreyNietzsche,6,Thu Jul 16 06:04:44 2015 UTC,Yup it's a snatch. Usually the bar would be on the floor and not on those big blocks. The biggest danger I could spot in this lift is that she was a little late on locking her right elbow. Besides that this was a very good and clean lift.
noisygifs,3dg01h,throwaway049450,2,Thu Jul 16 11:38:29 2015 UTC,Is the difference that her legs stay where they are? Clean and jerk don't you put one leg behind you at a point before lifting overhead or something?
noisygifs,3dg01h,Okama_G_Sphere,2,Thu Jul 16 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"Actually the main difference is in the first motion. With the clean and jerk the bar is lifted to the front of the shoulders first, then overhead. In the snatch the bar is lifted directly overhead."

noisygifs,3cwprl,fuzeebear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about military vehicles or anything like this, but seeing those barrels sway after each round is a bit concerning... I assume they're firing very far, so even a tiny offset will affect accuracy in a huge way."
noisygifs,3cwprl,blaghart,3,Sat Jul 11 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"If you look at the source video for the title gfy, the group is fairly decent.    It's not meant to be a ""sniper"" weapon in any case, when you're laying down automatic fire then what you're shooting at is probably an area target so a bit of spread might actually be beneficial to keeping the enemy' soldier's heads down.  If what you're shooting at cannot be taken down by a single one of such cartridges (capitalist equivalent shown), then pin-point accuracy is probably not one of your major concerns."
noisygifs,3cwprl,freelyread,2,Sat Jul 11 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"That's a scary massive projectile, I wouldn't even want that dropped on my foot.  I just figured that being off by 10 feet can mean the difference between hitting and not hitting something 0.5 miles away. I just looked up the cannon (2A42, right?) and found this, I don't know if it's correct.   This 30 mm automatic 2A42 shipunov cannon was developed in the Soviet Union and is also known as Shipunov 2A42. The effective range when engaging light armoured vehicles is up to 1500 m   Still really interesting, I was just wondering what kind of use these things get."
noisygifs,3cwprl,SaxMaan,3,Sat Jul 11 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"Here's another loud gfy of a 23mm anti-aircraft twin mount being used in the ground role.  As you can see, the target is something the size of a building, getting all your shots in a 30 foot circle on full auto is good enough for most situations.  Especially if you're a rag-tag bunch of Syrian rebels.  Bravo on the cannon identification by the way."
