teenagers,3e3677,TheMonarK,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:01 2015 UTC,I think he means taking summer classes at community college while still in highschool.   I'm doing that right now. Taking ASL and Computer science   It can sometimes be better because 1 summer class at the college is equal to 2 years in high school.

It's better to be alone than to let yourself be abused. Take some (or a lot of) time to figure out what you love to do.  Do those things. Don't get discouraged because it's too hard or because someone's going to judge you. Study. Not just what you're required to learn in school - learning shouldn't end when you leave class. Study what you're interested in, read more, you'll learn to love learning. Work hard.  If something's easy for you, take it up another level. If you let yourself slide by, you get used to sliding by and freak out when suddenly you have to work hard. Be completely yourself. Whoever you are, just own it. It doesn't matter what some classmate thinks about you. Stop trying to be cool, you're doing it wrong anyways. Don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself. In a couple years you're leaving and going to college on the other side of the country, it may seem like it, but this school isn't the whole world."

They're going to mean a hell of a lot to you for a very long time, some more than others, sadly. There will be ups with these people, and there will be downs; there will be great adventures, and there will be some pretty bad fall outs. There's a few friends that are going to be really important kind of later on. Stick with them, till the very end, and hopefully, beyond that. There's going to be some others that will fizzle out in your life, one specifically you're going to spend two and a half years becoming incredibly close with. It's going to hurt, and, to be frank, it still sort of does. But you'll get through it.  Freshman year is going to be a hell of a time for you. It's going to be a fun ride. Enjoy it while you can, because you're going to go through some weird fucking shit your Sophomore year. It's going to get a little dark starting in October, and it'll be really bleak from January through March. You're going to get through it though, and there's a little surprise at the end.

I'm a sucker for Stanley Kubrick, and it seems as though a lot of people our age haven't seen most of his films. My favorite of his, as well as one of my favorite movies of all time, is 2001: A Space Odyssey. I also loved Paths of Glory and Spartacus.   If you've already seen those, my other suggestions for films that most teenagers probably haven't seen are Requiem for a Dream, There Will Be Blood, Apocalypse Now, and City of God.  There are also a lot of films that I love that I am very surprised that others have not seen, but maybe you have! Those movies would be stuff like Back to the Future, The Prestige, A Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, No Country for Old Men, Saw, District 9, and Schindler's List.

teenagers,3e357d,streamlinetacos,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"Here's some things I've been doing recently:  Electronics: I'm working through this book. I think I'm beginning to understand what I'm doing. Very slowly.  Herpetology: I have pet lizards. I work a lot with reptiles, going to events, and just catching toads in my yard. I'm part of my state's Herpetological Society, which I think every state has. It's just fun.  Genealogy: I'm not sure why I find it so interesting. Old pictures are cool, and my ancestors had really weird names.  Reading: I mostly like biographies. I have these colored sticky tabs to mark all the things I find interesting and I have a note book for little details I want to remember.  I was once told that you should read 500 pages a day, which sounds ridiculous, but I'm trying to get to that point. Right now I'm reading about half that much. I used to never like reading, but we don't have television anymore. Sigh.   Investing: I like this because money (though mostly I lose the money). It's even fun to just pretend to invest. I have a spreadsheet of imaginary money I put into imaginary stocks and imaginary money that I traded for imaginary foreign money.   Programming: I'm slowly working through ""Python for Kids"" right now. I'm not good at it, but I'm making progress and that's a good feeling.  Billiards: I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time, but it feels awesome to sink a ball. It's something I'm just learning, and the little progress I'm making feels great.  Some random hobbies I would like to get into some day: Flying airplanes, glass blowing, magic, archery, traveling, astrophotography"
teenagers,3e357d,Snuggle_Moose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"This was so much more then I expected anyone to reply with and I think you for that. I wanted lizards for a while because I'm allergic to everything with fur. However, I think.  I've jumped to wanting fish now. What are some pros and cons of owning lizards? Also genealogy is really interesting. My uncle has my dad's side mapped out pretty far back and its cool to hear about your great great grandfather who was a Russian rebel."
teenagers,3e357d,inheritor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"Ooh I've thought about getting fish. My neighbor is a marine biologist and has a stunning aquarium. Tank pets are just cool in general, because it's like you have a little ecosystem in a glass box. I read up about dart frogs a while ago, and dart frog tanks don't even need ventilation, because you put live plants in the tank with them.  Anyways, it depends a lot on what type of lizard you’re interested in. I have leopard geckos, which are usually seen as ""beginner"" lizards because they're pretty easy to take care of and low maintenance (if you want something bigger, bearded dragons are also a great starter-reptile).  Pros  They're just weird, interesting, fun pets. It's amazing to have a connection with such a small, foreign creature. They also like to climb up your arm and sit on your shoulders, which is adorable. One of mine likes to sit on my head.   They’re rewarding  in their own weird way. For example, Leos are shy are first, but if you put your hand in their tank every day, they'll start to trust you and crawl onto your hand. The bond you form with a lizard is different than the bond you form with another person or a dog. If you pay attention, they’re just fascinating, friendly little guys.  They don't take up much space. I have each of mine in their own 10 gallon tank all lined up on a horizontal book case.  They're a bit of a conversation piece. I love to show people my lizards.  They're low maintenance. Check the temperature & humidity. Clean their tanks. Feed them. Make sure they're looking healthy. There's not much more to it.  Cons  There's a lot of misinformation. I think pet stores make them out to be more low maintenance than they really are. And the average life span listed at my pet store (6-10 years) is way off. It's more like 15-20 years. So it's a commitment.   Another thing about pet stores, they're infamous for selling unhealthy reptiles. It's probably best to buy from a reputable breeder.  They're nocturnal so they don't really do all that much during the day (watch them at night though, they’re very active).  When something's wrong with them, you have to deal with it yourself. Some common problems: shedding issues (usually losing toes), not eating, dropping tail. Luckily there's a lot of websites dedicated to reptiles, and a lot of resources to help you figure out how to deal with whatever's wrong. (and it’s also very rewarding to be able to help them by yourself.)  Their food can be gross. I feed mine wax worms, meal worms and crickets. I keep the crickets in a little plastic cricket terrarium, but a lot of them die and get stuck to the bottom which is nasty to deal with. Wax/mealworms are just gross because you have to touch them. And oh, if the food bowl is too shallow or rough, the worms will crawl out. I’ve had a couple of meal worms hide under the substrate and turn into beetles. I suggest using a hamster bowl."
teenagers,3e357d,xenodude1199,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Recently a couple thing I've been interested in:  Music: there's a lot here, I love listening to bands like twenty one pilots, Vampire Weekend, and Modest Mouse, I collect music records and listen to them on my technics turntable, and over the summer I learned to play ukulele and am trying to learn to play piano and the drums.  Gaming: I've collected every popular Nintendo home console, from the NES to the GameCube, and I've also got a decent computer (but not so decent internet) and play games like TF2 and Terraria with friends I've met online.  Tv/movies: I watch at least 3 movies every other weekend with my dad, normally one new one in theaters, and two older ones that we rented, and I watch a lot of movies back home with the rest of family. I've also been watching cartoons and shows like The Office, Parks and Rec, Steven universe, etc.  Skateboarding: just now I skateboarded to Subway and am sitting here with a stomach ache because I ate too much of a meatball marinara. It's going to be a bitch to ride home. I learned around March or may, and practiced by skateboarding home every day.  A lot of these I just recently got into, I learned ukulele over the summer and got into records around February, skateboarding I got into a couple months ago like I said, but  I've been into music since like 7th grade and have been watching movies with my dad forever. If you asked me what I was into when I was in 8th grade... I couldn't tell you a thing..."

Watching TV/Movies: I watch generally one movie a day, and during the summer I can get through a 10 season show in about 2 weeks.   Gaming: I play stuff of the Xbox 360. I also play Toontown a lot (I hate myself for this but it's so entertaining to me). I'll also go on my old accounts for things like Club Penguin, Webkinz, Maplestory, and others.  Finally, painting: I'm a shitty painter but I do it anyways. My favorite thing I've done is the bold and brash painting for a friend."

Show her that they expired and explain that nothing happened last night, if she asks."

Now, I suggest you talk to your mom first and gauge her reaction. the 'no need to explain' text makes me think that she's not that mad about them..?"

You'll probably feel good and fairly satisfied because you just had a dick in you. It's gonna be super fast and awkward, but hopefully fun and something to laugh at later. Sex will get better the more you two do it, so don't base your opinion on sex on this one encounter.   Mine was silly and fumbly and with my best friend, and she was smiling and giggly afterwards, so it was a fun experience. C:"

teenagers,3e2ta2,Humbungala,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"Haha by the sounds of it you and your friend view that kind of thing differently. I think I share your perspective but I was still losing my shit before I knew I was gonna do it...because nerves. As long as the dude isn't a jerk and is someone you're comfortable with, you'll be fine. The sex itself won't be the greatest shit ever, probably a little uncomfortable -but fun at the same time! Enjoy it and don't forget protection pls"
teenagers,3e2ta2,rola25,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:08 2015 UTC,I felt a little more confident afterwards. I lost mine at 14. But then i realized it's not a big deal. I'm still the same person I was before having sex.
teenagers,3e2ta2,xJusteezy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:03 2015 UTC,theres no wrong way to lose your virginity! honestly its so stupid that virginity is even a thing thats considered like special idk.  for me im in love with the person i lost it to and i didnt feel sad i felt happy afterwards. i feel like if you cry after having sex you werent really ready. you seem like you have a good idea of what you want so i think you'll be fine if you just have sex for fun yk? also dont let guys get away with not giving you orgasms lol
teenagers,3e2ta2,tell_me_a_lie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, first off, I'm a virgin. Only absolutely crazy people would fuck at my age. But I just want to give my opinion on it. Anyways, I honestly doubt anything will change. I understand it might seem life changing, but it's just sex. You stick a penis inside a vagina, big whoop.   Getting your driver's license is more life changing probably."

If they're proud they lost it at such a vulnerable age, then yeah. You can lose interest then. We've all made regretable choices and I think the last thing we want is for someone to judge us for something we most definitely wish we didn't do."

They didn't really do that with my brothers. Nor could they, we were poor when they still lived at home.

teenagers,3dzx0d,Cottonbuff,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:22 2015 UTC,Okay so just because of your suggestion I threw it into redbubble because it's so freaking easy to set up a store front (anyone reading this who would actually want to buy it lmk and I'll post the link). Anyway the phone cases looks FREAKING COOL if I do say so my self in my most humble manner possible.
teenagers,3dzx0d,kevinkat2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:31 2015 UTC,Ah fuck that looks dope and tite. I could totally see this as a supreme drop if it had a box logo somewhere.

teenagers,3e3alo,StyL_stealth,6,Tue Jul 21 17:03:58 2015 UTC,Good job its a picture
teenagers,3e3alo,Landocommando17,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:01 2015 UTC,It's too saturated and the background is completely out of focus.
teenagers,3e3alo,1944911,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree on the heavy saturation, the background doesn't always have to be in focus. The thing you're looking at is the sign. The background doesn't matter. Example: http://imgur.com/nJW3ioi blurry background, but what's important is the foreground. And yes, I took this photo."
teenagers,3e3alo,YouthfulPhotographer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:32 2015 UTC,The foreground is out of focus as well in that photo.

teenagers,3e3alo,EthanWeber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"Well, you recognized an interesting subject which is good! Here's a list of things you could work on next time: - Give the subject more space. You're really close to the subject and part of the sign is even out of the frame. - On a similar note, incorporate the background a bit! Give us context to the sign. - Rule of thirds is pretty important with things like this unless you're going for a particular style. Don't center the subject. - I can't tell if you edited it or if you just have a bad camera, if it's the former, cut it out with all the noise and bad color editing, the colors are all washed out. If you just have a bad camera, then I hope you can upgrade soon!"
teenagers,3e3alo,shit_zac_made,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"The colors are way too saturated and washed out, and the lighting doesn't draw your eye to a specific focus. But the biggest problem with this photo is the fact that there is no interesting subject. Now it potentially could be interesting if you give more context to the photo: back up a bit, don't blur the background, and stick to the rule of thirds (basically back up and partition your lenses' field of view into 3 sections, and decide where you want you subject: middle left or right). Then you can highlight the sign by shading the outer edges of your photo gradually. Like this: http://i.imgur.com/zJF9Gig.jpg"

My friends dislike rock, but I like a fair bit of it, literally nothing wrong with either of these scenarios"

teenagers,3e0kwr,Dyloneus,7,Tue Jul 21 08:10:12 2015 UTC,I like medieval music. I think I deserve to be called weird for that lol

teenagers,3e0kwr,Plsdontreadthis,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:34 2015 UTC,Any recommendations? I like medieval stuff when I hear it but I don't know many good pieces by name.
teenagers,3e0kwr,Dyloneus,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:53 2015 UTC,Have you heard of antti martikainen? Hes a fantastic composer. Check him out on YouTube: https://youtube.com/user/AJMartikainen?
teenagers,3e0kwr,Plsdontreadthis,2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:56 2015 UTC,"Woah! He's got some really neat stuff. I was under the impression you meant music that was from medieval times, I didn't even know there was a market for modern medical themed music. It's really cool that there is."
teenagers,3e0kwr,Dyloneus,2,Tue Jul 21 07:05:24 2015 UTC,Yep! And this is personally my favorite: https://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1122416/northland-naked-extended  And this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5kHouJU0nQ

teenagers,3e0kwr,YouthfulPhotographer,7,Tue Jul 21 05:26:13 2015 UTC,me too thanks
teenagers,3e0kwr,Tuscania,3,Tue Jul 21 06:50:31 2015 UTC,Beauty is in the eye (ears) of the beholder. I really don't understand why people go out of their way to objectively say that their taste in music is objectively better than someone else's. It's almost the same as religious debates. Just let people be!
teenagers,3e0kwr,Plsdontreadthis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but there is always some guy in a group who listens to something no one else likes and always tries to push it on the rest of the group despite them airing their dislike."
teenagers,3e0kwr,Tuscania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not like they're saying ""omg I'm better than u bc I like (blank)!!!!"", they just want you to be into what they're into."

teenagers,3e0kwr,Tuscania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:29 2015 UTC,The thing that kills me about situations like that is the fact that the person you suggested it to might actually like them but they won't take the time to listen to them.
teenagers,3e0kwr,Invisibile27,-9,Tue Jul 21 18:31:53 2015 UTC,except people on here think country music sucks ass which isn't true.

teenagers,3e0kwr,The_Canaanator,3,Tue Jul 21 05:20:07 2015 UTC,I mean real country like Johnny Cash.

teenagers,3e0kwr,AverageWhiteJesus,8,Tue Jul 21 07:47:13 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of country music but it doesn't suck. Just not my taste tbh.
