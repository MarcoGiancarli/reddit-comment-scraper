If nothing has prompted the sadness, that's a warning sign. If it continues for much longer than it should, then that's a warning sign. If actual physical afflictions spring out of nowhere, then that's a warning sign. I think once it reaches a certain point, you'll know. Wanting to die, especially over and over again, is typically the sign. Stay safe, and best of luck."

sad,3e1j4h,That_Sexy_Ginger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"Tugboat-  As someone who also has suicidal thoughts and is thoroughly depressed, I can tell you with certainty, you are not alone. Though we may not have the same reasons for depression/suicidal thoughts, I can completely understand that strong, obvious solution that is, to give everything up and wipe your existence from the planet. I've been there. I've stood in Death's cold clutches many times.   That being said, let me tell you about a girl in High School named H. H was a very loveable girl, she was one to care about you as a person, flaws and all. She was charming, fun, beautiful, and caring. She had this certain magic of lighting up a room, grabbing your gaze and pulling you in. Even if you were kind of weird, even if you liked music over sports, you were still just as much a person as anyone else. H valued me, and I think that's why I became so intoxicated and infatuated with her. I could talk to her about anything, I could be myself. Nobody had been this to me before, nobody had cared with such honesty. It wasn't as if she was trying to get something out of you or improve you, she merely accepted you. That was something magnificent I had never felt from someone my own age. What started as just being friends in a larger group, me and H began to hang out more frequently, and soon I was writing music and poetry about her. My mind was full of her face, and she was the sun in my sky. I would dream about her every night, I would think about her every day. So on her birthday, sophomore year of high school I gave her this song, of which I spent tireless hours writing, recording, and producing. It took a lot of work to create some tangible semblance of what I felt for her. She HAD TO KNOW. The only way I could think to tell her, was writing a song and giving it to her. Turns out, the song completely floored her and she loved it. We ended up going on a couple dates, and things started to look more serious. She knew how I felt, but it seemed she didn't feel the same way. It tore me apart. I couldn't think about anything but her. In the song the final lyrics are: ""I'll wish for you, I'll wait for you,"" such desperate lyrics from such a desperate fool. Whenever I got on Facebook I would get striking pangs of jealousy whenever I saw her with a guy. It got to the point where I would put little hints of their names into our late-night telephone conversations (we would talk late at night for hours) to see what her relationship really was like with each of those guys. But luckily she seemed to only have eyes for me. She told me she liked me, but wasn't ready for a relationship yet.   Unfortunately, the very next month, my father, a professor of literature, was going to take me, him, my mom and sister to Madrid, Spain for the next 6 months while he taught classes on a Study Abroad program. My heart was ripped apart when I knew I would not be able to see H for so long, for months. She would probably completely forget about me by the time I returned. The night I had to say goodbye to her, was perhaps one of the hardest nights of my life. I hugged her and cried. She kept telling me ""It's okay. It's just a 'see you later'. I'll see you when you get back!"" (at this point we still hadn't even kissed. I question, were things really that serious?) After I left her house, the realization of what had just happened and what was yet to come crashed all around me. Things were never going to be the same between us. When I return in half a year, there's no way she'll still be interested in me. This person who I loved so much, invested so much in, and cared for with all my being, the way I had never cared for someone. She would forget me. And thus began 6 long months in Madrid, Spain. What should have been an incredible life-changing trip to Europe ended up being a sort of torture. My only means of communication with H was Facebook and E-mail. The time zones were 8 hours apart, so I could never instant message her, we would just send each other letters. And this is where my life took a crash. Trapped in a non-english-speaking country with nobody but my parents and sister to talk to, I starved for a friend. I missed H so much. She was everything I thought about. Weeks passed and her letters became less frequent and I began seeing pictures of her with other guys. I sent her more and more letters, until I did something I truly regret and consider it perhaps the worst deed in my life; I blackmailed her into giving me her e-mail's security answers. With that, I figured out her Facebook's and reset the passwords to both. I trawled through every one of her e-mails and facebook messages for a mention of myself. I spent hours searching, and found essentially no mention of my name. It ripped me apart even more. She wasn't even talking about me with other people? Was I really that worthless? After a few days of brooding, I realized what I had done, and the severe damaging power this would have on our relationship (which was already very strained at this point, with my constant obsessive, manipulative behavior). I confessed the crime and I can say that things were never the same after that point. H forgave me, and said she would learn to build back trust with me, but I knew any romantic future was hopeless. Eventually being in a different country had a way of making you completely lose hope. I completely gave up on her, and in doing so, I fell out of love. It was a really sad tale, and very traumatizing for a high school boy, but I can say I've never fallen for a girl since when I fell for H.   My advice to you is to push through. Things can't get worse than they already are. I understand that feeling of loss, despair, betrayal. That terrible crushing weight when you see a picture of her with other guys. But I can tell you right now: you don't have anywhere to go but up. Things can't get worse. They can only get better. I know this sounds like cliche advice, (and while in my opinion high school love is one of the purest and most painful) but she may or may not go for you. Continue being her friend, but don't let that hope of ""what could be"" blind your relationship with her. I know that ""what could be"" mentality ruined my relationship with H, and possibly a lifelong romance. Just love her, and move along. It may happen, it may not, but dwelling on it or forcing it is what really tears things apart. Persevere. Persevere. Persevere.   Be the mighty chugging TugBoat. I know you're strong enough to get through this.  -KngeYexo"

sad,3e1543,BananaChocolateSalad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:13 2015 UTC,Thank you. :) honestly the hardest part is that something in the deepest depths of my mind keeps imagining/wondering what her death was like. She must have been so scared. I hope it was fast. Or at least something like the feeling people say you get in the mouth of a lion. A feeling of peace. I don't know why I keep dwelling on that. I feel like this would be so much easier if she died in her sleep or something.

It's a good skill to have to do well in them particularly because so many people don't seem to have that skill at all. Just because you got beaten to the role by someone with more experience doesn't mean that it's the end of the world. It's a lot better than you being shit in interviews or your cv sucked or your references weren't actually that good.

If people are only offering compliments, you aren't getting the necessary feedback to improve. Even if you put eighty hours a week in, you won't get any better unless you know where to specifically direct your focus. And for the record, there are plenty of folks who have natural talent and don't work hard at it. That was how I was with any sort of social science or history class. The reality is, though, that natural talent only goes so far. That girl may have more raw talent than you, sure, but if she doesn't put the effort in, she will only go as far as she naturally can. When you put time in and practice, you slowly improve by pushing your abilities, and while it may take time to reach where she is at, you are progressing where the lazy stagnate. Give yourself the time, and ultimately you will surpass her. She will likely continue to sell her work for 500 and you currently don't at all. Continue, and it'll start. Maybe at fifty. A little later, a hundred. Two hundred. Five. A thousand. Do not be discouraged, instead look up at the masters. Some had natural talent. Others felt just like you. But they all persevered and practiced, improved and progressed, and they're the best. You can do that too.  And as another note, don't compare yourself to her, especially with art. It's a very subjective field, and the only way you should really measure yourself is by comparing your current piece to your last piece. It's not fair to you to base the value of your work on that of anyone else. You are you, you are not anyone else."

I can't simply tell you you'll be okay; that is, objectively, my opinion. Rather, I want to show you that things can change. You don't feel unique, and I echo those feelings in myself. I have a very deep self-loathing, and part of it is that I feel that I'm boring and ultimately, I'm just another face in the crowd.  As history shows, many faceless people have come to change or even reshape the world as we know it. George Washington wasn't born the first president the United States ever had, the only unanimously chosen leader in our history. He had to work and earn his place. He had to prove himself, and you can't do that with natural talent alone.  Even prodigies need to constantly practice and hone their crafts to become masters, and even more to be recognized as one. Almost every person is born being faceless to the world. Unless someone puts the effort in, they will never break away from that. You may not feel unique, but you can be. A lot of hard work will lead to that. You just can't quit. I know it's easier to say than do, but if I was able to miraculously get out of bed this morning and go to work, I'm positive you are capable of realizing your goals. :)"

(Excluding discriminatory reasons) I feel like I am an emotionally strong dude, 10 years in the military, 2 Iraq deployments but when i called my (then future) wife on the way home i lost it. Its the only time in the 7 years ive known her that she has heard me cry.   Fast forward two months after our wedding and I was still jobless. I was applying for everything i could find. After having an analyst job with the Army I figured finding a job would be easy. Boy was I wrong. I have never been more rejected than those couple months. I was told no thank you for jobs that kids out of high school were getting. It. Was. Demoralizing.  But, I kept to it and by the grace of God found a job that I was not qualified for. I applied, interviewed (very) well and was hired.   Keep your head up. You sound way smarter than me, and I am sure you will find something amazing."

Only worrying about present actualities might be easier.  As for your grandmother's inappropriate criticism and unwanted helpful hints, she's an old lady and she shouldn't be expected to be diplomatic and correct at all times. Old people don't keep up at all times with new developments. Feel compassion for her and humor her; she is old. Her ways should not be causing you excessive distress unless you're extremely insecure about having your maturity acknowledged by all.   You aren't wasting anyone's time. Do you think I'd be here if I had anything better to do?  Take care of yourself and be patient with yourself. You're in a genuinely hard spot. Allow yourself to feel less than great under such conditions without thinking you're sick or depressed. Observe yourself closely so you can be the best friend to yourself that you can be. It is worthwhile and interesting to observe your mind and see how it functions and how and why certain thoughts arise."

I have a mom, also an N, who comments on my weight, yet subsistes on nothing but cookies, cheese and vitamin water. Its healthy ya know, got vitamin right there in the name.   Just know that you are trying to make the correct choices. Its not easy.   As for dating, if your FWB can't handle you getting a darn tattoo, maybe they just weren't dating material for you. You mentioned being raised by an N, you know they pretend to be lovely and nice - unitl they aren't. Don't fall into that trap, it will just make you sadder.  Just keep trucking.

sad,3bfosm,advice_tossout1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"Update:  I think I'm slowly getting better, convincing myself that her current self is not good for anyone in the long run (thank you hermes for opening my eyes). I've talked with her about it and she basically admitted that her strategy is to be as best as she can on her own expense, avoid confrontation, pretend everything is fine and dandy. The problem is, when the time comes she just can't do it anymore and quits. She sees no alternative strategy, is sure that no one can accept her true face. I am willing to help her but she has to help herself first. She is immature and I see it now.  The problem is the other guy. Today we had a good day at work, we talked a lot, cooperated well. We were friendly I had no sudden rushes of emotions. Untill the end of the day...  From what she told me she is already sleeping with the guy or going to very soon. Holy fuck it hit me hard. I tried to be all mature about it, said I know where it's going, that it's not easy for me but it's her decision and I want her to be happy. I didn't let her see how much it hurt me. The thought of her being fucked by another man is unbearable. I know she is not good for me, I know she has issues even she can't resolve preventing any lasting relationship, I know she won't stay with him very long. But the thought of my girl moaning under some random guy... I fills me with hate, envy, anger, sadness, hopelessness. I feel like going mad. I know exactly why she's doing it and I can't find any reasonable argument against it from her side of view but it does not help at all..."

Sad music has always  been apart of my life ever since I was a freshman in high school. The way people talk about you when you were around  to say anything back. Along  the lines of a Eminem ""what are friends, friends are people who you though they were  close enough to be your brother. But they will cut your throat when you are not looking."" Music  is something  special  for everyone because the way that it makes you feel inside is different  than anythi g else you can explain  in your daily life. The one song that has mirrored  me perfectly is by Henry Rollins ""i think i know you"". It pasted how i felt almost every  single day in high school. I and about to turn 23 here soon almost finished  with my degree  and i feel exactly the same way. Nothing else even comes close to music when you are feeling depression."

However, your kindness has to come from somewhere. You may think that it is fake, but it is definitely easier to be mean, and to your credit you reciprocate kindness - like many other good, honest people.  I sit in an empty room, going through the motions at my work until it ends and I can go to the next chapter of my life and the unknowns that it inevitably brings. I hate myself because of the endless circle of sadness; the persistant feeling of self pity that feeds the self-loathing, the idea that I as a man, nay, a human, should be ""better"" than this, that I shouldn't allow deceptively simple things to bring me down.   New friends will come. This is something I have been forced to learn. Torn from the security of my friendships, straining said friendships with distance, I am forced to understand the fleeting nature of friends. The best ones stick with you, no matter who initiates the get-together after a period apart. If none of them do that, I would urge you to move on. It can be tough. I so understand. But you will be able to start up with your best friends as if nothing has changed. Maintain contact with them nonetheless, find solace in the rhythm of conversation, be it weekly, monthly or otherwise.   If they do not stick with you, put yourself out there. Again, I know it is tough. For me personally I ""send out"" a sort of SOS signal, if you can call it that: I am open about my passions and hope that others will see that and be drawn to the common ground we share. I sport different clothes; I casually mention little bits here and there in conversation in the hope that someone will detect them and see a potential friend in me.  Life is fleeting. Friendships come and go, but the good ones stay. If no one stays, keep searching. Do not give up. I am not sure if I'm doing this right, I only recently came to this sub, and if this response is at all against the rules I understand.  You've got your school friends, but you drift apart during college. You've got your college friends, but you drift apart during the real world. But if you find a job you enjoy, and can picture yourself doing, those relationships will last you a long time. I have learned that the people you work with make the day-to-day tedium bearable, and that leads to strong friendships that last.  I see some parallels between us, and I feel like I had to type this out as much as for myself as an attempt to help you. I am not trying to sound pretentious, or humblebrag in any way; I can simply easily recognize a situation similar to mine."

It's a struggle to figure out who you are, and what you want to be, and who you want to be with, and how you're going to survive, and how you're going to afford everything. A lot of life comes at you really fast. But as life goes on, you kind of settle into adult routines, you master your work, and things tend to get easier. That's not to say there are no more struggles, but they are smaller, and the struggles make life more interesting. Think of it like a video game. If there were no obstacles, no one to beat, and nothing to overcome, the game would quickly get boring. But the more you conquer those challenges in life, the more you master it. My life now is sooooo different than it was in high school. Man, if I had to live in high school for the rest of my life, I'd kill myself.

Honestly it sounds like you're too desperate, if you weren't then you would have moved on as soon as she started giving you hints like texting you 24 hours after toy texted her. She has no obligation to date you but I agree the truth from the beginning would have been nice,, it's just not always easy to break that news so you could try to be understanding. You seem a bit selfish and like it's all about you. Especially leaving her the kind of message you describe that's just wrong. I can see you sent it from a place of being hurt but that kind of reaction proves to her that she made the right choice, you have to mature and become more understanding if you want to be in a relationship.

It's just that, from your perspective as a straight male, you're only seeing one side of that. If you allow that sort of generalized hate to preoccupy you, it'll come through in your mannerisms and women pick up on that.  In my experience, women can tell if a guy is relationship hunting, and it's usually unappealing. Try to stop trying to find a girlfriend. Instead, work on yourself. Find a new passion. Exercise more. Join a club or a group of some kind that have people with similar interests. Become more comfortable with yourself. When you do these things, both men and women will find you appealing, and then you won't have to go hunting. They'll come to you.  Try and maintain a positive outlook. I know it can be hard at times like this; I've been there. And just try to focus on improving the one thing you have any real control over: yourself."
sad,3ar6gk,ABrownLamp,2,Tue Jun 23 04:03:37 2015 UTC,"You're completely right, in your first paragraph. Rationally, I know women are probably no worse than men. I've just spent more time with one of the genders. I mean, PTSD victims know that fireworks are mostly harmless, but that doesn't prevent them from having an emotional response.  I hate it when, when someone complains about being single, another person says, ""You need to work on yourself."" The assumption is that the person is not working on himself. Granted, there are some people who kinda just sit around all day and expect their situations to change while they themselves remain the same. But I'm not one of those people. I go to the gym 6 days a week, I'm learning a third language, I'm a member of a few groups, I read, my hobbies change from time to time, and while I have met more people by doing these things than I otherwise would have, I'm just as single now as I was when I started, several years ago.  I think the problem is that ""most improved"" is not equivalent to ""the best.""  And is ""stop looking"" an effective strategy? It doesn't seem so. If you want a new job, you should send out applications; an employer won't randomly call you and offer you a job without knowing who you are. If you want to go to college, again, you should send out applications; a university won't ask you to attend. If you want something, you should pursue it deliberately, right? How are relationships special? If you want a relationship, shouldn't you ask people out? How can you go on dates if you don't try to set up dates? Women never ask me out on dates.

I did feel a little better afterward, but I know she's undeservedly much happier than I am.  That can be perceived as immature. So what? Why should I care?  That's all justice is, anyway: inflicting some variation of harm upon someone because they've done so to someone else."
sad,3ar6gk,fire--starter,2,Tue Jun 23 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, that's a pretty normal thing to do....Date around as a single person. Shes allowed to do that. You'd do the same thing if you happened to meet someone nice in between your two or three dates with her. What would you say to her? Oh i met someone else i might possibly be interested in, let me call you back after i get to know them? Its part of dating.   There's no way of getting around this, if you are really actually trying your best to date women and coming up short for three years, you need to change something important. I don't know what it is, shyness, appearance or effort... But you're gonna need to step out of your comfort zone on probably at least one of those things. You shouldn't be this rattled over this. Its a real obvious sign of your inexperience"

But in all seriousness I've been where you are and am a bit older than you, but not so much that I don't remember those imperious (and trust me, beautiful in hindsight) emo passions that define our subadulthood.  Take a tip from me: take out a loan and go to college if you possibly can, just to try it out.  As good a student as I was in highschool, I was very lonely and generally glum, hating life, etc. but college (as horrific as college-drama can be) gives you a taste of irresponsible freedom that can't really exist anywhere else except for the super-rich.  It will get you away from your parents and the home of your youth (which is likely what's depressing you).  Once you're on your own, setting your own schedule (and - in the case of college - free from the drudgery of earning your keep) it's like, night and day.  It's something to consider and it did the trick getting me to feel better/""normal.""  Also if you're 'cool' I recommend smoking and drinking, which (used appropriately) reduce anxiety and boost confidence, and profoundly change your general outlook -- I found said activities indispensable in climbing out of my funk and turning my life around. (edited for typos and clarity)"
sad,3aoj2o,ObeseClover,2,Mon Jun 22 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"Haha, obviously meant ""good bond"", but food bond works too haha. I think that's a lot of good advice though, and I really appreciate the time typing that out. I could see myself possibly getting out of my funk if I did go away to school, even if it wasn't that far. I do smoke and drink here and there, mostly smoke, and it definitely does help hinder the feelings I have sometimes. Hopefully it will all turn out better in the end, and that I do find myself in a position that you are in closer down the line. Thanks again!"

Then, later in the day when the dog finds me and drags me outside, her fangs locked on the sleeve of my favorite shirt, I start walking around in nature and watch the sunset over the mountain and feel better again. I'd be dead without my dog. She never takes no for an answer and has literally saved my life more than once. She's a wolf dog and her kind is absolutely relentless. They have to be to take down an elk. But she's as loving and joyful as she is uncompromising and intransigent. And thank goodness for that. serious  During severe and prolonged depressions, the wolf dog's agenda determines what I do throughout the day because I lack any kind of agenda of my own and even if I had one I'd lack the will to carry it out. As a result, the wolf dog has established herself as alpha by default. She is always benign and it's for the best so I accept it."

In my final year of highschool, my grandfather passed away, it was my first real experience with loss and I dealt with it poorly. I stopped being social, I stopped playing any sport, I stopped going to school (I played truant). I want to say I understand what you're going through, but everyone is different. The one thing you can do to cope is to go about with life as is, pay your respects and understand that death is a part of life. If you can afford it, speak to a counselor or therapist, they really do help with grief (In my experience, anyway.)

It's been 7 years since I finished middle school, so I'm not sure I can relate well anymore, but I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I want to let you know that high school can be intimidating and you might feel like a drop in the well at first, but you'll acclimate pretty quickly. You may not be able to see your current friends as often, but there's a whole new pool of people to become friends with. Just go into it with a positive attitude.  When I was your age I was crazy about this one girl, but I was too nervous to ask her out. She ended up going to a different high school than me and we sorta fell off in talking to each other. I was pretty torn up about it for a bit, but it faded. Don't get too hung up on relationships at your age if you can. That's not going to stop things from feeling good or bad, but if you can reflect on that it may help you handle future events like this.  You seem like a smart kid, taking AP and honors courses. You also write very well for someone your age I might add. I hope everything goes well for you in the coming years and that you can make it past this crappy day. Maybe in time you can look back and be proud that you didn't let this get to you as much as it could have."

So before I got really depressed and sad and lonely, I had this bad virus, where like two viruses combined attacked my body and I had a fever so high I thought I'd die...well I wanted to die that one evening. Spent a week in the hospital (everything's fine now). During the hospital stay, I was desperate to get out, because I couldn't do anything, I couldn't leave. I was standing at the window staring outside and just thinking of all the things I could do if I was not in the hospital right now...and it kinda changed my point of view on things.   When I got home, I recovered quickly and I started to just...do more things. I kept thinking about what my life would have been like if that virus had taken my life and it was pretty much...boring, nothing, I spent most of my days at home, watching tv and playing games oh and I drew too, not good but I did, still do today. I too was bored by everything and I couldn't really do anything, to begin with other than to distract myself with media.   And well, ever since then...I force myself to do things. It was hard at the beginning. I wanted to just stay inside but...I called the few friends I had and went out, met new friends...and so on. And I've seen myself change from someone who rarely does anything to someone whose life is so busy now that I have to plan everything two weeks in advance. And I like it that way. The only thing I tend to forget is to actually take time for myself every now and then, but that's okay. I'd rather spend my time with niece and nephew laughing and loving them and being loved in return than to spend it alone, even if it means I get a bit overexhausted sometimes but I make sure I sleep a lot and eat right (very important!!! food can add to your depression!). I also do spend time drawing, when I can, but it's more rare nowadays, but when I do I mean it and I can focus and I produce better drawings than before. So yeah. I'm living a very good life compared to 99% of the other people in this world. Of course I am not the rich 1% but I don't even wanna be. I count my blessings everyday and it's important not to lose track of that.   Good luck to you, get out there and get shit done :)"

sad,39dyew,badaaim,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yes! Thanks for asking. I could never live without love in my life. My SO is an enormous black and silver German Shepherd/Malamute mix and a few years ago, we adopted a little wolf dog who is an unrelenting source of joy and who now runs the show.  I was married for 16 years in the past to a human. It was great for 8 of those years. After we split up I didn't feel any desire to experience that sort of lifestyle or intense 1-on-1 relationship again.  I didn't know it but I had a lot of shit in my brain that had to be sorted out and I wasn't able to address it deeply enough while relating to others of my kind.  I am currently enjoying 5 years of living as a hermit. The insights I've had into the nature of the human being are worthwhile. I do not think I would've had these insights if living in the constant company of others. For me, it was only once I was alone that I was truly confronted by my own crap."
