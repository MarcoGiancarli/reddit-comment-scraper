Is it possible to pledge to buy in X amount per [time period], and that counts as being part of the Dogepledge ""rocket""? For example, $5/month is ""totes legit""?   Yes of course. You can absolutely, feel free adjust it to your needs. I think it's better to pledge $5 regularly than one time $100. Just don't forget to save the Dogecoins minimum for a moon year (3545.4 days) and to give a minimum of 5% donation to a cause of your choice before spending your Dogecoin.   The video mentions that Dogecoin is linked to Bitcoin. I had noticed that, but how will the Moonpledge unleash the Doge? (Pardon me for being a bit of a DOGE newb, with a little bit of delicious faucet DOGE in my possession.)   In the past, Dogecoin was mainly traded with bitcoin and we had that devils circle going when bitcoin price against the Dollar plunged, also the Dogecoin price plunged. If the Bitcoin price against the Dollar rose, the Dogecoin price fell. I think that we already broke that circle a little if you look at the charts from the last three months.

Suddenly some weeks ago I started to get new interest about cryptocurrencies and started to investigate about bitcoin. After that I also found dogecoin. First, I tried faucets to see if that thingie of the wallets was true and to learn about them without risking my money and after that I got really interested in this economic world. After that I started promoting the use of cryptocurrencies on my own family and then between my friends; then I started to do it on my blog, because I realized that in my city this kind of money is practically unexistent.  I started accepting payments for my medical consulting services but right now not much luck hahaha. I hope someday I got a patient that ask me to make a payment with doge or bit, but meanwhile I'll have to wait and promote it more on this city. I got on reddit because I read elsewhere that here is the native dogecoin community and you're nice people; I have visited reddit before to get up to date on summoners war, a game for mobile devices and I still have a lot to learn of how to behave and do things here xP.

dogecoin,3dz21x,dogetipbot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:33 2015 UTC,great!
dogecoin,3dz21x,Fulvio55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"Oooh, and flairs too! :)"
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,10,Mon Jul 20 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't forget about the work I'm doing at www.BitVoat.com/v/Dogecoin  It is quite unique, and has DogeCoin DIRECTLY integrated with out the need for a tip bot. Check it out!  www.BitVoat.com/v/Dogecoin"
dogecoin,3dz21x,thediscodoge,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm sorry for asking what I'm pretty sure is a silly question, but is bitvoat part of voat, or something different, and if so, how? Thank you."
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"It's 100% completely different, and 100% unaffiliated.  It's different in the fact that the ENTIRE site is powered by crypto currency - and there no tip bots as Cyrpto is BUILT IN.  Each time you voat up, you have the option to attach dogecoin directly to that tip!"
dogecoin,3dz21x,thediscodoge,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! I just registered."
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:13 2015 UTC,Hey welcome aboard! Go introduce yourself in DogeCoin and get some tips!
dogecoin,3dz21x,mspaint_wow,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:23 2015 UTC,Very cool!
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:11 2015 UTC,bitvoat is down right now
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,2,Tue Jul 21 10:02:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, looking at it currently."
dogecoin,3dz21x,mspaint_wow,2,Tue Jul 21 11:50:56 2015 UTC,And our first DDOS
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:36 2015 UTC,Well that sucks.
dogecoin,3dz21x,mspaint_wow,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:54 2015 UTC,"Naw, back up now. Was bound to happen."
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:06 2015 UTC,Down again
dogecoin,3dz21x,mspaint_wow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:53 2015 UTC,Yep I'm under attack.  I've just shelled out $200 a month for DDOS protection. Should kick in soon.  FFS.
dogecoin,3dz21x,dogeqrcode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:47 2015 UTC,There's no way to stop it I guess? So hosting companies must love it so they can charge extra.
dogecoin,3dz21x,IeuanG,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"Most hosting companies don't give a flying crayon if you get hit by DDOS.  This is an expensive game. If you're on a cloud service like Amazon EC2, your CPU goes wild and they bill you.  CloudFlare is managed at the DNS level, so my site routes through them. It's the same system as Voat.   It sucks. It's childish. But it's not an un-solvable problem. Indeed, it is a marker of success.  Site should be coming back online shortly. Just waiting for the account to update."

dogecoin,3dz21x,keb14,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:11 2015 UTC,weback.
dogecoin,3dz21x,earthmoonsun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:13 2015 UTC,ok tell me more about voat.co
dogecoin,3e0b5k,iusedtobethurst307,3,Mon Jul 20 23:43:31 2015 UTC,Yes Please! Its a good idea.
dogecoin,3e0b5k,lupetto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:03 2015 UTC,Love the idea!
dogecoin,3e0g78,woowdoge,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:34 2015 UTC,"OK, you got me to sign up and add a tipjar to http://fulvio55.altervista.org so that's a start.  Docs on the faucets seems a bit light on, but I presume people need to sign up to collect? And what restrictions are in place to prevent them draining the faucet?"
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:33:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for signing up.  Yes people need to sign up (just a username and password) to collect, once they collect they can withdraw to a dogecoin address. The faucet uses IPs and a few other methods to make sure everyone only gets one tip per faucet."
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:36:23 2015 UTC,"One tip, ever?  So if I had it someplace with WiFi, only one person could collect? That seems counterproductive."
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:40:56 2015 UTC,Yes if everyone was on the same WIFI only one person could collect. If everyone was using their mobile data each could collect once.
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:10 2015 UTC,"Hrm. Not everyone uses mobile data.. it bloody expensive here, so I only carry an iPod.  From what I've seen so far, it looks like a really good idea in need of a little more work."
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying but if I allowed multiple claims from the same IP someone could easily empty a faucet, I really don't see it being a huge issue but I guess if there was a faucet in front of a Starbucks and multiple people on the same WIFI tried to claim it could be a problem. The only other option I can think of would be a captcha which wouldn't be hard to implement."
dogecoin,3e0g78,W7phone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:46 2015 UTC,Ewwwww.. captcha :(  You don't think the address lockout is sufficient? What about a payout timer like I suggested in my post earlier today?
dogecoin,3e0g78,gholknam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"The faucets don't payout directly to an address so I don't think an address lockout would work. Didn't see your post about a payout timer, was it in this thread? Like faucets can only be claimed every so many minutes? How many minutes?"
dogecoin,3e0g78,TheMightyCraken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3e1myh/faucet_cooldowns/  The interval would be up to the faucet operator, and would depend on the circumstances. If you were paying 1 doge every minute, that 1440 doge/day, for example. 10 doge/5 min would be 2880/day. And those are maximums."
dogecoin,3e0g78,Fulvio55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"After working on this for over a year I've just finished adding the option to print http://Dogetip.co faucet links! Scan the QR codes and try it out!  Supports uploading your own custom faucet poster image, setting payouts, and limits.  To use login/register at http://dogetip.co then click ""faucets"" in the left side menu, then ""create new faucet"", then click ""Print Poster"", and click on the image you want to use.  If you'd like to make your image you can use this template: http://dogetip.co/postertemplate.jpg"
dogecoin,3e0g78,42points,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:01 2015 UTC,interesting..
dogecoin,3e0x61,frasertag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"Nevermind, clicking the QR icon shows your wallet address."
dogecoin,3e0x61,DeusTerre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:41 2015 UTC,"Hello! I have also started with dogecoin and had the same problem on my wallet; supposedly it works like the bitcoin one but it doesn't generate new directions on the list for every new payment, just below the QR code. I wonder why is that?  Also I'm new at reddit xD hope I did it well Hahaha"
