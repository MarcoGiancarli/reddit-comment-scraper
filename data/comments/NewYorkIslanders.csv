NewYorkIslanders,3e4nur,dl2316,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"The relevancy is in that the Isles had a billion dollar privately funded development deal that kept getting scaled back. This was replaced with a simple renovation deal that was tax payer funded (which got voted down). In a day and age where tax payers pay for everything, Nassau passed on what might have been the last privately funded sports arena in order to scale it down (aka divvy up the parcel of land to developers).   Isles new arena should never have been put up for tax payer vote because Nassau is in a load of financial crap and banking on an arena is a poor bet. Hence why Wang wouldn't pay for just an arena.   Oliver's piece is correct in that the final vote deal would have been an awful sham and travesty that'd hamstrung the county. Scaling it back for AHL, D league B-Ball, and concerts was the correct move in light of them passing on the Light House deal. Neither the Isles not Nassau could survive on the ticket sales split amongst each other."

NewYorkIslanders,3e0cux,bass_n_treble,6,Tue Jul 21 02:49:57 2015 UTC,Can't blame that group for joining together and showing their love/support for the game of hockey. I'm pretty sure they ended up at the Coliseum because tickets to Isles games then were most likely the cheapest out of all the options within driving distance.
NewYorkIslanders,3e0cux,johnzanussi,6,Tue Jul 21 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"Considering they had signs asking for ""Hockey where it belongs"" I'm gonna blame them, yeah. Plus doing it when we had our own relocation rumors swirling is a gesture that I'm suspect to call accidental."
NewYorkIslanders,3e0cux,johnzanussi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:14 2015 UTC,Good point. However if I was a fan in that area I would be all over any opportunity to let the league know I want hockey back in my town. Especially if there are relocation rumors.
NewYorkIslanders,3e0cux,johnzanussi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:35:23 2015 UTC,As someone who likes the Coyotes a lot in addition to the Isles I'm not much a fan of anything involving relocation rumors.

NewYorkIslanders,3e0cux,dl2316,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:46 2015 UTC,The rivalry probably depends a bit on how our first few meetings go if they get a team. I'd like to see them get one and then Montreal get the Expos back if there's an MLB expansion (I've heard rustlings) and I'm not even from Quebec. Maybe if they take a bunch of Isles in the expansion draft there'll be grounds for hatred.

Look on the bright side, at least you guys are close to the Isles. Us European fans give up sleep for 9 months a year to follow the team."

NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,entropism,2,Sat Jul 18 07:12:44 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Isles are probably presenting 3m aav @ 4 yrs right now. I'd wager they either bump the money a tad or shed a year to seal it in August.   Any other team would have to offer a crazy amount to cause issues. Like 4m aav, which seems incredibly unlikely."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,isles27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:28:31 2015 UTC,This is reassuring. I think his play complements us well and would love to see him with the Isles for a few more years :)
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"While I think Brock is an awesome player, I don't think he's irreplaceable talent. Lee got the better contract sooner because he showed consistent production throughout the season, dude earned his roster spot every game. He just wasn't mature enough as a player to handle the playoffs, but he was a good sport about it and said he plans to use his nixing from the playoff roster as motivation to only get better. That's humility and good sportsmanship at its best.   Brock, while he was hot in the beginning, can be a warning sign that he could be a streaky player. Sometimes that changes, but it sometimes never does. There are plenty of other young, talented forwards we could make lateral trades for and swap him for someone else. He's not superstar quality but he guarantees a hot streak from time to time. If Brock stays, awesome. He'll help bump up our goals. If not, we can find someone else just as capable without leaving a hole in the roster."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,skrshawk,7,Sat Jul 18 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have the exact tweets handy, but Staple has said this is a thing that happens sometimes, but that the real signing deadline is the first day of training camp.  Team rules are you either are signed before that day or you don't play that year.  In the highly unlikely scenario he didn't sign he would be traded for sure, but probably at a very low price because a lot of teams don't want someone who refuses to play for the club they're signed with."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,ugotpandaowned,4,Sat Jul 18 02:43:40 2015 UTC,Hes a restricted free agent so he can't just walk unless he wants to sit out an entire year or play on the KHL. Snow knows this so he is probably taking his time to lower the AAV. He will be playing the Islanders next season or be traded. There is more than enough time to get something done.
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,leeber27,4,Sat Jul 18 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sure no one here has any inside contacts that would be of useful information.  Also, he can't just walk."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,viewless25,2,Sat Jul 18 02:18:05 2015 UTC,well theoretically he could he'd just have to be cool with not playing in the NHL this year
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,leeber27,0,Sat Jul 18 04:30:34 2015 UTC,Good thing we're theoretically talking about him being in the NHL
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,lighthousefisherman,2,Sat Jul 18 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"Realistically: he stays, and right now they're playing the contract negotiations game. Garth and Brock himself both know what he's worth, but as GM, it's Garth's job to also sign talent to the cheapest dollar amount possible. He's going to be fiscal, especially considering the generous contract he gave Lee.   Not as realistic, but still within the realm of possibility: Garth bundles him with someone else and sends him to another team for another decent young player."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,bass_n_treble,2,Sat Jul 18 09:04:20 2015 UTC,"He started off the year red hot then suddenly appeared human; honestly was not impressed with his play towards the end of the year.  It's entirely possible, if not definitely, as a result of Capuano not having confidence in his youngsters."

NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,tazgraz19,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"Brock let the deadline for accepting his QO pass, meaning he can be offer-sheeted at this point (which won't happen). The internal deadline has always been day 1 of training camp since he had no arbitration rights."
NewYorkIslanders,3dp12i,zeile33,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Idk man I'm thinking trade.
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,lighthousefisherman,9,Fri Jul 17 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"He's a first rounder from 2009.  Sometimes guys take time to develop, sometimes they're a bust.  It's a 1 year, 2 way deal so if anything its bport depth, which we need.  I know nothing about the kid, but the '09 draft class has been nice to our team.  Either way, it's not going to harm us if he's in the AHL all season."
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,hockalo0gie,6,Fri Jul 17 16:33:27 2015 UTC,Nothing more than a Bridgeport signing. They need forwards.
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:26 2015 UTC,He'll probably be a bundling component to a larger trade package. Garth might use him to send elsewhere with someone like Okposo or Grabner later in the season.
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,SirHofH,7,Fri Jul 17 17:34:38 2015 UTC,It's a two way deal.  Hell be in Bridgeport unless miraculously someone really wants him and comes calling.  Don't look into this too much- they have to fill out the AHL roster and typically do that in late July/early August.
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,shiram,5,Fri Jul 17 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"Habs guy here : Leblanc was a project for us, but never panned out. Injuries slowed him down, and there were some questions about his confidence.  Should be a decent AHL guy though."
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,leeber27,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:22 2015 UTC,There's nothing to think about it.... He's just an AHL player. He won't get called up over quine
NewYorkIslanders,3dn0eu,firebird65g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, pure depth signing.   I think an issue we had in Bridgeport was there were not enough good players to push our top prospects. The team was horrible again last season.  We had a ton of two-way signings this year. Good. Let's see if any of these guys who failed in other systems can develop in our system. Let's see if these new players could push some of our top prospects for playing time. Let's see if our farm team could make the playoffs and get our minor leaguers some playoff game experience."

NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,viewless25,5,Wed Jul 15 16:40:03 2015 UTC,I'm surprised Nelson hasn't signed already. What could possibly be the hold up? There has been no news whatsoever about his offer that I've seen.
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,kenlane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"If I was him, I'd be pissed b/c I'm probably being offered much less than what Anders Lee got.  Which imho is ridiculous."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,Lostinthemist81,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:00 2015 UTC,Any basis for that thought? Highly unlikely they would re-up Lee and not offer Brock at least the same amount considering they're at basically the same point in their careers and Brock is seen as a player with more upside as a first rounder.
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,pepe_silvia26,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the Lee contract was high.  I'm assuming they didn't give him the same amount, but it is conjecture.  Who knows."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,Lostinthemist81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:05:20 2015 UTC,"Lee had arbitration which is huge negotiation leverage. I dont think there is anything to worry about though, I'd assume our offer is around 3m aav/4yr and he wants something like 3.5m aav/3yr. They will land somewhere in the middle. It is extremely unlikely any team swoops in and offers Brock 4m aav which would be the only way it becomes an issue."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,isles27,3,Thu Jul 16 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"An QO is a mandatory contract offer with a minimal raise (like 10 percent) that, regardless of whether the player signs, ensures that a restricted free agent does not become an unrestricted free agent. It's just a tool to prevent UFA status while the parties continue to negotiate. The realistic chances of Nelson being signed to an offer sheet are slim to none. It's a lot for the signing team to potentially give up to sign a player that has yet to prove himself with a breakout year."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,geli7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, one of the most reasonable comments here. Poulin is probably saying ""I have been here for awhile supporting this team, I want a raise or a 1 way deal"". Nelson probably just wants more money or a long term contract like Lee."

NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,pepe_silvia26,0,Wed Jul 15 22:32:07 2015 UTC,He's logged minutes with literally every single line at various points during the season.  No consistency whatsoever.
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,Lostinthemist81,2,Wed Jul 15 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"So did basically every other player on the team outside of JT, the 4th line, Boychuk, and Leddy."

NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,inapt888,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:31 2015 UTC,He played with Tavares the first two periods in San Jose and I can't really remember him playing on the fourth line at all.  So now you are just mad that he was on the second line then moved to the third line when Cappy decided Fransy was a better 2nd line center than Brock?
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,Lostinthemist81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:54 2015 UTC,"Our entire forward lineup is versatile. Honestly, I would say Grabovski was the most misused considering he barely played at center and that was his best position throughout his entire career. I believe he holds an above 50+ faceoff % which is something we sorely lack as well as is a plus possession player. Nelson was great in the beginning but wore down. Don't get me wrong, I love him but it wasn't our misuse of him that resulted in poor play down the stretch. He will rebound though."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,blekmyr,0,Thu Jul 16 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"No, he was definitely on the fourth line for a bit when Cizikas was out and then again in the playoffs.  He was on the kid line while it was working then for no reason they broke it up and then they bumped him to playing with Grabo and Kulemin and for a while they even had him on line one.  How, as a developing hockey player, are you supposed to grow in any way when you're playing with someone different every night?  They did that the season before too, never the same thing twice.  And despite all that he's still put up solid numbers."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,inapt888,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, let's just hope he demands more than $3,652,659 so that we at least will get a first from him in case he accepts an offer from another team."
NewYorkIslanders,3decdc,dl2316,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:09 2015 UTC,why? if he takes 3M we match it. I would rather him sign a ridiculous amount and get 4 firsts ;D

For civic arenas it's not a very high priority issue so it's a toss up on whether or not the name gets used each year.  Corporate named arenas are more likely to have their names included every year as it is often included in the deal for the naming rights.

NewYorkIslanders,3db08c,ManWithAPIan,6,Tue Jul 14 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"No, as it pertains to the Isles we have young hungry defenseman fighting for that 6th spot. He's a 5 at best, and will be overpaid. He's not the fit for us, we could use a top 4 (which pulock will hopefully be)."
NewYorkIslanders,3d9ef3,kenlane,2,Tue Jul 14 15:07:11 2015 UTC,Halmo had some decent numbers with Owen Sound in the OHL. Lot of PIMS with Bridgeport. Probably entirely unnoteworthy.    Czuczman seems even less exciting.    Gonna be a slow offseason.
NewYorkIslanders,3d9ef3,islesandpizza,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:19 2015 UTC,This is it guys.  There aren't going to be a ton of moves.  I think at most Grabner is shipped for a bag of pucks and the rest of the RFAs re-sign.  The only hype for the season will be that MAYBE Dal Colle gets a shot or barring that our guys are all 1 year older.

NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,_Chezz,7,Tue Jul 14 04:04:36 2015 UTC,I have SUPER high hopes for the guy. He's got a MONSTER shot and was pretty great at the scrimmage.
NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,Salacondor,7,Tue Jul 14 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"105.5 miles an hour slap shot good.   He needs some work with defending top NHL players, it'll be him v. Mayfield for the 6th d spot out of camp, winner gets >15 minutes a game against bottom 6 forwards. That's my guess."

NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,zeile33,2,Tue Jul 14 10:52:52 2015 UTC,"He looked very sure of himself at the scrimmage.  I really like his play, and he really has a monster shot."
NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,Eiramasil919,2,Tue Jul 14 12:29:19 2015 UTC,I think he'll definitely be on the team for good by mid season.  Whether he starts the year on the Isles will depend on whether he or Mayfield have a better camp and if any of our top 4 get hurt.
NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,replayer,2,Tue Jul 14 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"I've got really high expectations for Ryan. Like someone said earlier, he's gotta get used to defending NHL caliber players, but he's a smart player, he understands what's going on around him, and I think his offensive prowess will work well in the Isles' system.   You're right, definitely don't want to be comparing him to Weber just yet -- but his SHOT... my goodness, that's comparable.  He's also a stud QB on the PP from what I've seen.  I think he'll end up being similar to Mike Green."
NewYorkIslanders,3d7pdm,leeber27,2,Tue Jul 14 16:19:14 2015 UTC,He scored the first ever goal at Barclays center. It's fate that he'll be a stud.
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,JGilroy74,9,Mon Jul 13 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"Safe and cool bets would be: Tavares, Strome, Leddy, Nelson, Hamonic"
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,ManWithAPIan,0,Mon Jul 13 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone has JT, so I don't want to look like I hoped on the bandwagon.  I like Strome and Leddy, don't tryst Nelson and Hamonic to be here forever (don't know why)"
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,ManWithAPIan,3,Mon Jul 13 20:27:08 2015 UTC,I can assure you Hamonic isn't going anywhere. The kid is an Islander at heart and the organization LOVES him.
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,zeile33,3,Mon Jul 13 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"I love Hamonic, so I hope so.  He's definitely not a top 2 defenseman, but he's the guy that wins championships"
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,viewless25,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"I love Strome, too, but if he has a monster year and they have to pay him, we're pretty close to the cap and something's gotta give.  Probably Okposo will be leaving but, you never know."
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,ArtyThePoopie,5,Mon Jul 13 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Boychuk and Leddy are the safest bets because they're on contract for 7 more years.   I like to go with homegrown players, so Hamonic and Tavares are the safest bets among that group.  Young players like Strome, Nelson, and Lee are dangerous because they might leave as soon as they hit UFA.  Halak is always a strong one, has 3 years left, won't be getting traded.   I would wait for a deal to get done for Okposo and Nielsen. I think Okposo is a safe bet, but always make sure.  Don't get a Michael Grabner jersey he's possibly getting traded and, if not, won't be brought back before he hits UFA."
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,NHL_nutjob_19,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:51 2015 UTC,Imo Nielsen and Okposo have been here long enough to (depending on your opinion of them) warrant buying a jersey regardless of whether their they're leaving or not  Definitely skip Grabner tho lmao

NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,Subject2Change,3,Mon Jul 13 23:36:50 2015 UTC,I think Kulemin is a safer bet. De Haan's time and role on the team depends on how well he bounces back next season

NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,DancesWithCanoes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"Rather than tell you who you should like, I'll give you my two cents on what jerseys will be outdated more quickly than others in my opinion. Grabovski and Kulemin are almost guaranteed to be gone once their contracts expire, that money will help pay for JT's new contract. Grabner, Okposo, and Bailey are the group of younger long term islanders that are very moveable but hard to predict. Nielsen seems to me like our most realistic trade option, and therefore the least safe jersey to buy. I don't think Strait is long for the NHL, and the better the Islanders get, the fewer games Hickey will play. This is all my speculation, but as a proud owner of Yashin, Guerin, and Moulson jerseys I have been trying to make the same decision for when I buy a new white jersey. Leddy is quite a safe bet and I only see Lee moving in a crazy deal for something huge. (Babcock loves him but is only a coach)"
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,DancesWithCanoes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:29:26 2015 UTC,I'd say Leddy or Okposo personally.
NewYorkIslanders,3d5qlg,DancesWithCanoes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Boychuk or Leddy are a safe bet. I haven't seen many people here suggesting it, but any of the fourth liners would be a cool idea. Total fan favorites, hardly see them, and they're an integral part of this team."

NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,Cay_Rharles,11,Sun Jul 12 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"Pulock, I think he is going to click with Hickey and they will be a solid pairing.  Also that shot on the PP will be incredible."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,iruber1337,3,Sun Jul 12 21:49:09 2015 UTC,"We are gonna have a NASTY power play once Pulock makes the Big Team, it's gonna be absurd being able to choose between him and Boychuk working the point. What a wonderful problem to have."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,bass_n_treble,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"A replacement for Doug Weight would make our PP pretty nasty.  Boychuk on PP2 most of the year?  Really?  Okposo, with the least accurate slapshot on the team, on the point?"
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,mcbordes,5,Mon Jul 13 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"I watched Ho-Sang play some games in Niagra this year.  He's made some plays that made me say ""what the fuck is this guy thinking?""   I really hope I'm wrong about the guy but he just screams Kirill Kabanov 2.0 to me."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,hockeycardcollector,2,Sun Jul 12 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Ho-Sang is great but I don't think he is comparable to Kabanov. Kabanov had a bad wrist injury that kept him out for a long time. His numbers aren't anywhere near Ho-Sang's. I think Ho-Sang has more raw talent, and is motivated to prove himself."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,Stonecipher_LaVache,6,Mon Jul 13 19:54:20 2015 UTC,"Ho-Sang, dynamic transition player. Elite skating. Loads of balls attacking the traffic areas around the net. His hands and ability to weave through bodies around the net is eye-popping stuff. Rolls off contact well. Reminds me lot of PMB when he was good who was a treat to watch.   Barzal is close, all the tools and a great mind  and passion for the game. Really like MDC and Tito Beauvillier is very fun player to watch at both ends."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:50 2015 UTC,"While I didn't pay as much attention to those guys at camp as I did to my fave Ho-Sang, they all impressed me (and I even got to meet and talk briefly with Beauvillier!) and I think they were some damn good selections. Dal Colle looks like he's all ready for the show."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,viewless25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Thats a fearsome foursome. Garth is proving he can get top talent anywhere and he grabs passionate players. Love it. Great time to be a fan, I remember the days when Trent Hunter and Weinhandl were our best forward prospects. Garth has been able to amass a hell of a prospect pool littered with gamebreakers whil crafting a bonafide playoff contender."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,lighthousefisherman,5,Mon Jul 13 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"Aside from consensus fan fav, Ho-Sang, I gotta say Mayfield.  Guy is going to bring a lot to this team, especially size. 6'5"" 218 lbs. Good ole' Missouri boy like Pat LaFontaine. He's already debuted in the NHL. Not as much a leader on the PP like Pulock, but i think he's most poised to make the roster this year"
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,bunnysanders,5,Sun Jul 12 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Favorite prospect forward: split between Barzal and Ho-Sang. Barzal has the chops to develop into a strategic leader on the ice. Ho-Sang has moments of flashy brilliance but needs to bring more all-around finesse to his game. Either way, both are already not far away from being ace call-up options as they continue to develop as pros.   Favorite defenseman: Pulock. No doubt. He just fits with the defensive style the Isles are trying to cultivate.   Favorite Goalie: to be honest, I haven't kept up with information on our prospect netminders, but if they bring depth insurance, I don't care who's behind the mask if they can serve as eventual depth insurance. With Greiss and Halak, though, I'm not too worried about the prospect goaltenders for at least another 2 seasons."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,nrudy23,3,Sun Jul 12 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"I was really high on Pulock until the second scrimmage game, he seemed very questionable in his own end. Obviously a very limited sample size though. I like Dal Colle because I think he can be a very solid role player while he is developing, whereas I see Ho-Sang being a longer term development until he can step into a significant offensive role. Dal Colle needs very little space to operate, which will translate very well to the pro's in my opinion. And this is no knock against Ho-Sang, but Dal Colle had to mature way younger than most kids do because of both his mother's breast cancer and his brother's autism and seizure problems. Saw a video where his mother talked about Michael waking up to the sound of his brother Jonluca seizing in his room and holding him in his arms until the seizure passed. Garth Snow has a knack for picking kids who overcame additional adversity to make it to the NHL."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,NDA_Fridge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:58:06 2015 UTC,I think in the second scrimmage Pulock was looking to be more of a defensive presence
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,hardcorelegend43,2,Thu Jul 16 16:32:44 2015 UTC,I think Andong Song might be able to grow into a good player. It seems like he has the passion to want to play.
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,jimgillespie,3,Sun Jul 12 23:33:26 2015 UTC,Richard Park 2.0
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,islesandpizza,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"Most definitely, a lot of people aren't seeing that he's pretty unrefined right now and I think that he has a lot of upside period, let alone for where we got him in the draft."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,thewrongflag,2,Sun Jul 12 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"Barzal and Pulock. The former's two-way game is a BIG facet that is easily overlooked in young players. Of course Ho-Sang and dal Colle are also great forwards. Mayfield looked great in the playoffs but Pulock, I think, will develop to be the better d-man; he's got a killer shot that we need on the PP. I look forward to a big Pulock shot with 27 tipping it in his office (set up by JT – of course)."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,ManWithAPIan,3,Mon Jul 13 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"Dal Colle and Ho-Sang were at today's Mets game so I'm assuming they're ridiculously good luck, so I like them. I'm also psyched for Pulock, Barzal and Beauvillier."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,firebird65g,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"Quite a few of our new guys looked good, but Pulock really stands out to me. I know I'm parroting a little, but holy kendoly our PP is going to be fantastic."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,nrudy23,2,Mon Jul 13 15:02:00 2015 UTC,"It deserves to be parroted, we've had PP issues for what seems like an eternity and while I think we still won't exactly be the best on the PK, having a strong PP can go a long way in making up for that. Pulock on the Point is going to be one hell of a difficult thing to stop."

NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see Matt Barzal in orange and blue.   Everything I've seen has put this guy's work ethic off the charts, his highlight reels show fluid skating, an ability to make plays, and probably a currently underrated scoring ability, just based on his WHL goal totals.   Also he was an assistant captain on the U-18 Canada team this year, always a good thing. Showed great chemistry with Anthony Beauvillier in the U-18 as well, I think we'll be seeing them on a line in the future.   I think Barzal's kneecap injury last year may have dropped him down slightly on some team's rankings. The lack of goal scoring also could have dropped him a bit, but to our benefit. Another coup by Snow at #16 in my opinion."
NewYorkIslanders,3d1qe3,nrudy23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:10:23 2015 UTC,Barzal...I think he was an absolute steal at the draft and to me throughout development camp and watching the two scrimmages him and Ho-Sang were hands down the most impressive players on the ice.  Both made quick reads and moved the puck well.  Barzal could learn to shoot more as Ho-Sang could tone it down a notch with the moves and become more of a playmaker

NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,ryan924,3,Sat Jul 11 13:52:35 2015 UTC,That's really great to hear that this is making some noise in China. I really hope to see the Asian market grow a lot in the future.
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,enag7,3,Sat Jul 11 14:36:49 2015 UTC,Glad that he wants to finish college so he will get more time in minors to get more built. Thanks again for the translations. Sorry about the loss.
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,Joppop1,3,Sat Jul 11 18:18:45 2015 UTC,Thank you. I come from China and have been living in Long Island for almost three years. I became an Isles fan since this February. Song really draws a huge attention in China. Many hockey fans in China are now being interested in Isles. I just wish our marketing department would do something as soon as possible as they already made this move. Our marketing is always lagging and weak compared to other teams.
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,lycbread,2,Sun Jul 12 03:41:25 2015 UTC,Yes I think they can do something with this guy. He have a huge potential. I hope he will play in NHL.
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,Pepperpwni,2,Sun Jul 12 09:18:56 2015 UTC,"It all depends on if he makes the roster. He's got a good 3 years of development ahead of him, minimum. I was impressed by his frame at camp, but he definitely needs to hit that weight room hard (much like every other 18 year old we drafted). We'll see what he's made of in a few years, and at that point the islanders will market it."
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,lycbread,2,Sun Jul 12 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"You are right. But it's not bad that Islanders have more fans outside of North America, right? NHL is looking forward to stepping into Chinese market. Many teams are doing something for that already. No matter if he will make it or not, I would like to take this as a good opportunity to get our Isles well known. I have heard that some hockey fans in China say they will be an Islanders fan because Islanders drafted Song. I'm happy for that. I wouldn't like to see that Isles become another Houston Rockets in China, but at least we could be one of the most popular NHL teams there. I'm optimistic."
NewYorkIslanders,3cwqjz,Pepperpwni,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"I am all for having more Islanders fans, but I also believe its important for the Islanders not to push it more than any other 6th round pick we've taken in the past forty years. Despite where he's from, at the end of the day, he is still a late round pick and shouldn't be given any more attention that he deserves until he proves something."

My friends parents are still fairly close with Andongs' parents. What I've heard is that Andongs' parents aren't too happy about him being drafted, they'd rather him get a degree than play hockey. They also feel like the draft choice might just be a publicity stunt since this year will be the first time ever the nhl season will be televised in China."

NewYorkIslanders,3cta66,Tissueboxhead,0,Fri Jul 10 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"I can't remember which bathroom, but it was the upper level right at the center line.  It was a mad house.

NewYorkIslanders,3cucws,viewless25,7,Fri Jul 10 21:14:27 2015 UTC,Really depends on camp and preseason but I'd say it's between Pulock and Mayfield with Pulock in the lead.

I think Visnovsky provides that steady veteran presence as a 7th defenseman that you need to be comfortable going with a rookie like Pulock.

NewYorkIslanders,3cr5xa,LooseSeal-,9,Fri Jul 10 13:22:14 2015 UTC,I'm sorry everyone; but where you live is such a shithole. The Islanders should practice at Aviator on Flatbush Ave. There is plenty of surrounding area for these amenities. Brooklyn would hand the space over really quick.

It's a beautiful new facility located right down the road from the Coliseum. And from what I've heard they're bankrupt already and could use the additional revenue.  Why have the county foot the bill to renovate an old rink when there's a brand new one a couple miles from their old home?

If you weren't doing this you were basically on the bathroom line the entire intermission (which would then block the entire concourse area but that's another story).
NewYorkIslanders,3comdb,Eiramasil919,2,Thu Jul 9 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"Or sprinting during the game hoping to get in and out in less than a minute if you were desperate, and then missing a goal...yes this has happened to me twice and I wasn't happy."
NewYorkIslanders,3comdb,Chrismercy,3,Thu Jul 9 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah apart from the sentiment involved with the Barn ticket prices were something I always loved there, I figured prices would increase at Barclay's because of how new it is. I'll be right up in the back with you though haha."
NewYorkIslanders,3comdb,ballots_stones,3,Thu Jul 9 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"pros: Jumbotron is huge and super clear. Seats had good leg room in lower level, great food selection. Never had to wait in line for bathroom, ice seems brighter lit Cons: $12 for a beer, goal horn sounded like a recording, didn't see the isles banners hanging."
NewYorkIslanders,3comdb,Fdnyc,3,Thu Jul 9 16:39:54 2015 UTC,The banners for the Stanley Cups were there.  The retired player numbered weren't.
NewYorkIslanders,3comdb,hgli,3,Thu Jul 9 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Goal horn wasn't on full. It can and will be much, much louder."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,agentanthony,4,Thu Jul 9 15:02:12 2015 UTC,The train from ronkonkama to Jamaica to Atlantic terminal was fine. There was a lot of Islanders fans on the train. Also it's very easy to drink on the way.  The train back was packed though until a couple stops after Jamaica when my friends and I finally got a seat. The conductor was saying that during the season there will be more trains after games to try to compensate for all the people
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,ugotpandaowned,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:06:18 2015 UTC,I didn't go to the game but I've taken the LIRR back from 2 events at the Barclays and it took about 2 hours each time from Atlantic Ave. to Seaford.
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,coupdemon,2,Thu Jul 9 15:11:18 2015 UTC,Must have been a long time between transfers at Jamaica.  I take the LIRR from Atlantic all the time.  2 hours is inordinate.
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,jackwoww,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:46 2015 UTC,Same here. I regularly take the train from Atlantic to babylon(which is farther and has more stops than the trip to seaford) and I don't think it's ever taken me more than an hour and a half(except in a few rare occasions)  I wonder what happened to this guy?
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,Madlameusername,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't look up the schedule, I imagine, or didn't go to the right track for the earlier transfer."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,jackwoww,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"Coming in was fine, I took the train daily for High School and the last few semesters for my commute so I'm used to it, it's easy to get there from the stop and there's stuff like a Cold Stone and the Shake Shack around for before the game. Didn't get to survey the bars in the area but someone else probably is ""in the know"" about that.   Getting home was a bit of a pain in the ass, the train didn't open all of its doors and was a bit slow to leave but we had to transfer at Jamaica anyway and after that it was just business as usual.   Overall, it was a bit annoying waiting to come home but I can only assume they'll figure that out as the season approaches."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,nassaucoliseum,2,Thu Jul 9 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about looking into opening a bar, kinda like the Ranger fans have Flying Puck by MSG, but for Islander fans near Barclays. Just wondering if any Isle fans would be interested in the idea before I pursue it?"
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,marktical,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I love the idea and I'm sure there would be other people interested but it's gotta be the kinda bar that can operate year-round instead of just before Isles games, know what I mean? Isles themed, yeah, but good enough of a bar to draw a crowd no matter when."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,nassaucoliseum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely, the main idea was a bar for Islander fans to come chill, watch the games, hang out before and after, get some food, but like you said, it would have to be a bar people want to come to in the offseason and when theres no games. Still hammering out the specifics but I'm really thinking about pursuing it. Islander fans need a place they can come to and just hang out together. Business wise, you're right, it would need to be an overall good spot though"
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,marktical,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I know exactly nothing about running a bar so alas, I can't give much advice but as someone who likes to drink, as long as the drinks are stiff and the prices aren't bad (and it's not a Rags bar) there are things I care a lot more about than what team they root for. I know Bar None, a favorite bar of mine, is technically an Ohio State bar and I hate the Buckeyes but love that damn bar.   So making an explicitly Isles bar would be a great idea, it's just a matter of figuring out how you want to run your bar and then putting up a bunch of Isles shit."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,nassaucoliseum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:28 2015 UTC,I'm worried about the return train. I really do hope they have a proper amount. Does the LIRR change the schedule with events like this or do they just add more trains without really explaining where they are going?
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,Eiramasil919,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"Going was fantastic, I was nervous about changing at Jamaica honestly.  Coming home, the Atlantic Terminal train wasn't bad but the Ronkonkona LIRR train was super packed.  I don't think they realized the turnout for the scrimmage.  After a few stops we got seats and it was fine.  Only little over and hour in commute.  Last time I took a direct train from Babylon to Atlantic Terminal and was 2 hours of horrible.  This commute was great, especially if they put more trains on for game days."
NewYorkIslanders,3coloe,gotroot801,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"I went to both pre-season games at BC and the scrimmage this week. Since it was a weekday I tried to get the first train out (10:36pm Hempstead train). Only about half the cars were open until maybe 3 minutes before the train was set to leave, and those cars were packed to the gills. TBH, I don't think the LIRR expected such a crowd for a rookie scrimmage in July.  For both preseason games I headed to a bar and had a drink and took a later train, which is the smarter move and will probably be what I do going forward, school night or not."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,dontcallmepeenut,7,Thu Jul 9 04:38:07 2015 UTC,He showed really well. He is big and fast kind of reminds me a little of Ovi.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,DGGuitars,5,Thu Jul 9 05:00:25 2015 UTC,He also had some great assists and could handle the puck nicely for being big.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,leeber27,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:33 2015 UTC,Big? Are you sure you're thinking of the right kid?   Ho sang is 6' 170lbs...
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,DGGuitars,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:01 2015 UTC,Well man on the ice he looked big compared to the others.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Fdnyc,4,Fri Jul 10 05:11:48 2015 UTC,When he was on the ice he was a total bolt of lightning. Made things happen
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,TheMelroseDiner,2,Thu Jul 9 05:22:58 2015 UTC,Does anyone know where I could find the stats to the game?
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,FinalxFlash,2,Thu Jul 9 10:56:05 2015 UTC,Who is this Anas player? From what I saw very nice scoring touch
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Eiramasil919,3,Thu Jul 9 11:20:22 2015 UTC,"I went to the game with my 11 year old son, and thought that guys name was just hilarious.  And then, after he scored his second goal, a large group of guys started chanting A-nus A-nus.  My kid was in hysterics and now wants an Anas jersey."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,FinalxFlash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Lol I noticed the humor as well, but he looked impressive maybe in 2 years he could become a valuable asset"

NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,FinalxFlash,3,Thu Jul 9 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"I heard the announcer say in his first two years with Quinnipiac has led the team with goals, very comforting. Also colberg played well and indrasis was all over the ice"
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Salacondor,2,Thu Jul 9 11:42:03 2015 UTC,The people next to me (and me) almost got kicked out of the arena for pounding on the glass. A women from Barclays came down and said that we couldn't pound on the glass then another guy came down and gave us a hand signal that we could. Very fun game to watch.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Pepperpwni,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:32 2015 UTC,The people that work there need to adjust to hockey culture. I sense some tension but feel it will dissolve over time.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Salacondor,2,Thu Jul 9 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yea, this sort of game will work out the kinks."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,lighthousefisherman,2,Thu Jul 9 17:03:09 2015 UTC,Yeah when I went to a devils preseason there they were letting people walk back up their seats while the puck was still in play. By around 2nd period they finally got the hang of it.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Eiramasil919,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had the same feeling for the last pre season game as well.  Hopefully it will all work out."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,LoneLegislator,2,Thu Jul 9 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"He definitely tried a bit too hard to show off early on. But having a kid with a chip on his shoulder can be good. Once he settled down, his vision was phenomenal. Can't take too much out of a rookie scrimmage, but interested to see what his point totals are back in Niagara this year."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,patio_himself,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:36 2015 UTC,Meshed nicely with Beauvillier
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Eiramasil919,2,Thu Jul 9 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"I've been singing it all day, lol!  He was great.  Pulock was fantastic and the Leduc guy was just gigantic!  Bouvillier was able to get plays going."
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,iruber1337,2,Thu Jul 9 17:41:31 2015 UTC,His explosive first strides through the neutral zone is going to make him amazing at the transitional game.
NewYorkIslanders,3cn2qk,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Thu Jul 9 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"Still harken back to the stories of scouts forgetting who McDavid was when he was on his team. Or the scout who had to be escorted off teh draft floor cause he was having a meltdown do to him wasting of god-given talent. Good talent doesn't draw reactions like that. Only the take-your-breathe-away generational ones.   If Garth got him to buy into the system, Isles have themselves a guy who can match McDavid. Last night wasn't even him at top gear and he created enough high end chances where White could have won despite being vastly outplayed and outmatched.  Big time believer, and if your into analytics, a few of the stat guys confirmed what everyone saw, he tilts the ice and gains the zone with ease.   Very much on the Ho-Sang bandwagon. Barzal is technically the better prospect, and the more easy to project, but Ho-Sang is as talented of a player Isles have drafted since LaFontaine. The instincts he has with the puck, going into traffic, you can't teach that. And the Isles somehow got the kid to backcheck and utilize linemates, the two points that had many saying no matter how talented he'd never be a fit at the NHL level."

NewYorkIslanders,3clys3,ArtyThePoopie,2,Thu Jul 9 18:45:14 2015 UTC,You could also say it was 5-3. That was the score of the game. Blue then won each skill competition making it 8-3.

Would be very surprised if he did this year but IIRC its his second camp so Isles have him on radar.   Also other LI kid, Schiavo, had by far the best Shootout move/goal. When they said ""nation's top roller hockey player"" made sense, one of my friend busts shit out like that a lot when we would fuck around in the street/at rink."

He's really the only one I've seen on either squad with a real nose for the net and willing to get down and in.  ETA: Him skating in behind Williams after the whistle didn't impress.  He's gonna get his ass laid out if he tries that in a real game."

NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,DLun203,3,Wed Jul 8 18:16:04 2015 UTC,I posted this in another thread but figured I'd get a better response by posting on the main page.   My grandfather passed away and so my cousins and I divvied up his massive pin collection. I found this one and had to have it. I don't see Nystrom or Gillies on it so it must be from the late 80s? Any ideas?
NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,bageloid,3,Wed Jul 8 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-York-Islanders-Chase-Promotional-Hall-of-Fame-Collectable-Pin-with-card-SGA/321781917016?_trksid=p2047675.c100011.m1850&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D32222%26meid%3D9406f8d32a7e4fb99228b2b0212d393b%26pid%3D100011%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D321675330744  A link if you want to buy 10 more in packaging, no hint on date though."
NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,bass_n_treble,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"Nystrom's number isn't there yet.  Likely 1993 or 1994.    Potvin's number was retired first in 1992, and Malakhov changed his number 23 to 92 in the 1994-95 season if I remember correctly."
NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,mcbordes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"I like the thought process but this isn't retired numbers, it's Islanders Hall of Fame.  Trottier's number was retired in 2001 so basing it off of Nystrom's retired number date is not correct.  I remember getting this at a game and was born 1991.  If I think it was closer to 1998 give or take.  Right around the time they changed the logo back.  In fact, I want to say it was the 1996-97 season because I think they gave a lot of pins out that 25th season."
NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,mcbordes,2,Fri Jul 10 02:45:47 2015 UTC,It's from the post fisherman pre-Yashin era.  I was at the game that it was given out.
NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,trainwreck72,2,Fri Jul 10 02:55:11 2015 UTC,I have one of those.  It's most likely from the late 1990's when nobody wanted to go to the games and we got to go for free most of the time.

NewYorkIslanders,3cku2q,mcbordes,2,Wed Jul 8 19:56:51 2015 UTC,Arbour's 1500 was added in 2006 (or 2007).  Before that it was the 739.
NewYorkIslanders,3cmru1,Knight_Of_Cups_,6,Thu Jul 9 02:59:42 2015 UTC,Here is my recap of the scrimmage.   Ho-Sang is Jesus Christ. Ho-Sang is the Prophet Muhammad. Ho-Sang is the Moschiach. Ho-Sang is Benjamin Franklin. Ho-Sang invented the Internet.  Ho-Sang killed Hitler. Ho-Sang conquered Sub-Saharan Africa before reaching the age of 14. Ho-Sang discovered America and the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine. Ho-Sang cured the ebola virus.
NewYorkIslanders,3cmru1,mattymonkees,5,Thu Jul 9 03:30:35 2015 UTC,TL;DR Ho-Sang played well
NewYorkIslanders,3cmru1,Salacondor,3,Thu Jul 9 04:26:30 2015 UTC,Agreed.

NewYorkIslanders,3ckub3,isleshocky77,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:47 2015 UTC,This is true. I will make back a quarter of my season ticket cost by selling one ranger game.
NewYorkIslanders,3ck13m,nassaucoliseum,4,Wed Jul 8 14:49:39 2015 UTC,I was supposed to go but due to a death in the family I had to give the ticket to a friend.   My grandfather passed away. He lived in Wantagh for 50 years and saw the Isles in the glory days of the 80s. Poppop was an avid pin collector. We divvied his pin collection yesterday and I managed to snag this bad boy. I'll keep it forever and wear it to every game from now on.  Edit: No Nystrom and no Gillies so it must be an old pin. Anyone know how old? Is this a question for the main page?
NewYorkIslanders,3ck13m,DLun203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"If it's okay with you I'll say a prayer for your Grandfather, I'm sorry to hear about that. Hopefully the Isles can win it this year for him.  And I definitely would post it on the subreddit as its own topic, more people would see it and be likely to able to identify it, plus it's a great pin that deserves to be seen."

NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,bentchamber,5,Tue Jul 7 22:00:24 2015 UTC,Anyone comes through center ice with their head down will have to answer to the jumbotron
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:21:12 2015 UTC,its only upsetting for people in the top rows looking down. it won't be noticeable to lower deck seats or people watching on TV
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,viewless25,-4,Tue Jul 7 22:20:21 2015 UTC,There is no way they are leaving it that low for the season. What a horrible thing if they do. You will miss ever single center ice faceoff in the upper decks!
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,kenlane,11,Tue Jul 7 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you guys are kidding, so I'll just entertain you. The jumbo isn't raised in these pictures. Like, at all. You couldn't fit the players underneath for a face off where it's at in these pics. Not in the way even for the upper decks when it's raised.   Sorry if you guys were being ironic, so whoosh I guess, if so."
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,Netslanders,3,Tue Jul 7 23:17:42 2015 UTC,I was assuming extreme sarcasm but like /u/Netslanders said the jumbotron was only a few feet off the ice at the time of the photos. There was a lot of work/setup going on while for tomorrow's scrimmage while I was there.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,kenlane,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:30 2015 UTC,That's what I thought until I read the other comment. I guess I'm just a little too dense for the internet today
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,DGGuitars,5,Wed Jul 8 00:28:42 2015 UTC,I was in the city today and stopped by the Barclays Center on my way home to get a view from my seats since the upper sections will be closed off at the scrimmage tomorrow.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,rjr31,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:57 2015 UTC,Would you suggest 214? Looks interesting since I cannot afford lower bowl im looking for good upper seats.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,DGGuitars,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:29 2015 UTC,After finally seeing them in person I can't tell you how happy I am I chose that section. For what they cost compared to other seats I really do think they are the best seats for the money. 218 is pretty much the same as 214 as well.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,Salacondor,3,Tue Jul 7 20:16:48 2015 UTC,I got a half season plan in section 219 because they seemed to be the best value. Haven't seen our seats yet but I'll take your word for it!
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,Salacondor,0,Tue Jul 7 21:57:08 2015 UTC,Still man stub hub prices there are $60 to $90 its to much but those are like the only seats. Im 21 I cant afford that.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,jokesonjokes,2,Tue Jul 7 20:39:21 2015 UTC,Once we get a little close to the start of the season I'm going to try to sell about a third of my tickets. I plan on offering to people on here first at not much more than what I paid before dumping onto StubHub.
NewYorkIslanders,3cgrgx,DGGuitars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:45:32 2015 UTC,Do you have single tickets or multiple per game?

Actually if you're in a corner or end section you can't even really tell. If you're in a corner or end section the Isles shoot twice on it's kind of nice because it's closer to you."

NewYorkIslanders,3cfp3x,_stee,3,Tue Jul 7 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Half season tickets are $10 a game more expensive than full season tickets. The weekday and weeknight plans are more expensive per game and as everyone is freaking out about, individual ticket prices are way more expensive than any plan. It's basically set up to make you buy some sort of plan"
NewYorkIslanders,3cfp3x,sennaone,0,Tue Jul 7 17:54:19 2015 UTC,well thats a pretty shitty plan . I know of a lot of brokers who bought up entire sections and plan on pricing below what box office will sell them for. So Sclapers will win this round.
NewYorkIslanders,3cfp3x,bageloid,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:55 2015 UTC,They only let you buy 4 seats per person.

NewYorkIslanders,3cd7ml,Salacondor,5,Tue Jul 7 00:18:11 2015 UTC,Hey guys. Yeah we are doing fewer podcasts in summer due to lack of things to talk about on a consistent basis and Shane's schedule (he does play by play for SI Yankees). I will be sure to announce here in advance before we go on. This week we are tentatively planning on Thurs so we can recap the prospect scrimmage and are working on plans to have a live interactive show at a bar in Brooklyn. That will be tougher to pull off but just an example of what we are thinking heading into next season. Thanks for all the support!
NewYorkIslanders,3cd7ml,tazgraz19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:38:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your answer, do you have any idea of when the piece about Brooklyn will be out?"
NewYorkIslanders,3cd7ml,viewless25,2,Tue Jul 7 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"I thought they were Wednesday? Anyway, I think they said they're doing fewer episodes this summer"

NewYorkIslanders,3cd7ml,tazgraz19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"Just realized, couldn't be Wednesday because they are going to be at the scrimmage, unless they did a podcast with a crow before or after the game which would be so cool."
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,fabutzio,5,Mon Jul 6 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I just went to stubhub. Isles Rags in December is going for $160ish."
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,jokesonjokes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:44:49 2015 UTC,Those are STH selling tickets. Tickets that were 25 bucks for me are selling for $250 after fees via TicketMaster. So whoever is selling it for $160 is making up to $135 in profit.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,bageloid,0,Mon Jul 6 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Pre or post fees? But that is what I said to my brother... ""Face"" has become more expensive than what the secondary market has ever commanded. Even playoff tickets were considerably cheaper. Wouldn't want to even think what playoff tickets would be this year... hopefully they dont make some ""Diamond plus"" bs tier when that comes along. I hope my rep is wrong but would be surprised."
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,rkingisles,6,Mon Jul 6 16:47:37 2015 UTC,Price is everything included on StubHub.  This is also pretty standard for teams across the League. Isles were one of the last to implement it.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,DGGuitars,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:43 2015 UTC,Just funny that the listed ticket on SH is cheaper than what face is because who would have guess it would have been like a +300% increase to just get in the door!
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,Justwritingstuff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:18:46 2015 UTC,what kills me is lower bowl tickets are minimum $80 . When I was able to get two tickets for $40 from STH and get awesome seats no matter where I was in the colli.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,aaronwe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:00:34 2015 UTC,Just funny that the listed ticket on SH is cheaper than what face is   I've been getting my tickets from stubhub for years now because the listed tickets on SH are always cheaper than what you get via the ticket office.  It's been that way for as long as I can remember.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,bstrait37,3,Tue Jul 7 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"The Mets used to do, and probably still do, Yankee, Washington, and Better teams are more expensive than like, Philly or really bad teams.."

NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,McArctic,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Same, thought I could use the presale to offset the cost of my season tickets, this pricing structure will kill any secondhand market. The only ones that will be going for less than face are season ticket holder seats."

NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,NHL_nutjob_19,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:08:35 2015 UTC,Idk I'm hoping it helps the second hand market.  Season ticket holders should be able to charge more than usual and buyers still get a huge discount off box office.  I guess we'll see

NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,bageloid,0,Mon Jul 6 20:40:45 2015 UTC,So basically they're trying to price us out the way MSG does at not just rangers games but every other event there. That's totally awesome good job Barclays! Ever think of the college students who can only go to like a few games a season while home on break and can't afford to pay their asses in ticket prices?
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,NHL_nutjob_19,8,Mon Jul 6 19:58:56 2015 UTC,No.  They're a business.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,Waveridr85,2,Mon Jul 6 21:03:01 2015 UTC,My biggest concern about moving to Barclays was that it was going to become too corporate of an atmosphere with the high prices to go with it. Sad to see to be honest but I guess that is what comes with having a better team in a better arena
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,DLun203,2,Tue Jul 7 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"That corporate atmosphere is why they were able to afford Grabo, Kule, Leddy and Boychuk."
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,lsp2005,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:34:49 2015 UTC,This is true...I will admit that
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,bageloid,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:58:23 2015 UTC,I'm all for it. If they can make the money we can afford better players and better merchandise etc
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,DGGuitars,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:42:22 2015 UTC,I don't think the Isles are struggling to afford a cap ceiling. And merchandise doesn't mean shit to me when I have to pay triple/quadruple what I paid at the coliseum.
NewYorkIslanders,3cbgr7,Madlameusername,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:33:38 2015 UTC,So we can get isles salt and pepper shakers too? I would rather have reasonably priced tickets.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,viewless25,13,Tue Jul 7 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"Guy just led the most dominant team in juniors to a championship. Put up what, 40-50 goals?   Isles have 13 players under 1-way contracts.  He can't play in the AHL till next year. So the guy who says he'll get called up for injuries is dead wrong or is a prophet predicting the demise of many, many players.   Put the three together, and you'll get why most fans say he's a year away."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,Stonecipher_LaVache,-3,Tue Jul 7 02:36:39 2015 UTC,This.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,johnzanussi,4,Tue Jul 7 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Our future doesn't have to mean next year. The isles have the luxury of letting kids develop properly, unlike in the past when they get rushed up and ruined. Bailey was rushed because of money issues, and everyone considers him a disappointment. Strome and Nelson were allowed to develop properly, and look where they are now. Have some patience, we have a great future ahead of us."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,entropism,4,Tue Jul 7 04:30:14 2015 UTC,Dal Colle doesn't need to be playing this year. He still needs to add on some weight and fine tune his game. They'll treat him just like they did with Strome. Bring him along slowly and let him dominate lower competition while working on parts of the game he can improve.  He'll start for us in the 2016-2017 season and will be on the first line in no time.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,Undercover_Mop,3,Tue Jul 7 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"Forward log jam in nhl.  We still have grabner as a healthy scratch right now.  So if dal colle makes the team he's gotta play, so who else sits?  I'm hoping worst case scenario he plays his 9 games and they evaluate from there."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,zeile33,2,Tue Jul 7 02:06:54 2015 UTC,I'd say a mixture of both. In my opinion the only way he cracks the lineup is if he impresses THAT much. He manages to work on his skating and size so much this summer that he comes in a kills it in camp/pre-season and pretty much forces a spot from someone. But if he shows that he would be a bottom 9 player then no I don't see him making the squad this year.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,leeber27,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"That's not a lack of development though that's literally just a log jam. If he'd have to impress that much it's because there's so many people ahead of him. He was drafted last year, the fact we're having this conversation shows he's progressing probably ahead of schedule. Strome was a much more touted prospect and these convos were barely had."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,FoxFlex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe I didn't explain what I was trying to say well enough. It's not like strome in the fact that when strome was coming up; we needed someone on the roster and instead of turning to FA, we signed him. For MDC, we don't NEED anyone else on the roster (he doesn't need to fill a spot that would have been filled with a FA; unlike stromes case).  Basically; unlike strome (who had a spot available to him over a free agent), MDC has to TAKE a roster spot away from someone. In order for him to do that he has to prove that he is deserving of that spot over someone else.  If you've seen any of his recent games (I managed to catch the memorial cup on TV) he really needs to work on his skating; which is something that really breaks someone out of the prospect spot... And 190 is looking good for weight, but if he could reach 200 that would be awesome.  So like I said, he's gotta take a roster spot by showing he can; unlike strome who had a spot avaible (not to say he didn't deserve it cause he totally did). However, with his current development it'll be hard for him to do so."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,leeber27,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him play sooner than later, but I'm gonna say they're not gonna take chances by starting him. The islanders are now a contending team with a full forward roster, and then some. We have Lee who can be a more than competent left wing for JT this upcoming season. Dal Colle might get a few call-ups just because, but they'd probably be games against bottom-10 teams to see how he could do somewhere against opposing skill level that's between AHL and mid-tier nhl. If anything, he'll get a couple games just for a sample-size skill evaluation but you'll probably see him on 2nd or 3rd line."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"Log jam. Isles have 13 solid forwards (Grabner trade discussions aside) along with a few guys in Bridgeport (Quine, Halmo, Petrov + their 6-player frenzy they recently had) that could easily fill in a slot due to injury. Dal Colle is another year away, Ho-Sang 2, Barzal 3. Looking at the current team, I believe Bailey, Nielsen, Grabner + 1 more will have to be moved to make room for them. Don't see Kulemin or Grabovski being moved until at least the last year of their deal (2017-2018)."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,grud315,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"He's at least one year away.  Fans can't have it both ways: either they hate accelerating a guy (see: Bailey, Josh) or they hate ""waiting too long"" (see: Strome, Ryan).  Funny how all that turned out, by the way: I saw the Sabres waved Cody Hodgson.  Tyler Myers regressed after a dynamite first year.  Luke Schenn also regressed after a great beginning to his career.  Filatov washed out of the league.  Kyle Beach never made it.  And yet here we are, and if you look at Bailey's HERO chart, it looks like he's become a really nice player.  I don't know how much better he'd be if they took their time with him.  Plus he's on a great contract.  Moral of the story?  I would trust what management is doing, whatever they decide to do-- but the most likely thing with Dal Colle is that it'll be Opening Day '16 at the absolute earliest."
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,mattymonkees,0,Tue Jul 7 17:17:10 2015 UTC,When someone gets injured he'll come up for a few games. Maybe we'll make a trade and he'll come up. He could surprise the living hell out of everyone at training camp and outperform the rest of the team. If there's an okie/grabner trade we may see him up sooner than later. Too early to tell.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,islesandpizza,3,Tue Jul 7 02:09:35 2015 UTC,Not an option. We have to decide in the first few days of the season if we want him in Brooklyn or Oshawa.
NewYorkIslanders,3cd9me,islesandpizza,2,Tue Jul 7 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"My bad, I totally misunderstood where in the system he was."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,beLIeveinNassau,14,Mon Jul 6 02:09:22 2015 UTC,The bashing this guys gets boils my blood. Some of this fan base expect that every person on the team needs to be a top pair guy. I would take hickey as a bottom pair d man over a lot of teams 5 or 6 guy.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,LooseSeal-,11,Mon Jul 6 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"Its his size. ""smurf"" ""midget"" ect. Funny thing is, Hickey is good at avoiding and absorbing contact. Hell, his first year here Big Byuff tried to Bum Rush him at full steam and Hickey stood him and knocked him on his ass.   Size doesn't matter as much as armchair fans think it does. Center of gravity, positioning, quick feet, and leverage do. If size mattered as much as these ""fans"" thought, Theo Fleury wouldn't have been a demon on skates. Steve Webb couldn't have smote the soul of every Leaf in the 2002 playoffs.   It's like when people get on Kessel for being ""fat"" and looking out of shape. Dude blazes by 99% of the league as is and was tops in Leafs fitness testing, maybe more players should crush hotdogs and have some pudge. Maybe then they could stop the guy from scoring at will in transition."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Jul 6 03:08:20 2015 UTC,Not to mention he throws the body around and is super durable. He also was a 4th overall pick his draft year so he clearly has been able to dominate at least in his age group.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,LooseSeal-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously! When does this guy miss games? You'd think if he was too small to play he'd, y'know, get hurt once in a while. He engages people in battles, ties them up effectively (may not crush them, but he slows even big guys to a crawl along the boards because he keeps his feet moving and lowers his body. Often you'll see his ass is above his head in a triangle position, thats leverage. Eaton used to do the same thing alot), and drops a mean hip-check in transition.   Hickey rules. Glad Isles value him, speaks volumes about how the Isles evaluate players."

NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,greenglassdoor5,13,Wed Jul 8 19:08:02 2015 UTC,I don't understand the shit that Hickey or Bailey get on a constant basis.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,cadoin,4,Mon Jul 6 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"Bailey was a huge let down. Pretty easy to understand. Guy was drafted top 10 before Tavares was drafted, & just put up a career high in points of like 40 this past year  Hickey however is a solid 2nd 3rd pair defenseman. Or at least has turned into one."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,hardcorelegend43,3,Mon Jul 6 06:17:27 2015 UTC,Bailey was also thrown in to the big club at a young age. He never had time to develop in the minors. Maybe it's just taking more time for him to develop up here
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,DancesWithCanoes,-3,Mon Jul 6 09:39:11 2015 UTC,Same with Tavares but he turned out fine.  I don't buy that excuse.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,jackwoww,12,Mon Jul 6 11:44:07 2015 UTC,Tavares is a bit different
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,DancesWithCanoes,5,Mon Jul 6 12:14:05 2015 UTC,Come on now...
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,bpmorris92,0,Mon Jul 6 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"No one has their own opinion, everyone circle jerks the same bull shit over and over.  It's more hip to criticize your team than appreciate a half point per game player."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,mcbordes,7,Mon Jul 6 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand all the hate he gets. He'll never be a top pair guy, but that's fine. No team has 6 defenseman that could be in the top pair. You have to have guys for all roles. 1st pair to 3rd. Hickey was the fourth overall pick in his draft year and while he's not an allstar, he's solid and fills a roll the isles need filled. Glad he's coming back."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,PoorFlory01,4,Mon Jul 6 02:21:29 2015 UTC,They picked him up off waivers too.  It's not like they gave anything up to get him.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,mcbordes,2,Mon Jul 6 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"For whatever they did in the regular season, Hickey and Strait both stepped up big in the playoffs and did well considering all the injuries we had at the blue line"
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,DeBlaz07,4,Mon Jul 6 02:14:06 2015 UTC,"I am fine with the contract we offered him, but I think it is important to note the faults that drew ire from fans last year.    He constantly shoots into the first blocker in the offensive zone, which often results in muffed opportunities and possibly worse. To resolve this I hope he talks to Johnny who is a master at shooting off target to avoid blocks, with players like Tavares, KO, and Lee you have to let them battle on the boards sometimes to extend possession. Also deflections are cool. His physicality is good at times, but he needs to select when to be physical more carefully. There are too many times that he goes for the body against a breaking Nash-type player and gets tossed like a rag doll. Hickey is a solid skater, so he needs to use his speed to aide him in physical mismatches. This one is a positive type criticism, I'd like to see him skate into the o-zone more often. As previously mentioned he isn't much of a threat from the point, but he is a very solid skater and the vast majority of his successes offensively come from him penetrating. I'm thinking he held himself from going deep because Viz would often do that, but then when Strait is in he should take that role and let Strait hold the line. It also may have to do with what Cappy says. There were some games where it seemed like no d-men were activating and those games were against high caliber teams so I wonder if Cappy try's to play cautious at times.   Like I said I think his contract is fine and he is a 5-6 caliber defenseman, but he should have to produce to maintain that spot. He got three years, but players like Pelech are going to be pushing for a lefty roster spot well before his contract is up.   Also there is the possibility we sign Ehrhoff which is an additional challenger to both CdH and Hickey.  Most of this applies to CdH as well, he needs to find some level of consistency. He seemingly regressed this year, and he did so while paired with Hammer who had probably his best season. He needs to be challenged because Hammer deserves better. I hope CdH finds his 2013-2014 form, but the rumors of off the ice distractions are disheartening. This is why we need Ehrhoff, he signed a 1 year deal last season and he underachieved partially due to injury so I think he will be less expensive and we can get him for a short term. He can pressure our guys in a positive way so we have healthy competition."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,isles27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:31:46 2015 UTC,What are you hearing about Ehrhoff?
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,Chrismercy,2,Mon Jul 6 10:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think he waits to pick a side until Oduya settles somewhere. I think every team in on Oduya wants Ehrhoff as a consolation, the Blackhawks being the most appealing destination. Chicago has to move another contract though before they can get anything done.  Ehrhoff is only really valuable to us if he will sign a 1 year deal, if he ends up getting more years from anywhere else it isn't worth it since he certainly isn't a permanent solution and our free agency next year is going to be wild."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,isles27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:44:12 2015 UTC,Where is this that we sign Ehrnhoff? Are you saying that there's just a possibility to sign him? Cause in that case there's a possibility to sign anyone... I doubt Ernhoff would come here nor would we take him after he stiffed us a few years back.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,leeber27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"Also there is the possibility we sign Ehrhoff which is an additional challenger to both CdH and Hickey.   Yeah I said there is a possibility. He fits our needs and we can offer him a reasonable one year deal whereas some of his other suitors are going to low-ball him hardcore to try and fit him in their cap situation ie. Chicago, Boston.  As for personal reasons, we've been rejected before and had players come here eventually anyway. The situation is also entirely different now and we have at the very least a little more appeal."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,isles27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Chicago and Boston wouldn't take him... He also wouldnt be looking for a one year deal. And like I said I doubt the team would take him back, they don't let grudges go that quick.   If we're taking about possibilities, let's talk about someone that's a better fit."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,leeber27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"Nobody looks for a one year deal, but he signed one last season to play with the Pens. He didn't have a type of year that would up his bargaining price too much, so yes a one year deal could be on the table.   Ehrhoff is the best fit for our team right now based on available players.  Maybe there are hard feelings but that doesn't change the fact that he is a good option.   If he isn't your favorite player then fine, people are allowed to have varying opinions."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,isles27,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:07:11 2015 UTC,I'm not saying I have anything against him - nor would I have a problem if we signed him. I'm just saying he's not looking for a one year deal on a team he already said no to in a game where hard feelings stick around way too easily. If we're going with the logic that anyone will sign a one year deal then our best bet is Oduya or Shultz.
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,leeber27,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"What? Ehrhoff could end up taking another short term deal. It happened last year. That plus the type of season he had makes his likelihood of taking another short deal higher than other free agents.   Whether or not he wants to play with us, who knows. The precedent has been set that players and GM's can overcome personal differences to work together.  If it happens great, if not oh well."

NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,FinalxFlash,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"he just takes too many risks that lead to opposing chances - tries to do too much.  When the rest of the D is solid, these giveaways are glaring, so we bash.  What I am starting to realize is that these mistakes are coming from his being young and will improve over time.  as a 5-6, I am now coming to see his real value."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,Skooby14,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with Hickey is that he is a 7th defenseman on a good team but is sometimes relied upon to play top 4 minutes on ours when he just can do it. All of his advanced stats (which I'm not a fan of by the way, and how anyone can say he was our best defenseman last year because of them is beyond me) look good because he plays mostly on the bottom pairing. But as soon as he gets more minutes, his flaws come out even more.  The bottom line is this. He is a decent guy to have around as a 7th defenseman but his size and strength really holds him back a lot. He gets outmuscled in the corners, gets taken out of play when he gets checked and turns the puck over in crucial situations. He regressed last season and I don't think he was worth the contract he got."
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,Undercover_Mop,2,Mon Jul 6 06:36:36 2015 UTC,He's better than a 7th.  He can easily play a bottom pairing
NewYorkIslanders,3c98qr,hockeycrazy033,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:59:50 2015 UTC,"I said 7th on a good team. I just don't see him playing top 6 minutes regularly on a perennial playoff team or Cup contender.   Also, I don't get why we should have him in our top 6 when he is a perfect example of why we had trouble at the end of last season and in the playoffs. We're in a tough division with physical teams and last season showed that we don't have enough size in our lineup. I would much rather have someone who isn't going to be pushed around easily than someone who can be pushed around and have it cost the team."
NewYorkIslanders,3c628g,cartun1,5,Sun Jul 5 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which (recent) post season coliseum goal is my Favorite between this goal, Tavares game winning game 4 goal against the Penguins, or Kulemins game 6 goal. My god that place was special when great things happened in there."
NewYorkIslanders,3c628g,xjared45,2,Sun Jul 5 07:20:20 2015 UTC,Kulemin's goal was amazing. I don't think I even saw it go in because everyone was looking to see if Tavares was alright then the place just erupted

Nothing more you can ask from a player.   Wish he didn't go to Philly, but atleast if he plays he will get to stomp on Pitt a couple times a year ;D"
NewYorkIslanders,3c0sx3,isles27,5,Fri Jul 3 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"It's better cmac got out of rotation hell with us. It's less money we have to spend, a chance he will get more nhl ice time, and it clears roster clutter for our main roster. Can't have too many Grabners/Boultons lurking in the press box."
NewYorkIslanders,3c0sx3,lighthousefisherman,2,Fri Jul 3 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"Very true, it's a shame to see him go. I'd prefer him playing on the Sound tigers than on phillys farm team tho. Time will tell"

NewYorkIslanders,3c052v,viewless25,3,Fri Jul 3 17:47:56 2015 UTC,That's an isles thing. Throughout our history we've been a heavy home grown talent team. We don't buy players cough rags cough
NewYorkIslanders,3c052v,leeber27,4,Fri Jul 3 18:24:52 2015 UTC,If you know the rangers suck and in 94 they bought the cup...
NewYorkIslanders,3c052v,Eiramasil919,2,Fri Jul 3 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"not to take anything away from Garth but I feel like having as many 1st round picks as the isles have had in the past few years makes player retention much easier than a team like, let's say Pittsburg for example, who usually pick later in each round."
NewYorkIslanders,3c052v,Justwritingstuff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"isn't that the point with lower tier teams getting the better draft picks though? giving them the boost needed for a future advancement in the league's ranks. not sure what you're trying to point out here really, as if garth's accomplishments these last few years are somehow less worth because he's taking advantage of the rules set up for the rest of the league's teams as well? no hate or anthing here, i've been as much of a critic of garth as anyone, but i'm legitimately curious what you're trying to say with your comment.  and just look at the oilers, they've had far better draft picks than us these last few years, and yet they're still stuck in the bottom while we've finally become a true competitor."
NewYorkIslanders,3c052v,jed1panda,2,Tue Jul 7 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"not sure what you're trying to point out here really,    that it doesn't really make sense to compare player retention to the rest of the league because the isles have been put in a position that makes it easier to retain players. I don't think its as much of an accomplishment because they're essentially set up for success in this particular example. I mean, to me, it is less of an accomplishment.  I mean if you and I were both GM's and I got to pick in the top 10 for 5-6 years straight while you were picking in the high 20's for 5-6 years straight should we really be surprised if I retain/develop more of those players than you?  I'm also not sure the oilers are a good example either as I belive Theyve picked higher than us for the past 5ish years and I believe they've retained more players as well.   I think we're talking about two different things. I'm talking strictly about player retention based on draft order. You seem to be speaking about team success related to draft order if I'm not mistaken."

NewYorkIslanders,3c1b6b,lighthousefisherman,5,Fri Jul 3 21:14:46 2015 UTC,He will probably sign a vet minimum contract when the off season is almost over. He is apparently one of the best guys in the locker room and he knows his role. He is scratched every night so that some of the younger guys can play in the AHL.
NewYorkIslanders,3c1b6b,ugotpandaowned,2,Fri Jul 3 23:24:55 2015 UTC,I hope he retires and works for the team in some capacity. Everything I've heard about him is how well liked he is by all the players
NewYorkIslanders,3c1b6b,IslesBeBack,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:36:08 2015 UTC,He is a UFA. Hopefully the Isles finally cut ties with him.

NewYorkIslanders,3c1b6b,ArtyThePoopie,5,Sat Jul 4 15:23:13 2015 UTC,At a $650 grand cap hit he's not exactly draining the team's cap space
NewYorkIslanders,3c1b6b,leeber27,3,Fri Jul 3 23:52:54 2015 UTC,He was barely a million in cap... That's not a money vacuum. Learn about the cap situation/contracts before you post about it.
NewYorkIslanders,3bxh86,downtownflipped,7,Thu Jul 2 23:28:51 2015 UTC,Had my hopes on us landing him but couldn't reason with what we would have to give up to get it.  Fuck the Metro this year.

NewYorkIslanders,3bxh86,PoorFlory01,2,Fri Jul 3 13:18:45 2015 UTC,Just need to find a way to keep them to 2-3 goals against and you can reallllly work their D and bottom 6.
NewYorkIslanders,3bxh86,Geodaddi,3,Sat Jul 4 19:55:54 2015 UTC,I am a tad concerned that the two teams closest to us in the division points wise both got better and we haven't done much. I'm not being impatient but just a little concerned.
NewYorkIslanders,3bxh86,IslesMetsJets44,6,Fri Jul 3 00:58:04 2015 UTC,One thing a lot of people overlook is a majority of our team are pretty damn good rookies and young I think average aged of 24? The isles will just get better and better no worries. When it comes down to the grind we will see how the others do.
NewYorkIslanders,3bxh86,DGGuitars,3,Fri Jul 3 12:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think we have to look at this as we are really depending on strome, nelson, lee to have big strides. Remember they have all been in the league for ~2 years still. Lots of room for improvement"

NewYorkIslanders,3bx8ky,viewless25,4,Thu Jul 2 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely he'll start the year in Bridgeport as our lineup is pretty solid and he's never played the NA game on NA sized rinks before.  Unless he really blows the staff away, they'll want his adjustment period to take place in the minors"
NewYorkIslanders,3bx8ky,D0UBLETH1NK,2,Fri Jul 3 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about him but I could easily see him splitting time with someone for games where we need size. Imagine him fulfilling the role of Boulton last year on the west coast trip.  Some of the pieces I read on him questioned his motivation/drive, but he should have all the motivation in the world this season to get paid."
NewYorkIslanders,3bx8ky,isles27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:24:04 2015 UTC,I hope he does. We could have a killer third line of petrov grabo and kule. His size combined with the smaller and more physical NHL could mean he'd be really effective.

NewYorkIslanders,3bw84i,FinalxFlash,5,Thu Jul 2 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone is signing Oduya for under 4 years which doesn't really work for us. Franson likely wants top pair money, but it is difficult to give him that after he self destructed post-trade. Also Franson is a righty so he'd be on our third pair for top pair money? Seems off.  Ehrhoff might be an ok idea. He had a tough year due to injuries but he is typically a productive player with good possession stats. He is 32 but signed a one year deal last year so maybe he'd be down for something similar this year."
NewYorkIslanders,3bw84i,isles27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:55:52 2015 UTC,Garth will play musical chairs again. Wait for like the 5th day of free agency and then scoop up someone who is getting nervous about not getting a deal. He waits for bargains. He will sign someone. Just give it time
NewYorkIslanders,3bw84i,Waveridr85,4,Fri Jul 3 02:13:18 2015 UTC,Would be nice but let's look at the kind of money Boychuk and Leddy got. Other top defenseman know what Garth paid for that pair. They're not gonna take a bargain deal unless for some reason they really really want to play for the Islanders/in Brooklyn. I think it'd be a better move for Garth to let Pulock and Mayfield get nhl ice time and shop okposo before the trade deadline and then move him to get us a really good defenseman later.
NewYorkIslanders,3bw84i,lighthousefisherman,3,Thu Jul 2 19:52:14 2015 UTC,Both of them are about to get insane contracts.  No thanks.

NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,zeile33,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:26:29 2015 UTC,That second line is balanced. I like this line up the most. But I think Nelson should center that second line with Kulemin and Okposo.
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,RyPhy,3,Thu Jul 2 17:29:07 2015 UTC,I pretty much agree. I think it will be:  18-91-21 86-51-84 12-29-27 17-53-15  I think Mayfield may be more ready then pulock at this point.
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,Rubberneckin,3,Thu Jul 2 12:16:45 2015 UTC,Okpuso needs to stay away From Johnnys line. I really hope Cap can see it's not anything special. Hes horrible defensively and sort of a puck hog. Hes much better suited for his own line and adds more of a threat to other teams split up.  27-91-18  21-29-12  86-51-84  CCM   2-55  3-44  Mayfeild and Pulock? Hickey as the 7?
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,tanu24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"Hickey as the 7 after they gave him a decent contract like that is a pipedream.   We all know Cappy favors vets, Hickey would have to implode to lose his spot."
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,isles27,2,Thu Jul 2 16:15:26 2015 UTC,True I like him too so i'm not upset. I think he would be solid next to Mayfeild since hes huge and hickey is more skill. Like a poor mans version of Leddy and Boychuck
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,tanu24,2,Thu Jul 2 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"Can they really play 91 27 together without having a defensively inclined third forward rounding it out. In a perfect world I suppose 18 develops his defensive skill this offseason and then they are set.  Also, for the love of God, 29 is a winger.   Perfect world scenario  27-91-18  21-51-86  12-84-29  17-53-15"
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,isles27,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:11 2015 UTC,Nelson is a Center-Winger. He can play both.
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,ZebishopREVO,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter what he is 'listed' as, if you watched last season you'd know he should be a winger. If you think Nelson should be a center that is like saying Bailey should be a center."
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,isles27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Not saying he should be a center. Just saying he can.
NewYorkIslanders,3buoal,ZebishopREVO,2,Fri Jul 3 23:34:31 2015 UTC,Am i the only one who doesn't want 51 centering the second line.  51 is a shut-down two way center.  we need offense out of the second line.  third line should be out there against the other team's best line.  here's what I like:  18-91-21; 27-29-84; 12-51-86 ( i think this is an excellent shut-down line) and of course e=mc2

Shame we didn't have the room to keep him around, but buffalo might be a good fit for him.   I'm actually really curious to see how buffalo will be in the upcoming season. They might very well be a tough team. Kane, Moulson, Ennis, Eichel, O'Reilly. I'm excited to see how their motley band of forwards will play out. They might finish in the top 20 if they get rid of Chad Johnson before he ever sets foot on the ice in their jersey."

NewYorkIslanders,3brniu,usaftoast2013,2,Wed Jul 1 18:43:21 2015 UTC,The Russian Anders Lee. Him and his coach had major disagreements and was demoted to the 4th line for most of the year. I'd assume that hurt his stats.

Can be surprisingly agile with quick stick and the ability to create plays in havoc traffic down low. Can build up some momentum straight-away. Nice shot in tight. Will do his damage in the O-zone, not noted for his defensive play and his transition game is limited (basically hope he has enough space to get going). Should translate better to NA game offensively than KHL do to smaller rinks and style of play. Skillset very similar to Lee/El Nino.  Think he starts in AHL then is used as a callup for first injury. No way Garth is clearing 2 F's to get down to 11 for him."

NewYorkIslanders,3bo973,Chrismercy,5,Tue Jun 30 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"If Lee continues to score at his 25-30 goal pace like has at all levels of hockey, its an acceptable deal. Remember, even though he's not a  transition guy he absolutely factors into puck possession and was our best (or atleast at the top, dudes numbers excellent) possession forward last year according to stats. He can do alot of little gritty grindy things, and do them exceptionally well. Good luck finding a guy that big who owns the puck in the O zone and finishes at a top 6 rate at that price.

NewYorkIslanders,3bo973,islesandpizza,-4,Wed Jul 1 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"That's a bit more than he deserves...  Healthy scratch in the playoffs?  Does any one honestly expect this guy to be as good as someone like, say, Kyle Okposo?  I certainly don't and Okposo hasn't even come close to SNIFFING a contract like that.  This is not a good signing."
NewYorkIslanders,3bo973,Lostinthemist81,5,Tue Jun 30 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much you followed the regular season, but Lee was tremendously successful when paired with Strome or Tavares. In the playoffs he was moved to a line that didn't suit his playstyle, and thus his performance suffered. Lee is physically stronger than KO is on the puck and against the boards right now. That is something that greatly benefits this team.  If Lee was never moved from the first line some would speculate that the Isles end up with home ice and a different looking series, but unfortunately KO was rushed back and created some instability and inconsistency throughout the lines.  If Pulock finally makes the squad I think the addition of his shot and Lee's strong play down low can actually reinvigorate our PP."
NewYorkIslanders,3bo973,isles27,3,Tue Jun 30 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"Kyle Okposo? Yea, I do. Kyle put up 18 goals his first full season. He only scored more goals once in his career and it was the 2013-14' season. Kyle's assists didn't reach this level either till that season as well. Factor in the fact that the kid is 6'3.. He has a pretty damn high ceiling. Plus now we have a team motivated to win and the cap has rose a bit leaving more room to play."
NewYorkIslanders,3bo973,Chrismercy,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"Correct, when JT wasn't nearly the player he is now.  Sometimes its amazing how attached so many Islanders fans get to players."
NewYorkIslanders,3bpfki,zeile33,3,Wed Jul 1 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"I think he is a decent player with some upside. The issue I see is that we will already have at least three players applying positive pressure on roster players in whomever is left out from the pool of Pulock Mayfield Strait and Pelech.   On the flip side, we ran all last year with two defensemen piloting the press box. As of right now the only obvious candidate for that role is Strait, and I'm sure that if they could the Isles would love to leave Mayfield down in Bridgeport and throw someone else in the press box, hopefully treating them significantly better than how they treated Donovan. So maybe this is that someone?   If they Donovan Mayfield then I am going to be supremely disappointed.   In the long run though Bartkowski doesn't seem to bring much to the table that Pelech isn't already representing. Good size, lefty, comfortable in defensive zone, contributions in offensive zone."
NewYorkIslanders,3bpfki,isles27,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"If we could bring him in as a cheap 7th defenseman to replace Strait than sure, but that won't happen so pass."
NewYorkIslanders,3bpfki,GoldenMarauder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:09:45 2015 UTC,There are better options for cheap D depth that fit what the Isles look for in D. Bartkowski is not good. Rather just roll Strait.

An incremental upgrade, maybe, but guy did not step up for Bruins at all. Not the D Snow is looking for based Snow's emphasis on PMD's/possession guys. Especially with the knowledge Isles just hired an analytics firm.   Of course, on the flipside, neither is Strait, whereas Donovan actually had solid numbers."
NewYorkIslanders,3bpfki,Waldo19,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"If its the Brian Strait the showed up that last 1/4 of the season and in the playoffs then sure.   For a much as I loathed him In November, Strait improved as the season progressed and gave you everything you want out of a bottom 3 defenses-man in the playoffs.  If someone beats him in camp great, it means we have improved. But I don't buy into the ""anybody but Strait.""   Strait is a known commodity and that has value. If he wins the bottom pairing coming out of camp, then so be it. If he loses the job I want it to be because somebody is genuinely better."

NewYorkIslanders,3bnhha,zeile33,2,Tue Jun 30 18:05:44 2015 UTC,cap won't be going down. It just won't increase as much as initially anticipated
NewYorkIslanders,3bnhha,zeile33,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:10:46 2015 UTC,It's possible that the Canadian dollar  goes down to .65.  Cap would have been lower this year if nhlpa didn't use the full 5% escalator.  Not sure if that comes off or not but

NewYorkIslanders,3bnb4x,lighthousefisherman,5,Tue Jun 30 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Brad Boyes? Nah. Garth doesn't double dip like that.  Semin? Possibly if Snow dumps Grabner and cant get an impact player for KO. But at 13 F'S under contract plus Petrov (whom Staple indicates Isles like a lot, will get a look), Isles need to cut before they can add. IMO Justin Williams is target numero uno upfront. CorsiGod, Cup Champ, Conn Smythe winner, and good for 40-50+ points on the rightside. Has all the elements Isles love.   But 1 year of Semin would be a big budget PAP/Boyes esque move, one that Id welcome and not discount Isles from pulling if KO is indeed being shopped."

They're around the same age and presumably in the same situation.  The Isles may believe Petrov is ready to take a legit top nine roster spot.  --Sorokin coming is a big deal.  He is still playing in the KHL, where we've seen guys not come stateside for rookie camp.  --Seeing this roster reminded me of some interesting players I temporarily forgot about amid all the draft hoopla.  Stephon Williams was basically the best goalie in college hockey this year.  I'm still very intrigued by guys like Eamon McAdam, Jesse Graham, Doyle Somerby, and Taylor Cammarata, all of whom don't have the pedigree but might turn out to add value."

NewYorkIslanders,3birah,Chrismercy,7,Mon Jun 29 16:38:26 2015 UTC,Anybody remember when Patrick Roy said Poulin would be a top goalie?
NewYorkIslanders,3birah,agentanthony,7,Mon Jun 29 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he had that potential. Many fans forget he had a very bad knee injury. In my opinion he couldn't bounce back from that and it went to his head"
NewYorkIslanders,3birah,leeber27,6,Mon Jun 29 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"He's still really young.  His downfall is that he's a head case, he's solid until he lets in the first goal and then he loses all focus, seems nervous.  Hopefully maturation will take care of that."

Plus, being Swedish I'm really biased about Oduya.. a lot of people don't really feel he's that great of a defenseman.. me included. I'd rather make a move trading for Edler or something like that if we need a Swedish d-man (which we don't!)"
NewYorkIslanders,3bjec2,blekmyr,3,Mon Jun 29 18:55:05 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting you wouldn't take OEL or Hedman on your team just because they're Swedish?

NewYorkIslanders,3bjec2,Chrismercy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:18:08 2015 UTC,To me Hickey is really valuable and we really shouldn't let him go or play as #7. I hold him as being just as good as Oduya
NewYorkIslanders,3bjec2,blekmyr,3,Mon Jun 29 21:58:59 2015 UTC,Oduya has 2 cups. Even if they were close he has more experience where we lack it the most.. playoffs. Truth be told I don't see DeHaan as a top 4 guy. My preference would be to bring in an experienced guy to play on Hammers left placing DeHaan with Mayfeild/Pulock at 5&6. Injuries are inevitable your boy Hickey would certainly find ice time.   Bottom line is we need experience next to Hammonic. 44 doesn't really bring that. Lots of times I see hammer having to take away from his game to pick up for DeHaan. Hammonic is emerging as a real offensive threat but can be all he can be next to 44.
NewYorkIslanders,3bjec2,Chrismercy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:25:34 2015 UTC,You are right. I'm not saying Hickey's perfect. I'm just saying Oduya's probably not the answer

NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,MrCopacetic,10,Sun Jun 28 15:54:58 2015 UTC,Flames are my team in the West! Good luck to you guys
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,mdonoyan,9,Sun Jun 28 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, we absolutely did!  Flames didn't do too bad themselves.  I liked Griffin, but more so because we had him, and I'm an optimist. Even for a ""big dman"" that supposedly takes longer to develop, he was far behind schedule. I still believe that size has no impact on a player's development time."
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,LooseSeal-,5,Sun Jun 28 17:31:02 2015 UTC,And not to mention he fell behind on the depth chart.. if he was still our best d prospect no way they move him. Management has more faith in pulock and mayfield at this point.
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,LooseSeal-,3,Sun Jun 28 22:53:51 2015 UTC,"As do I!  Really high on Pulock. And as all Isles fans know, Signing Leddy and Boychuk was absolutely massive!   I do still wish Griffin the best, though -- I felt he went way too early at #4, considering the rest of the talent in that draft pool. But hey, we turned him into 2 picks in a deeeep draft (Extra Es for eeemphasis)"
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,Skooby14,3,Sun Jun 28 23:05:05 2015 UTC,"True. He may end up being a great player and I have no issue with that. My thoughts on him is that he wont be special though. His cool, calm on ice play worked well for him in juniors but with elite talent all around him I feel like hes too slow. What makes him steady at lower levels will be his problem in the nhl."
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,LooseSeal-,2,Mon Jun 29 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Mayfield's performance in the playoffs made Griff expendable - I think we got a great haul for him."
NewYorkIslanders,3beswu,ArtyThePoopie,2,Mon Jun 29 14:39:39 2015 UTC,Yeah mayfield can turn into that big mean guy we need. Hammer cant do all the dirty work alone.

NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,LoneWolfComando,30,Sun Jun 28 22:54:35 2015 UTC,I think the real question is how do WE pry Dylan from YOU?
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,Chrismercy,12,Mon Jun 29 00:34:34 2015 UTC,I cant see moving him being an option for the islanders right now. He has the most upside of any of our forwards and has show the most improvement. I believe they think he can be a top 6 guy for a long long time. That's not the kind of guy you move just yet when his value is only going up.
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,LooseSeal-,5,Sun Jun 28 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"yea, he isn't going anywhere. Plus he'll probably be on JT's wing after showing some great chemistry playing together. If he takes another step forward this year their top line can easily be one of the best in the game"
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,patio_himself,5,Sun Jun 28 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"Ryan is probably top five on the Islanders' list of untouchables after JT, Leddy and...yeah, that's probably it.  Sorry OP but he's not going anywhere."
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,GoldenMarauder,5,Mon Jun 29 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"Makes no sense whatsoever for the Isles to move him.  Possession standout, point producer, rookie contract, close relationship with Tavares.  No chance he is dealt for anything Arizona can reasonably offer."
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,mattymonkees,6,Mon Jun 29 02:34:05 2015 UTC,The deal would start with OEL and go from there. So neither team would probably do it.
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,Undercover_Mop,4,Mon Jun 29 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"Isles look highly at him. very young, very talented. I honestly cannot see Garth giving him up for anything, unless its a total steal. There is some talk of him playing wing for Tavares permanently, if not anchoring his own second line as center. Easily a point per game guy once he hits his stride."

NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,RyPhy,2,Mon Jun 29 18:43:02 2015 UTC,Strome has arguably the 2nd highest forward potential on the team behind Tavares.  He stays.
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,bass_n_treble,4,Mon Jun 29 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"Isles just traded a D prospect who returned what Hamilton did because they have too many.   The only roster player of remote interest is Oliver Ekman and, again, Isles just traded a 21 yr old 4th overall D prospect because of Mayfield and Pulock. They have a 1st pairing locked up for 7 years and a 2nd for 4-7 or so. Strome isn't completely untouchable (depending on his contract demands) but Yotes have 0 assets to get him.  If his demands are absurd (7m-8m+ caphit), Id do it for Ducs, Domi and Ekman. Maybe a pair of unprotected 1sts subbed for one, but only if its a must move situation. Nothing less."
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Duclair Domi and Ekman for Strome? No way is that a fair trade for Arizona. That's the three most valuable players on their team. I know Strome is a great young player, and all. But that's kind of a lot."

The Yotes have a lot of nice young D, of which we have lot. None of those assets have value to the Isles. They'd have to offer up either a young impact roster forward, of which they have none. The scenario doesn't work without a severe overpayment, even then I think Isles would be best served turning it down.   If we were forced to negotiate a trade from contract demands, and Yotes were the only team Strome will sign with, a pair of unprotected 1sts plus at least one of those three players is the bare minimum. And that can't play out till next offseason."
NewYorkIslanders,3bg5t0,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"Outside of Tavares who is just an offensive juggernaut, Strome is already our most talented playmaking forward. Nelson is a bit more of a combination type player with a  little more goal scoring and Anders Lee is a pure goal scorer in the mold of Franzen and Moulson. On that basis, I'd say he would command a ransom. Realistically I could see him traded if a team was crazy enough to give up a top youngish shutdown defenseman. It's probably impossible but one of the few people I'd be ok with a trade for is OEL. Guy is a stud and from a small sample size is the best dman in the league at shutting Tavares down."

Hed have to play wing, and it'd be mostly to give them a 4th RH shot. He's a mediocre skater, perimeter player. Would rather have PAP or Ward but Gagner would be a nice cheap option.  I think Flyers keep him though, they cleared cap space and could use his extra pop. Gonna tough to add significantly better offense thats cheaper through UFA/trades given their cap situation."

NewYorkIslanders,3bdiov,kenlane,5,Sun Jun 28 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"I think he has little to no shot of making the NHL. If he was actually an NHL talent, the numbers he'd be putting up for his prep school would be staggering. If he were an NHL talent he'd be absolutely dominating the league he's in. He still has four years of college to get through, but I highly doubt he'll reach the show. This pick was simply a friendly gesture from Wanger to this kid, and to probably grab a couple headlines in the process. But so long as we're discussing talent, I don't need an in-depth scouting report to tell you that he is the longest of long shots.  Disclaimer: I'm not a Wang-hater and I have no qualms with using this pick to help grow the game in a super-nontraditional market and have the kid have an experience he'll never forget. And who knows, maybe I'll be eating my words four years from now. I sure hope I will be."

Garth is fire at drafts. Best part of being big market isn't the UFA options, its the scouting staff. This was the first year where Isles seemingly abandoned/shifted psychological portion of test, didnt interview any draft prospects they drafted. Either Isles interviewed a bunch of guys and didnt like them or maybe they are evolving their drafting. Into what IDK, but it was curious and the first 5 rounds were absurd value addressing organization needs without deviating much from BPA. Very clear, concise direction: everyone they drafted can skate and transition and generate shots.   Plus, it was mentioned on the broadcast Isles went all out in integrating advanced stats into their scouting for this draft (something they've obviously been doing at the pro level since at least last offseason, it was if Garth just starting plucking every Corsi-darling out there). The cockiest, smuggest, most aggressive drafter in the league just got some new gizmos to draft with. Love it."
NewYorkIslanders,3bd1bh,Fireislander,4,Sun Jun 28 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Edmonton makes Talbot their #1 netminder or they give him a generous amount of starts as a backup. Guy was too good to be playing most of last season in Lundqvist's shadow. Talbot deserves way more than what the scumbag rags gave him.

NewYorkIslanders,3bd1bh,leeber27,4,Sun Jun 28 04:35:42 2015 UTC,Actually it was the oilers 16th which was from Pittsburgh and the 33rd which was packaged with our 77 for 28 from Tampa which was the rags pick from the msl trade. So we used two of the rags first rounders two years in a row to select great players.

Like the fact Pulock was his D partner, also being a bit overage he'll be in the AHL sooner than later. Report seems  to be hes not a dynamic player but can get around, make a pass, has a good shot, and plays a steady D oriented game despite having offensive gifts. If Isles can get his skating up to par great, if not he has some upside as a shutdown guy.   Some had him as a borderline 1st rounder, almost no one had him dropping to the 5th. Love it.  EDIT: Reading up, seems he came to combine pudgy and wasn't performing well. For a guy whose been knocked for his skating, seems to me teams got scared they'd draft a pylon so he slipped. To me, seems like if you can get this kid to buy into program (which, considering he's boys with Pulock and his cousin/uncle bled nearly his entire career here doesn't seem outlandish) he's at the very least another big heavy LD to push Pelech with Reinhart gone. Overaged like Pulock so he won't have to wait 2 years to go to AHL, only a year's wait I think."

NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,Salacondor,10,Sat Jun 27 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"In any draft, you pick the best player.  The Reinhart trade shows you can always retool.  Clearly the best players available in their eyes were defensemen."
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,mattymonkees,3,Sat Jun 27 18:43:00 2015 UTC,This is correct.   Grow them. Trade them. Profit.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,Cay_Rharles,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"Except for Andong Song, he was definitely not the best player available.  Most people are saying theres no way he deserved to be anywhere close to being drafted."
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,hockeycrazy033,5,Sat Jun 27 21:45:22 2015 UTC,I think that might of been a show of good faith. If China is going to start producing hockey players it puts you in an awesome position if your team is known as the first to accept one of their guys.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,NordicReagan,2,Sat Jun 27 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"Also, from him being drafted we just got one huge fan base in China."

NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,mcbordes,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:39:30 2015 UTC,The Islanders already did because of Wang.  They scheduled their training camp to be in China about 5 years ago until the NHLPA intervened.  The Islanders also host the Chinese junior national team every year.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,mcbordes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:35 2015 UTC,Why?  It's not like baseball where you can just sign these guys at 16.  They will have to be drafted and every team will have an equal shot at any of the next Chinese players.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,NordicReagan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking more along the lines of setting up quality scouting channels and establishing a solid infrastructure.   The earlier we build relations with those teams the more likely they might be willing to help us out in some capacity. Plus, the sooner we get into a market, the quicker we'll be able to efficiently observe and evaluate it."
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,mcbordes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:47:26 2015 UTC,We're talking about an organization that has kicked around the idea of not employing any amateur scouts and relying solely on Central Scouting's rankings.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,isles27,7,Sun Jun 28 23:17:58 2015 UTC,I think it was reasonable.   Many of our d prospects are nearing NHL ready levels of play so it opens up more options moving forward without depleting our depth at the position from a prospect standpoint.
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,Stonecipher_LaVache,3,Sat Jun 27 19:37:48 2015 UTC,Great point
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,lighthousefisherman,2,Sat Jun 27 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"This.  Plus he nabbed two high end offensive players in the first. Only thing I would have liked was a power winger but most went in the 2nd IIRC plus Isles are picky with them. He needed to add some dmen as we had a glut just turn pro, in a year or two he'll need fresh bodies.   This next class of players is gonna be fun in Bridge. Isles never really had the luxury of slow development upfront and on the blueline, gonna be a lot of good players there in the next two-three years."
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,Number-91,4,Sun Jun 28 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Garth is taking the necessary measures toward creating a new depth pool for the Islanders with this draft. Reinhart had plenty of chances, but he just wasn't the right fit for our defense so he gave Reinhart a chance to go somewhere else that needs better D. It's also only a matter of time before Pulock and Mayfield are full-time on the roster. They won't stay down in bridgeport for much longer. Garth is creating a new depth pool of solid defensemen to ensure we have a good base of call-ups should the need arise. I'm very satisfied with the moves Garth made."
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,ugotpandaowned,3,Sat Jun 27 20:00:16 2015 UTC,Considering this team couldn't recover from the losses defensively in the playoffs i would think this was a necessary move
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,ugotpandaowned,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"We are pretty set at forward position for the next couple of years with our young NHLers, Dal College, Ho Sang and our two first round picks this year. In like a couple of years though maybe some of these defensemen will be able to overtake Hickey or depth. Also that one defenseman we drafted that played for Oshawa also is a utility guy like Brent Burns"
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,anarcurt,2,Sat Jun 27 18:18:36 2015 UTC,I thought we were more set on the defensive with Pulock and Mayfeild... okay that's all we really have isn't it. Thanks for the response and good job Snow. #SummerOfSnow2
NewYorkIslanders,3bbonq,PhilosophicalPhool,2,Sat Jun 27 18:24:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not as sure about Mayfield as a lot of people but we are also pretty set at defense. Our top four is lock up for like seven years and Hickey and pulock should be a solid 5-6. Honestly this team is in a good position at every position and its great to see

NewYorkIslanders,3bb7nn,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Sat Jun 27 15:49:51 2015 UTC,From what I understand; they were using him as forward on the PK mostly. Using his speed to disrupt the points like Grabner.

NewYorkIslanders,3b9x75,nothing_cleverr,2,Sat Jun 27 14:21:30 2015 UTC,We have a deadly Offense in this team's future and from what I've seen the addition of Barzal puts us over the top. Garth couldn't believe he dropped so far.
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,puckle_nuck,30,Sat Jun 27 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"We just signed two rock solid D-men in Leddy and Boychuck. We are going to ink already inked up Hamonic for a long deal. Mayfield looked great, and we have Pulock, and De Haan. And Hickey really picked up his slack this year.  Reinhart wasn't playing to potential, and this could go two ways: We kick ourselves, but still have a good d-core OR he turns out anywhere from decent to bust, and Garth got us two great picks before he lost value.  I've already seen tweets from big reporters talking about how scary the Isles offense will be with the pickup of Barzal.  I'm telling you, I understand the fear in this... but the more I think about it, this was a gooood move from Garth. Both sides made out well.  EDIT: Bass_n_treble pointed out that Hamo already inked up, I don't know how that slipped my mind! I feel like a total nerd."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,AC3FACE,6,Sat Jun 27 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Was but he did not look good in the AHL and was awful in his few games at the big club. Plus with Boychuk and Leddy in the long term picture, he became really disposable."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,turtle888,5,Sat Jun 27 10:12:50 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of this deal. I think they gave on Reinhart way too soon, I think he will find his way. Then again Boychuck and Leddy were not in the mix when they drafted Griffen and that prob also plays a part.."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,Waldo19,8,Sat Jun 27 01:02:59 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head with your second sentence. Best case scenario Reinhart becomes Leddy. But Leddy is a proven commodity and locked up.  Reinhart was starting to look like a bottom 4 kind of guy best projection, and you already have guys like Potvin Pulock, Mayfield and Donovan who can fill that role.   Seems like a reasonable trade. Time will tell."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,bass_n_treble,7,Sat Jun 27 01:16:30 2015 UTC,Potvin   Did they lower his banner when he came out of retirement?
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,Waldo19,5,Sat Jun 27 01:42:56 2015 UTC,yeah he's starting on a line with Gordie Howe
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,B47ANCE-,3,Sat Jun 27 01:52:40 2015 UTC,"Reinhart can NOT skate like Leddy. Reinhart is 4 inches taller than Leddy, they are two completely different players."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,BrainOfG,2,Sat Jun 27 03:45:15 2015 UTC,Reinhart is too big and broad of a skater to be the next Leddy. Leddy probably skates better with the puck than anyone on the Isles. He transitions from defensive zone to neutral zone so well.
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,Waldo19,2,Sat Jun 27 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"yeah I meant it in terms of overall potential, not in terms of playing style"
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,s7ev,11,Sat Jun 27 01:33:47 2015 UTC,I hope we don't regret this by giving up on him
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,mip10110100,14,Sat Jun 27 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be better utilized on the Oilers than he could have been on the Isles.  He might turn out well, but we got 2 good, high picks where we had none till the 3rd round.  Plus there is the ability to trade a high second round pick now."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,McEirhead,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:00:11 2015 UTC,"I think everyone will be happy with this trade. I'm from Edmonton and saw Reinhart play a lot for the Oil Kings. I really like him and think he's the type of anchor we desperately need more of. By the same token, a lot of our fans think we gave up too much for him. Barzal can very probably become the best player in this trade, and I bet you guys will be pretty happy with this trade in the long run."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,tanu24,0,Sat Jun 27 19:14:22 2015 UTC,You cannot teach speed... and hes slow. Wish him the best but hes too slow imo

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,_stee,4,Sat Jun 27 15:28:47 2015 UTC,I am personally a huge fan of it! Reinhart should be a top 4 defencemen. But has not been progressing as planned so I love this trade!

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,ryan924,4,Sat Jun 27 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"Barzal was ranked 6th by Pronman, averaged the 9th best player according to PPP. Great job Garth."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,firebird65g,2,Sat Jun 27 01:23:37 2015 UTC,Not a fan of this deal at first. Reinhart seems more like surefire 2nd pairing guy rather than a top pairing Dman. Thoughts from Islanders fans?
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,northernswagger,2,Sat Jun 27 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think Reinhart is a top-pairing guy, but can turn into a top-4 defenseman.  If the skating comes around, you have a really solid player, he's got solid instincts and a good shot from the blueline."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,viewless25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:23:54 2015 UTC,"If we could turn these two picks into an above average top 4 d-man, i'll be happy. Our top 6 is locked up for 5-7 years so it seems like both teams got what they wanted out of this."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well its a decent move for us. We're stacked on defensive prospects, but had no 1st and 2nd round pick this year via the Vanek trade. We still have a blue chip defensive prospect in Ryan Pulock.  For the Oilers, I'm not entirely filled in on their defensive prospect core. I've heard it leaves something to be desired. Although I've heard from Oilers fans that Edmonton has a log jam of left shooting defensemen, I think the addition of Reinhart is big for the Oilers. He looked like a top line defenesemen when captain of the Oil Kings championship run in the WHL in 2014. But since coming to the AHL and NHL, he's been a nightmare. He's painfully slow on the ice. He gets bullied by guys 4 inches shorter than him. He's not even a remote threat on offense. I personally got sick of him. I thought he was using his pedigree and size to dominate minors, and thought that would guarantee NHL success. But its not over for him. He'll just take another year in the minors before he can really compete for a starting role."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,bass_n_treble,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:37:48 2015 UTC,I love the trade for our side. Reinhart just hasn't progressed as planned and I think we cut our losses at the right time.

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,RyPhy,-8,Sat Jun 27 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your team has zero defensive prospects and have bungled a lot of draft picks.  I hope Chiarelli knows what he's doing."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,leeber27,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:55:24 2015 UTC,Don't listen to that guy... He speaks nonsense on almost every thread. I honestly think you guys came up big with Reinhart. Apparently Isles org didn't want to put in the time to groom him; meanwhile you guys will have plenty of time to groom him along with the countless other start prospects you got. He'll work out great for you.
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,bass_n_treble,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"Hoping your right but as an avid draft watcher, I think the Oilers missed big giving up Barzal and likely Kylington/Roy/Sprong. Griffin has potential but I think Barzal and Kylington as a pair are far more valuable."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,ArtyThePoopie,2,Sat Jun 27 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"The thing about griff is he's got a huge ceiling. The best example to mind is Chara. He really didn't show much promise at first, but by the time he was 25ish he really start emerging. You guys have that time to wait. Regardless of the other defensive prospects, he's bound to develop into a player that will be in the NHL; it's just a question of where in the lineup.  As for passing on Barzal, I wouldn't be entirely upset. You guys did just draft a franchise center lol. You got mcjesus and RNH, which doesn't leave much room down the middle for Barzal when you consider that centers on the 3rd and 4th line gotta have some size and grit; which he doesn't seem to have either of."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,i_wannatalktosamson,2,Sat Jun 27 01:42:18 2015 UTC,Definitely a bold move in letting Reinhart go. But you don't win Stanley Cups by avoiding bold moves

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,firebird65g,3,Sat Jun 27 02:10:20 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of this at all, bigger dmen take more time to develop"
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,nofx516,3,Sat Jun 27 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's just how the game is evolving, it isn't enough just to be a big guy without being able to produce (ex: Boychuk). And aside from being a big body he doesn't really fit in anywhere else on the team besides a bottom pair defenseman.  Whereas a guy like Pulock helps on the PP with a cannon and pretty good skater.  And we could even have a guy like Mayfield being a #7 d-man based on a pretty solid playoff performace. Garth took a chance, just gonna have to wait and see how Reinhart turns out and how Barzal and the 33rd pick develop."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,daiwynne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:00:55 2015 UTC,"It definitely takes a big defensemen longer to develop, but I'm not really sure Reinhart fits in exactly with what we need from our defensemen right now.   We have enough lefties on the big club, and we have some good stay at home defenders. Couple that with Reinhart struggling with the speed of the NHL in his short time up here and the management may have began to look at Pulock and Mayfield more favorably to Reinhart, which made him expendable for the right price, which we got tonight.   I look at Leddy as a guy who really made our team more dynamic by his ability to break out of the defensive zone with his speed. We lost the Caps series because our defensemen did a horrible job moving the puck out of the D-zone, we do not need another plodder on the blueline. Great move by Garth."

NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,PK84,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"Can't help but wish that deHaan had been traded instead of Reinhart. Call me crazy, but I've never been a fan of CDH, and was hoping he'd be bundled or traded for equal or greater value as Reinhart. CDH always seems lost and makes alot of careless mistakes on the ice. Thoughts?"
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,islander1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. CDH is probably less valuable to a team like EDM that is banking on prospects hitting their stride in 2-3 years. CDH did seemingly regress this year, but it is hard to determine which season (2013-14 or 2014-2015) is indicative of his true skill level. I think at the very worst he is a serviceable bottom four d-men with the ability to move the puck in the o-zone pretty well."
NewYorkIslanders,3b9add,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"I thought he was garbage in the playoffs, and he had put him self in the doghouse (some rumors say he's a frisky dog who doesnt get much sleep and Isles were getting ticked of; just rumors). However when he's on his game he's a top level shot supression PMD. Him and Hamonic compliment eachotehr well and are excellent at preventing clear entries, long cycles, and creating fast outlets.  CdH's ability to back the play up and skate out of pressure is too good. Just needs to get better at taking skating lanes (always passes) and not constantly scrambling like a QB looking for the homerun pass.   I think Reinhart, as a big pure shutdown LD, was a better compliment, but his game is too slow and reactive. His skating wasn't improving and he wasn't getting the system. Mayfield is. Pulock is. Pelech quietly is (Garth can talk up Mayfield, but Pelech is the guy whose gonna take big leaps this year in the minors and IMO has better NHL upside. People forget he was logging 28-30+ minutes a night in Erie dominating all situations)."

If he has a chance to make the team better, though, you better believe he is going to do take that chance. His sole job right now it to make the team better. Whether or not trading okoposo will help with that is unknown right now. If he gets a good enough offer, make no mistake though. He will trade him. I love okoposo and think he is an excellent player, but if we can get someone better it will be worth it. Tavares is only going to get better over the next couple of years. Getting a truly elite winger next to him would be a sight to see. Remember Vanek? He made our first line unstoppable. Now imaging a team that is far improved on defense and at goalie with JT and an elite linemate. That would be sick/"
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,thenewguru2,7,Thu Jun 25 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"If he gets a good enough offer, make no mistake though. He will trade him.   That goes for pretty much any player other than 91 though."
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,bageloid,3,Thu Jun 25 22:32:32 2015 UTC,I can't help but wonder if KO can be that winger. Prior to his eye injury he seemed to be on pace for a monster season. I am hoping that a full off-season of rest and recovery allows him to regain that pre-injury form.  But I agree with your point entirely. If its a no-doubt improvement you do it.
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,Waldo19,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"What if its, Okposo + (Mayfield? Let them bring home the HT kid?) for Oshie? Pretty close, Oshie has more raw skill and a nastier player, but Okposo probably a headier player. Oshie has that extra year too.   I dont think Sharp is the answer, old, already won, what else does he have to play for? If the Blues want to shake up their team and dont wanna invest in Oshie, that'd be an easy sell for both sides without the messiness of the Kessel contract.   Isles will be in much better position winger wise then as MdC + JHS will have completed their first pro season by the time he hits UFA."
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not that high on Oshie. Don't get me wrong he is very good, but I think he is still riding some of that Russia Shootout mystic and is perhaps not quite as good as those outside of St. Louise think.    For reference, Oshi played 72 games this season and had 55 points.  Okposo played 60 and had 51.  So I personally wouldn't go for that trade."
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,Waldo19,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:00:30 2015 UTC,Okie for Sharp?  May free up cap space for Hawks and give Tavares a sick winger.
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,jackwoww,20,Thu Jun 25 22:23:55 2015 UTC,I think people around here are seriously overrating Sharp lately. Plus he's getting up there age-wise. I don't think he's the answer
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,ArtyThePoopie,6,Thu Jun 25 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"Well, he may not be actively shopping him (""planning on tading""), but I would think if something lucrative came his way involving Okie I'm sure he'd give it a thought."
NewYorkIslanders,3b4dwj,Eyebleedorange,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:07:13 2015 UTC,I'm absolutely certain that's why he put KO on the block in the first place. Only if someone made an offer too good to refuse would he have actually traded okposo.

I mean, Garth was working on getting them for a long time, but he might have a trade plan of a similar nature and is saving Okie as a trade chip for later. Either way, by this coming season's trade deadline, I either expect to see an Okie contract extension or Okie in a different jersey."

But Caps got out of the first round finished ahead of the Isles (on tiebreaker) and OVI has name recognition and did score a ton of goals, so not really that surprising. Just makes JT missing out on the scoring title hurt a little bit more.   It seems that everyone has already forgot that the Islanders were good this year. Which I kind of like, because we get to surprise the league again next year. Going to be really fun beating the Stanley Cup champs in the home opener."

NewYorkIslanders,3b156u,mcbordes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, very few players stay with one team anymore for their entire career like Bossy or Potvin did. If a player stayed on one team for their entire career now, it's probably because of something that forced them to retire early. Still, Tavares could very well leave and win a cup somewhere else if the Isles don't extend his contract. Happened with Ron Francis when he went to the Penguins. Ron Francis was the Tavares of the Whalers and got traded to the Penguins and won 2 cups there while the whalers had zero. Shit like that does happen quite a lot. Not saying I want Tavares to be traded, heavens no, but things like that do happen."
NewYorkIslanders,3b156u,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:31:20 2015 UTC,I was more talking about him signing up for 0 cups in the next 16 years.
NewYorkIslanders,3b156u,mcbordes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Tavares could very realistically extend his contract. You can tell he cares more about the game than he does about money, as he's paid relatively low compared to other elite players in the NHL, and I'm positive Garth would up the payout if Tavares wanted to stay but asked for more money."
NewYorkIslanders,3b156u,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:51:31 2015 UTC,What?  The first comment I replied to was the guy saying him winning a cup like Bourque where he's traded to a contender when he's 40 to win his first cup.  If that were the case that would mean the Isles wouldn't have won a cup the next 16 years.  That's all I was objecting to.  Kulemin Grabovski Jaro and JT all become free agents when JT does.  They can easily give him 10 mil a season if he wants it.  In no way did I say anything about him not re-signing.

NewYorkIslanders,3b156u,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"nah man, I meant that the only time I would be content if Tavares leaves would be after 21 years playing for the Islanders and unsuccessfully vying for the cup, he would go on to do it for another team (hopefully in the west). That does not mean that I would be happy that he didn't win one for Long Island, I would be absolutely devastated. I would rather see him win as many cups as possible for the Islanders that go and win his first at 40. I do not want him to leave when his contract expires, and I never want to him to leave ever. There would be nothing better if he went down the Mike Bossy (minus the injuries) path and became an advisor or a scout for the team."

NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,ballots_stones,2,Fri Jun 26 13:53:30 2015 UTC,Barclays center website has a very nice 3D seating chart that will tell you whichever sections are obstructed view.
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,zeile33,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:08:09 2015 UTC,A FRiday?  Now that we're actually in the city is our schedule going to blow?
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,blekmyr,3,Wed Jun 24 16:47:52 2015 UTC,Is that a bad thing?  Sorry if a European fan doesn't understand what's so bad with a friday home opener..

NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,zeile33,2,Wed Jun 24 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's just easier to get to a game on Saturday, especially since I'm coming from pretty far away.  I like to get there early and hang out a bit before hand.  Not a big deal for one game, but that prelim schedule had less Saturdays on it."
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,blekmyr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, I can see that.  One thing I can't understand, though is how communications can be so bad (or at least people say they are) between LI and Barclay's? I mean it's NYC and the distance between say the Coli and Barclay's is what, 40 km?  I'm from Stockholm, Sweden and going 40km by train here is no problem at all. I can't see why it's such a problem in New York.. which is a real city."

NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,ryan924,0,Wed Jun 24 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"Up until recently, Brooklyn was a place that most people did anything to avoid going to. Thus, not to many trains go directly there."
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,blekmyr,2,Wed Jun 24 21:28:47 2015 UTC,But Brooklyn is huge.. doesn't like 1m people live there? It's just hard for me to comprehend since that many people should mean that the commuting isn't so bad it's almost unusable
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,jjawss,2,Wed Jun 24 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"The trains are very crowded and can get expensive. A round trip ticket during peak hours is ~$20 from my house, so tack 80 bucks plus the inconvenience of traveling/extra time onto a family's total cost. Also- the trains from Long Island only run about once per hour in either direction, depending on the line. Once you're in Brooklyn, the train can get you straight to the arena. It's just a pain in the butt compared to what a lot of us are used to.   I commute from LI to Manhattan every day & i wouldn't hesitate to use the word ""nightmare"" to describe it at least 3/5 days of the week :)"
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,Tilt23Degrees,2,Wed Jun 24 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yep. Live in Nassau, commute to manhattan. Hate my life because of it. The LIRR is a nightmare, I'll be going to the home opener and maybe 2 other regular season games. Saving my money for playoffs."

NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,blekmyr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.. you can't get like a monthly commuter card which lets you travel anywhere in NYC? And once per hour, that's just crazy considering how large New York is..  I do really feel you locals when you say:   It's just a pain in the butt compared to what a lot of us are used to.   Because for me as a European fan every game is the same: get up at 1AM and watch the Isles for 3h and then get back to bed. The arena doesn't really matter to me as long as the team stays in New York (of course I'd have preferred them to stay at the Coli). It's really sad that they're moving into the city, though. I'm a suburban guy at heart and I don't really like big cities."
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,jjawss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:47:18 2015 UTC,"Subway is more frequent than what I said- My primary line will come every 3-10 mins, and 10 is probably too long an estimate. The commuter rail is once per hour on average by me. apologies for making it seem like they're the same! Subway is great.  & I do get a monthly! I have 2, one for the train (1 hr ride) and one for the subway."
NewYorkIslanders,3aysdq,blekmyr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:01:26 2015 UTC,"Are the cards different for the subway and the train? This is mindblowing to me.   And if the subway works great, why do people complain about the trains.. why not just take the subway?  Sorry if I sound rude, I really don't mean to. I'm just trying to get a better grasp on how the arena move really affects the fans."
NewYorkIslanders,3b0288,clebo99,2,Wed Jun 24 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"You play 3 periods of 5 v 5 before 4 v 4 and then  3 v 3.  So in my opinion a 3 v 3 ""specialist"" is a nice bonus but he has to be good enough to justify his 5 v 5 roster spot (which he will play FAR more often).  The Bruins were a team last year that with just a little bit better shootout luck would have made the playoffs.  However, the solution to that problem isn't getting a shootout specialist, its finding guys who put the puck in the net during regulation so you never have to deal with OT in the first place.  That being said, I got a soft spot for Grabner and his wheels (I adored Jason Blake back in the day). So I'd be fine with keeping him, unless there is something nice coming in return."
NewYorkIslanders,3b0288,Waldo19,2,Thu Jun 25 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"There is no 4 v 4 period, just a heads up. I agree with you other wise. The roster gets made for the first 60 minutes, if you have a team that can win in the first 60 they'll figure it out in 3v3 often enough."
NewYorkIslanders,3b0288,FoxFlex,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:32:25 2015 UTC,appreciated.
NewYorkIslanders,3b0288,Waldo19,2,Thu Jun 25 02:38:34 2015 UTC,LOL...that is funny...I used to love Blake as well and I do have a soft spot for Grabs.  You just think that if Bossy took off a lunch hour and talked to him the guy would net 50 a year.
NewYorkIslanders,3b0288,leeber27,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"I thought grabs also, but it doesn't matter since capuano benched him every game and (didnt check, but assuming) the 3 v 3 won't effect playoffs so it's not a huge deal"

NewYorkIslanders,3azlrh,dl2316,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'll be sad to see Visnovsky go, because he seems like such a nice guy, but in the end it's about winning. I think if he came back to the isles it would be to fill a 7th D kind of role, and even then I'd still be worried because he's such an injury liability. I'd rather have a younger, less-injury prone 6th/7th D man who we could develop. Pulock needs a shot at nhl action sooner than later."
NewYorkIslanders,3azlrh,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Judging from Garth's comments to ESPN, no way he's back. Its a shame, the guy was still an excellent possession player. But he has three guys all close to ready, dont blame him to see whats on the market. FWIW, Id rather Oduya than Viz. Viz just doesnt have the same offensive ability he used to, Oduya would give them a bit more in terms of man to man coverage. I think Garth does go with a young guy though, and why not? He's got a very strong top 3. 4 when DeHaan is on his game, another guy I wouldnt be surprised if he gets moved (Staple says its unlikely, so he's not going anywhere).   Very much get the feeling Isles will be active in finding an upgrade or two and will move roster players to do so."

It might be me, but I don't even remember Sunday games being this common for NHL...especially on football Sundays?  Just seems weird to me.  Here's to hoping that truly is tentative (and that more Saturday games are scheduled rather than Sunday- maybe these Sundays will be swapped for Saturday games)..."

There's been a lot of talk about it, but at the end of the day for something like that to happen in a draft this strong is very unlikely.  Second of all, for us to do it, we'd have to give up a lot more than grabner and KO. High level prospects, 1st round picks, young emerging players (nelson, strome [which would kill the point of this], pulock, lee), would play in a combination to trade for that pick (I'm not saying all, but you're looking at these to be the possibilities to get that pick... Not Grabner/KO).  Unless you wanna give up a strome, we aren't gonna get another."

They had a poor year, and he fits their style of play. Though idk what Snow could make out of it, Boston does have a top 15 pick. The draft is strong this year and that could end up being another good prospect. I talk about a first round pick because the Islanders currently do not have a 1st round pick, as they gave it to Buffalo when the Islanders got Vanek. But I would rather have a team higher in the draft that can still be a good team if we were going for a first. Maybe Philly or another team lacking in offense."

Okie & Reinhart to the Blackhawks for Sharp, no draft picks.   Okie & Grabs to Philly for a top-4 defenseman or top-6 forward and a first/second round pick."

NewYorkIslanders,3am63k,lighthousefisherman,0,Mon Jun 22 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Rumor is Sharp might be the next casualty in the Blackhawks cap space saga. Similar situation as to why Leddy was offered up for trade and we were able to snag him. We're now a team that is capable of reaching the playoffs, but we're not a team that's capable of going too far just yet. Getting a guy who's recently just gone all the way to winning the cup would be an asset I'd like to have on our roster. Boychuk, Leddy, and Halak all have deep playoff experience, but if we could add one more guy like that, it will only help."

NewYorkIslanders,3am63k,ArtyThePoopie,0,Mon Jun 22 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"lmao  no  just no  Trade 1 is a wholly unrealistic scenario. Phil is worth much, much more than that. Trade 2 is a criminally gross overpayment. Trade 3 is the only feasible one you posted, except for including a first rounder. They would never do that."
NewYorkIslanders,3ambmk,Jeffw54,6,Sun Jun 21 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people would trade Strome for Jones. While he is still young and can improve, Jones is a very flawed defensive player who likes to take a lot of risks. He gets caught in the offensive zone quite a bit and sometimes has trouble getting back to cover on the defensive end.  Strome has the potential to be a 70 point, 2nd line center who plays solid defensively and has few flaws to his game. He is much more valuable than Jones and will grow into the better player in my opinion"
NewYorkIslanders,3ambmk,Undercover_Mop,3,Mon Jun 22 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"Jones from Strome in a heartbeat.  I really like Strome, but a player like Jones is incredibly tough to come by.  He is very young, on an ELC and already playing beyond his years.  Strome is a great player but we are fairly stocked up front and with Dal Colle and Ho Sang coming up in the next few years it seems like a no-brainer.  This will also make Reinhart more expendable as we have a top-four of Leddy-Boychuk Jones-Hamonic, that isn't even taking into account Pulock when he is ready."

NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,dl2316,7,Sun Jun 21 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this would be a real bummer. I had a funny feeling he wouldn't be extended but it still would hurt."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,firebird65g,12,Sun Jun 21 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"Okposo is a quintessential guy who provides more value to our team compared to what we can get for him.   I can see a trade happening now that we have new ownership and potentially a higher team salary, but what will we pick up for Okposo? If we don't get a first line winger, than it would be a fruitless trade."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,Clown_Shoe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:55:08 2015 UTC,I'd rather get a legitimate defenseman.

NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,lighthousefisherman,3,Sun Jun 21 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"The one idea I've heard floating around is that he could be bundled with someone else on the main or bport roster for Kessel. It would allow us more money to put towards an effort to land a guy like Kessel if we traded Okie. Not saying that's ideal, but Kessel would be a nice consolation if we parted with Okie."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,i_wannatalktosamson,10,Sun Jun 21 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"Kessel is a much better player then KO, I love him as much as the next guy but kessel is an elite player where as KO is a very good player"
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,entropism,6,Sun Jun 21 14:22:53 2015 UTC,Not keeping him on would be a huge mistake.  Not sure why they would get rid of Okposo at all...
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,NordicReagan,6,Sun Jun 21 01:55:08 2015 UTC,"I love Booker as much as anyone else, but he's looking at a BIG payday next year. Somewhere close to the 7-8 million mark probably. I think the fact that he's being shopped is purely asset management. Is he the 1st line winger you want to JT's side going forward?  My only thought against Kyle's play is that he tends to be a little hot/cold. During the season he's a solid player, but doesn't really meet elite status until he's in the playoffs. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that there are glimpses of him going balls-to-the-walls crazy good, but I rarely, if ever, see it during the regular season.   All I'll say is the return better be fucking HUGE if we do move him. Without KO, we essentially have a 1st line of Tavares + nobody. Plus Kyle and Johnny are super close. It'd be a huge bummer if JT had two of his close friends (Moulson being the other) shipped off within 3 years of each other."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,entropism,3,Sun Jun 21 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"Well, actually, I can see him on JT's line.  I just want someone consistent on the OTHER side, which will make all the difference.  I'd like to think KO would sign for 5-6 mil per, long term, but I don't know his thought process.  Perhaps the reason he's being shipped is because he told snow his demands and they're way out of whack.  We'll never know.  It's just my preference that he stays."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,NordicReagan,3,Sun Jun 21 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. I mean, don't get me wrong, it'd suck to see him go. Ever since he's come up he's been one of my favorites. But yeah, I'd probably be just as content to see him sign to a reasonable contract and the Isles find another piece to plug into the 1st line until DalCole is ready."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,entropism,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Personally I'd love to see Lee/Tavares/Okposo and then Dal Colle/Nelson/Strome.  Draft heavy on forwards/Goalies the next two years.

NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,dubbs505050,3,Sun Jun 21 00:49:11 2015 UTC,Makes no sense.
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,Fireislander,5,Sun Jun 21 00:57:13 2015 UTC,Read this earlier today and it genuinely hurt my soul. I would hate to see KO go
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,bass_n_treble,4,Sun Jun 21 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"He's boosted by Tavares and is overvalued IMO.  A St. Louis fan said they'd give up Oshie and a pick for him.  If that's the consensus around the league, that's a huge steal.  Honestly I would rather see him move Brock Nelson.  I think that kid will be a flop."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,entropism,3,Sun Jun 21 10:15:14 2015 UTC,"Oshie is considered quite the disappointment in St. Louis these days, and that he fell off quite a bit.  Also saying he disappears for long stretches. There's a reason they're shopping him."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,zeile33,2,Sun Jun 21 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"Totally get it.  Don't really feel like paying him 7mm.  But if we do trade him there's gotta be a prime piece coming back in the deal bc there's no way Garth leaves JT with no wingers (although JT, Lee, and Strome together  fills me up a little).  Very interesting.  This is going to be an exciting off-season for us."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,PoorFlory01,2,Sun Jun 21 04:37:49 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to see him go but I get the logic. He's strong on the puck and can be a top line winger, no doubt. But is  he worth the payday he wants? Isles have to think about the HUGE contract they have to give Tavares in a few years. Tavares makes 5.5 a year now..that's going up to atleast 10. Plus Lee and Nelson if they get bridge contracts this offseason and Strome next season.  I'd love to see him stay. But if he goes, I get it and they'll get something great for him."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,lighthousefisherman,2,Sun Jun 21 12:11:36 2015 UTC,"I already commented on this, but I'm just gonna throw in another 2 cents. As I said, if Okie was used to get us someone like Kessel, I'd be more than down for that. However, if Garth is going to use Okie to trade for an early pick at this year's draft, I'm gonna be pissed off. We really don't need to do that much in terms of a draft right now. Our prospect pool is already deep enough. I really don't think Garth needs to worry about this draft. Rather, an Okie trade should go towards building a better main roster."
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:15:31 2015 UTC,I see a few people saying it would be a bad move but I really think it could be ok. But if we did move him we would have to make sure we come out well in the trade.  As of right now we already have a lot of forwards. We're still a big forward and defenseman away from being a Cup contender. If moving Okposo can help us in those areas then so be it.
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,cadoin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:12:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't like it considering we wouldn't really have any wingers to play with JT then but I get that they could probably get a decent deal for it.  I wouldn't accept anything under a replacement winger and maybe a 2nd or 3rd rounder for him though.
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,isles27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:51:37 2015 UTC,This is likely just Snow using KO to see which bigger pieces are on the table from other teams and working back from there. Not sure there are many players or available picks out there that match the Islanders perceived value of KO.
NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"More I think about the 7m comment and thats its coming from outside sources more I think that Garth may just be trying to negotiate against his agent. Would have to think KO's priority is staying with Isles or Minny, and Minny would have to clear space to get him at a premium. Only way it makes sense is if the eye injury is worrisome, which would affect value anyway."

NewYorkIslanders,3ak7e0,V_T_H,2,Sun Jun 21 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"Playing with fire, Isles would need to get back a hell of a talent to think of that. His caphit and skill/athleticism should make him a top tier commodity, even with an expiring deal. Still, big no on a trade if you can sign him for Boychuk money. Yikes, really interesting to see and my takeaway is that Garth wants an impact winger and will listen if its an upgrade. Don't buy that theyd move Okposo for a pick(s).  Yotes rumbling to be shopping. Im not sure Isles would have the balls to gamble like that (nor should they). Plus, Id have a hard time passing on Noah Hanifin."

NewYorkIslanders,3airsj,leeber27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:30:43 2015 UTC,MDC has a shot at the squad if his skating improves and manages to at least get 10lbs by camp. Ho-sang we won't for another year.

And I agree, this team has alot of chips on its shoulder, its building that kind of 'real' hate that can fuel a team. These guys want to win together, and they have the talent to overwhelm teams in waves. They just need to get nastier. Big reason why I want Scotty on the team next year is his RH shot and nasty physical game. Dude got ticked and was tossing Caps like ragdolls after they woke him up.   And lets not forget, we have two gamebreaking wingers in the uhhh wings. Ho-Sangs transition game is elite level stuff  (and god have mercy on the opposition when he gains the zone, remorseless offensive game), and MdC just screams future stud.

NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,_stee,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:08:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with the premise, but I not sure anyone considers him a bust.   Who has dismissed him? The guy isn't NHL ready, which you address in your post, and is likely not making the team, especially with Mayfield's performance fresh on MGMT's minds (according to Staple). Right now, Mayfield is a better skater, not by much, but Griff lacks anykind of explosiveness and relies too much on positioning/gap control/size. Mayfield is more aggressive and will close gaps; he forces opposition to make decisions. Long term, I think Griff's head prevails as it has for Hickey and CdH (at times. lets not sugercoat it, guy was playing lethargically at times and looked like Donovan on his worst days in the playoffs). His skating I think can improve as he's forced to play a more assertive game. But short term, Mayfield's aggressiveness lets him maximize what he has. He's older, more developed, and closer to his ceiling. Reinhart is an adept puck handler, alpomb under pressure, and has a strong first pass when he has time. His feet haven't caught up to the rest of his game and fans will have to be patient.   However, don't doubt Isles want to hang on to him. If they move him its because an offer fits now and longterm. They do have the depth, dont forget Pelech to go with mentioned Pulock and Mayfield."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,Stonecipher_LaVache,-1,Sat Jun 20 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"Uhm. We all know he has potential. The thing is, it is very easy to say 'size takes longer to develop' but in reality we have no idea what his development will look like or how long it will take, if it even pans out at all.   The argument against Griff is simply that Mayfield looks more NHL ready, and Pulock provides a very different skillset which is a need for this team.   If someone has to move it should be Griff for these reasons. He shouldn't be moved for a depth player, because that is too impatient of a move and can lead to us regretting that move in the future. He should be moved for a significant piece in an area of need so that we don't have to question the decision in years to come, like how the situation was with Pokka and Brennan."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,isles27,3,Fri Jun 19 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"Pokka sure, but TJ Brennan?  Really?  He wasn't ever really a prospect, just an AHL player they signed and traded before his first game."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,mcbordes,3,Fri Jun 19 20:58:00 2015 UTC,Uhm. You do realize Mayfeild has just finished his third year in BP right? And he is also 2 years older... Thus proving this articles point...
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,leeber27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:18:13 2015 UTC,"How can you possibly regard that as evidence for anything? How many big d-men prospects don't pan out? I'm sure you don't track that. This 'three year' development plan may work for some, but it is preposterous to regard it as a guarantee.  If we can trade potential for actual talent and upgrade at a position of need, such as a 2-way forward, why wouldn't we?"
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,isles27,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"""The argument against Griff is simply that Mayfield looks more NHL ready...If someone has to move it should be Griff for these reasons""  This is exactly what you said. I'm saying the reason for this is because Mayfield is older and has more experience, which clearly you didn't realize.   As for your evidence; it's preposterous to assume anything is a guarantee in sports. The article is just saying how these types of players need time to develop. That doesn't mean every player does, it's just what's recommended from previous years.  Stop being a Milbury.  EDIT: Im guessing you have no idea what I mean by that line since you give that ""6 month long fan vibe"" but basically he did exactly what you're suggesting (trading a big defensive prospect + for immediate help)... And we literally just stopped paying for it last week."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,leeber27,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry you had to resort to being so petty.  I suppose the trade for Leddy was a Milbury move last year according to your thought process. Interesting, you must give Milbury more credit than I'd be willing.  This situation is entirely different. We finally have some depth at defensemen and we can leverage that for stronger forwards that fit our needs. Sometimes you have to assess potential from a different perspective. Sure it could mean what a player could eventually become and provide for the team, but it could also mean what the player can allow the team to acquire in the market. Since potential is never a sure thing sometimes the better move is to leverage it for actual talent and work from there.  Everyone knows Griff is young, and that is precisely why he will yield greater value on the trade market than a player like Mayfield. But Mayfield is entirely capable of playing, so whatever transaction we make if we made one with Griff will not hurt us nearly as much, since as you keep saying Griff needs more time for development. Maybe a year or more, who knows. If they use Griff to obtain extra value out of an exchange then there still is Mayfield, Pulock, Pelech. Griff shouldn't be shopped for picks though, that would be a big mistake. Probably only for a proven goal scorer or two way forward."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,isles27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"What's petty about this? You're suggesting an exact Milbury move. Either you weren't a fan back then or you hit your head and forgot about a HUGE thing that dumbass did to this team. Judging this thread's posts you either don't understand the game or you started watching it last week; sorry but that's just the way you're presenting yourself.  How does my logic make the Leddy trade out to be a Milbury move? You clearly do not understand what happened with Milbury's trade. He traded Chara, a scrap, and a 1st round pick [Spezza] for Yashin. (A huge Dman, that wasn't producing well with some extra, for immediate forward help). That trade got us nowhere. How is that the same logic as the Leddy trade? Garth took advantage of a cap stricken team and traded away a prospect and career AHLer? Two totally different scenarios. Don't put words in my mouth .  I'm not arguing that we should move Mayfield. I'm not arguing we should move anyone on D actually, I think we should keep everyone and trade out the guys that don't make the squad. I'm arguing that you are dispelling this article because you personally feel that we should move Griff because he seems like he won't pan out; which is ridiculous to think. Of course he's going to look worse than Mayfield because Mayfield is older and had more experience. That's not a knock on anyone it's simple fact.  There is no leverage for Griff right now. Not many teams are willing to give up what you're asking for a prospect that will take time to get tot he league. We are not going to get a top line winger for him and if we did it would be a rental like Sharp; which would NOT be worth it.  I will no longer comment on anything above, you proved there is no use in arguing with you. However I do have a question that I would love for you to answer just so I know who I've been dealing with this entire time.  Out of curiousity (and amusement) what do you think we could get for Griff. Or even, what do you think we could get in exchange for a package that would include Griff? You say a ""proven goal scorer or [a] two way forward"" but WHO exactly?"
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,leeber27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Your logic is incoherent. For some reason you are living in a world where we couldn't derive value from a trade. If you are this close-minded then you will never be able to understand how to properly assess and work with talent and the market. Not every prospect traded yields a Yashin, just like not every prospect pans out. Stop living in a world of foregone conclusions.  Maybe in a couple years you will develop the ability to assess situations with logic and not emotion. Until then, best of wishes."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,isles27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:02:50 2015 UTC,Where is there emotion involved with any of this? You want to do a ridiculous trade before giving someone a chance; I'm trying to understand why you could possibly want that. You have not answered a single question and only put words in mouth. Good luck finding anyone to agree with your way of thinking about hockey. And a suggestion in the future is to check your shit and actually watch the game for longer than a year before playing GM.
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,leeber27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you can't hold a civil discussion.

NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,leeber27,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"So if you were the Islanders GM about to execute a trade, and the other team says ""Give us either Reinhart or Mayfeild, we have no preference."" You'd give them Griffin Reinhart?"
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,Briant403,2,Fri Jun 19 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, I would leverage the potential of Reinhart that everyone here is so excited about and use it to gain extra value from any exchange."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,isles27,2,Sat Jun 20 13:41:52 2015 UTC,"Reinhart is more valuable, so that's not really fair. What he's saying is that if the choice is ""Reinhart"" vs ""Mayfield + enough to match the values"", he'd choose to give Reinhart and keep other pieces."
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,karmapuhlease,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:15:59 2015 UTC,The guy is 21 and Mayfield has only played 3 games in the nhl.  At best Mayfield will be a bottom four dman. At 21 Reinhart is already a bottom six guy and getting better.  He isn't even developing slow.  People said the same thing about cdh.  Where is he?  Well two years ago when the isles dmen couldn't move the puck who comes up after being in the ahl for about 4 seasons? Cdh and he started moving the puck out of the zone.  If they trade him we better get a top line sniping winger. At the least
NewYorkIslanders,3aez69,quigs17,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:56:02 2015 UTC,"Based on what? Mayfield's limited minutes on the ice were much more impressive than any of Griff's minutes. It wasn't like the hand of God selected Griff to play extra NHL games this season, it was the coaching staff so how can you hold Mayfield's limited minutes against him.  He may not be the complete shutdown D-men that many think he is, but in all likelihood he is the most NHL-ready in the system. His size is an asset and his poise is a tremendous intangible that Griff lacks. Maybe Griff lacks it due to age, experience, or something else, but that doesn't change the fact that Mayfield is more ready and thus more valuable to us right now.  Once again, all this potential and future promise that you and everyone else hold so highly for Griff can be used as a great bargaining chip if we do look to upgrade at forward in an area of need."
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,Jeffw54,6,Wed Jun 17 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"Grabber is worth a bit more than that. Try getting a second or tack on a minor Canadiens player. But, if they say no, just take it. The minor or the second was just to sweeten it.  Edit: Added that last little bit"
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,Salacondor,4,Thu Jun 18 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"Swing Grabner to Montreal if you can get them to tack on an AHL forward. It doesn't have to be Hamilton's best scorer, but a guy with at least a decent point total. From a casual glance at their stats, Drayson Bowman looks like a safe bet, though I don't know what his actual value is. Looks like he's a serviceable call-up though.  With the loss of Grabner, our penalty kill wouldn't be looking too hot. I suggest looking for a two-way kind of guy who can score as well, like Ryan O'Reilly. Definitely give Colorado a call and see what they're looking for. You may have to overpay slightly, but do avoid getting fleeced. edit: Dangle Reinhart around. COL needs defensemen.  I don't like the idea of getting Jordan Eberle. Our problem this year wasn't goal scoring, it was getting scored on.  I don't think Florida has anything worth swinging a substantial trade over.  Also take two of our third rounders (if the Grabner trade is successful) and look for someone willing to give up a second round pick. The higher the better.  edit: Also (because you mentioned vancouver) see what they want for Edler I guess, though I don't think an upgrade at D is necessary at this time. In fact, moving Reinhart  edit2: also this is a mock draft so if you want to trade Tavares for Toronto's 1st rounder then go wild"
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,ArtyThePoopie,3,Thu Jun 18 02:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'd show interest in Brian Campbell/Gudbranson from Florida. Nobody from Vancouver interests me.

I think we need to move up to the top 5 (at least) and snag Lawson Crouse. That kid's gonna be a stud. /s  That's out of the way. I don't see a need to move into the first round, unless someone comes at us with an offer we can't refuse. De Haan should stay, only pieces I'm interested in moving are Reinhart, Grabner, Grabovski, and Hickey.  Reinhart would need to be an NHL ready d-man or forward or late 1st rounder  Grabner could get a late 2nd round pick  Grabo probably won't get any bites with his cap hit.   Hickey, just see what we get offered."

If not, then take the one that was offered from Montreal.  I wouldn't move Reinhart for Eberle and there really aren't any other pieces I can think of that would make me do it. I do think Reinhart could be moved though. Could you possibly talk to the person in charge of Colorado about something around Reinhart and O'Reilly? I'd offer up Reinhart and Nielsen and go from there. Pelech could be someone you could use as well as Bailey, but only if it's absolutely needed.  I don't see Florida as a great trading partner. Anyone that would be useful would be almost impossible to get without disrupting out team.  Only player I would be interested in from Vancouver would be Hamhuis. Not really sure what we'd have to give up though.  It's ultimately your decision but I'll throw some deals out there that I'd like.  To whoever: Grabner  To Islanders: late 2nd/early 3rd    To Colorado: Nielsen, Reinhart, Pelech, maybe another piece if needed  To Islanders: O'Reilly    Vancouver: check to see what they'd want for Hamuis. They'd probably ask for de Haan but I'd really be hesitant to make that trade."

NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,sans_,-4,Thu Jun 18 12:52:07 2015 UTC,Jagr (he's older so he's not too much and may be good for a push)  Ekblad  (a young guy for the future and now) for DeHann and Ho-Sang. These 2 Isles could aid the panthers in the long run while we push a bit for the Stanley Cup.
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,Salacondor,6,Thu Jun 18 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this, personally. Not only do I not want to part with De Haan, but for Jagr? You're giving away one of our best young defensive studs for a forward who will maybe put up 40 points if he has a good year? Idk. Ekblad would be a nice pickup but I don't think either of the two you've put on the table would be enough to get him. Ho-Sang is an unproven player who teams are already afraid to touch because of his attitude issues, and he has no NHL experience whatsoever. Hell, he may not even be NHL ready next season."
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,sans_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"I see your point, I was more trading for now which when I think about it might be something for next year. Maybe instead of Florida we go for Toronto with Ho-Sang and an Isles first 2017 and a first 2020 for Kessel. This may be very unrealistic but maybe the guy running the Leafs is a Kessel hater.  EDIT: Last sentence"
NewYorkIslanders,3a7yg8,Salacondor,2,Thu Jun 18 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm so on the fence about Kessel. He's absolutely lethal and I feel like the Leafs will give him up for less than he's worth like you said, but at the same time I feel like we'd have to leverage some of our future towards him and that makes me so uneasy -_-  Although I guess I'm speaking strictly in terms of real life, perhaps I shouldn't be so invested in our youngsters for a mock draft haha."

NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,Jeffw54,13,Wed Jun 17 18:02:46 2015 UTC,Probably a third round pick considering he's coming off two hernia surgeries and steadily declining play.
NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,ArtyThePoopie,6,Wed Jun 17 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"Not much at this point.  He has shown in the past two seasons that he is inconsistent, and injury prone.  Not many teams would be willing to give up much to take on a contract that could be a bust."

NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,kyleT_NYC,2,Wed Jun 17 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"Hedman is quickly becoming one of the best two way defensmen in the nhl.  Mayfield will be a 3rd pairing dman at the very best.  Did you watch the guy play in the playoffs? His puck movement and passing skills alone are incredible.  Add that he is huge and can actually plays above adequate defense and you say he's Scott Mayfield,  who played two games in the playoffs against Washington's bottom six"
NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,quigs17,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"look above. I'm saying scott mayfeild, who at 6'5"" 220 and 2 years younger came up and showed more skill defensively and mentally in those two games than most of our players did all season and he played a similar game to hedman. He will turn into a very similar player for the islanders so why waste a trade... trust me id take hedman but we can fill bigger holes in our lineup especially when we have as bright of a stable as we do with pulok Mayfield and Reinhart."

NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,inapt888,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"I just think he has way to much hype especially after the playoffs for us to be able to trade grabner and get him. If you look at mayfields 2 games, he is the same type of player, aggressive getting to the puck, excellent backchecking and positioning and is the same body type at 6'5"" 220 vs hedman at 6'6"" 230... Obviously hedman is a higher caliber player but 1. Mayfield is 2 years younger and will develop even more and has shown defensive brilliance in the first showing of his skills and 2. Tampa would NEVER let go of hedman for grabbo and few picks, I dont see any trade happening on that"
NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,kyleT_NYC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"I think mayfield will be a solid player. Big body defensive minded defenseman. However, he was not good at clearing the zone and helping the puck the go the other way in the Washington series sadly. I remember reading a stat on his corsi and shot attempts against when he was on the ice and it was the worst on the team by FAR. Nothing against him, he's a rookie and he looked alot better than Reinhart."
NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,inapt888,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that to an extent but with the right pairing its not an issue and something he can improve upon as a 2 game rookie. He also blocked about 8-10 shots and had a handful of excellent hits in 2 games. The whole team had terrible issues clearing the zone and I saw him take care of business pretty well IMO.  I've played competitive hockey, specifically on defense, since age 4 (I'm 28) and I appreciate the defensive end of the game the most and watching his game really gave me chills. I saw him skating hard to every puck and mostly beating out caps guys, effortlessly making big physical plays and being in position when he needed to be.   I fully understand we have small sample size of his play and need to see more of him and let him develop, but I would put my money on him becoming a key piece on our blue line over the next few seasons and certainly the size/ability is there for him to be a player like Hedman for us."
NewYorkIslanders,3a6tgz,kyleT_NYC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"well i can't say you're not making a good argument! I still believe he'll be a 4-6 defenseman for us who blocks a lot of shots and hits a lot of people. I can't think of a good comparison right now though, maybe a much better Carkner in his prime? I don't believe he has the skills to be the number 1-2 Hedman has become. He doesn't have that offensive acumen. Also yeah small sample size, but I can't say I am not excited with our defensive prospects coming up and to see what's in stored for Mayfield!"

NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,thewrongflag,6,Tue Jun 16 19:56:05 2015 UTC,I know very little about sports contracts and financing. Does the end of this buyout help the current team in any way? Does this mean we have the ability to spend more money in signing players now or was that benefit already realized when the team decided to buy out Yashin years ago?
NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,XACTOlife,6,Tue Jun 16 19:34:49 2015 UTC,Yes this is very helpful. 1st it is less money the owners have to spend on a sunk cost that can now be allocated to a real player. 2nd it frees up some cap space which we will need as the team is aging and players get more expensive.
NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,Pool_Shark,-6,Tue Jun 16 23:07:58 2015 UTC,Nope. Buyouts do not count towards the cap.   However you could make the argument that since the owners aren't paying Yash $2.2 million per year anymore they might be more inclined to spend on player contracts.
NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,johnzanussi,10,Tue Jun 16 20:05:29 2015 UTC,that's incorrect.  his buyout did count against the cap.  the only compliance buyouts that were not against the cap came after the lockout.  so we free'd up $2.2 mil of cap space.
NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,hockalo0gie,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:35 2015 UTC,Im not sure what our cap is like anymore but didn't we pick up tim thomas specifically because we were going to go below the salary floor?
NewYorkIslanders,3a2duu,Fireislander,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:22:06 2015 UTC,That was a few years ago and he went to Dallas anyway so he's been off our books for at least a year.

NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,joefelice1,5,Tue Jun 16 20:46:29 2015 UTC,Lee and Nelson's will take longer because they will obviously be paid more and for a longer amount of time. Hickey's will most likely be a short term low amount; thus being a quick job.
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,leeber27,2,Tue Jun 16 23:21:58 2015 UTC,@StapeNewsday:   2015-06-16 20:26:37 UTC  Heard today that #Isles and RFA D Thomas Hickey getting closer on a new contract. Nothing new as of now on RFAs Anders Lee or Brock Nelson.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"Between him and Viz in talks, Isles D remains in tact. Some may bemoan in it, but with Pulock, Reinhart, and Scotty ready its a solid move. Isles have 3 NHL pairings and 3 NHL ready prospects if anyone gets hurt. That 3rd pairing was very good at possession, essential to the Isles style. Lack of size hurts but the only big boys on the Isles are guys who can skate and move the puck, Isles know what they want. I'd rather retain two guys who know the system the go for Paul Martin. And size could be fixed in a pinch of they carry Mayfield as a rotating rookie ala Donovan (hopefully with more games). Reinhart and Pulock Id rather either play or keep in the Bridge for playing time.   Plus Strait."
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Tue Jun 16 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"Give me a Hickey, Garth."
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,jokesonjokes,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"Lee and Nelson should be the priority over hickey. Either way, I hope the contract hickey inks isn't a long one. We have a lot of promising young defensemen in bridgeport and I don't want someone that's only okay like hickey taking up a roster spot for too long over someone like Pulock or Mayfield."
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,lighthousefisherman,13,Tue Jun 16 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Hickey proved this year that he's better than ""Okay"". Not ""superstar"" caliber, but he can definitely hold his own and isn't a liability. A great guy to have around for sure."
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,sans_,8,Tue Jun 16 22:42:35 2015 UTC,Would take hickey over strait every day of the week.
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,lighthousefisherman,2,Tue Jun 16 22:52:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. I do think Strait improved this year but could definitely afford to get squeezed out.
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,sans_,2,Tue Jun 16 22:59:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't agree with that. He season before last he played amazing but I thought he took a big step backwards this past season. Got over matched quite and bit and was overpowered by bigger and stronger players. I think he can be a solid 6th/7th defenseman but I also think there are much better options than Hickey.
NewYorkIslanders,3a3015,Undercover_Mop,2,Wed Jun 17 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"Priority?  It's not like Hickey's deal is holding up anyone else's.  Lee and Nelson, performing well over expectations as part of the young core, have more bargaining power and will take time to negotiate.  Hickey knows he's lucky to be in the NHL and will probably sign a cheap 2-3 year bridge deal, befitting a bubble player."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,ugotpandaowned,5,Tue Jun 16 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"O'Reilly could be a good fit but it all depends on what we have to give up for him, he only has 1 year left on his contract."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,CaptWinkie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Gotta think the Avs would at least ask for one of Reinhart or Pulock, no?"
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,trickface,3,Tue Jun 16 18:28:28 2015 UTC,If we could guarantee that O'Reilly would sign an extension with us I would give up Reinhart as part of the trade
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,lighthousefisherman,5,Tue Jun 16 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"Don't chase me down with torches and pitchforks for this, but I think trading Frans for O'Reilly would be a good move. Frans has served us well, and still has moments of brilliance, but I don't think he is what he once was. Parting with Frans, while painful, could be what we need to do to further team progress. He's a spot on the roster that could go to a younger player that shows a better bang for the buck. O'Reilly on a 2nd line with Kulemin and Strome would be an excellent relief behind our top line, which I'm suspecting will be either 27-91-21 or 12-91-21."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,lighthousefisherman,2,Tue Jun 16 22:04:24 2015 UTC,I agree. It'll be sad to part with Frans but O'Reilly is 24 and Frans is in his early 30s. Id rather sign O'Reilly to a longer term contract if possible. And I bet Colorado would want Nielsen as part of the trade because he is a similar player to O'Reilly but could probably sign for less per year
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,ArtyThePoopie,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"My view is this: When we lost Moulson, there was a huge hole left in our team's  scoring that Vanek didn't properly fill. It was a bad move, as we all know. We thought Garth was stupid for letting Matty go. However, with Frans, I think he'd be a good veteran bargaining chip that could be used to help progress the team by trading him for someone like O'Reilly. I don't think it would bring the same lack of results that the Moulson/Vanek swap did."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"If you're implying a 1:1 ROR for Frans then, well I have bad news. ROR is a better two-way player than Frans is or was even in his best years. Disrgarding that all, though: what Colorado needs is defense. And not a prospect, someone who could start immediately. For that reason alone, I don't see a trade for ROR happening."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,mattymonkees,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:24:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say frans is a single ace-in-hole bargaining chip. We'd definitely have to bundle him with someone else. There's just not much we can afford to bundle without risk.
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"Conditioned on the Isles signing O'Reilly to an extension, I would give up Nielsen and Reinhart for O'Reilly and a pick without even blinking, no questions asked."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,IslesBeBack,3,Wed Jun 17 15:40:55 2015 UTC,I've been a big proponent in bringing in O'Reilly for a while now. It's no secret that a deal between the Avs and himself probably won't get done.  If it was guaranteed that he would sign with us or if the Avs would let us talk to his people before a trade went down I would give up a decent package.
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,ArtyThePoopie,2,Tue Jun 16 17:43:39 2015 UTC,Frans + Reinhart for O'Reilly with an extension seems like it would help out both teams.
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"If we're moving Frans, an idea which a lot of fans have seemingly latched on to, getting ROR to fill his place would be wonderful consolation (not implying a ror for frans trade because that would never happen). I'm concerned though about his contract length in regards to what we'd be sending to Colorado."
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:03:43 2015 UTC,His contract length wouldn't matter much though. He's only 24. I'm more concerned with how much money he wants which could be upwards of $6-$7 million.
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:47:35 2015 UTC,"My concern is that he wouldn't sign with us after only playing a year here, thus making whatever we sent to Colorado highly disproportionate to what we got"
NewYorkIslanders,3a27r1,leeber27,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah that makes sense. I think in any deal we would have to either have a contract in place or at least be able to talk to his people to gauge what kind of contract he would want. That's the only way I'd feel 100% comfortable making a deal."
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,karmapuhlease,22,Tue Jun 16 03:13:06 2015 UTC,I would say salary cap Era dynasty. There is never going to be teams like the Islanders of the 80s again as long as there is a salary cap
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,ugotpandaowned,-6,Tue Jun 16 03:17:15 2015 UTC,I still dont consider a dynasty every couple years a cup.  It should be in a row.
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,DGGuitars,11,Tue Jun 16 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"3 straight western conference finals, 4 in 6 years and 3 cups in 6 years. It's as close to dominance in the Salary Cap Era as we are going to see. The only blemish to it is that LA has been pretty good in their own right for 3 of those years"
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,ugotpandaowned,2,Tue Jun 16 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's my main issue with it. If the Kings win next year, they undoubtedly also have a dynasty by the same standard. The idea of simultaneous dynasties is crazy to me, but apparently it wouldn't be without precedent. There was some overlap between the Red Wings, Leafs, and Canadiens during the late 50s and throughout the 60s."
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,dl2316,6,Tue Jun 16 04:11:04 2015 UTC,Dynasty has become to mean a much different term once the salary cap came about
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,Waldo19,6,Tue Jun 16 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"I want to be clear, this is a purely academic exercise.  In the modern salary cap Era the Hawks 3 cups in 6 season is incredibly impressive. But based off of the criteria used to define dynasty teams, they currently fall short. I explain below.  The NHL is actually kind of inconsistent with what it calls a dynasty.  Under one definition there appear to be 8 teams however under another there appear to be 9 teams  The criteria used for the 8 teams seems to be that each team must have won at least 3 Stanley cups with no more than one year between wins. Each team has also won at least one cup back to back.   Based off of this criteria the Hawks are not a dynasty. They have 3 cups, but 2 years separate the  2010 and 2013 cups from each other and they never won back to back cups.  The criteria for the 9 teams seems to be 4 or more cups within an 8 year span from the first cup win. The Hawks again fail to meet this criteria because to date they have only won 3 within 6 years.  That being said the NHL can call whoever it wants a dynasty, and in the modern context, the Hawks probably are one.   However, if the Hawks are called a dynasty...then what about the 1997, 1998 and 2002 Redwings (3 cups in 6 years). Does that not count because it's pre-cap? Slippery Slope my friends."
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,leeber27,3,Tue Jun 16 04:34:20 2015 UTC,Cap era dynasty. What they were able to achieve over the past 6 years in an era where the cap controls a huge part of the game it's pretty much impossible to get 4 straight.

NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,dl2316,2,Wed Jun 17 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"They are a cap era dynasty. It is just about impossible to win 4, yet alone back to back cups in this era. Nothing will ever beat the domination of the teams of the 70's and 80's. The Islanders never even played a game seven during the dynasty, and won 19 straight postseason series."
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,bass_n_treble,-3,Tue Jun 16 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"Until we win another 3 or 4 in a row in this era, I don't think we have any rght to criticize what they do and don't consider a dynasty nowadays."
NewYorkIslanders,39zv4s,three_dee,-1,Tue Jun 16 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"I would say a fair definition of ""dynasty"" is a team that is successful for a long period of time, and pulls in at least more than one championship.  The Blackhawks qualify.  I don't think it needs to be 4 in a row, or any number in a row."

Would it be awesome to have Kessel? Of course.   That nonsense about him being a problem in the locker room is bullshit, so that's not a valid excuse.   The problem is his contract. Not necessarily the amount he's being paid, but the fact that he will be paid that much for the next 7 years (if it was for maybe 4 more years max then yes we should amke a move). If we were to make a move for him it would be because we were in a ""win now mentality"" like the rangers. We have so much talent coming up with some potentially huge contracts. We just wouldn't be able to have him around and do that. He's totally worth his contract, but he's just not a fit for this team at the current point in time.  Bottom line, it would be awesome to have him on the squad, it's just that he's not a fit with any team that is just starting to get their wheels turning."

NewYorkIslanders,39uhbb,Nicktardo24,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:08:59 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. This team and the Nassau Coliseum holds a very special place in our fan's hearts. The team did an amazing job by using this song. It really brought out raw emotion from the fans at the coliseum. Especially come playoff time. This is the song that brings me back to last season. It was a really really special season and it really brought our fanbase together as a whole.
NewYorkIslanders,39uhbb,bass_n_treble,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:23:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely! I was at game 3 of the playoffs overall one of the best days of my life. By far the loudest I've ever herd the coliseum
NewYorkIslanders,39uhbb,nothing_cleverr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:05:56 2015 UTC,Talking with fans today about getting home from Barclays Center 11:00 earliest... I have really been missing the Coliseum today; this isn't helping.

NewYorkIslanders,39uhbb,snapfractalpop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:49:36 2015 UTC,This it the other song is a tear jerker from the April game. This other song got me to burst into tears when they played it.
NewYorkIslanders,39uhbb,snapfractalpop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"This is particularly hitting me in the feels, because my first major concert was Smashing Pumpkins in 1997, at Nassau Coliseum (I was in middle school).  This stirs up so much of the past.. people.. music.. friendships of yesteryear.. bittersweet to say the least."
NewYorkIslanders,39ssii,usaftoast2013,3,Sun Jun 14 12:27:02 2015 UTC,I'll do it again

NewYorkIslanders,39rt8z,Jeffw54,3,Sun Jun 14 03:22:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know how we couldn't get an Islanders fan to do this, but you don't have much to do. If you need to do something, trade our thirds for a second and take the best Goaltender available"
NewYorkIslanders,39rt8z,viewless25,3,Sun Jun 14 05:26:51 2015 UTC,"Either a strong goalie like viewless said, or a strong forward for JT to play with."
NewYorkIslanders,39rt8z,Eiramasil919,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:06:30 2015 UTC,After seeing this post I got curious when the mock draft was since I spend a fair amount of time on /r/hockey. As of right now the post was 17 hours old. I have created another post in this sub which can be found here or in the sticky so that we can find one of our fans to take the spot. If none of our fans can take the spot you are more than welcome to keep it but at least give us the chance to take it especially since you were told in your comment claiming the isles spot that they would like an islander fan to take the spot
NewYorkIslanders,39rt8z,Fireislander,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:33:27 2015 UTC,Oh yeah go for it I just didn't want my 2nd favourite team to go with out a GM
NewYorkIslanders,39rt8z,dl2316,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:18:58 2015 UTC,Please don't trade our prospects and our up and coming stars. Our drafted completely messed up and was shit last year with bad trades. This year we do not need to trade much.

NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,_stee,13,Sat Jun 13 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, with Dal Colle coming up, we really don't need him nor do we meet the asking price without giving up a player like Strome"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,dl2316,3,Sat Jun 13 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"without giving up a player like Strome   To get talent need to give up talent. Its the unfortunate part of trading, you gotta give up players you like...or just not trade that works too."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,MacerV,5,Sat Jun 13 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Devils advocate: Dal Colle isn't coming up for a couple of years. We kind of need a winger now. We all saw what Vanek did on the first line with JT, what if we had another caliber player like that"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,viewless25,5,Sat Jun 13 22:16:49 2015 UTC,We all saw what Vanek did on the first line with JT   Phil Kessel's gonna leave and go to Minnesota?
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Rubberneckin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:36:28 2015 UTC,Somebody has to replace Vanek now that he sucks ;)
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,leeber27,4,Sat Jun 13 22:50:31 2015 UTC,He actually had a decent season.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Chrismercy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"If MDC isn't up next season, it will be the next"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,dl2316,2,Sun Jun 14 02:20:35 2015 UTC,Why strome? You don't think Toronto is looking for young Defensemen? Which we have enough to spare.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:22:51 2015 UTC,He was just an example. What I was trying to convey that a player picked in that area (top-15) in the draft that also has a high potential (Nelson) would be just a part of the asking price.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,inapt888,9,Sun Jun 14 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have Phil. Could you imagine Phil Kessel on jt's wing? Goals on goals on goals. He's got, what, six years left on his contract? He's 27. And he gets out of the media pressurecooker that is toronto. It'd be great for everyone.  However, I'm not necessarily sure the package we'd have to send to Tor would be worth it for us. I'd imagine Dal Colle and Reinhart/Pulock would be involved, considering we don't have a first rounder. And tack on a late-round pick too I guess.  I'm not going to say yes or no (though I'm leaning towards no) because I'd be happy if it happened and happy (er) if it didn't"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,tanu24,5,Sat Jun 13 22:08:41 2015 UTC,it's not worth it to us at this point. MAYBE if we had a first round pick this year I would think about that pick + Reinhart + something. But we don't and I rather us stick with what we have. We have something good going on here. Let's let some kids develop and see what we got.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,brasqo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:55:13 2015 UTC,I have 0 faith in Reinhart i'm ok with him going. Grabner and Bailey are some other pieces that can be thrown in. Maybe a first next year too. I'm just so ready to own I can't wait anymore
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,inapt888,4,Mon Jun 15 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"Would rather not part with dal colle, strome..."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Chrismercy,5,Sat Jun 13 21:38:43 2015 UTC,All I can think of is a grabner + pick package but that isn't good enough
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,inapt888,4,Sat Jun 13 22:18:00 2015 UTC,"not even close sadly. We aren't doing much this offseason, let's be honest."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,MacerV,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:54:08 2015 UTC,With new ownership I can see Garth having to go for broke this off season. The wang security blanket will be gone and he will have to prove his worth to be kept around.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Axel2134,3,Sun Jun 14 00:26:16 2015 UTC,yeah but what would we spend the rest of the cap on? all I can really see is a 6th D/Back up G. we already have too many forwards without some kind of trade.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,MacerV,5,Sun Jun 14 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"Leafs fan here. If you want to know something about Kessel feel free to ask it. As for what is probably expected as a return for Kessel the word is a 1st + elite prospect, take that as you will."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,viewless25,8,Sat Jun 13 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Good news, we don't have a 1st!  shit"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,MacerV,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"There is the 2016 first, and an alternative would be simply other prospects. Dangle the likes of Michael Dal Colle / Griffin Reinhart / Ryan Pulock I'd think it'd generate interest."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,inapt888,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"Too steep for our blood, good luck finding anyone willing to fuck themselves over"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,PoorFlory01,3,Sat Jun 13 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"Its not really fucking anyone over, its the way things go when trading prospects for known assets, things can get cloudy and you will often have to trade away prospects who you hope to be great one day for a great player in return."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,inapt888,2,Sat Jun 13 22:45:14 2015 UTC,I agree with you. But we're really not the team to be talking to about this. This is too young of a team who is still not close enough to give up that kind of return. No way do we give up any of our recent first round picks and pick up that salary on Kessel even though I recognize he is a fantastic winger. We just can't afford him.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,hockeycrazy033,4,Sat Jun 13 23:53:11 2015 UTC,It'll cost waaaaaaay too much to bring him in. Plus the Isles have a logjam of forwards anyway.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Stonecipher_LaVache,0,Sat Jun 13 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"I agree but I also think of it as the D problem. DalColle and Ho-Sang and the gang are young, I wouldn't mind trading DalColle for the Phil"
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Briant403,3,Sat Jun 13 23:17:04 2015 UTC,but that wouldn't be enough. They would want at least another first and probably a top prospect. This is a top winger who is signed for a good amount of time for a team looking to rebuild.
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,leeber27,2,Sun Jun 14 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"If we had to give up a prospect and a 1st I could totally ship out a 2016 first and Reinhart for him.  We gave away a 1st for a rental in Vanek lol.  I don't want The Phil that bad, but i'm sure some trades are doable."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,Mrmentortv1,2,Sat Jun 13 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"Love The Phil, think he gets unfairly shit on and have little doubt hed dominate in our system. The cost though would be high. First off, his caphit is ~8.1m  and will create issues for years. If you can negotiate some cap eating, could work but that means a bigger package. Which is the second issue, TO is gonna try and get as much as possible, figure at least one or more of Strome, Reinhart, Pulock, or CdH especially since we have no 1st.   If the market for him is dry, and hes available for something close to Nash (i.e., 1st, two young top 6/9 forwards), then yeah sure if they count Bailey as one of those guys."
NewYorkIslanders,39qne2,DancesWithCanoes,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why hasn't anyone besides yourself mentioned the 8.1m a year cap hit that comes along with him. That's enough to pay the entire kid line through their RFA years and then some."

The Thunder was the Isles ECHL affiliate and living 45 minutes north in Sacramento made me feel connected to home when I went to games (rocking my blue jersey).  The Thunder used a secondary name, Rough and  Ready Islanders (after Rough and Ready Island on the river nearby)."
NewYorkIslanders,39np7o,six_stars,2,Sat Jun 13 05:39:02 2015 UTC,Nice. At least you got to experience it while it lasted.  I saw the R&R jerseys and thought it was a cool tribute to the Isles.

NewYorkIslanders,39c8rv,isles27,11,Wed Jun 10 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"Its an interesting debate beyond the age factor because you have Strome and Nelson both natural centers plus Grabo can play center.   Nielsen would fetch a nice return, but the cost shouldnt be discounted. Nielsen is a guy who hasn't cashed a check since his rookie year, he drives the same car he got in the AHL last I heard. He's not motivated by the money, it means nothing to the Prince (well, maybe not nothing, does want to open ice rinks in Denmark and develop its youth programs post-retirement). He willingly asked to be used as a defensive guy, giving them a premium 3rd line center. In a hard cap sport, having a guy who wants to be an Islander will do anything thats asked of him is hard for me to trade. Especially since he worked his way through Europe, minors, multiple coaches, and has always been reliable and consistent."

NewYorkIslanders,39c8rv,bass_n_treble,2,Fri Jun 12 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"The mistake I'm afraid of (from traumatizing history) is that Islanders make trades not valuing highly enough what they're giving away. Time and again in yesteryear, we've seen our guys go to other teams to play their best hockey. It's like we just forget because we don't want to think about it, and it biases our future trading decisions. I hope this time history doesn't repeat itself. Grabner comes to mind.  TL;DR: I just hope we don't trade Grabner and watch him kick ass somewhere else."
NewYorkIslanders,39c8rv,islesandpizza,2,Thu Jun 11 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"I say keep Nielsen. What wasn't mentioned in the article(s) is that he is also our shootout wizard who always seems to beat goalies with that nasty backhand of his.   As for a trade, I propose this: Grabner, Petrov (or a future draft pick), and Reinhart to the Oilers for Eberle. The Oilers need D, so they will get that in Reinhart. He hasn't necessarily panned out with us although he still has a lot of time to develop. We still have depth on D. With Grabner the Oilers can still have someone with the speed of Eberle and Petrov the Oilers have size. If it's a draft pick instead of Petrov I say a future 2nd or 3rd. Thoughts?   Edit: Also, Boychuk or Leddy might be able to influence a Bruin or Blackhawk to join the team. Both teams are going to be cap heavy and looking to unload. Sharp? Krejci? Who knows..."
NewYorkIslanders,39c8rv,ArtyThePoopie,3,Thu Jun 11 09:23:29 2015 UTC,"Nielsen should be a 3rd line center on special teams, really.  I think he is an asset to the team and IMO not on the table.  The Kid Line is a fine 2nd line if Strome isn't RW1 this season."

NewYorkIslanders,39c8rv,hockalo0gie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"There's a number of factors that contribute to both the successes and hardships our team faced this past season. While we did make it to the playoffs, clearly we still had some adjustments to make. Some of these adjustments, in my opinion, are in regards to the roster, who we should keep, and who we shouldn't.   I'm on the fence about frans and since everyone including myself loves him, I'll leave him out of this.   Grabner can definitely go. He's good but at the same time the team was just fine without him most of the season. Boulton and McDonald provide insurance in case a mainstay fourth liner is injured, but both are unnecessary. Again, we got along just fine without either of them most of the season.   As for defense, I would love to see Snow give us another gift before the start of next season: trade Brian Strait and Hickey."

Growth seems to have stunted after his 16 goal 21 yr old Soph season, brief skimmings indicate coaching riff. Classic netfront power winger skillset, tempered expectations but wouldnt be stunned if he translates well. Likely starts in the AHL.   Between this and Miks, Garth has acquired a pair of youngish skilled guys who can compete for spots. Opens up some moves, as they already needed to trim a forward. Id like to see them get a bigtime winger (or atleast snag Joel Ward/proven vet) but would be very Garth to trade Bailey/Grabner at the draft for picks then let camp determine if you go with one of these guys or try for a cap casualty when a team is crunched and cant negotiate for top prospects."

NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,ugotpandaowned,7,Mon Jun 8 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"I said it in the last thread that, while I don't expect it, keeping Lubo around to split time with Pulock or (less likely) Mayfield as a 6-7 kind of deal would be nice. He's got veteran insight to dole out and is crafty and really knows his way around the o zone. The defensive zone's an adventure sometimes with him, but I figure that's why he'd be splitting time with Pulock.   The only problem I see is Strait played pretty well down the stretch, but I don't see anyone trading for him. So we're stuck with him, and for that reason I don't expect Lubo to be signed, but I don't think having two d men in the pressbox will be that much of a deterrent considering we did that the entirety of this season. Plus if Snow thinks it's too crowded he can just send Pulock down for a bit. So basically, there's not much to lose by giving Lubo a contract, as long as he's okay with spending some time in the pressbox here and there."
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,ArtyThePoopie,3,Mon Jun 8 16:36:15 2015 UTC,Depth on d is always good!
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,zeile33,2,Mon Jun 8 16:46:59 2015 UTC,Exactly I think the 6-7 of Lubo and Pulock would be great for both of them and the team. The problem I see for Lubo is that he will probably want to play on a team that will be able to at least contend for the Cup and of all those teams I think the islanders have an easier to crack lineup. He probably won't be able to find a Stanley cup contending team that will play him on an every night basis.  I agree about Strait also. I think he is worth more to the Islanders as a 7-8 defensemen than he will get in a trade. No matter what happens he will probably see a good amount of ice time next season
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Jun 8 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. Isles tend to carry 2 extra D anyway, most teams do 2 F's 1 D.  Isles placed a premium on having depth on D after having numerous seasons where they couldnt ice competent lineups. If Lubo was on board with reduced minutes (which, given his age and health, may make sense) the Isles should love to have him on with Hickey and Strait as 3 of their bottom 4 D as opposed to having Strait as their 7th and whoever doesnt start among Pulock/Reinhart/Mayfield. Thats a D that isnt well designed for absorbing injuries to key top 4 guys."
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,bass_n_treble,4,Mon Jun 8 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here, but I think Lubo is the product of some revisionist history --because of his injury in the playoffs and our rally around him I think we have begin to believe he's a better hockey player than he is.  You guys see Slovakian Mark Streit, I see injury-prone aging defensive liabilty with the worst skating speed since Matt Moulson.  Constantly being beat on the rush and having to break up plays with his stick.  I think we should let him walk.  Brian Strait has surprisingly had a decent year and should be a reliable 4-5 guy.  We can pick up a UFA or trade a forward for a 5-6 defenseman if needed."
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,BroadwayJayEsq,8,Mon Jun 8 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"Brian Strait has surprisingly had a decent year and should be a reliable 4-5 guy.    I wish I could laugh at this, but I think you mean it seriously.  Brian Strait is one of the, if not THE, worst regular defensemen in the NHL.  According to war-on-ice's titular statistic (WAR) Brian Strait was a BELOW replacement-level player, meaning almost any callup from the AHL would have outperformed him. WAR takes into account just about every relevant statistic.  Meanwhile, Lubomir Visnovsky is still extremely effective. His HERO chart shows that he is elite level at both shot suppression and shot generation.  He had one of the best games in decades by an Islander defenseman in Game 3 and his current injury trouble is his back, not concussions so there is no reason to think he is unable to continue playing.   I might be in the minority here   I don't know if you're in the minority or not, but you should be. Lubo is an outstanding talent who delivers big-time and who we would struggle to replace.  Brian Strait shouldn't be allowed to own his own ice skates and you're praising him. That calls into question your evaluative abilities."
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,bass_n_treble,5,Mon Jun 8 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for linking 2012-2015, completely ignoring we are pretty much talking about post-All-Star game 2015 only (remember our March slide where we almost missed the playoffs?), not just when Lubo actually was as good as Mark Streit.  In addition, he played much fewer games this season so you might as well be posting stats from 2012-13 and 2013-14 only.  Brian Strait is improving in 2015-16 (welcome to the present, forget about 2012, thanks) and Lubomir Visnosky is declining.  It's pretty simple."
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,dl2316,3,Mon Jun 8 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"This article was also from after the all star game. Brian Strait is a seventh or eight d, and should not be in the lineup, when Leddy, Boychuk, Hamonic, DeHaan, Hickey, and even Mayfield (limited sample size, however) were all better than him. We have an endless supply of good d prospects, and it is time to start utilizing them. Strait also has no potential, unlike a Reinhart or Pulock. Since the All Star break: (bold is best, bold+italics is worst.)    Player CF% Rel CF% CF60 CA60    Strait -9.84 44.88 56.72 69.66   Boychuk 2.65 53.62 65.79 56.92   Leddy 2.44 53.36 65.99 57.68   DeHaan 3.5 53.93 63.27 54.05   Hamonic -3.57 49.43 62.04 63.46   Visnovsky 2.41 54.81 61.99 51.12   Hickey 1.58 52.94 61.30 54.49    Here is a chart that furthers my point.  *All stats and the graph from war on ice  More Graphs!  Strome's play with the team. (notice where Strait is)  this is from @IneffectiveMath. I cannot find the rest, but the take away is Brain Strait sucks compared to our other options"
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,bass_n_treble,3,Tue Jun 9 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"And yet the chances against Lubo have gone in at an insanely high rate compared to Brian Strait. The only explanation is simple: Strait has been bailed out by great goaltending, whereas Lubo has had zero goaltending luck whatsoever - a .809 SV% against is so low it is laughable.  This luck is almost certain not to continue, but for this year, it has made Visnovsky's +/- look awful, despite him being amazing at preventing the best offensive chances.   How can LHH chalk that up to luck for an entire season?  Maybe there are things stats cannot explain, like... Strait might be in better position and play conservatively behind the puck more than Lubo, who is constantly chasing guys that beat him into the D-zone.  There is really nothing in the article about matchups and difficulty of competition either.  Yes, I agree Strait should not be on the PK... Doug Weight really has no business working as a coach in any respect at this level, and I'm not saying Strait is a 1st pairing guy, but I seriously doubt Visnosky is going to play a solid season, let alone even appear in it much thanks to injuries.  There are a couple of decent guys we could sign to replace a 39 year old d-man who skates like he has cement blocks for feet"
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,dl2316,2,Tue Jun 9 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree with you and my post in no way should be taken as ""We need to keep Lubo"" I think it would be better for the team and for him (concussions), I just do not think that Brian Strait is the answer."

When did you say we were talking about post-All-Star game 2015? Oh right, you didn't until just now. LOL.  Lubo is BETTER than Mark Streit. Also, the larger the sample size the more valuable the data is. Lubo is excellent. Absolutely excellent. Even a couple bad weeks wouldn't change that.  Brian Strait is absolute garbage by all metrics, many of which I presented.  You've got hyperbole, which is apropos of absolutely nothing.  Brian Strait is not improving. Saying he is improving proves nothing, other than that you don't know very much about Brian Strait. Welcome to 2015-16 where you have to present some evidence of your assertions.  Lubomir Visnovsky is declining though, that much is true; even if you don't realize how or why. However, a declining Lubo is still a million times better than Brian Strait. Also, never forget that Lubo had one of the best games by an Islander defenseman in, probably, your entire life in Game 3.   It seems like you must have missed this one, but Game 3 happened in the recent playoff series against the Capitals. That was in the 14-15 season. Lubo was a +20 CF. Those numbers are unbelievably gaudy.  Your man Strait was a -7 on that night when the team was a +19."

NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,patio_himself,2,Mon Jun 8 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he really shouldn't tbh. Or at least play in europe where he's still probably head and shoulders above half the guys there (depending on what league he plays in)"
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,mattymonkees,2,Mon Jun 8 22:30:06 2015 UTC,Honestly rather have Donovan in. At least he'll play a whole (hopefully) season and gain a ton of experience instead of rotting in the box
NewYorkIslanders,391lqs,leeber27,2,Tue Jun 9 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you appreciate Donovan, but last I remember he is a UFA by some loophole and will not be coming back."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,jokesonjokes,3,Mon Jun 8 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"Kid looks like an intriguing addition to the team. But then comes the age old question with a variety of different answers, who would sit for him if the isles were to play him?"
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,lighthousefisherman,4,Mon Jun 8 06:46:32 2015 UTC,"A RW? Could spell the end of the road for Grabner. He is fast, he is fun, he is a good hockey player. But he caught that injury bug. Keeping him would basically guarantee line shuffling on a regular basis. Looks like we are trying to get bigger next year. Having a 6'4 power forward around doesn't sound like a bad idea to me."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Chrismercy,4,Mon Jun 8 10:03:36 2015 UTC,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  KHL players sometimes score twice as much in Russia because the league is watered down.  He might be a career AHLer, or like a Colin McDonald."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,bass_n_treble,3,Mon Jun 8 11:49:19 2015 UTC,Garth showed us he isn't comfortable with our right side when he got Kennedy. My assumption is partly based on that.
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Chrismercy,2,Mon Jun 8 12:12:03 2015 UTC,"Grabner will be healthy to start next season, and Strome is probably the second best forward on the team now.  If Cappy let some guys develop chemistry over the course of the year, maybe it would be a different story"
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,bass_n_treble,3,Mon Jun 8 12:19:27 2015 UTC,History tells me saying Grabner will be healthy is a pretty far stretch.
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Chrismercy,2,Mon Jun 8 12:30:11 2015 UTC,"I thought there was actually lower scoring in the KHL.  When Jagr went to the KHL for those few years, him numbers dropped."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,hockeycrazy033,2,Mon Jun 8 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"nah, his numbers did go down but consistently so"
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Cay_Rharles,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"Indrasis is as far of a power foward as you can get,  he is a really skilled playmaker with good hands and good shot,  but my fear is that if he hits even the AHL ice,  he will just be crushed by some grinder and will stop playing. Most of the time he could use his great hands to avoid hits, but for such a physical leauge,  there will be that one time. Oh and his numbers would be better if he had good linemates."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,defman112,2,Tue Jun 9 06:12:51 2015 UTC,He has to make the team first
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,mattymonkees,2,Mon Jun 8 15:05:13 2015 UTC,Why do we need another mediocre forward?
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Cay_Rharles,2,Mon Jun 8 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"With Collberg bombing last year and only Quine in the system, makes sense. Isles can sign the Harry Z/Kael/CMacs for grinder depth but much trickier to find skill depth.   Doubt this guy even starts, they'd still need to unload a pair of forwards (and thats not counting Kennedy) as they have 13 under contract. And if they unload a pair, they become liable to add an NHL UFA."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Jun 8 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Collberg played basically the entire year at 20 years old."
NewYorkIslanders,38z249,mattymonkees,2,Mon Jun 8 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Also had some injuries, wouldn't surprise me if he has a Quine like bounceback. Isles one of the few teams where an ECHL trip isnt a death sentence."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,escapingNihilism,17,Fri Jun 5 22:10:50 2015 UTC,Rags play in Manhattan and practice in Rye. It's not much different. In other news: fuck the rags.
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,agentanthony,8,Sat Jun 6 12:14:49 2015 UTC,RIP Iceworks. It was awesome having the team's practice center in my hometown
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,viewless25,8,Fri Jun 5 22:28:41 2015 UTC,Cool.  Let's give the Nassau County government more money.
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,jackwoww,17,Fri Jun 5 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"This isn't about nassau, this is them trying to retain the fan base on the island."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,McArctic,3,Sat Jun 6 09:56:50 2015 UTC,What are the Long Island fanbase going to do? Become Rangers fans?
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,viewless25,7,Sat Jun 6 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"The fear is that they won't show up for games and become doing disinterested. Honestly, if you stuck around though the past 20 years, you're not going anywhere when the team gets good."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,2,Sat Jun 6 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"No, but they'd most likely stop going to games which then leads to not buying merchandise."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,McArctic,3,Sat Jun 6 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to a single game for the next few years, maybe longer. But I still buy merchandise. Also, merchandise goes to the league, so its not the Islanders problem. People will show up to games if the team is good. Our team this year was mediocre by most standards and half our home games sold out. Most of the season ticket sales are from Brooklyn anyway, so we'll be fine"
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,viewless25,0,Sat Jun 6 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I really hope they won't be fine in Brooklyn.  It's too far out to go to anymore than one game a year."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,McArctic,4,Sat Jun 6 20:51:31 2015 UTC,the sooner we accept that they're not coming back the better it will be
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,-1,Sun Jun 7 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, unacceptable for me.  I'm only on the island about 3 times a year.  The move to Brooklyn means I will no longer be going to games.  It's too far out."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,McArctic,4,Sun Jun 7 13:39:25 2015 UTC,"This brings back such fond memories for me. In the very early 1980s as a small child, my dad would take me to scrimmages there. One day a fight broke out on the ice. The men in the stands, which were close enough that if you spoke with emotion would permit your saliva to rain on the ice with no effort, we're screaming and cursing with gusto, and just as the din died down,. I in my pitch perfect mine mouse voice of a nearly 3 year old girl screamed out ""you motherfather."" With the perfect gusto to sound like what it meant. As the young player sat and slumped crying in the penalty box, everyone there kackled at him. This is my earliest hockey memory.  I made a grown man cry playing hockey."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,lsp2005,4,Sat Jun 6 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"What an odd decision. I'm perplexed, why not somewhere closer to Barclays?"
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,carpy22,4,Sat Jun 6 03:32:30 2015 UTC,I think because it is very close to the Hicksville train station so the players can hop on the train to Barclays.
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,mcbordes,4,Sat Jun 6 04:21:24 2015 UTC,The previous location was closer to the LIRR at Syosset.
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,carpy22,5,Sat Jun 6 04:23:13 2015 UTC,Does that line go to Brooklyn? I thought it went to Penn?
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,3,Sat Jun 6 04:25:26 2015 UTC,"It goes to both, all lines except for the Port Washington Branch have the capability to go to both Brooklyn or Manhattan. Usually Hempstead, Far Rockaway, and Long Beach trains operate out of Brooklyn. Diesel trains complicate things, those go to Penn or Long Island City."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,carpy22,5,Sat Jun 6 04:46:42 2015 UTC,I can't picture a pro sports team catching a transfer. Seeing them all on the train would be odd enough
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,4,Sat Jun 6 14:29:47 2015 UTC,There is talks of having a direct train to Barclays from Hicksville.  This may be a good first step for those of us hoping for that train.
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,mcbordes,2,Sat Jun 6 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"Presumably with a stop at Jamaica, no? Express Hicksville to Brooklyn would be kinda crazy."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,carpy22,3,Sat Jun 6 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe a stop, definitely not a train change.  It would only run on Islander game days."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,mcbordes,2,Sat Jun 6 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"That works, hopefully they do it for Nets games as well."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,carpy22,2,Sat Jun 6 05:24:36 2015 UTC,"I they do it for Nets games, they should do it for Islanders games."
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,-4,Sat Jun 6 18:49:18 2015 UTC,I can't fathom why they don't want a location closer to Barclays. They should be called  New York Commuters
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,6,Sat Jun 6 04:26:22 2015 UTC,They live out on the island. Don't want players going from Long Island to Brooklyn back to Long Island and back to Brooklyn on days of games for practice
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,DancesWithCanoes,3,Sat Jun 6 04:41:09 2015 UTC,I wonder for how much longer that will be true. I feel like new players will want to live in Brooklyn. Such a big part of the pro brooklyn argument was that players don't want to live on Long Island
NewYorkIslanders,38q6y6,ryan924,2,Sat Jun 6 14:26:47 2015 UTC,Closest rink to Barclays is Aviator. I think that would just be to public for them.
NewYorkIslanders,38mbcx,ryan924,16,Fri Jun 5 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"He wore Isles gear (hats, shirts) progressively throughout the series.

NewYorkIslanders,38mbcx,leeber27,8,Fri Jun 5 04:09:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he made a documentary on the isles actually.

NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,TheLegendarySheep,10,Thu Jun 4 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"considering he was a con-man, i highly doubt it. if he had had the money he simply would have been a con-man with means.   He didn't want the islanders because they were the islanders. he wanted to own a team as a status symbol. IIRC he ended up trying to get a hockey team, only after it became clear he couldn't get any traction in trying to own a team in the other 3 big leagues. His professed love for the Islanders was all part of an act.    If he had actually had the money he probably would have burned Long Island the same way Peter Karmanos burned Hartford with the Whalers. Big talk of a dedicated rebuild and future glory in order to secure the team, followed by a move if things didn't immediately get better, especially if it seemed that there was more money to be had in a different market."
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,Waldo19,6,Thu Jun 4 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm so tired of people drinking the kool aid about Spano being some Isles savior. It's not bad now, but last year it was painful and embarassing to witness."
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,AC3FACE,7,Thu Jun 4 23:06:09 2015 UTC,In the Fish Sticks book it talks about he told Milbury to offer Sakic and Forsberg big offer sheets (both were RFAs that year).  He figured the Avs would match one and they could steal the other away.
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,mcbordes,3,Thu Jun 4 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"That would actually be a brilliant idea, even if it would mean people would hate Milbury (but not for long, since they'd quickly realize he was a very charitable GM... to other teams)."
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,karmapuhlease,2,Fri Jun 5 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"It actually could have been one of the dumbest moves in NHL history.  A bottom dwelling team would have brought in a star, sure but they would have given up a chance at the Joe Thornton sweepstakes (which they ended up losing) as well as the pick for Vinny Lecavalier (who, again they also didn't get).  Could you imagine the Avalanche picking up those 2 guys as compensation for Sakic or Forsberg?"
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,mcbordes,2,Fri Jun 5 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"Fair point. The way it worked out though (with us not getting anything out of those drafts - just Luongo, who we quickly traded) it would have been better to have either Sakic or Forsberg."
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,karmapuhlease,2,Fri Jun 5 19:32:54 2015 UTC,It would have prevented the Parrish and Kvasha trade from happening.  I guess I'm okay with this.
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,mcbordes,2,Fri Jun 5 19:40:29 2015 UTC,It would have been a disaster. I was watching a documentary on that guy and the wholes Isles con situation not long ago.....my god he is a complete psychopath. He literally exhibits classic traits of antisocial personality disorder.
NewYorkIslanders,38jyns,xarallei,2,Sun Jun 7 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, that documentary was what inspired me to ask the question. It was a 30 for 30 called Big Shot."
NewYorkIslanders,38fvod,cassettecowboy,15,Wed Jun 3 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"Oh Oh, I Know the answer to this one.  Back in January of 1997 the Islanders and Maple Leafs were in last and second to last in the NHL.  The Islanders own the Leafs' pick and obviously their own.  Joe Thornton was the consensus number one pick that year, think McDavid but 1997.  Frozen Pond had a signing for Thornton (since juniors doesn't have the dumb rules the NCAA has) and had him sign Islander pucks because it was almost a sure thing Toronto or the Islanders would finish last.  Boston ended up tanking as did the Sharks and the Kings so the Islanders ended up with Bobby Lu and Eric Brewer instead of Thornton (and probably Marleau).  That left Frozen Pond with a ridiculous amounts of inventory of this puck for close to 20 years now and for some reason they think they can sell it for $50 with the shipping."
NewYorkIslanders,38fvod,mcbordes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:53:43 2015 UTC,Wasn't this when Boston transparently tanked the season so they could end up with Thornton? I remember a lot of people calling foul.

There was also a goal (I believe short handed) by Kulemin in I want to say that Carolina game they lost at home but definitely around that time where it was just like Kuley saying get on my back, I'll win this game for you (though I think they lost that game).  I'll update when I figure out which game it was.  EDIT:  Found the goal, not a shorty but this camera angle doesn't do it justice.  He was between Justin Faulk and the boards, ran Faulk over and scored. http://islanders.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/recap?id=2014020925  EDIT 2: If you listen to the call Howie is talking about Semin and then calls Kulemin a former teammate of Semin's in Washington.  So much greatness in this quote.  First of all, he confused Kulemin with Grabovski.  Next, Semin was on the Hurricanes for a full year before Grabo even played for the Caps."

""OH HE'S GONNA GET AROUND THIS GUY""  ""HOLY SHIT HE SCORED""  edit: Also this one  He didn't beat Fluery cleanly, but boy oh boy is it some classic Kulemin, creating offense through his relentless play.

That memory will always stay with me as my favorite goal

I came up from ATL for that game and it was an absolutely phenomenal experience. haven't been to a hockey game since the Thrashers moved to WPG (ugh) and that game one against WAS was perfection for me. so many Islanders jerseys, so many memories of going to games (and concerts) in the barn, and so much LONG ISLAND... I was thrilled. while I miss yelling LET'S GO THRASHERS, it was fabulous to proudly yell LET'S GO ISLANDERS for 60+ mins and be hoarse for the rest of the week. absolutely incredible experience that I will also never forget.  aside, I went to that game w/ a buddy of mine who also came back from Providence and he missed the goal b/c of the long lines to the restrooms. ""I missed JT's goal b/c of the Coliseum."" so hilarious!"

NewYorkIslanders,38gs7n,FioMonstercat,3,Thu Jun 4 20:24:10 2015 UTC,Saw one where JT pretty much dumped it to himself behind the blue line and split 2 defenders to score. Not sure who it was on ( buffalo?)
NewYorkIslanders,38g5c9,dl2316,3,Thu Jun 4 00:10:01 2015 UTC,Damn it I can't make it. I was hoping to get a look around the new home for less than full price.
NewYorkIslanders,38g5c9,ArtyThePoopie,2,Thu Jun 4 03:10:30 2015 UTC,Does AHL count as prospect? I'd love to see MDC and pulock on the ice  EDIT: just checked the article when I got home and it says it right there lol gotta start clicking links on my phone

NewYorkIslanders,38g5c9,leeber27,2,Thu Jun 4 03:35:03 2015 UTC,Also there has been an autograph session after the game and skills competition.

NewYorkIslanders,38an7q,Salacondor,2,Wed Jun 3 00:58:33 2015 UTC,Yes you can. We monitor that and will address the question on air.

NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,tazgraz19,14,Tue Jun 2 20:23:34 2015 UTC,I would really support the 7:30 start time. Didn't even think of that as an option but it would definitely help for games I'm going to from Suffolk.
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,LooseSeal-,4,Tue Jun 2 21:04:51 2015 UTC,"It's funny...I work in Manhattan and I almost never went to midweek games at the Coli because i found it very hard to get there by 7p.  The 7.30p start time would have been very helpful, and I certainly would have gone to more games."

Thank God. I have been 20 minutes away from Uniondale and just get static    I must be misunderstanding something. 25% of session ticket sales come from Long Island ( Nassau and Suffolk) and 33% from Brooklyn?

NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,ryan924,8,Tue Jun 2 22:37:26 2015 UTC,try being a Isles fan from CT....thank god for Sirius
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,aldostrada,6,Wed Jun 3 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"The rest is made up by other counties, just no other county has more than brooklyn and nassau/Suffolk"
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Scapone22,2,Tue Jun 2 22:50:23 2015 UTC,Maybe we are gaining some regional appeal then? Seems strange to think about. Or maybe enough Long Islanders have moved.
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,ryan924,2,Tue Jun 2 22:55:55 2015 UTC,There are a lot of counties throughout MY though.  5% here 8% there and you make up the rest.
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Scapone22,2,Tue Jun 2 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"It's still an indication of broader appeal. Having a more accessible location does that. It sucks so much that they won't be in Uniondale anymore, and I am still not over how mad I am, but this move will be good for the team in the long run."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,ryan924,2,Tue Jun 2 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"Do we know what the numbers were at the coliseum? A lot of these holders are retained, I'm not certain there has  been a huge increase."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Scapone22,2,Tue Jun 2 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"I would like to compare the county breakdown between this and the past few years. I would be surprised if there is not a significant increase in county diversity. I mean, if you don't live in Nassue, Suffolk, or Western Queens, getting to NCMV would be very hard. But Barclays gives you access to much more area."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,ryan924,2,Wed Jun 3 02:40:59 2015 UTC,only full season tickets have been sold so far. no partials or singles yet
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,DancesWithCanoes,2,Wed Jun 3 02:33:44 2015 UTC,They didn't announce what makes up the other 42%. But Best mentioned later on Twitter that Manhattan was around 20%.

It sucks for Nassau County (don't live there though so I can't get that upset) but that's the politicians' fault. I'm looking forward to the new stadium and I hope it gives the team that little extra something it will need to continue competing for the Cup."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,kyleT_NYC,11,Tue Jun 2 21:50:12 2015 UTC,FUCK KATE MURRAY!
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,NordicReagan,2,Wed Jun 3 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"sucks worse for suffolk county. Been going for 25 years tailgating and having fun at the rink, now I have to sit on a shit train and deal with transfers for 2.5 hours each way as opposed to a 50 minute drive. fuck the barclays, I'd rather watch from home at this point given the shit seating options and higher ticket prices."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,kyleT_NYC,2,Wed Jun 3 17:54:25 2015 UTC,Where do you live that it takes you 50 minutes to get to the Coliseum but 2.5 hours to get to Barclays?
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Madlameusername,2,Wed Jun 3 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"I live near westhampton, I can hop on sunrsise to southern state and hit the meadowbrook and be there in 50-55 min, if I take a train its 30 min to ronkonkoma, wait for train, hour to jamaica, wait for transfer (ive had to wait upwards of 30 min before depending on schedule), then ride to the stop by barclays which is like 15-20 min... I probably would still drive but if I get out of work at 530 and the games at 7 ill be in rush hour trying to get to a game and no way im making it to brooklyn from the east end. I'll just go see them play the rags at MSG and take a train from ronk-penn and have an easier ride."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,NordicReagan,3,Wed Jun 3 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"I live near westhampton, I can hop on sunrsise to southern state and hit the meadowbrook and be there in 50-55 min   Damn, that's crazy. I live in Babylon north of the train station right by the southern state and it takes me about 45 minutes to get to the coliseum. The train takes about 60-75 minutes so it's not really a big deal for me. I don't mind an extra 30 minutes if it means I don't have to be responsible for a vehicle."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,kyleT_NYC,2,Wed Jun 3 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"Ahh damn. Yeah you're pretty far out. I'm pretty impressed that you can get to the Coliseum in a little under an hour. Takes me like, 45 coming from Stony Brook"
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Justwritingstuff,2,Wed Jun 3 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"yea, its about that from my girlfriends in nesconset, once you have to travel north it gets crazy, but I can stay south shore pretty much, sometimes ill take ocean parkway and avoid traffic all together too and its a great drive maybe adds 10 min. I also probably am not doing the speed limit lol!! maybe like 70mph average"
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,bageloid,2,Wed Jun 3 20:32:31 2015 UTC,You could still drive. Parking is actually cheaper near the barclays than it was at NVMC.   The Barclays also offered several unobstructed seating options that were cheaper than any at NVMC if I'm not mistaken. They could be all sold out by this point though.
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,emjay914,2,Wed Jun 3 19:02:11 2015 UTC,The 329 to 229 thing has been known for a while.
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,quigs17,2,Tue Jun 2 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, put the most passionate fans where they won't be able to see shit..."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,emjay914,5,Wed Jun 3 11:52:31 2015 UTC,The view from 229 isn't bad so long as you're standing. Which for us is the norm
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,Justwritingstuff,3,Wed Jun 3 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that you couldn't see a good chunk of that end of the ice from that area...maybe it helps if you are standing, which is kind of scary up there...it is really steep."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,emjay914,3,Wed Jun 3 17:52:04 2015 UTC,"With how angry a lot of people are about the move I wouldn't put too much weight in what you read on message boards. It seems like the people who have never actually been to the Barclays are the most vocal about ""terrible sightlines""."
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,quigs17,2,Wed Jun 3 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"I wasn't putting any weight in what was written on the message boards, I was referring to the view provided on the Barclays site...according to that picture you can't even see the entire goal crease on that end, or the near face off dot. http://nyislanders.io-media.com/#/vr/Section/229/13/11/d"
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,bageloid,2,Wed Jun 3 20:02:45 2015 UTC,During the pre season game they brought us around the arena to let us find a good spot to sit.  229 happened to be one of the best.  It's in the same corner as 329 as well
NewYorkIslanders,389pnu,aldostrada,4,Wed Jun 3 19:31:39 2015 UTC,It's also only 15 a ticket.
NewYorkIslanders,385uzs,ryan924,2,Tue Jun 2 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"it's just so strange to see something that looks so good for the franchise, yet so shitty for its actual fan base. Weeknight games? Ha. Impossible for many."
NewYorkIslanders,385uzs,islander1,2,Tue Jun 2 23:39:03 2015 UTC,Yeah man it would have been so much easier getting from Nassau to Kansas City for the weeknight games.  I feel ya.
NewYorkIslanders,385uzs,nofx516,2,Wed Jun 3 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Of course Brooklyn beats nothing.  However, either scenario sees fans in Suffolk unavailable to attend weeknight games.  I guess it's a good thing they can only hold 14k fans."
NewYorkIslanders,385uzs,islander1,2,Wed Jun 3 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a good thing they can only hold 14k fans.    If it's anything like nassau they won't have to worry about more than 7,000 people showing up anyway haha."
NewYorkIslanders,386irh,ryan924,6,Tue Jun 2 05:08:23 2015 UTC,Horribly written and offers absolutely nothing of any value.

NewYorkIslanders,386irh,mcbordes,10,Tue Jun 2 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but let's not parade this shit in this subreddit. Keep it at the high school level."
NewYorkIslanders,386irh,BrainOfG,6,Tue Jun 2 16:24:42 2015 UTC,100% agreed.

NewYorkIslanders,383dq8,viewless25,2,Mon Jun 1 21:37:49 2015 UTC,Didn't want to sign with a team that wouldn't give him a chance at cracking the NHL roster.
NewYorkIslanders,383dq8,hardcorelegend43,2,Mon Jun 1 21:57:40 2015 UTC,That's crazy to think that we have enough D to let a guy walk
NewYorkIslanders,383dq8,superfluity87,2,Mon Jun 1 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"I read about this yesterday, and it still hasn't set well with me. Seems like he was a decent player. I hate to see a guy like that walk. Especially when Reinhardt, pullock, and Mayfield haven't been at the big league level long enough to see if they're going to pan out. I love DeHaan, but he's got some injury issues. Matt Donovan is a turnover machine and though he surprised me in the playoffs hasn't shown me much in the regular season. Perhaps it's just me, but I would have rather seen them let Donovan walk and give Russo a shot. Especially since I don't see a long term future for Straight and Hickey."
NewYorkIslanders,383dq8,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Tue Jun 2 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"You have Boych, Leddy, Hamonic, and CdH all locked inlongterm. Hickey's an RFA and Lubo wants to return. Throw in Reinhart, Pulock, Mayfield, Pelech (lotsa of people forget about him, played on the WJC teams, and logged heavy PP/PK/ES minutes sometimes 30+ a night in juniors. Can move the puck and dish out big hits), Grahame (dude can skate) plus guys like Czurz and Leduc in the system and you have Burroughs AHL eligible.   I'd prefer to keep him, but they'd need a few more guys shipped out to realistically have a spot for him."

NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,clebo99,3,Mon Jun 1 14:54:32 2015 UTC,The economic status of Russia is making it hard to keep teams funded.
NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,eggy333,4,Mon Jun 1 15:13:51 2015 UTC,I was starting to think he'd never come over.  He could be a moving piece. Snow might try to combo him and something/someone else.
NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,leeber27,3,Mon Jun 1 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"Oh my ahahahhaha the BlueChipPrince is finally here.   Big, can cover ground when he gets momentum, sick hands and snapper around the crease, and surprisingly agile down low. Basically russian Ander Lee. Was supposedly holding on coming over (despite attending a camp) cause of ailing health of his beloved Grandma (EDIT: MOM credit Ent@Work).   Should shore up forward depth and has a shot at making an impact (sustained or as a burst). Could also become trade bait with a strong camp. He has natural abilities that a team short on forwards can salivate over."
NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Jun 1 18:13:58 2015 UTC,How has him production been though? Last I checked in this guy was getting benched a lot and not much of anything from a numbers stand point.
NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,LooseSeal-,2,Mon Jun 1 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"Playing under a different coach last two years, was pushed from top 6 minutes to 4th line and was being offered to another team for 100 million ruples. The other team balked, which is why he's now (supposedly) coming over.   With Kirrill, he's a power winger playing on Olympic Ice. Did have 16 goals as a 22 year old in ~50 games, never topped it again. If you're expecting Todd Bertuzzi 80-90 points, nah man. But the dude is talented and has high end skills in traffic/crease areas.   Isles needed to address F depth at the AHL level, bringing in guys who can impact at the NHL level, this does that."
NewYorkIslanders,382e0r,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Jun 1 19:34:43 2015 UTC,Actually I believe his mother had the serious health issues.

NewYorkIslanders,38146w,Waldo19,3,Mon Jun 1 15:01:03 2015 UTC,I feel that the Dal Colle was the least hyped 1st rounder of all the first rounders we have had in the past 5 years and I think he will be the best of the bunch
NewYorkIslanders,38146w,aldostrada,2,Mon Jun 1 18:24:58 2015 UTC,He's the most complete Hockey player under 20 years old this franchise has seen since Tavares. The Metro better prepare for this duo.
NewYorkIslanders,38146w,RyPhy,2,Mon Jun 1 22:02:46 2015 UTC,Dal Colle is gonna have to be really impressive to say he's better than Niederreiter or Strome.

NewYorkIslanders,38146w,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Tue Jun 2 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"Or 73 pts in 161 games (wow, what a difference playing on a team with an NHL coach does)"
NewYorkIslanders,38146w,bass_n_treble,2,Tue Jun 2 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Oof yeah not even a point every-other-game clip, Josh Bailey production minus the defensive awareness. Nino has a load of talent hashmarks in, reason why the Isles took him, but the guy has done nothing that MdC isn't capable of matching/exceeding. MdC has a 40 point campaign sometime in his first two years and he's bested him. Nino hasn't done anything exceedingly noteworthy, a pair of sub 40 point years with questionable defense/footspeed/no 200 ft game to speak of isn't a barrier uncrossable."

NewYorkIslanders,380sbc,Cay_Rharles,3,Mon Jun 1 18:27:33 2015 UTC,A long islander with an unpopular onion.   Hes an outstanding musician and a poor lyricist with a even worse formula.  A pop hit machine.

NewYorkIslanders,380sbc,DancesWithCanoes,2,Mon Jun 1 02:22:51 2015 UTC,These are not the same banners.  Those banners have been there.
NewYorkIslanders,380sbc,mcbordes,3,Mon Jun 1 12:43:32 2015 UTC,They had replicas for the preseason games. Now that the original banners are packed up they have been brought over.
NewYorkIslanders,380sbc,DancesWithCanoes,2,Mon Jun 1 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"They were there for Nets games too.  Same spot.  Why would they put up the cups and not the retired numbers if those were the original banners?  EDIT: This is only news because Shannon Hogan went to the Ed Sheeran concert.  Unless you have a source saying they have been unpacked and sent up to the rafters, I don't believe it."

NewYorkIslanders,37zgy3,ugotpandaowned,5,Sun May 31 22:42:42 2015 UTC,Can't really root for an east team right?  But I'm tired of seeing Chicago win and the media slobbing Toews' knob.  Just gonna hope for an awesome series.
NewYorkIslanders,37zgy3,zeile33,4,Mon Jun 1 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"In a typical situation, I would root for the team in the West; but, the Bolts haven't been to a Stanley Cup Final in over ten years and I always enjoy the chance to a team that hasn't won it win it over a team that has more recently (unless it was us of course!) So with that said, Go Bolts!"

NewYorkIslanders,37zgy3,Clown_Shoe,2,Sun May 31 19:20:28 2015 UTC,Going for the bolts for sure! Great scrappy squad and they did knock out the rags!

They're diluting the meaning of the term ""dynasty"" (if the Kings win the Cup next year, does that mean there were two simultaneous dynasties?!) and I think there's still some chance of salvaging it if the Lightning win this year to stop the Hawks at 2."

Their 3 cup wins were almost all 5 years apart from one another and they had the gal to call it a dynasty. 4 in a row or bust I say!

Then when I looked it up to confirm my facts I started to dive deeper and holy shit they were bad."
NewYorkIslanders,37xij1,Stonecipher_LaVache,12,Sun May 31 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"The Rangers aen't even the OG NY team. Only reason they've been asserted as such was because there were no alternatives left till the Isles.   Before the original 6 era, the Americans were slated to move to Brooklyn, same street different corner of Barclays. Why? Because in an attempt to secure more money ""Tex"" Rickard convinced the league to let him create a team that would be tied directly to MSG rather than a tenant. The league obliged, even though his interest in hockey was so lo he'd cancel games for the fucking circus.  However MSG didn't stop there. When WW2 hit and the Americans couldnt find replacements, they paid the league off to ensure that the AMericans wouldnt be back so they could monopolize the NY market. Thus was born the greatest sham in sports marketing.   It'd be the equivalent of a Scottish person buying the land of the Guinness brewery, making their own beer in it, then waiting for the British's policies of genocide to finish the Irish off so as to declare their Scottish beer as the true original Irish beer.   TL;DR: Rangers gleefully sat back as Nazi's killed Americans and paid off the powers that be to make sure what lived would never play again."

They've been around for like 90 years and have 4 championships, only 1 of which came with more than 6 teams to compete with.  1 in 70 years.  More recently they've had amazing regular season teams that always struggle in the playoffs eeking  out game 7 win after game 7 win until they have nothing left when it's all on the line.  Fact is they're really good right now and will be a threat to win for a few more years at least but have yet to prove anything."

NewYorkIslanders,37stz8,superfluity87,7,Sat May 30 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"They won the presidents trophy in a year when half the league was in on the McEichel sweepstakes. It's a great accomplishment, just not as impressive as it could be. It's more my dissapointment in how teams acted this year than on the accomplishment of winning the presidents. I still think it takes something away from it. They're also in a boat load of trouble. Literally half their team is up for free agency, and considering they've made deep runs two years in a row guys are going to be asking a kings ransom. Doesn't look good IMO. Isles have a few tough cap decisions to make, but we have tons of youth in the wings that could fill the gap that I'm personally excited for."
NewYorkIslanders,37stz8,Justwritingstuff,3,Sat May 30 04:01:31 2015 UTC,I am definitely not the most knowledgeable hockey person (I've only been paying attention to the full NHL for 3 seasons now even though I've always been an Isles fan) so I thank you for speaking to this more eloquently than I could.
NewYorkIslanders,37stz8,superfluity87,3,Sat May 30 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"hah thanks. I've been watching hockey for a long time. I've also been lucky to make friends with fellow hockey fans (even if some of them are dirty rags fans!). We're always bouncing ideas, concepts, and feelings about going on's in the league. Any time I meet a hockey fan, I'm always excited. It's always hard to find people who truly enjoy the sport, and those that do are really passionate about it. That's what I love about this sport. The vast majority of people who watch it really do care about it. The bandwagoners only come out during the playoffs, for the most part. Few other sports are like this great game."
NewYorkIslanders,37stz8,Chrismercy,2,Sat May 30 16:16:14 2015 UTC,Who are they losing to FA? I haven't been up on that kind of stuff since cap geek went down.
NewYorkIslanders,37stz8,Justwritingstuff,3,Sat May 30 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"Martin St. Louis may call it a career after this year. Sheppard is a UFA, but Haglin, Stephan, Fast, J.T. Miller, Lindberg, Klingberg, and Hunwick are all RFAs. Having an RFA isn't horrible, but again they made two deep cup runs. Some of the guys I mentioned are going to want a big pay raise, and will look elsewhere if they don't get it. At least that's how I think it will play out logically. Their cap hit is already at 58 million without those players. If they're lucky the cap goes up to 73 this year. That leaves you with just shy of 15 mill (because I rounded up) to resign half their team. Good luck with that. On a side note here are a few good sites to use in the wake of cap geeks death:  Sportrac.com  hockeybuzz.com  Edit - I linked them all to the Rags payroll for a quicker view of what i'm talking about."

NewYorkIslanders,37jd9t,bageloid,2,Thu May 28 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"but that's just like his opinion man. I think he's ready to come up. He's one of the most dominant players in the OHL and he's coming off a full length season, so I think his conditioning is better now than it will be if he sits out another year."
NewYorkIslanders,37jd9t,viewless25,1 point,Fri May 29 00:26:33 2015 UTC,I am thinking his opinion is based on conversations with isles staff.
NewYorkIslanders,37jd9t,bageloid,1 point,Fri May 29 00:28:02 2015 UTC,Also this team hasn't rushed any of our prospects so I have a feeling they will let him take another year. I don't think it would hurt to give him a few games up though and see how he does.
NewYorkIslanders,37jd9t,lutharvaughn,1 point,Fri May 29 10:59:27 2015 UTC,"What does his conditioning NOW matter? We're not watching Isles hockey till October. Is he suddenly gonna lose conditioning playing next year?  For a variety of reasons, no. Isles can develop him as much as they want and its to their benefit to do so cause it defers his UFA years and gives them more value on his rookie deal (not too mention the on ice advantages of development). There is nothing MdC has done that has put him on any more of a fast track than Strome or Reinhart.   He could probably play on about 15-20 teams in this league off the bat easily, but Isles so deep upfront and are transitioning from a fast track rebuilding team to a slow-cooking contender. Even on D, 5-7 D prospects and maybe 1 spot (assuming one of Hickey or Viz isnt back, if both are its 0) open in the NHL. Garth is waitin' till the meats sloughin' off."
NewYorkIslanders,37jd9t,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Fri May 29 13:34:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He still needs to put on some weight and add some more muscle. Right now he's kind of lanky. Once he adds some muscle on he'll be a lot bigger and stronger. This is really the main thing he has to work on but other aspects of his game like defense and maybe playing a bit more of a physical game can be improved. We also don't have a spot for him next season. We're filled up front. All in all, he's just not quite ready yet. No harm in having him play another year of juniors. He'll likely be one of the best players in the OHL next season and will probably be Canada's top player at the WJC. He'll gain more confidence and perfect his skills. By the beginning of the 2016-17 season we'll have a 6'3"", 200lb sniper that can step right into the top 6."

Either he will remain with ""Dinamo"", which seems to be found means to continue in the KHL,[1] or will go to another league and even he has an offer from the NHL from the ""Islanders"".  Miks in Riga will be only in the case if the club significantly improve the conditions of the contract. The problem for the ""Dinamo"" is that in the hands of the attacker has an offer from another club KHL, which meets the requirements of the player and his agent.[2] At the same time, there is an old dream Indrašis try their hand in the NHL. Future for Latvian striker should become clearer in the next few days.   -[1]  I have no idea what that's supposed to mean. I'm assuming it's saying that he could stay in the KHL but with a different team? I didn't want to edit that bit because I really have no idea.  -[2] No idea wtf this means either. Probably saying that offers from other KHL teams are better than Dinamo Riga's, thus pricing him out of their grasp.  Overall, it seems to be more rumour than fact in my opinion, but either way we'll see in the coming days if there's any truth to it.  edit: Also here's some discussion (with real latvians!) from hf. It seems that he has made it known that he wants to play in the NHL. I'm starting to believe this rumour a bit more, and based off what was said in that thread I want him to come over because our AHL offense could use warm bodies (and who knows, maybe he makes the team/gets called up), but I won't get my hopes up for a deal."

NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,Waldo19,2,Thu May 28 16:04:21 2015 UTC,They'll make moves before the season starts with cap strapped teams.
NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Thu May 28 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"Isles need to inject some skill upfront depth wise. They graduated all their top forwards in a year or two span. I'd like to keep Harry Z, Kael, CMac around while adding some young talent (ideally Collberg can stay healthy and productive). This guy fits the bill and doesn't seem out of the question for him to atleast start in the AHL.   Unfortunately for Isles, they are sort of hitting a weird spot where it seems all their pro-ready/eligible prospects are D and they are backed up in that position. Not the worst problem to have, especially when you can trade guys like Pedan for a 3rd (whom I actually liked, still wouldn't surprise me if he makes it)."
NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Thu May 28 16:44:10 2015 UTC,Well they did draft like 9 d in one draft. We were weak and now it's an asset but now we need wingers.
NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,DeBlaz07,2,Thu May 28 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, they drafted 10 straight (counting Pulock) D. The last forward taken was Mitchel Theoret in the 7th and not another was taken until Camaratta in the 3rd/4th of the Pulock draft.   The MdC/JHS picks were huge for them. Filled major positional needs and both have elite upside.   GMGS's plan can be looked at as draft a lot of centers, draft a lot of dmen, then fill in the gaps with BPA's that can fill needs."
NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,leeber27,1 point,Thu May 28 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"From someone in the know of his game:  Join Date: May 2015 Posts: 1  vCash: 500 Latvian forward coming to Islanders system? This is what I writed about him to other Islanders fan site.  Sup guys, I have read/heard a rumour today, that Islanders offered a contract to 24. years old Latvian born forward Miks Indrasis. As i'm paying a lot of attention to international hockey/European hockey leagues, I know few things about his game. First of all here is his Stats in his career.  Last few seasons he played in KHL/Dinamo Riga, main reason why I think he leave that team is because his contract ended this last season and the team has some problems with funds.  He put up pretty good numbers for one of the last placed teams in KHL. His strength I will say is his sense of hockey and he have really good hands, he is pretty big in size, he know how to score a goal, but he is not that strong, I think that is his one weakness, he needs to get stronger to play in North America imo, but he has prove in Worlds/Olympics that he can belong here. Also his minus is that he likes to play with the puck a lot, go around d-guys outplay them with some moves, but most of the times he gets pushed by defender and he doesn't have that strength to push back and get over the d-guy.  Indrasis hands are very good, you can see in this SICK goal what he scored in KHL. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivrp8Nlp97I  He is not unknown for North American scouts, cause after his really great debut in Worlds in 2012, In 7 games he got 3 goals and 2 assists, under the coach Ted Nolan who last season was coach for Sabres and few years ago for Islanders.  In that summer he was with Chicago Blackhawks in prospect camp and two years ago with Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks working out. In one Ted Nolan's interview he said, that Indrasis could play in NHL, if he gets stronger. Main thing is that if he accepts Islanders offer, he will start play in my opinion at Islanders AHL team Bridgeport Sound Tigers. He is great talent to watch.   Some highlights from past few seasons.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NNmYTVc5OU"

NewYorkIslanders,37jgf5,Hex65,2,Thu May 28 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. But I will say this for the Rat, when he was up I think he gave us the best he could. It's just that his best wasn't good enough for an extended stay."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,islesandpizza,7,Wed May 27 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand all the Lubo hate going on in this sub (by hate I mean not wanting him around). Yeah, he's injury prone and pretty old. That doesn't mean the guy is cryptic and can't play the game anymore. He has some of the best passing on our team and quarterbacks plays (no not because he is slower than everyone, but because he genuinely controls plays). The guy was a +5 in the playoffs; which is clear evidence of him being around and controlling play for the goals.   Obviously he shouldn't be around in the top 4, but if we could get him for 1-2 mill I'd take that. He would be a great veteran pair with pulock/mayfield/reinhart (even better with pulock cause his shot mixed with vis's passing could be deadly). He's not playing well? fine, make him number 7 for a night and give someone else time. Get's injured? guess what... he doesn't count toward the cap when on IR and we can bring a kid up in the meantime. Honestly it's not the end of the world if we get this guy back on the squad and would actually help us out."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,leeber27,1 point,Thu May 28 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Pulock, Mayfeild and Reinhart compete and the best two play."

NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,leeber27,2,Thu May 28 15:16:56 2015 UTC,They are going to keep being rookies if we don't ever play them.
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,tanu24,1 point,Thu May 28 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"You can get rookies into a lineup over time, not throw them in at once. Not to mention a contract for Vis would be very short term (1-2 years); by then whatever rookie makes it out of camp is no longer a rookie and another prospect can come into the lineup as a rookie. There is no rush for guys like pulock (who is 19) and reinhart (who is 21 and needs a lot of work before pros). Vis is a good bridge to bring them in 1 at a time and give them valuable leadership."

NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,leeber27,1 point,Thu May 28 20:06:02 2015 UTC,But what if two of them aren't ready for the NHL yet? Why not make it a competition with Lubo as well?
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,ugotpandaowned,1 point,Thu May 28 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"What if I said I felt he doesn't look up to the challenge anymore? By no means am I discrediting his skill but he looked like a punching bag out there. How many more concussions can he actually sustain before he is forced to step down? Personally, I believe we should be looking outside the box for the right guy for Hammonic. Free agency has some good names and Lubbo would free up A LOT of cap space. I can't speak for you but deHaan does not come off as a #4 just yet. He puts a lot of pressure on Hammer to pick up the slack. Hammer deserves an experienced partner so he can just play his game. mayfield, Reinhart, & pulock could duke it out for that last spot with deHaan leaving Hickey and strait as some serious depth."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,Chrismercy,1 point,Thu May 28 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"His decision is clearly something entirely different than people saying he doesn't have the skill anymore/is too old to continue playing. If he feels that it's detrimental to his health, then he won't sign anything- that is entirely different than what my comment is about (which is arguing why the isles shouldn't let him walk). His health is up to him and if he wants to stop playing because of it then good for him.  Vis is already freeing up cap space; his contract is over. Hence me saying if we could get him back for 1-2 mill that would be great. As for Dehaan, I agree he was very poor this year. I would like to say that's just the sophomore slump hitting him hard, but it's difficult to say. If he could come back and play the way he did his rookie year he should be in the top 4.   Signing a UFA would be difficult cause the isles already gotta look at extending guys on the current roster next season; so whoever they got would have to be very cap friendly. Also, many of the UFA's are only a few years younger than Vis or play worse than Vis, and the one's that aren't either of those will be looking for a long term deal. A long term deal would lock up 4 Dmen (doesn't sound bad at first) but that means our top prospects would be fighting over the 5/6/7 role with strait, hickey, and then dehaan (that would be 6 guys if you're only considering the prospects in question to be pulock, reinhart, and mayfield). A short contract to help ease rookies in is exactly what we need and from the UFA list you're not finding anyone to fill the role as well as Vis can."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,leeber27,2,Thu May 28 16:57:57 2015 UTC,Only if he stuck around as a number 7. And even then it would be too crowded with Hickey/Strait on the bottom pair while three prospects fight over the last spot on D.
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Wed May 27 22:38:38 2015 UTC,Even then I would rather re-sign Dono or someone else for a 7. Sorry Viz :(
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,_stee,2,Thu May 28 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'd like to see Strait/Hickey on the left with Vis and Pulock or Mayfield splitting time on the right, but I doubt Vis would outplay one of the prospects enough to earn regular time, especially once they got acclimated to the NHL. As for Donovan, he is without a doubt gone on July 1st. We'll probably end up rotating Hickey, Strait, and whatever D prospect makes the team on the third pair."

Why he'd jump ship now is beyond me."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,Punk_In_Drublic16,4,Wed May 27 19:50:58 2015 UTC,His concussion history is awful. Hes slowed down and hes probably not in the Isles plans for the future.
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,tanu24,1 point,Wed May 27 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"People always cite Lubo's ""amazing"" ability to break up developing plays.  Want to know why he always has to do that?  Because he's slowed down and forwards constantly beat him, making the play happen in the first place.  And next year he'll be a year older and a year slower.  He might not even make the plays now after getting beat next year.  Even Brian Strait, arguably our most improved player (or Bailey), looked better than Lubo last year.  I'd rather see Mayfield, Pulock and Reinhart fight for a spot."

No way he will just sit on a pile of money this free agency. I think he knows he needs to show case what he can do as a GM or he could be on the block. I think there will be snow in the forecast this July.
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,Chrismercy,1 point,Thu May 28 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"Show casing what he can do doesn't necessarily mean he should throw that money away. We do have cap space ($14,250,357) but he needs to be smart about it. That space can quickly diminish when you see we have to sign Lee and Nelson this offseason (both RFA's and should be a cheap bridge deal), extend neilson, okposo, grabner, martin, cizikas (I think they'll let a couple of them walk/trade but for arguments sake lets say he signed them all), and one of the biggest next year would be signing strome off his RFA deal (that could be a huge 4 mill deal based on his performance). After considering all of that our cap space looks a lot smaller (even if you consider a cap raise, which wouldn't be a big amount)"
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,leeber27,1 point,Thu May 28 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Perhaps it was a contingency plan? Cause they had quotes from Grabner too. I'd like him back because he's still good. Him, Hickey, and Strait as the 5-7 is ok enough with Reinhart, Pulock, Mayfield, and even Grahame and Pelech down there. With Russo turning pro also they may need to trim somebody especially if they want a carry a call-up vet.   I dont see Garth rushing on this, rather if he can trade rights to Hickey/Strait for some picks having Lubo in the back pocket makes it easy. But never know, could happen soon too and then sort it out later."
NewYorkIslanders,37hqq0,Stonecipher_LaVache,0,Wed May 27 21:56:35 2015 UTC,I say keep Hickey and Strait.  Both were serviceable last year.  Lubo was showing his age.  It's time to let him walk.

NewYorkIslanders,3712gs,hockeycrazy033,2,Sun May 24 02:14:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the article guys.    The Islanders' move to Brooklyn has emerged as an issue in the race for Nassau district attorney, with Democrats pledging to spend money to highlight Republican Kate Murray's role in blocking the $3.8 billion development around Nassau Coliseum that the team said was needed for it to remain on Long Island.       Murray, the Hempstead Town supervisor, is dealing with renewed criticism on social media from angry fans who blame her for the Islanders' departure. And acting District Attorney Madeline Singas, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the office, is now trying to capitalize by welcoming those fans' support of her, despite what's driving it.       But Murray argues that her critics overlook the complexity of the yearslong saga that led to the hockey team's decision to leave, saying the fans ""give me a lot more power than I have.""       Political and sports business experts say Murray will have to often address the complaints of frustrated fans. But they are split over the potential impact of the issue at the polls in November.       ""Lots of people say that sports do not mean that much, but it is big money and it can be big politics,"" said Lee Igel, co-director of the New York University School of Professional Studies' Sports and Society Program. ""Sports do matter, because they get people fired up, especially if a politician had anything to do with their team staying or not.""       Stanley Klein, an LIU Post political science professor, said Islanders fans, with the team's move still fresh, will surely ""have a voice"" in the campaign.       ""The real passionate ones will stay passionate and will not vote for her,"" said Klein, also a Suffolk GOP committeeman. ""But is it a big enough group to determine an election? No.""       Murray, who announced her candidacy for district attorney May 4 -- nine days after the Islanders played their last game at Nassau Coliseum -- became Hempstead supervisor in 2003. A few years afterward, Islanders owner Charles Wang sought town zoning approval for his privately funded, county backed $3.8 billion Lighthouse project.       It would have renovated the 40-year-old Coliseum in Uniondale and built 8.8 million square feet of additional retail, hotel and housing units on 77 acres of surrounding land. Wang said that level of development was needed to make the arena component financially viable.       But Murray opposed the plan, saying it would have a major impact on traffic, the water supply and the environment.       Hempstead's GOP-led town board pressed for a drastically scaled-down proposal, which Wang resisted. In 2012, a year after a referendum to allow the county to borrow $400 million for a new arena failed, Wang announced he was moving the Islanders to Brooklyn in 2015.       ""I think a lot of people who are Islanders fans think the [Lighthouse] proposals had to do with rehabbing the Coliseum or rebuilding a new one, and that was it,"" Murray said in a recent interview. ""It was far from it. It was a mini-city, 2,300 apartments, and you would never get across Hempstead Turnpike with the traffic. . . . It simply was not sustainable.""       Nassau Democratic chairman Jay Jacobs, who backs Singas over former Manhattan prosecutor Michael Scotto for the party nomination to face Murray in the district attorney election, said the county party ""absolutely"" will spend money to highlight the Islanders issue.       ""Wang was going to spend his money to rebuild the Coliseum and it could only be done as part of a larger redevelopment to make it economically feasible. The one thing stopping it was Kate Murray,"" Jacobs said. ""We are going to be reminding people about that.""       County GOP chairman Joseph Mondello didn't respond to a request for comment last week. But a party source predicted that the issue won't hurt Murray, who was re-elected by wide margins in 2011 and 2013, after it was clear the team would not stay in Nassau.       ""It's a very small group of die-hards,"" the GOP source said of fans who attack Murray online. ""The proof of their impact is in the last couple of elections, where it didn't make a difference.""       Still, practically every time Murray's name appears on Twitter, Islanders fans respond in bunches, no matter the issue.       Earlier this month, when Murray tweeted the telephone number of a county police tip line to report graffiti vandals, one fan posted: ""I'd like to report the theft of my hockey team.""       Singas was quick to get involved. In one tweet this month she wrote, ""Thank you #Islesnation for all your support,"" and released a statement predicting she'd be enjoying fans' post-goal ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" chant on election night this fall.       Joe Lozito, a North Bellmore resident and outspoken Islanders fan who says he met his wife at a home game in 1992, acknowledged that his anger toward Murray prompted him to offer to help Singas, whom he had never heard of.       ""I don't know anything about this woman and here I am throwing my full support her way,"" said Lozito, 44, who also was honored by the Islanders in 2011 as a ""hometown hero"" for subduing a knife-wielding man who had attacked him on the New York City subway.       ""You're going to get a lot of people who don't normally vote,"" Lozito predicted. ""If [Singas] wins, a big part of it will definitely be from Islander fans."""

NewYorkIslanders,36xo0q,vagrantstart,3,Sat May 23 02:12:19 2015 UTC,He REALLY took advantage of Wang being on the way out and therefore having more freedom to spend more money and get players to actually join our team. His work is why Boychuk and Leddy both ended up loving it here and signed for 7 years when they could have easily gone to another team. I have no idea what exactly goes through his mind sometimes but hey don't question it; it worked this season.

NewYorkIslanders,36xo0q,Justwritingstuff,0,Sat May 23 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"And when they play hockey in May, Snow will get a nomination for GM of the year.  Maybe when he hires some NHL coaches (who can figure out maybe Grabner is a good enough player to make the lineup instead of Tyler Kennedy, or to put Boychuk on PP1 and move Kyle ""Oh! Post no!!!"" off the point or pull Halak for a 6-on-4 for the last two minutes of his 2015 playoffs) he'll have some hardware for his fireplace.  Until then, enjoy the University of Maine cronyism and trying to figure out who Tavares' linemates are for the last six years.  Ledecky and Malkin better tighten that leash.  If Capuano and Weight fail this year, Snow may also be on the unemployment line with them for re-signing stupidity over and over again.  Anyone see healthy scratches Brock Nelson and Anders Lee lighting the lamp in the IIHF tournament?  I heard the coach of that team wasn't U of Maine alumni with mysterious job security.  Just a rumor though."
NewYorkIslanders,36xo0q,dubbs505050,2,Sun May 24 12:07:42 2015 UTC,"Anyone see healthy scratches Brock Nelson and Anders Lee lighting the lamp in the IIHF tournament?    Do you really think it's fair to compare the NHL to the IIHF?  The level of competetion in the NHL is head and shoulders above that of the IIHF, no? Nelson is doing very well. But not better than he did early this season under Capuano. And isn't Lees point production below average for NHL/AHL players?  Totally agree about Capuano sucking though Haha.   But still. Your biggest criticisms of snow seem to be things that snow is not responsible for. (ie coaching mistakes) Which, on the surface seems to fall on snow, but I think really falls on cheap-skate wang not opening up the coaching budget. I imagine we won't see Capuano leave until Malkin and Lednecky take over regardless of how the next season turns out. You fail to recognize his bringing in 7 roster players in a single season and turning a bottom 5 team into a playoff contender.   Edit: I also don't understand your criticism of Okposo on the point. He's unarguably the team's second best scorer. He outscored the entire team despite playing 20 less games than everyone else haha.   Edit: and I wasn't one of the people who downvoted you for what it's worth. I think your opinion is insightful and thought provoking in its own way.   Edit: I also have to admit. I'm a shameless optimist. Im always trying to find the silver lining. I admit I'm guilty of cutiing someone a break when they don't deserve it haha."

He buys players and panic quits on them the moment they don't give him exactly what he thinks they should be producing. Half his team are literally free agents at year end because he lacked the intelligence to stagger contracts in any way or form. He's quite possibly the dumbest GM in the history of ever. I've never been a huge Snow fan in any way, but he came up big this year in a way I never expected. Things have fallen into place that I would have never thought he was capable of, or expected him to do. He deserved some notarity for it.  Edit - not sure why I'm getting down voted, but prove to me sather is even remotely worthy of the award. All he did this year was trade for Yandle, and they don't even use him right. A.V. is the biggest reason for the teams success next to Lundquist. Has nothing to do with anything he's done over the last two years. His trade last year for MSL was the doubest thing I've ever seen. Let's trade youth and a draft pick for an old guy who's washed up. Yup.. gm of the year worthy apparently. Snow grabbed a pair of first line defensemen, signed the best free agent goalie that was on the market, and tried to add some scoring touch with grabovski, and kulemin. Took his team from second to last to assembling a team that broke team records. Sather did nothing and won the presidents trophy in a year where half the teams were dumping the season for the mceichel sweepstakes.. slow clap"
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,superfluity87,0,Sat May 23 05:11:02 2015 UTC,How can you stand for getting downvoted so much in your own subreddit?

NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,ArtyThePoopie,-10,Fri May 29 21:05:57 2015 UTC,How the actual fuck was snow not a finalist? That fuck Glen Sather gets a finalist nod too? Fuck this.
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,NHL_nutjob_19,16,Sat May 23 00:08:34 2015 UTC,You mean aside from assembling the squad that won the Presidents Trophy?
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,QuestFor4,-8,Sat May 23 16:24:00 2015 UTC,And from what i can tell from the nomination it's not even because of anything he did this year (except Yandle).
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,Axel2134,6,Sat May 23 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"the Rangers finalist in any award should be Vigneault. He really raised them to a new level this year. Sather on the other hand, has not done anything to benefit the Rangers this year."
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,dl2316,10,Sat May 23 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, Garth's brilliant acquisition of Tyler Kennedy is trophy worthy, jumping from 26th to 10th is more important than 12th to 1st and still playing in the playoffs.  Stop drinking the Kool-Aid, kids.  We're on our way, but ya'll sound as homerish as Butch Goring after a couple of drinks.  Simma down"
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,bass_n_treble,5,Sat May 23 05:36:20 2015 UTC,"Any reason you cited Kennedy but chose to ignore acquiring Halak, Boychuck, leddy, Grabovski, kulemin, conacher, and Johnson all in one off season?"
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,Madlameusername,0,Sat May 23 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"Not saying he deserves a trophy, just a nomination. Yes, what the Rangers have done is fine, but has nothing to do with what Sather did THIS year besides maybe re-signing Zuccarello and acquiring Yandle."
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,Axel2134,3,Sat May 23 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"In contrast, we only have what Garth Snow did this year.  Otherwise we're going to have to think about Vanek, Nabokov, Niederreiter, Dan Boyle, Ehrhoff, Chad Johnson, Poulin, Rolston, Reasoner, Andrew MacDonald, Conacher..."
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,bass_n_treble,2,Sat May 23 05:52:09 2015 UTC,good thing its a trophy for GM of the YEAR.
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,hockeycrazy033,-2,Sat May 23 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"He brought in 5 guys for basically nothing to bring this team from nearly last place to a 100 point team. Nearly  Everyone else on the team has been drafted by snow. All this after having the disaster of a trade in vanek last season. Was Kennedy a good trade? We only gave up a  7th round pick so I'd say it's not so bad.  I thought neuverith wasn't a bad move, played better than Johnson.  The Rangers overpaid for Yandle who hasn't been all that impressive"
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,quigs17,-2,Sat May 23 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"From the NHL website: ""Sather assembled a roster that went 53-22-7 (113 points) during the regular season to set franchise records for wins and points in capturing the third Presidents' Trophy in franchise history. The Rangers also led the NHL and set club records for road wins (28) and points (58). With a successful mix of 25-and-under standouts (Kevin Hayes, Chris Kreider, Ryan McDonagh, Derek Stepan), veteran draft picks (Carl Hagelin, Henrik Lundqvist, Marc Staal), trade acquisitions (Derick Brassard, Kevin Klein, Rick Nash, Martin St. Louis, Keith Yandle) and free agents (Dan Boyle, Dan Girardi), the Rangers have advanced to the Conference Finals for the third time in the past four seasons. Sather is a finalist for the first time since the award was introduced in 2009-10.""   basically what I got out of this is he managed the roster that just so happened to win the Presidents Trophy this year and that's really it. The description is more about what the Rangers as a team did in accomplishments than what Sather himself did, which is utter crap. Fuck this league sometimes."
NewYorkIslanders,36xoww,NHL_nutjob_19,12,Sat May 23 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but nobody happens to win a President's Trophy without a good team assembled.  A team that doesn't shit the bed in March and nearly miss the playoffs."

NewYorkIslanders,36vs9j,tazgraz19,7,Fri May 22 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"Snow, without a doubt, did more to improve his team than any other GM in the NHL this year. It's not even a contest. All Fletcher did was trade for a goalie that met the design of the Minnesota system. Snow completely remodeled the scoring depth and added a top 2 defensive pairing. It's really unbelievable how successful of a GM he is given how bad Wang-ownership is."
NewYorkIslanders,36vs9j,compoundfracture,5,Fri May 22 17:32:04 2015 UTC,And he added Halak.

Perhaps keeping Capuano and Weight should keep him from winning NEXT year but let's not diminish the improvements Snow made this year by focusing on what he didn't do immediately after the season ended.
NewYorkIslanders,36vs9j,hypo11,5,Fri May 22 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think Snow doubling down on Cappy and Weight could potentially cost all three their jobs if they can't get it done next year with the franchise's best goaltender, Tavares' best season ever, a developing Kid Line that boasts future star (and arguably first liner) Strome, and ""The Best 4th Line In Hockey"".  Management ineptitude is holding this team back.  All I want for Christmas is the second round!"

Some famous names of the era are Bryan trottier, bobby nystrom, Dennis potvin, mike bossy, billy smith, and the coach al arbour.  Perks are we are probably one of the loudest fan bases around (next to Winnipeg), every season can be different (more so from 90's to 2012), and we are also one of the youngest teams around (which speaks volumes when you consider how big a season we had). Another  perk is Barclays is one of the most state of the art arenas around (and one of the most unique with the scoreboard being off centered.   One of the best things about the team is the close-knit community behind it. The coliseum closing was one hardest things for us because it was a huge staple in our lives (this is going deeper than just the game). How much the isles have taken a part in this extremely dedicated fan base is something very unique and hard to find in a sports franchise. Even more than that is the players recognize this and it makes it all the more special.  Oh and one last thing is you're coming in at the most perfect timing- this team is just starting to go into a beautiful dynasty.

However they will always be reliant on Henrik and their elite first D pairing (to go along with balanced upfront attack, however no homegrown generational talent upfront). Islanders are more upstart, play a throwback 70's/80's style of being able to attack and play multiple ways, utilizing the 4th D as a F to exploit teams trying to play defensive. Possess one iconic player in Tavares, but also have a bevy of 25 and under stars in Leddy, Nelson, Lee, Strome, and Hamonic. Add in Ho-Sang (2nd most talented player not in the NHL behind McDavid, some scouts say better), dal Colle, Reinhart, Pulock, Mayfield, Pelech, and you're looking at a team whose ceiling will only go up.   Fast players, skilled players, physical players, defensive wizards, ect. Isles are pretty much loaded at every position and have a GM that excels at cap management and new ownership so unlikely anyone gets moved unless they get outplayed.   Become a Mets fan too, not only will you get more respect for not going Yankees, but they are gonna be fire. That rotation will be the best in baseball (Harvey, DeGrom, Wheeler, Matz, Synderguaard are all throwing close to 100mph and Matz is a local kid while Syderguaard is 6'7"" and hitting about .300 with a few homers in AAA), not too mention the vets they already have in Niese, Gee, and Colon, and it'll cost them maybe 10-20 mil max depending on how long Colon can still pitch.    Paint you're studio blue and orange and carry a 90's boombox and walkman tuned to WFAN. If you got the disheveled bohemian bum look, you can pass as a faux disheveled-Mets fan. Make sure to nab 1986 varsity jacket and a snapback with green brim while walking through concrete dust for authenticity."

Yeah we're riding Hank and our D hard, but you're rarely going to have a team with ALL aspects of the game (goal tending, defense, scoring, power play) working well at the same time. Yes, this is a defensive team first, but because of that, we don't always have to score 5 goals. We can win 2-1 games against good teams. And that has gotten us pretty far.    And while I agree with much of what you said about the Isles (don't know much about their upcoming talent), it didn't keep them from faltering down the stretch and losing out on home ice and getting bounced the first round.    So I'll take my bet on Hank and our D and let the chips ride..."

NewYorkIslanders,36jofi,CobraKaiNoMercy,3,Wed May 20 04:11:02 2015 UTC,"yea so i went there yesterday and had a chance to sit in 220 214 218 center ice limited view sections in the hundreds and double digits as well as 112. With that said ive found that psople sitting infront of you is going to be a huge problem. for example 218 which is behind where isles shoot twice behind the goal, i sat in the Last row with my friend in front of me directly. even with him sitting up right his head covers all of the glass infront of me and just to the top of it on the ice. When he leaned forward half the ice on our side i couldnt see.   220 wasnt as bad. Still anyone leaning forward infront of you is a big concern. I see it being a huge problem especially the higher up you go. One thing people also need to realize is that the view of the ice greatly changes depending on section and not just the ice itself from a distance standpoint but how much of it you see.   I strongly encourage anyone who hasnt went there to test seats out to do so. Because me and my friends are now faced with the decision to spend more money not due to distance from the ice but how great the difference is of the person in front of you impacting your viewing experience."

They advertise it as obstructed but really there are none. I think I maybe had to stand up once to see the puck in the near corner, that's it.  I also circled behind he opponents shoot twice net.

NewYorkIslanders,36igks,islesandpizza,5,Tue May 19 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure about moving reinhart unless something big comes our way. Between him and pulock they're our defensive future and should only risk it if it's worth it. How he played in playoffs should mean nothing to his value because of how young he is and his style of defense needs much more time than most.   As for the moves to be made, I think we shouldn't do much, maybe a bit of a ""tuneup"". For a lot of guys on the team, it was their first playoff experience, and for many others it was only their second. It's only up from here so a tune-up is what might give us that extra edge to an already more advanced team from last season.  I think maybe a short-turn winger till dal colle is ready; same thing on defense. I also think a strong tough forward would be nice. I knwo you said it seems like we'll be the new york bruin-hawks, but that's what happens when teams go over cap meet teams with plenty of cap. As for player names in specific, it would be nice to grab maybe lucic (not short term, but he gives a long term grityness we need). If not him, then perhaps sharp; his contract is short enough to pave way to MDC and he still has some years left in him to help out this team, especially in playoffs. For defense, there could be a lot of options; especially since we'd be in the market for a second/third line Dman. Plenty of good free agents and with the waves the isles are making they won't have to grossly overpay to get them interested in coming here."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,leeber27,2,Tue May 19 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Echoing ""don't expect much"" but will throw out some options. First off we have a glut of F's and D prospects (Mayfield, Dono, reinhart, Pulock all pushing for jobs with only 2 open). Only F's on contracts I see as expendable are Grabs (Cappy doesn't utilize him, will have to eat some of that caphit but would be excellent at even a 2m hit) and Bailey (not even vanilla, good player but plain yogurt).   For trade partners, Blues want to look at their core guys after they lock up Tarasenko. Backes and Oshie are UFA's after next year, in addition to Berglund (may have an extra year, forgot) who I have no interest in. Steen also on the block but locked up for a few years. Either would be a HUGE get and fill every need upfront in one blow. Backes is big, skilled, puts up 50-70 points a year with Selke quality D. Oshie has conditioning issues, but kid has sick skills and and a bulldog mentality. Steen is a strong 2 way guy who would be a great fit for LW. And Mayfield is a St. Louis kid who'd fit well behind their top 4.   Chicago with Sharp, Boston with Lucic, and even TO with Lupul would be of interest (Kessel they'd need to eat that cap hit). All should be looking for the young cap friendly NHL players/prospects that the Isles can offer.   As for UFA's only Joel Ward interests me. Dude is a damn good player.   Ideally Isles get a LW, but right now their top 9 RHS are Okposo and Strome, a natural center. Isles have more guys they can shift from C to LW than from C to RW (atleast if they want RH shots available on each line, which is ideal atleast for breakout purposes).   Some say get a dman, only way I add one is if Calvin de Haan ticked of MGMT with comments/crappy late season play and they want to trade him before he Ninos them. That said, wouldn't mind a shutdown vet who can dress for the Bruins/Caps/Blues/big team games. However the cost of getting a guy like Boychuk who can play everyday isn't worth it. Heck, if we keep Mayfield I'd rather try him out then expend big assets on someone."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Wed May 20 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Talking defense:  I am no Cap expert but, based on my general understanding, Oduya seems reasonable. He made 2.8 mil last year. I'd just be concerned that at 33 he is looking for a multi-year that might be longer than what the Isles would want to give him. Especially when we seem to have good young defense-men that look ready or near ready to go.   That being said, I'd definitely be interested in Oduya as a replacement for Vis, and his familiarity with Leddy would be a plus.    On the whole our defense seems in good shape. We have a solid top 3 in Leddy, Boychuk, and Hamonic. We then have Donovan and Mayfield looking like they are ready, given how well they performed when asked to step up.  I am also cautiously optimistic that de Haan is going to have a better year next year too.   Reinhart seemed lost in game 5, but not everyone is going to be able to make the jump from AHL to NHL playoffs gracefully. Somebody who pays more attention to Bridgeport would need to chime in on that one. I only know what I read."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,Waldo19,5,Tue May 19 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"Mayfield has something like 3x the AHL experience that Reinhart has.  I think another year at the Bridge will be great for Reinhart.

NewYorkIslanders,36igks,inapt888,1 point,Thu May 21 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"cal and jt played together in juniors. tavares broke gretzkys scoring record, cal scored 35  Clutterbuck will be reunited with John Tavares, the No. 1 pick in the 2009, draft. The two were linemates in Oshawa, where Tavares was a superstar.  While John Tavares was breaking Wayne Gretzky's junior hockey record for most goals by a 16-year-old, Cal Clutterbuck flanked the Islanders' star. Despite logging 153 penalty minutes in 2006-06, Clutterbuck scored 35 goals and 89 points.  During his one other season with Tavares (2005-06), Clutterbuck scored 35 goals and 68 points.  Cal was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by Minnesota, and went on to score 62 goals and 110 points in 346 games, which included stints on the first-line alongside Mikko Koivu. Of course, Koivu is no Tavares.  So, what if the Islanders saw a spark during training camp between Cal Clutterbuck and the centre that elevated his game to the max in the OHL? Isn't there a possibility that Clutterbuck, who scored 19 goals in 2010-11, could find a way to improve that total while opening up the ice for John Tavares and Matt Moulson, who have already displayed a strong chemistry together?  Perhaps it's not the way we should be thinking, but I haven't seen any player perform worse alongside John Tavares. Seven years later, and with a void to fill next to JT, I could see a scenario where Cal Clutterbuck and John Tavares pick right back up from where they left off in the OHL."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,DancesWithCanoes,-2,Thu May 21 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"Cal isn't much of a hockey player, just a deranged Canadian on skates (but he's our deranged Canadian on skates). We just don't really have anyone that's tough to put up there with him. Okie maybe, but guys like Lee and Strome are good players, they don't have as much weight to throw around or as much tenacity to go after people. I did like Lee going after Wilson the game after the hit on Lubo though."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,viewless25,5,Wed May 20 01:44:24 2015 UTC,Cal is a actually a pretty good hockey player. He's been his team's most effective PK'r every year in the league and has a rifle of a shot to go with his quick wheels. Not sure who the hell you've been watching but Clutterbuck is a top 9 player who plays on a specialized 4th line. And he's a big reason why it works. Dude is instrumental for breakouts.

Isn't there a possibility that Clutterbuck, who scored 19 goals in 2010-11, could find a way to improve that total while opening up the ice for John Tavares and Matt Moulson, who have already displayed a strong chemistry together?  Perhaps it's not the way we should be thinking, but I haven't seen any player perform worse alongside John Tavares. Seven years later, and with a void to fill next to JT, I could see a scenario where Cal Clutterbuck and John Tavares pick right back up from where they left off in the OHL."
NewYorkIslanders,36igks,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Thu May 21 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"I don't expect much this offseason. We have one or two players to re-sign. We have to decide how we feel about Hickey and if Visnovsky at age 39 is worth bringing back.   Other than that, I think we still have to go for a 1 year deal on a Back-up goaltender. Poulin has established that he isn't ever going to be NHL material, we've been waiting for him to develop for years now, and he still doesn't show any signs of progress. I don't see any FA signings other than 1-2 years modestly for a backup goaltender.  No trades. We get jipped on any Reinhart deal. He hasn't shown anything on the NHL to get any return, but we've invested too much in him not to get a big haul."

Most teams he plays NHL next year, but wouldnt mind taking a more patient approach to let him fill out and develop a physical edge. Always fun when you have two game breakers who can play together on the horizon, and both can play completely different styles. Especially cause JHS and MDC are close friends off the ice."

NewYorkIslanders,366tkf,DancesWithCanoes,6,Sat May 16 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"Thats beautiful. Im firmly on the JHS bandwagon. People bring up Kabby, Schremp and sometimes Robert Nilson (IMO the better comparison), but none are perfect. Kabby had some severe issues with his parents particularly his dad who fucked up his draft year pulling him out of juniors. Schremp couldn't fucking skate, he was a gimmick player (dangle for days off the halfboards and dish the puck around and wait for onetimers). Even Nilson wasn't exactly a blazer, very average speed and frankly he had no drive. Schremp atleast tried and IMO had a decent little run with us before his skating became to big of an issue. JHS is driven, shifty, fast, and has the balls to dangle through traffic cutting across the crease. Reminds me alot of PK in that he can rub you the wrong way, but the guy is an elite athlete.   Telling sign was even his parents were saying they tried to teach him to be an independent thinker and now he won't listen to anyone. Well, since being drafted he's been doing everything Isles asked (including accepting a trade to Strome's team when he could have held out for a contender to acquire him) and had the scouts day dreaming again."

Hempstead's bond rating has decreased under her leadership as well. She also bombards households with political mailings and other things with her name on it as a form of promotion, which is of course paid for by the taxpayer.

Not willing to go into details bc I can be identified through them but trust me when I say she is not a good person and definitely should not be in a position of power. Corrupt af. $40 an hour for an old guy to do a shitty job that a sixteen year old could do for minimum wage? And you know her father won't be getting fired regardless of what he does. I'll bet he has his own office, too, because that's the MO over there - you want someone on your side, give em a raise and an office regardless of whether or not they deserve to be in a position of power.  Whole damn town hall is filled with incompetent idiots because of this. You wouldn't believe how badly people slacked off. I was a fucking teenager when I was there briefly and I worked harder than 99% of the staff despite making $9 an hour compared to their 60k+ salaries.

NewYorkIslanders,362qic,NHL_nutjob_19,4,Fri May 15 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"The owner, Charles Wang, was going to build a destination location at the current site all paid for by him.  Murray would not give the proper zoning to Wang and was a no show multiple times for meetings.  Like others said, she states traffic and congestion as the problem as well as the project being too ""big"".  If you were from long island, you would agree with me that traffic is something that will never go away nor get better.  Just think old country road by the malls at 5pm....  Either way Wang tried using moving as a technique to get the process moving as he proposed the Lighthouse Project in 2007.  Its now 2015....They ended up putting a vote to the county residents to fund an arena on its own.  Which at the time the county was under a ""freeze"" and under control by a state oversight board because the county couldn't pay the bills or balance a budget.  Plus the vote was in August when most people were on vacation.  There is a graph floating around of the total votes counted vs number of registered voters.  It was like 10% turnout for the Coliseum vote.  Bottom line is the Coliseum needed to be replaced and thinking about it in 2007 was a good start but plans should've started in the late 90's.  While the economy was good there should've been a fund in place to address the issue when it arose.  But no one did.  I blame no one but the local politicians because this is what they are elected to prevent and get paid to do."

When Lubo got hit he was trying to settle the puck in the corner while Wilson trucked him.   Orpik was practically stationary, didn't seem to be a malicious hit. He played the guy with the puck as best as he could."

I'm tired of watching these fucking fools playing so late in the season. Islanders better have a deep playoff run next year or I'll fucking lose it. If a team like the Rangers can make the conference finals twice in a row off of twelve consecutive 1 goal games (..Luck) than the isles should be able to win one playoff fucking series.   Look at how big of an impact home ice played. Caps dominated but still lost. Fuck you Halak you can't make a save on Brayden Schenn with two seconds left? Why don't we get the good bounces like the rag shit heads? And of course the caps decide to stop playing dirty against them, and Backstrom does shit all series.  I'm not even going to watch anymore Rangers games. I'm sick of them and I know they will pull a rabbit out of their collective asses and win the series vs the Bolts. I'll be waiting until the cup when a real team shows them what dominating hockey looks like and not these 1 goal coin flips that they win.   Fuck the Rangers. And keep chanting potvin sucks, you talk more about the Long Island Legends than we do. Must be jealous of his rings.  And with a healthy defense we would have beaten the caps and maybe even the Rags. This is because of you Tom Wilson you giagantic turd."

They have so much more secondary scoring compared to the caps and bishop is getting hot off the habs series. Honestly this should be an easy series if Krieder doesn't repeat offense. And for the hell of it, let's say they get past because rags catch breaks like that*; the hawks will smoke them. it'll almost be like how bad the kings beat them last year, I'd expect a near sweep again. Hawks are winning it all.  *For example, the teams stats with last nights officials were/are-  Caps: 6-8 regular season, 0-3 playoffs (now 0-4 in playoffs)  Rags: 11-4 regualr season, 4-o playoffs (now 5-0 in playoffs)  I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, but shit happens and it always happens to help the rags."

NewYorkIslanders,35psso,jed1panda,12,Tue May 12 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"I went to Long Island with my dad back in '01 when I was a kid, crazy in love with hockey, with every dream I had involving hockey. It was the only thing that really mattered in my life beside the obvious. I had the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim as my favorite team still even the day before we got on the plane from Sweden, of course because of the Disney movies. Who the hell were these Islanders? I was so confused of why my father had chosen Nassau of all places to go to for watching live NHL hockey.  Then we finally made the trip in February, and from the second I landed I was just amazed of being in U.S., I fucking love America. Got to the hotel, it was nothing fancy. The pools had ants in them, so I go them out with a net lying on the side, before I jumped in.  Then we arrived at the arena to watch a practice. Still outside on the parking lot, I thought ""pretty cool"". Not very flashy, but still nice. Far bigger than what we had in my little town. My dad used his phone to call Mats Lindgren, who got out from the Arena to greet us. I thought ""Wow, an NHL player is talking to me!"". Inside, of course after going to the store to get a hat and a jersey, still just walking in the halls I thought that the place was massive. And then we got to our seat section... WOW! It was better than how I felt when dreaming of getting on NHL ice as a goalie in the future. Had a blast just watching the guys play, more so than I ever did in a candy store. As they finished up, I had the autograph papers ready, too stunned to say a word to the players, but they talked to me while signing, and made me feel just at home. I just got a new favorite team.  I even got to see Rick DiPietro! Shit, that dude was cool. He was only 18, and play with such an entertaining style. He beat Chris Osgood's 5 year title as my regining favorite goalie. Quite the honor.  The day after we went to our first game, I'm pretty sure it was against the Panthers. Not sure if they were in the first or second game we went to. That atmosphere... It wasn't even sold out. I think there were about 13 000 people at the game. So loud. So alive. So much love for hockey. I was home.  It absolutely kills me that I didn't get to take my father back with me to the Coliseum for a 2 game weekend. And that I won't get to, one day, take my future son there for his first NHL game.  I'm sure Barclays Center will be turn out fine eventually (have some faith, guys), but it could never be another Coliseum. That old and gray concrete bunker had tradition in it, true love for the sport, it was solid. Barclays feel very shallow in comparison.  I want to end this on a positive note however. The Islanders are a better team this year than they have been since before I was born. There is absolutely no reason not to be psyched for this upcoming season. This is the start of something great.  I will try to save up for a trip back to New York this season, because I want to make sure to be a part of the history that is you guys making this team feel right at home at their new house.  Fuck the Rangers!  edit: words"

NewYorkIslanders,35q0ex,ArtyThePoopie,3,Tue May 12 16:38:50 2015 UTC,Not sure if he was invited and declined or just not invited but either way I'd say his eye surgery played a part in it
NewYorkIslanders,35q0ex,mc11050,2,Tue May 12 15:58:33 2015 UTC,I was wondering about Tavares.  I'm guessing Canada is pretty stacked already and JT was in the playoffs?

If I were the owner, his job would now be in jeopardy.  To be fair, we really didn't have the ""injury bug"" this year.  Grabner was mostly a healthy scratch this year--for what reason, I don't know.  Brock Nelson was simply helpless without Strome and Lee, and Tavares' mojo was severely hampered by Okposo's return--why immediately on the first line?  Did he not see Tavares jump to the top of the Art Ross standings while Okposo was out?  To me, this was the beginning of the end for our season.  So much confusion about lineups and chemistry even within games.  Can you name the top line of the Islanders?  How about the second line?  Yeah, Tavares and Nielsen.  Whatever.  Who were their linemates this season?  Can you tell me?  You can only name the fourth line, admit it.  Brian Strait was actually the most improved player in the second half of the year IMO.  But 0-for-14 on the PP in the playoffs isn't just disappointing, it's atrocious and worthy of losing your job over.  WHY WAS JOHNNY BOYCHUK ON PP2?  KYLE OKPOSO DOES NOT HAVE A SLAPSHOT.  GET HIM OFF THE POINT AND PUT HIM ON THE HALF-BOARDS OR BEHIND THE NET WHERE NOBODY CAN KNOCK HIM OFF THE PUCK.    The only way this team will advance is with a new coach or at very least a new PP specialist.  Just remember, when Capuano became the 2nd winningest coach in Islanders history, his record was sub .500  He's had enough chances already.  Time to go."

Jets and Giants as well as the Mets and Yankees, simply do not play each other enough for a real deep rivalry to develop. The fans of these teams may give each other shit, but its rarely while both teams are playing against each other in a meaningful game. Other than the Subway series was there ever a really important game between these teams?  This is in stark contrast to he NYI and NYR who have been in constant fierce competition with each other since the Isles joined the league in 1972. Hell the rivalry started before the islanders even stepped on the ice for the first time, when they had to pay a ""territorial fee""  to the Rags just to enter the league.   To say their is real history and bad blood between the teams is an understatement."

If they are a big fan of another sport, explain to them that it's like the rivalry between the Giants and Cowboys, Yankees and Red Sox, whatever. The two teams are fighting for the same playoff spots every year and have met in the playoffs many times (though not lately).   So it's like saying to a Yankee fan after the Yankees are eliminated ""Why aren't you rooting for the Red Sox? They're both AL East teams.""

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

The only thing I can see people being pissed about is the lack of a return in his trade, but that has nothing to do with Vanek, it's on Snow."
NewYorkIslanders,35ai51,iruber1337,0,Fri May 8 19:14:47 2015 UTC,You guys have nothing to be salty over IMO. Your team is a talented young squad with a strong core. You're going places and gave Washington one helluva series and they're destroying the Rags atm. This last year in Nassau was probably the best season yall have had in years.
NewYorkIslanders,35ai51,Cashews4U,1 point,Fri May 8 20:08:19 2015 UTC,yeah I went to the Isles-Wild game this year and everyone was booing Vanek when he touched the puck. I couldn't because I was busy writing him a thank-you card for saving our cap space
NewYorkIslanders,35ai51,ArtyThePoopie,0,Fri May 8 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"If anything we should be mad at Snow for that awful trade. Everyone knew Vanek was going to the Wild. He wasted a first round pick and a fan favorite (who was probably going somewhere else anyway).  Edit: downvotes for what? That was an awful trade considering Vanek was leaving. Every gm knew he wanted to ""test the market"" aka go to Minnesota. They dropped a first round pick in an insanely deep draft.   It doesn't mean Snow didn't do an amazing job with Halak, Boychuk, Leddy, Grabbo and Kulemin. Just like those trades/signings don't erase how bad the Vanek deal was."

It also said that he has to have the Islanders have four training camp days and two open practice days at the new Coliseum.

However, it does seem that JT doesn't get the same superstar protection as other players do.   Ovi can apparently board anyone he wants, no call he's a superstar.  Crosby, has an eggshell of a skull, so if you hit him heard and it is anyway borderline, that'll be 2 minutes in the box for you, he's a superstar.  JT on the hand seems to be called more or less like any other player. No real preferential treatment, but as a result, there is no reason not to hit him like any other player.   However, as I write this I do have to acknowledge my huge homer bias."

I often see him being compared to sub-superstars rather than superstars (crosby, ovi, toews, etc). I feel this could stem from being on the islanders (a team that hasn't shown much until this year), to not leading in points for many consecutive years.  I think in 2 years time he'll have that superstar level of respect because he'll have hopefully won an AR and been on the top point charts for 3 seasons straight on a competitive team."

This season proved that if he has a better team behind him, he can be just as good if not better than superstars like Crosby and Ovechkin. Coaches and team leaders alike probably tell their team to ""keep an eye on Tavares"" every time another team plays the islanders. You better believe during the Washington series Capuano was telling us to watch ovechkin. Trotz was probably telling the caps to do the same to Tavares. To increase chances of winning, neutralize the other team's biggest threats. It's never a terrible strategy. It's not that the league hates Tavares, it's just that the league is fully aware of what he's capable of."

NewYorkIslanders,34zhrz,leeber27,5,Tue May 5 22:09:01 2015 UTC,Islanders need to get a real big name high scoring forward to play with JT. With our defense out of those young guys the only one who will be ready for next season is most likely pullock. We also need to decide on what we want to do at the backup goalie position but besides that we shouldn't change too much
NewYorkIslanders,34zhrz,mc11050,11,Tue May 5 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"If the isles could get a high scoring winger as a rental for 2 years max, then sure I'd agree as long as not much is given up. Perhaps a deal for Chicago for Sharp would be great, but beside that I'd rather not. Dal colle is at max 2 years away from the squad. I also firmly believe that the left wing we're looking for is Lee. He didn't get a fair shot at the spot and even during that time he killed it. It's better to use what the isles have and not trade away/buy players. That's rangers bullshit; islanders drafted their dynasty team."
NewYorkIslanders,34zhrz,leeber27,4,Tue May 5 22:11:31 2015 UTC,"Kennedy is a UFA, so it's not moving him, it's just not signing him. Grabner has one year left on a fairly big contract, so getting anything for him will be hard. You also didn't mention lubo. He said that he's like to come back to the isles and play again. I don't see it being out of the ballpark for a small contract with him; it'd be great to have him split time with a rookie. And you didn't mention a backup, for that I'd like nuevirth back. As for strait, there is no reason to have him moved. He proved int he playoffs that he is a great #7 and it's better to have him as a #7 and never playing than a young player. It is nice to have okie and JT together, but his talents might be best suited on the second line with bailey and nielson (as seen in playoffs). As for dal colle and ho sang, it is exciting looking forward to them especially with the waves they've been making, but it'll be a long ass time before we see ho-sang; probably 17-18 season we'd see him. As for dal colle he might make it to BP next season and possibly (if he really stuns in preseason) in the lineup (but that's a pipedream and I won't entertain that) the lineup I'd really want is this:  lee-JT-strome  bailey-nielson-okie  kule-grabov-nelson  mc2  leddy-manchuk  hamonic-dehaan  pulock-vis/strait/hickey/mayfield"
NewYorkIslanders,34zhrz,leeber27,2,Tue May 5 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Both MDC and JHS have a year left before they are AHL eligible. Could push them both back to a '17-'18 start.

NewYorkIslanders,34zhrz,leeber27,1 point,Wed May 6 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"No problem! The agreement is in place to protect the CHL (keeps stars in the league unless they are being used in the NHL) and to save the NHL cash. Juniors are the NHLs most important talent pipeline, having stars play there means you can devote more resources elsewhere. AHL is partially a development league, partially a place to stash reserves. Non CHL players aren't bound by age or experience other than they have to be atleast 18. It's on the surface odd, but works surprisingly well. However Id like to see them create exception clauses so that certain players like MdC don't stagnate, but Strome also played out his junior career and doesnt look any worse for it."

NewYorkIslanders,34xgwe,leeber27,3,Tue May 5 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"Its definitely not a question to be nervous about and I'm sure many fans have the same question, especially since it's barely mentioned in the industry (a couple commentaries from butch now and then).  Personally, I know about the in depth knowledge from playing the game myself at the junior level. Coming up and playing travel and high school I learned about many different fundamentals of the game (breakouts, formations, types of coverage, basic plays). At the junior level I started learn how to implement more complicated plays; those are often unique (like football) that aren't known by the fans.   I don't have any resources. The only stuff I had was paper plays but that wont describe the basics you're looking for. If you have a question about something specific I can try my best to answer (usually hard without my hands lol)"
NewYorkIslanders,34xgwe,leeber27,2,Tue May 5 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That's really appreciated. It would be easier to watch a game and post questions as it progresses. Clearly I'm looking for something more, but this is a start. Off the top of my head I have a few questions. 1) What's the purpose of crossing on the rush. If I were to guess I would say it's something of a pick and roll. 2) when is the proper time to pinch as a defenseman. 3) what's the strategic process behind line changes. Isles are heavy on the dump and chase, but always seemed unprepared and went on line changes at inappropriate times to properly facilitate that strategy. I understand you have to get it deep sometimes to get a change after an icing, or a long shift in the defensive zone. Something seemed off to me the last half of the year, but I don't coach so pretending to understand the purpose would be futile. When's the right time to alternate players?"
NewYorkIslanders,34xgwe,dl2316,4,Tue May 5 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"No problem, like you said you're best bet is to probably post it in the game thread and someone will be bound to answer it here. as for your questions, here's the best I can say without a dry erase board lol  1) This is probably the hardest to answer because it's really up to the team. There's many defensive plays that are done when a rush is heading your way. As for crossing the rush, you're right in the thought of a pick and roll; that's the best scenario (lead's to turnovers especially if you had many men heading that way). You can also cross the rush for physical purposes; you can do a great open ice hit and prevent a play even forming if you have the proper backup.   2) Usually defined by the coaching staff and done in practice. However when faced with the actual event it's totally up to the defenseman. If you have the puck and see a rush forming in front of you, you can decide to take it deep or dump it at the red. Usually if you know you have backup/no line change will be made on either offense or defense you can take it deep because it often leads to some great offense. That also corresponds with the type of defensman. A playmaking/offensive defensman will pinch when he sees fit because he's capable of doing it (a perfect example is Leddy, we see him doing it all the time). A home bound defesman will often stick to the red line dump and hold the point as best as he can and rip shots (assuming he has a good shot[home bound defenman usually do]) a perfect example of this is boychuk. The only times we really see him pinch are to the top of the circle to snag a pass or get a close slapshot in. As for pinching along the boards when the other team is trying to clear, that's hugely opinionated. I feel that If you can do it, then do it. But if you question it, you should only do it if you know you have backup; other than that you take the safe route and get as many strides as possible of a head start on the now-rushing forward.  3) Very dependent on the coaches, the course of the game, or even the team you're playing. If you're playing a speedy team with a great clear-out, you want short shifts cause the last thing the team needs is a tired unit on the ice on in the defensive zone with a team ready to outplay you. For the isles, their dump and chase strategy has been used for what you said, to get the change, but to also spark the offensive zone plays. You have it deep in their zone, you manage to get possession (hardest part) and you implement plays to keep the pressure in their zone. That's what gets goals; it's very hard to get a goal off a rush. Plus it's more painful on the opponent if you keep the pressure in their zone. Wears down their D, changes momentum, and kills morale. The dump and chase strategy is merely a way of getting to that; there's other ways to do it but dump and chase is usually best bet if you want to keep the game simple (often we see the isles being too fancy, which is why Butch says ""chip and chase game"" all the time). Long story short, dump and chase is a better way to spark the offensive pressure. However, the way they do a dump and chase and get control is a team play. Their are alternatives to dump and chase, but those are usually plays done in practice that only the team knows (hopefully lol). I just realized I went on a rant about dump and chase, but for the process behind line changes are usually TOI related, player matchup (Boychuk on Ovi every game), getting a line back together, or trying a specific play; the dump and chase play is an effective way of accomplishing those."

NewYorkIslanders,34xgwe,mcbordes,1 point,Wed May 6 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"Oh one thing that I've seen that bothers me, is any time you see a defnseman pass it across the front of the net with ano opposing forward bearing down in deep. Logically I would think the safe play would always be to bank it behind the net to the opposite side man. Is there any logistic reason for that, or is it just as bone headed as I think it is?"
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,dukemantee,14,Tue May 5 02:51:05 2015 UTC,So R/rangers has a thing where they completely rip on a player with the hopes that doing so will make him become hot since it happened to Nash once apparently.

NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,LundqvistsBloodClots,17,Tue May 5 03:19:28 2015 UTC,We could tell them it doesn't work.  If that worked Josh Bailey would have 100 goal season because our fanbase rips him a new one every game no matter how he plays for some reason.

NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,iamthebobkat,-7,Tue May 5 17:25:37 2015 UTC,Bailey gets crap because he makes giant glaring mistakes. Also he has poor hands and fumbles the puck in crucial moments. He's definitely improved and is a good 2 way forward. He just shouldn't play with Tavares.
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,Clown_Shoe,8,Tue May 5 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"Even now, the Bailey haters can't resist an opportunity to talk about how Bailey sucks.  Give it a rest, please."
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,BroadwayJayEsq,2,Tue May 5 13:03:16 2015 UTC,I like him as a third line forward. Not on the top line.  You can just stomp your feet and call people Bailey haters like a child though when someone's says something you disagree with.
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,Clown_Shoe,3,Tue May 5 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not stomping my feet about anything. It is objectively incorrect that Bailey is a bad player, or that he shouldn't be on the first line.  He's 33d in the league in P/60 at even strength. That puts him squarely in the top 90 scoring forwards in the NHL which is ""first line"" territory.  It is stupid to continually criticize Bailey on things like ""he has poor hands"" which no one can dispute other than to say ""he has good hands"".  Like many fans, I'm tired of the nonsensical Bailey critiques. He scores too much for that."

NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,BroadwayJayEsq,-1,Tue May 5 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think he's a useful piece but he has flaws in his game.  Most of the criticisms of him are valid but I agree people do tend to go overboard.  The guy you are responding to here didn't say anything that terrible.  He called him a ""good 2 way forward"".  How did that equate to ""Bailey sucks!"" in your mind?"

You're really putting words in the guy's mouth when you claim he said ""Bailey sucks""."
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,three_dee,2,Tue May 5 17:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're accurate criticisms, but that is irrelevant to the inquiry anyway.  He was talking about ""what Bailey sucks at"". Those ""criticisms"" are things he thinks Bailey is bad at, or in another words ""how Bailey sucks"".  Bailey is actually quite good, he is 33d in even strength P/60 ON PAR WITH PATRICK KANE, but his ""hands"" and ""fumbling"" mean he isn't a first-line player? Please. Just give it a rest."
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,BroadwayJayEsq,2,Tue May 5 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"So... in your mind,   ""Jaroslav Halak sucks at playing outside the crease, he should stay at home where he is really solid and let his D-men work in their own zone""  is equivalent to  ""Halak sucks!""  You should learn how to English."
NewYorkIslanders,34wetf,three_dee,2,Wed May 6 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Well, no. There is a difference.  Saying he has ""poor hands"" is both false and overly critical. He is a top scorer in the NHL at scoring rate. He's 33d in a league with 90 first liners. But apparently he has ""poor hands"", ""fumbles the puck"" and ""makes giant glaring mistakes."" Those critiques are idiotic and wrong and take away from the excellence of the guy's play.  Also, there is a historical effort to undermine Josh Bailey because he was drafted ahead of luminaries like Luke Schenn and Nikita Filitov that the fanbase (wrongly) thought were superior players. That cannot be ignored when false critiques pop up.  Jaro Halak has no history of false critiques. He is also the best goalie we've had since Rickie D. And that critique is very, very, very minor. It isn't ""he has no glove hand"" or ""he fumbles the puck at critical moments"" (which actually happened once) and ""he makes giant glaring mistakes"" of which the final two are MORE true of Jaro Halak.  No one would say those things because he's such a good goalie and it is stupid, and pointless, to make those kind of critiques. The same is true of Josh Bailey, but that doesn't stop the haters.  The guy is 33d in even strength scoring per 60. Just put it to bed, that's very high-end top-line production. On par with PATRICK KANE. Just put it to bed already. The haters were wrong about Josh Bailey."

Hopefully with the healing too fransie and okie will look better together. I would almost want to see Brock with kyle and frans on the wing and strome center three but I'm not sure.

Leddy/Boychuck and then Hamonic/Reinhart as the top two pairings would be fun.  more offensive firepower?  that may depend more on the continued development of the guys we have than bringing somebody in.  remember how young Strome is.  I prefer to play him on a second line away from Tavares and see if he can be productive at C.  another winger from outside would be nice, but internal improvements could go a long way towards getting where they need to be (and they weren't that far -- the D got beat up, Okposo's injury fucked with line chemistry, and the team almost won a series nevertheless).  developing a real goalie prospect for the first time in forever would be nice, and there are a few in the pipeline, but Halak at least gives the team a chance to win.  he's league average rather than bottom-of-the-league like a Poulin would be.  the Isles reaped the benefits of that."

Our defense seems solid, so maybe going outside of the organization for that winger makes sense. If so who would you want?    Garth did a great job snatching Leddy and Boychuk. Are their other players on cap stricken teams that you think we could get for a steal if Garth plays his card right? Or do we need to move some parts to get some parts?"
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,Waldo19,2,Mon May 4 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"Isles have LW options in Lee, Nelson (if they can get a heavy center), and longtrm MdC. On RW Okposo, Strome (though longterm Isles may still want him at center, not sure) with Ho-Sang on the horizon. Isles can wait it out and be set but I dont think there is any roster player who brings what the Isles need which is a faster Lee/more skilled Kuli unless Brock Nelson gets shifted. But then they'd need a big center.   Either way, Isles would have to target outside for the time being. MDC is really close to being that solution but Isles would be wise to get a vet on the decline (where a team panics on him bottoming out and moves for a reasonable cost) or someone locked up who can be flipped for value a few years from now. Id prefer someone who can play a crash and bang offense, but if say, Kessel comes cheap and with his caphit eaten up, Id improvise.   Nobody is a UFA worth going all in on but a few could be fits. Stewart (should be cheap), Ward (love this guy), even Horcoff could fit if they want to shift Nelson. IIRC Snow has tried going for Ward before.   The defense I agree is fine, maybe an extra vet to replace Viz but Im fine with having Donovan/Mayfield/Reinhart/Pulock battle for the spot. In fact Id actually like a Mayfield/Pulock with Hickey pairing. If anything isles could afford to trade a guy there.  Slight chance of CdH if only because he was getting a little grumpy towards the end of the year and played poorly in the playoffs. On a great deal, very skilled, could return a young impact F upfront and frankly he's never gonna play more than Leddy. Love his skill, but he's gonna be moving down the depth chart as other guys develop.  I think Snow stands pat, trims some fat at the draft for picks then sees what he can snag on the UFA market to replace some of the lost fat. Grabner is the obvious cut, but I think Bailey could get play too as his value should be high. Solid season at both ends and another strong playoff showing with a very friendly contract."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,Stonecipher_LaVache,-6,Tue May 5 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Benching Lee didn't cost the Islanders the series, though. No coach's decision did.   Hmm... what about keeping Halak in net instead of a 6-on-4 powerplay to end game 7?  Sorry Mr. Staple, you're turning into a homer."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,bass_n_treble,13,Sun May 3 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Yeah because that ONE play determined the whole series
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,_stee,0,Sun May 3 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Game 7 down by one goal with 2:30 left... uh yes it did.  If they tied it we would have had a chance to silence the crowd and get an OT goal.
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,bass_n_treble,7,Sun May 3 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"On the other side of the coin, if Cappy pulled Halak with 2 1/2 minutes left when we're down by one goal and that resulted in an empty netter 15 seconds later everybody would still be calling for his job. He was damned if he did and damned if he didn't in that situation.  I can't say I blame him for holding off on pulling Halak."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,DLun203,2,Mon May 4 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"The season was already over... you risk nothing by going 6 on 4.  Do everything you can to win game 7 at least instead of sitting cluelessy and just accepting defeat.  We had 11 shots on goal the entire game.  I just see a guy content with siping Poland Spring behind the bench and collecting the peanuts salary they throw at him.  A man who is in over his head.  Garth Snow saying he and Weight are going nowhere is like doubling down on stupid.  In my view, that means his job is now in jeopardy as well for endorsing this mediocrity.  My only hope is that Ledecky and Malkin are more interested in winning hockey games than real estate slumlord Chuckles Wang.  Then there will be some hot seats under the entire coaching staff that is holding us back."

A man who is in over his head   You just don't get to 101 points and have some of the best possession numbers in the league. I'm not saying that this gives Capuano and his staff any leeway. Even the best teams have to experience failure before success.  cough 1979 Islanders cough
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,dl2316,2,Mon May 4 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"All the Capuano apologists keep quoting the 101 pts that Garth Snow built.  In January and February we thought this team was a Cup contender.  First off, points don't mean dick when you're golfing in April.  Secondly, how many pts did Tortorella have with the Rangers the season he took them to the Conference Finals?  Probably a lot more than he had with Vancouver the next year after he got fired.  Say what you want about them, but at least the Rangers upper management are serious about winning, with proven staff.  We still have someone who is likely the 29th or 30th highest paid coach in the NHL (coach salaries are not really completely documented but I can't imagine he makes a lot)."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,bass_n_treble,2,Mon May 4 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"And in January did people think that the Minnesota Wild would be in a playoff spot? Things change over the course of the season, that is the way hockey is. Basing a coach's ability on their contracts just doesn't have any basis for me. I do not think you will find one single team (except for maybe the Sabres) who upper management did not want to win. 30 teams all have the same goal and 29 of them all come away disappointed. Any GM that would fire their coach after what NHL teams see as a successful season would be looked at as crazy by the rest of the league. Remember, Capuano was in contention for the Jack Adams for most of this year."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,dl2316,1 point,Mon May 4 02:38:50 2015 UTC,Capuano was in contention for the Jack Adams for most of this year.   Undeservingly so. The Jack Adams means nothing. It's based off which team improved most from last year for the most part. I've been saying that since last December.   I give way more credit to Garth snow than Cappy for the team's success. A coaching change would be ideal IMO
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,RyPhy,1 point,Mon May 4 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Remember, Capuano was in contention for the Jack Adams for most of this year.   Until he made the AHL Coach of the Year move of putting fresh-off-injury Kyle Okposo back into the lineup on the first line against the red hot Rangers, screwing up the chemistry of Art Ross 1st place holding John Tavares' line.  Bush league.  Can you name a consistent line other than ""The Kid Line"" (which was separated most of the year, causing a cold streak for Brock Nelson) or the 4th line?  Why was Michael Grabner a healthy scratch for pretty much the entire season?  Cory Conacher got some quality first line starts this year.  Great talent evaluation there.  The man is a fucking joke."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,bass_n_treble,6,Mon May 4 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"bad decision obviously, and he should have pulled Halak. But he's right, that ONE play didn't cost us the whole series."
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,inapt888,6,Sun May 3 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if we went even 2-for-14 on the powerplay we could have wrapped that series up in 6 games.  Just ask Doug ""No Pink Slip"" Weight"
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,bass_n_treble,2,Sun May 3 20:46:02 2015 UTC,yep. A pp goal in game 4 in particular might have been nice.
NewYorkIslanders,34qn1d,Waldo19,3,Mon May 4 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"it never does.  the utter collapse in the final 30 mins of Game 2, and then the putrid game 7 performance (team was likely out of gas -- 2-1 on the scoreboard is a lie) are the two times the Isles looked overwhelmed.  that said, could pulling Halak at 2:30 in Game 7 have worked, pulled the series from the jaws of defeat?  sure, in theory.  but the Isles would have been cannon fodder for the NYR, sorry to say.  it's better it ended the way it did."

NewYorkIslanders,34ja5z,sollamander813,1 point,Fri May 1 23:02:14 2015 UTC,I'd say the most name recognizable Rangers print writer is Larry Brooks (or Brooksie plus a bunch of insults if you're John Tortorella).

NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,bass_n_treble,4,Fri May 1 15:50:07 2015 UTC,Meh I'd rather they were replaced but this team finished with 101 points with capauano coaching and took a team that looks poised to make some sort of run to game 7 with half an NHL caliber defense. Not every team is going to get Babcock and why take a risk on someone else?
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,ugotpandaowned,0,Fri May 1 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Could have been 115 pts with an NHL coach and a 10th place powerplay, or smarter lineups and goalie rotation.  He's not a good coach, but you have Halak, Leddy, Boychuk, Okposo and Tavares on the team and much less dead weight than previous years (Conacher an exception)."
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,bass_n_treble,4,Fri May 1 16:58:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree that someone else needs to be running the power play. But unless they can be totally sure they can land a guy like Babcock or Hitchcock why take a chance on someone without a great track record in the NHL? Capuano makes questionable lineup choices but he gets everyone plying hard and the players buy into his system
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,ugotpandaowned,3,Fri May 1 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"We had three of our D injured, okposo had to start from scratch after returning, Nielsen has and was playing on an injured ankle, grabner cant stay healthy, grabo had health issues and many of the players we were all complaining that got too little ice time were all rookies. To win you have to be healthy and have some experience. The future still looks quite bright."
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,bageloid,-1,Fri May 1 16:47:37 2015 UTC,Okposo didn't have to start on line 1 though and ruin the Lee/Bailey chemistry  Mayfield and Donovan looked better than deHaan and Lubo.  They played simple  Grabner has been a healthy scratch for almost the entire year  Boychuk on PP2 for some unknown reason
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,bass_n_treble,6,Fri May 1 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"Mayfield and Donovan looked better than deHaan and Lubo.   Get your eyes checked. Lubo had one of the best games EVER by a defenseman in Game 3.   44 had his struggles and 46-42 were good in relief, but if you're complaining about Lubo... I mean, I don't even know what to say to that. Game 3 was a legendary performance by a defenseman."
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,BroadwayJayEsq,0,Fri May 1 17:26:59 2015 UTC,Every one of Lubo's great plays is when he's already backpedaling and got stripped of the puck or outright beat in a footrace.  He was good for us but he's definitely showing his age.
NewYorkIslanders,34iwao,bass_n_treble,2,Fri May 1 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Mayfield and Donovan also played significantly less than both Lubo and deHaan, both in terms of number of games and ice time. So I don't think it's quite fair to compare their performances."

No one will be responsible for our downward spiral after the allstar break, and early exit in the playoffs.  No one will be held responsible for the team giving up a goal in the final minute of a period almost every game in our last month playing.  And lets not forget about all the 3 goal leads and third period collapses we had.  Stupid decisions by cap resulting in us losing home ice advantage.  I'm so sick of hearing cap coached us to a 100+ season.  This team has serious talent, anyone coulda coached us to a 100 point season."
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,hockeycrazy033,3,Fri May 1 04:26:04 2015 UTC,Giving up last minute goals has been an issue alot longer then the last month of this season
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,AfellowchuckerEhh,2,Fri May 1 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"While I agree with all your points, the collapse began when Cappy put Okposo back in the lineup in March.  February we were still on fire and Tavares made his Art Ross push with Lee and Bailey.  Not that Okposo could possibly play third line minutes for a few games to get acclimated."
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,bass_n_treble,2,Fri May 1 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"exactly, any other coach in the nhl wouldn't have injected him into the first line after missing a quarter of the season.

NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,tanu24,2,Fri May 1 06:28:09 2015 UTC,how many have blown more 3 and 2 goal leads? How many of them break up a top line that was doing better without their second best goal scorer and shoved him on the line instead of trying to add secondary scoring. He never calls timeouts until it's to late. Teams never playing a full 60 minutes. Coaches get fired even after making the playoffs for reasons. This team was better then 101 and a first round exit.

When the team starts a downward spiral halfway through the season and get completely out-coached in game 7, that's where you ignore the 101 points."

Yes, the Isles had a good season. 101 points and the playoffs.......however, he definitely was outcoached by Trotz in this series and you can tell how we played on the road after game 1.  That is ALL coaching...matchups, etc and Cappy didn't make any changes to rectify the situation.     And the PP is a real issue.  As much as I love Weight, we CANNOT go 0/14 in the playoffs.  That is inexcusable."
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,tanu24,6,Fri May 1 12:07:47 2015 UTC,"Meh figured as much. Frustrating spots in their coaching, but by no means is it unfixable. Give em a year to get their shit together. God forbid we have a terrible start or don't get past the first round again, drop them. Getting rid of Cappy after a 100 point season sends a weird message."
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,DLun203,4,Fri May 1 02:27:09 2015 UTC,Because this team is talented as fuck. Rags let Torts go despite good results. Game two should have been enough to send him. everything he does wrong came out in that game. All those dropped points leading to no home advantage and then looking like that game 7. Hes not a NHL coach i'm sorry. So many things wrong hes done this year.
NewYorkIslanders,34h09g,Chrismercy,1 point,Fri May 1 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"Two points:  a) Maybe I'm reaching here but we were a Presidents Cup worthy team this year. I can think of 3 games off the top of my head that would have been won in the regular season with better coaching. All with 3 pt leads. That alone puts us at 107 pts. Any coach would have gotten us to 100 pts.  2) Next year Okposo, Nielsen, Grabner and Martin are all UFAs (and a long list of RFAs). We're not keeping all of them. We have the talent now. Why are we giving Cappy another chance when the guy couldn't get us through the first rd of the the postseason with so many stars on the roster.  He's out of excuses. He has a better team than he ever could have asked for. His time is up. Too bad he and Garth are so close."

Sure, an argument can DEFINITELY be made against Weight; I'm very surprised he wasn't let go or moved away from his position.   Besides, who knows what the fuck Snow us going to do. Remember we were supposed to be quiet at the trade deadline? I don't think he's above changing his mind on things."

NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,roso4991,-13,Fri May 1 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"So we should just forget our history? Let's go ahead and change the logo, maybe get ride of the blue and orange and where black and white. Let's change the team name to the Brookyn Starbucks while we are at it."
NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,roso4991,9,Fri May 1 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Nassau is our history, however it is not our future.  And if you were out on the ice playing would you want to hear your fans chanting about past political blunders, or chanting to get behind you and drive you to put just that little bit more out on the ice and win.  My chant remains ""Let's go Islanders"" not ""Let's go Brooklyn"". And lets face it the Starbucks are going to be in Seattle whenever they get a team, be grateful that the Islanders are still on Long Island and not in Seattle, which looked like a possibility just a few years ago."
NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,Madlameusername,-2,Fri May 1 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we should replace ""let's go islanders"" I just want something to do once a game to show where we come from. The islanders have always been a sorce of Long Island pride for me, I'm not ready to give that up yet"

NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,Musclesjones,6,Sun May 3 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"Queens, Brooklyn, Nassau and Suffolk, we're all Islanders now.  I suppose if I was gonna craft a new chant something like,  ""Q-B-N-S, Isles Isles Isles!"" might be ok. Acknowledge the historical home and the new home. And making it clear that the Isles territory has expanded and the rags has shrunk.  For the good of the organization, the goal should be to get as many people supporting this team as possible. Fans from Brooklyn and Queens need to feel included. But the team is the Islanders.  ""Lets go Islanders!"" is still the #1 chant. There are just more Islanders now."
NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,superfluity87,2,Fri May 1 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"I like it. Past history and future in one chant, along with a subtle jab at the Rangers? I'll take it."

NewYorkIslanders,34j76k,carmelocleanthony,3,Fri May 1 20:02:45 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of a non-Long Island resident, I understand that the local Nassau and Suffolk County fans (the majority fanbase) want to show their Long Island pride. I support it fully. But, also, I think staying stuck in the past will keep you from fully enjoying the team and its future. The team belongs to the greater metro area now, not just Long Island. The thing that first attracted me to the team as a semi-local resident was that it was so super-regional of a team being out on Long Island. But, we gotta embrace the new era, bandwagoners and all. On the upside, Brooklyn Bandwagoners = $$$ for the team, and that's never a bad thing. And more money = they have a reason to stick around longer. Embrace that our boys didn't move away completely and that they can still stay a New York team and not become the ""State without an NHL Team Bumblefucks"". Don't drag down the team trying to re-establish the franchise in Brooklyn, that's gonna be hard enough for them to do already as they've crept significantly closer to Rangerstown, USA. Plus, the logo will remain unchanged. That has long Island on it. There's no reason to worry about heritage being forgotten."

If the Islanders can't win it I'd rather another fan base who has never won a cup get one.     i don't like the caps, but at the same time, if they win it all at least the islanders forced a game seven on the eventual winner and at least a new fan base gets to experience the cup.    So while the Caps are not my first choice, I won't be upset if they win. I'll just be a little blue wondering what could have been this year if we had gotten out of the first round.   EDIT: Forgot Calgary won the cup in '89. Still of the Canadian teams remaining I'd much rather see the flames win than Montreal."

I don't think I'll be rooting for either though. I just want it to go to 7 games and for them to beat the ever loving shit out of each other. Rooting for the Flames for the rest of the playoffs.
NewYorkIslanders,34eof5,toothecloud,2,Thu Apr 30 16:53:15 2015 UTC,I'm with you. There is no way in hell I can root for the caps to win this. As much as a hatred for the Rangers is imbedded inside of me I can't honestly say I want them to lose to the caps. I'm with you on the flames. Would love to see an underdog story.

But on the other hand this series has brought to light the really shitty side of the Caps and their fans. I really can't see myself wanting to watch the caps and their fans representing the metro.. They are literally just bad people.. The Rangers kinda (don't hang me for this) deserve it?...that being said I want them to get banged up bruised and broken.. Win in a bullshit game 7 and get mashed up by Tampa or Montreal after that. WIN WIN. #nocaps #norags

NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,igotthisone,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be packed, I live in the area with a car and drive to Atlantic on occasion to hit up the Target and the Buffalo Wild Wings from time to time. Parking in that area is tough and that tiny parking garage under Atlantic is gonna be full up with people who drive to Atlantic to take the LIRR to work.  Parking a bit away from the center closer to the park slope or even the prospect heights area will just make it a little bit easier. I live down in South Slope currently and my GF used to live on Union St a few years back and parking was always a pain in the ass then; it's only gotten worse since the Dinosaur BBQ opened and the area gentrified a bit more."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,Subject2Change,-2,Wed Apr 29 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"Even still, there are always one or two spots open on each of the streets from Union to Atlantic. It screws up the residents, but uh, well they shouldn't have moved somewhere that eventually got a stadium!"

I understand why it didn't happen but those blind spots are pretty bad, and the horse shoe seating design isn't great either.  But at the end of the day, they didn't move to Canada or KC or where ever else. I am excited for the team to build off of this year and make the necessary improvements to finally get out of the first round."

NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,igotthisone,10,Wed Apr 29 20:30:57 2015 UTC,Baseball is by far the #1 sport in NYC.

NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,Musclesjones,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"Ticket sales would probably be the main determining factor. This is definitely a couple years down the line but if things go well and they win a cup and pick up a lot of new fans in Brooklyn, it could become financially feasible to want to have a stadium with full priced, full view seats. TV viewership is way lower for NHL than the NBA, but a sell out is a sell out as far as ticket gate."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,sollamander813,4,Thu Apr 30 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely staying a fan - I'm just cutting my purchase of tickets from 5-10 games a year to 1, and that's just to see what it's like. Driving to Brooklyn for a game doesn't sound like fun, and from what I've heard the sight lines aren't that great. Couple that with the tickets being 2-3x as expensive as they were at the Coli, and there you have it.   And as far as the bars replacing tailgating...uh, you can bring 30 beers in a cooler and spend about 20 bucks total or get a drink and a half in Brooklyn for the same price."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,chiaestevez,5,Wed Apr 29 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"You also don't have to spend $15/person avg.(depending on your zone). One way just to get there versus just showing up. I have a monthly so it doesn't matter, but the poor fuck that actually lives and works on long island that wants to bring his family to a game is dropping $60. That's just one way. So double that if you plan to go home. $120 just to get there and back. That's just for a family of four.  Edit - grammar."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,superfluity87,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:44:17 2015 UTC,"You know, I never thought about that. I did not care about the price of a train ticket because it's the same as parking. Never considered this. I wonder if the LIRR can do an Islander faimly discount."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,ryan924,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"I think they already have some sort of deal, but even if you take 20% off you're still spending close to $100 for a family of four. Not including tickets to the game. I think they're going to have a lot of problems selling tickets after the first initial season. Everyone I talk to about it doesn't take that expense into account. Most people are ecstatic that they can get shit faced at a game and take the train home that they forget how expensive it is. I've never been one to drink at a game, so mass transit really doesn't do anything for me. Now instead of being able to go home when the game ends i'm at the mercy of the LIRR. Now if I miss a train I'm sitting around for an hour till I can catch the next one home. So now when I finally catch a train home I'd be lucky to get back before midnight. So now any weekday games are completely out of the realm of possibility. I'm not even sure how they'll manage to sell tickets to most of those. Even if you work in the city and go straight there after work you still have the problem of getting home at any reasonable hour."
NewYorkIslanders,34aneo,superfluity87,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Based on the season ticket prices, it actually seems pretty reasonable. Definitely not 2-3 times more expensive. Closer to 1.5 or less. Don't forget, tickets to games this year were not cheap either!"

Outside of BOA, opening day and a few April games I hardly saw any tailgating that was more than just drinking a beer or two in/around the car in the freezing cold.  Do people forget how terrible some of those windy winter days are outside of Coliseum?   I'll absolutely miss the Coliseum but the 30 minute difference each way isn't enough to keep me away.

This is about Long Island continuing to lose everything that used to make it an amazing place to live and work. this is about losing our culture and becoming just another NYC bedroom community. This is about a once great area slowly dying. (This next part is going to sound bitter and I am really sorry if it offends anyone). I hate the idea of loser Brooklyn yuppies projecting their fake post gentrification ""Brooklyn pride""  on to Long Island's team. I will always be an Islanders fan.

It's not about getting to games, but the idea that suddenly some people won't root for them anymore,  or won't care. I hate to see a resentment between our fans grow because of this. Look at these guys from Germany. Long time fans, took them forever to get to a game. They are true fans in my book, even when they've never been to a game.

There are fans from around the world I'd consider true fans, even if they've never been to the U.S. I was addressing the attitudes of some that I've seen around that ""it's over for them"". ""It's not their team anymore"". I expect this to suck for a lot of people, but it's still our team.    When people act like they won't be a fan anymore because it will be more difficult for them to get to games, it creates a rift because for many fans, it was always difficult. I expect this too some degree because it's a hard pill to swallow, but I just want our fanbase to remain solid during thia transition and not have people harboring resentment.    After all, we are Islanders fans. We've endured some pretty tough times. We owe it to ourselves to stick together for the good times ahead. Our star is rising."

NVMC had a very good send off all year and the events really helped me brace for the big move. I have been a fan my whole life and the thought of not being able to get tickets in BK led me to the decision to finally pursue my dream of being a season ticket holder. I went out to the Barclays and picked out my seats. The place doesn't feel like home yet but I'm sure with this team only getting better we'll get used to it relatively quickly. People need to accept what has happened and welcome the team to Brooklyn and continue to support them just as much as they always have.

The short direct walk to the rink would be a big plus and its only a 6 minute walk from Atlantic terminal.

NewYorkIslanders,34bu6y,Whalers7997,3,Thu Apr 30 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"Its likely not ironclad but pays out so much that the Isles would be unlikely to get out. The question to ask is if SNY would match and pay the buyout fee? Sport industry is currently in a small bubble where cable contracts are vastly outpacing all other revenue streams. The MSG deal, a landmark franchise saving deal, is much closer to market rates now.   Dont hold your breathe, but its possible. Isles would benefit greatly from dedicated coverage and SNY's only shot at getting a NY winter pro team is the Islanders. Nets are locked in with YES. Might be something you see from new owners whom I suspect will be tight when they find out their 500m investment is on SD overflow."

If they cold negotiate it, wonder if MSG would consider selling its overflow games to SNY."

If she does end up announcing a run for district attorney, then she can continue to serve as Hempstead supervisor while running for DA, but she can't run for reelection as supervisor to the TOH at the same time.  This means that, if she does run for DA, she can't be the supervisor anymore because she can't run for the position.  That does also mean however that we all need to make the extra effort vote against her in the DA race to ensure she's not in any form of public office anymore so we never have to deal with this woman again, even if she ends up deciding to surprise us and run for town supervisor again."

Having their inside winger get in the way of our inside winger to prevent him from challenging a shot or contesting a loose puck. It is a play that most likely gets called in the regular season, but not as much in the playoffs.   The reason it is interference is because they are not playing the puck and impeding they going for the puck on purpose. Much like a defender who holds up a guy who chips the puck past him"

NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,AfellowchuckerEhh,10,Wed Apr 29 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, Yashin's contract is up this year.  First off, get rid of Cappy and hire a coach with experience. Weight and Cronin stay for now. If the PP and PK still suck in December, they're gone.   Viz, as much as I loved him, is also gone after this year. Grabs gets traded if he requires surgery again. I want to see as many high-ranked prospects stay within the organization if possible, so trade bait will mostly be draft picks (worked for getting Boychuk) and ""lower tier"" players (Strait, McDonald, Neuvirth...).   As for the current status of the team roster, the improvements I would like to make are:   A real backup for Jaro. CJ and Neuvirth never cut it. If this team wants to perform well in the season and go deep in the playoffs, Jaro can't be the only option every game. More depth on defense, especially a top-4 partner for Hamonic. This will likely come from a trade unless Hickey steps up. Bottom d-pair should consist of a mix of Hickey, de Haan, or a rookie Pulock or Reinhart. Keep lines consistent as much as possible. Find something that works and stick with it, luckily a Capuano firing will make line juggling less of a problem."

NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,Musclesjones,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:11:50 2015 UTC,"Kennedy, Neuvirth and Lubo are all UFAs that I don't think will return.    Next are guys like McDonald, Boulton and Mouillierat who can come back as UFAs or not, either way they won't really be a big deal and are very replaceable if they don't come back.  I think Grabner is back, sure he makes $5 million next year but his cap hit is only $3 million and when healthy I still think he's worth it.  If everything about him needing offseason hernia surgery is true, expect him to be back to his old speedy self next year.    Now, here's the part where I take an unconventional step that I may get criticized for but hey, that's the fun of commenting on the internet.  If I'm Garth, and I'm not, I package KO, Nelson or Lee (preferably Nelson) with Reinhart for Taylor Hall.  Okposo's $2.8 million is going to increase after next season when he becomes a UFA and there's no guarentee he resigns.  I also don't think he plays the game the same way since coming back from eye surgery and seems to avoid playing physical since coming back.  Nelson and Lee are both RFAs and will get big raises this year anyway, somewhere around the $2.5-3M AAV range so whoever goes KO will offset the 6 million cap hit Taylor Hall commands.  Griffin is absolutely adored in Western Canada and is the biggest piece in this trade.  I think Mayfield who as many of you remember falling out of the first round to the Islanders in the Strome draft, has proven in the past two games that he can be a legitimate NHL defenseman.  Between Leddy, Boychuk, Hammer all signed long term and guys like de Haan, Strait, Hickey (still a RFA), Mayfield, Donovan and Pulock can certainly fill out 4-7 or 8 depending on how many D-men they carry at each time.  This makes Reinhart expendable to bring in an exceptional winger like Taylor Hall.  Now here's where I get killed by everyone here, but that would give the Islanders lines of:  Hall-Tavares-Bailey  Kuley-Fransy-Grabo  Lee/Nelson-Strome-Grabner  Martin-Zeekers-Clutterbuck  Then you will also have depth signings scratched/playing when guys inevitably get hurt and maybe even young guys like Collberg/MDC or Ho-Sang being with the team next year."
NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,mcbordes,2,Wed Apr 29 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with trading KO, Bailey, Reinhart, or Grabner. Tavares could really use a true wing man like Hall or Eberle, and with so many up and coming prospects, we could really go for selling some players high. Besides, I think what we need to move forward is a couple of good (not you Tyler Kennedy) playoff experienced players to help the young ones anticipate what to expect in the playoffs so at least we wouldn't be caught with our pants down, particularly another D-man.  With goaltending, other then replacing Mike Dunham the goaltending coach, what has been really itching me is Ottawa looking to rid of Hammond or Lehner, and I think either would be a good pickup, and I think we have the capacity to trade for that."
NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,cassettecowboy,2,Wed Apr 29 05:01:58 2015 UTC,I was so ecstatic when the Islanders signed Chad Johnson.  I thought him and Jaro were going to be 1 and 1a in net based on how well he played in Boston last year.  He certainly didn't get the press the Hamburglar got this year but I think he'll be another Chad Johnson.  I don't like the idea of picking up a backup goalie for anything more than a late pick or just signing one as a free agent.  At some point the Poulin Wall should be able to atleast step into the back up role.

NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,kenlane,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"All Players/Coaches currently under contract, not including LITR, Minor Leaguers and Prospects. from top to bottom,  Coaches  Capuano, Weight, and Dunham need to go.  Capuano: Cappy's coaching has been suspect at best. more need to be done in the playoffs and i just dont feel like he is the guy that will get us there. his inability to change gameplan mid-game and his inability to coach a third period has been our achilles heel for far too long. In the caps series no one is being pressured to put a body on anyone and finish checks in our own end (outside of line 4) most of the caps goals were a result of extended zone pressure. Our neutral zone play was awful as well, the caps (like most teams this season) just walked the puck in at will. GOES.  Weight: 0-14 on the PP in the playoffs... nuff said. GOES.  Dunham: too many games were lost where we outshot our opponents but would still end up losing due to soft goals and lackluster play in our own end. GOES.  As far as the players...    Forwards:  Everyone played well enough, but the fire really faded from their game in the second half of the season, the passing was lazy, our entry was bad at best, and the powerplay was a joke, sure some of it can be attributed to coaching, but at the end of the day you really have to look at where the mindset of these players are.   Tavares: John Tavares needs a strong winger, and it isn't bailey. Period. STAYS(of course).  Bailey: Ive always been on the Bailey bandwagon but i feel he would be better suited for a 2nd or 3rd line scenario. Sure Josh had a strong Playoffs points wise, but far too many times i felt like he was trying to do too much with the puck. hes not creative enough to give john a better shot or provide space for himself for john to attract defenders and then make a play. GOES.  Okposo: I like Okposo but you really didnt see the chemistry between him and Tavares the was there when Moulson was here, perhaps he still has lingering drags from the eye surgery, but i feel he needs to be a centerpiece of the 2nd or 3rd line to see him flourish (much akin to when john was injured during the olympics and he had to step up during the second half of that season) STAYS.  Grabovski and Kulemin: these 2 guys showed glimpses of what a forward pair with chemistry should look like and gave us great chances against the caps, they are proven players who showed a great amount of poise and were very exciting to watch. STAYS.  Line 4: Line 4 was at times our best line of the entire year, they can hit, they defend, Clutterbuck has shown he can score goals, and Cizikas has a duality to his play that supports everything this line is about. STAYS.  The Kid Line: the kid line is just that, still growing.  Lee: when Lee first came up in the last 10 games of the previous season, his role was a big body center who got in the dirty areas and made plays, he score a ton of points in that small time frame and then for some reason they thought it would be good to move him to the wing... i would love to see him in that ""big center"" role again, his wing play was uninspiring and his healthy scratch in game 7 was evident of that. STAYS.  Strome: Strome is no John Tavares, he needs more time to mature and needs to have more confidence on the puck, make a move and try to get creative, this grindy style doesn't suit him and he seemed invisible during the playoffs. STAYS (but not on this line)  Nelson: Nelson is a hard worker and understands the game. he has a future, is it with us though? UNDECIDED.  Franz Nielsen: Franz Nielsen... he had no playoff presence, however, he is solid and a key player during the regular season, hes been one of my favorite players to watch for some time now and i feel he more than deserves to be here. His consistency during the shootout is a godsend. STAYS.  Colin Mcdonald: I hate colin Mcdonald, or at least, i used to. he always seems to be in the right spots and can make plays and clogs up wherever he is, hes worked hard and is in my opinion the best healthy scratch you can have, where if you need that extra strength or a role filler he can step up and make a game of it. STAYS.  Grabner: Grabner is still a threat and was grossly underutilized during the playoffs, just having him on the ice during a pk has the opponent change their mindset given his (less now after surgery)explosive speed and eye for open pucks... but then with that, there is his finishing, which sadly doesnt exist. I still like him though and would love to see him back in the lineup full time. STAYS.  The rest: Tyler Kennedy, Boulton, & Mouillierat should be dealt this offseason. GOES! and good riddance!    Defence:   The Defence, Even while bolstered with the arrival of Boychuk and Leddy Struggled to find themselves in the 2nd and 3rd pairing area, they surely need help and health moving forward.  Boychuk: Boychuk is a stud. STAYS.  Leddy: One of the only guys here who know when to carry over or dump in, his smart plays and poise under pressure are inspiring to say the least. STAYS.  Hamonic: Not as big a fan of the hammer as i used to be, but still a solid second pairing guy. STAYS.  DeHaan: Man, i cant make heads or tails of this guy, i would like to see him stay but he seems to make more and more unsafe and rushed plays than he used to. UNDECIDED.  Strait: His play lately has been miles ahead of what it used to be, but seeing him go as a piece to a trade for a solid 2nd or third pair defenseman would be nice. GOES.  Visnovsky: This guy held us together for a long time, but sadly to say i think he's done, ill miss him for sure, but he has his health to think about. GOES.  Donovan: outside of him being ejected for seemingly nothing during game 6 i don't feel we have seen enough of him to make a judgement, he seems to have fire which is nice and was alright in game 7. STAYS.  Hickey: His size is an issue and his play is average, i think he could grow into something special, but is this a wait I'm willing to make? I'm not sure. UNDECIDED.  Bonus: Mayfield: Mayfield showed so much presence and determination during game 7, and i feel very very good about him. his size and smart plays on the puck put me at ease and made me forget that he hasn't played very many NHL games (let alone Playoff games) at all. STAYS.  Goaltending:  Halak: He was truly special during the playoffs, and kept us in every damn game he played in (minus game 5) however, we need a goaltending coach to bring him some consistency during the regular season. STAYS.  Neuvirth: I personally feel they are wearing out Halak and as such  Neuvirth needs to step up, he let in a lot of soft ones but i still feel he is a solid number 2 and a little better coaching and conditioning could go a long way. STAYS.  Poulin: he still plays here? jk, Poulin is a good emergency goaltender, i still have faith, however if the opportunity were to present itself, then he should go. GOES.  RFA/UFA/Rumors  As for acquisitions, i think the best available players that would could realistically pick up would be: Taylor Hall: LW, Jordan Eberle: RW, Christian Ehrhoff: D, Zbynek Michalek: D, Mike Green: D, Johnny Oduya: D  Lines for 2015-16  Forwards Strome - Tavares - Bailey Replacement/Hall/Eberle? Grabovsky - Nielsen - Kulemin Okposo - Lee - Nelson Martin - Cizikas - Clutterbuck    Defense Boychuk - Leddy Hamonic - Hickey/Replacement/Oduya/Ehrhoff? any mixture of deHaan/Hickey/Mayfield/Reinhart based on performance    Scratches: Grabner, Mcdonald.    this is all speculation that we would be able to pick these players up without having to deal out current players, however i don't think it would be crazy to think that there is some sort of combination of: Bailey/Nelson/Hickey/Reinhart/Picks that could make some of these happen."
NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,nickturk,4,Wed Apr 29 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"> Bailey: Ive always been on the Bailey bandwagon but i feel he would be better suited for a 2nd or 3rd line scenario. Sure Josh had a strong Playoffs points wise, but far too many times i felt like he was trying to do too much with the puck. hes not creative enough to give john a better shot or provide space for himself for john to attract defenders and then make a play. GOES  Bailey is incredible at finding opening against the defense and is great with the puck. His problem is he cannot score like a normal hockey player.   >Lee: when Lee first came up in the last 10 games of the previous season, his role was a big body center who got in the dirty areas and made plays, he score a ton of points in that small time frame and then for some reason they thought it would be good to move him to the wing... i would love to see him in that ""big center"" role again, his wing play was uninspiring and his healthy scratch in game 7 was evident of that. STAYS.  He should be playing on a wing with JT. Whether it Bailey or Strome with them JT and Lee are great for eachother."
NewYorkIslanders,347p7q,tanu24,2,Thu Apr 30 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"-Okposo I feel with his size and bump and grind style always had that 4th line style of play going for him. Wouldn't mind seeing us have 2 lines that are bump and grind for the team with him leading the way on one of them. -Coaching needs to go, they had their chance. -Baileys a frustrating case because he's so hit or miss at times. Wouldn't mind him going depending on what we could get for him -Visnovsky should go, if for anything just because of his health. If anything we can get someone to replace him or give some room for Mayfield or someone else to step up and further prove themselves. - I'm with you with Tavares. Idk if i'll get hate for it but wish we could pull of getting moulson back just because their chemistry was sexy."

NewYorkIslanders,347jbh,Raymondahz,3,Tue Apr 28 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well, here's my honest, only-slightly-biased thought: we had a championship caliber roster this year. In the first half of the year when we had an almost entirely healthy roster, we were first in the league in terms of many advanced stats (notably Fenwick), and were also right at the top of the league in terms of points and wins. Keep in mind, our goaltending and penalty killing in that time was also not good - Halak was not great for the first couple months, and Chad Johnson was not a good backup for us.   In terms of roster additions, we're losing perhaps only one crucial player in Visnovsky... perhaps he signs again for one year, but to be honest if he's dealing with another bad concussion, we may have seen the end of his career. Visnovsky was VERY good. We'll have to hope that Boychuk and Leddy can be leaned on perhaps slightly more, and that someone like Pulock is NHL ready (I think he will be) and capable of filling in Lubo's role.  The big problem for me is the coaching. While the PK eventually sorted itself out, it was still a major problem for about 70 games. Have we really turned a corner, or will we again be near the bottom of the league? And the powerplay, while started off decent, ended up 16th in the regular season, and killed us in the playoffs. In my opinion, Doug Weight has to be removed from the bench. I have no problem with him being an assistant GM, I think he's a smart guy, but his PP strategy did not work well -- and it's not because of the roster. This team has the players necessary to have an elite powerplay unit.   Additionally, Capuano's juggling of the lines after Grabovski got hurt killed the team's chemistry. While you can expect a team to sink a bit when losing an important player or two, you can not accept an 0-7-1 home stretch, and a plummet like that out of home ice advantage. We were first in the league on March 11th(!!!), and didn't end up in a position to win a playoff round. That is not acceptable. We need a coaching staff that can get 100 percent out of this team the whole year and in the playoffs, because 100 percent from this team is championship caliber. And given how young so many important players are (Lee, Strome, Nelson, De Haan, Tavares, even Leddy, all 25 or younger), we can expect to actually be even more capable next year. But we need coaches that can elevate them to that next level."
NewYorkIslanders,347jbh,forsan_et_haec,2,Wed Apr 29 05:59:31 2015 UTC,November was arguably Halaks best month for us.
NewYorkIslanders,34750a,Iceman3116,4,Tue Apr 28 20:54:34 2015 UTC,They pretty much nailed it.  Cappy deserves one more year at the least.  Weight is gone.  Look for them to add a proven coach as an assistant and special teams coach.  The struggle on the power play burried them this year. (and broken sticks).  If they can add one winger who is a proven 1st liner (Patrick sharp?) and another lock down dman they will be a force next season
NewYorkIslanders,34750a,quigs17,2,Wed Apr 29 00:03:24 2015 UTC,We absolutely need an assistant coach and special teams coach. I am not sold on giving Cappy another year. We need a top line winger and to pay the stick companies more for better sticks. Do you think Detroit is going to get rid of their coach?
NewYorkIslanders,34750a,lsp2005,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"I do have to say i wouldnt mind if we could get Sharp by giving up De haan, his puck control concerns me, and I feel our d is deep enough especially with Mayfield playing well in the playoffs to make the move."
NewYorkIslanders,34750a,quigs17,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:52:52 2015 UTC,They might be.  But it probably depends on where they end up in the playoffs.
NewYorkIslanders,348da4,princesslindsay,11,Wed Apr 29 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"In this situation it doesn't do the organization any good to fire the current coach without having a really good idea who the replacement(s) are.   For all his faults, Cappy's Isles had a 100 point season. The islanders are not going to look like a very attractive organization if they appear to be knee jerky and perhaps unfair to a coach who by all metrics had a successful season.    The organization is going to sit and wait and see. Will Babcock be available?  Will the new GM in Boston get rid of Julien? etc.   The devil you know is often better than the devil you don't. The isles need a coaching upgrade, but if they fire Cappy right now, there is no guarantee they get someone better.  It's April 28th. there is plenty of time to test the waters and see who becomes available, and who is interested.    patience."

Firing him right now might put us in a bind later.  He needs to go this off-season in my opinion, but today isn't the right time.  I think the 100-point season issue is valid too, but at some point we need to clearly communicate that expectations are higher.  If he was capable of motivating these guys to play a full 60 minutes, it's not far-fetched to say we could have had the President's Trophy by a considerable margin.  Still, the President's Trophy isn't even the goal, obviously.  Bottom line is that I think firing him sets a precedent, and that's what we need.  We have sufficient talent and ""tangibles,"" now we need to mold it and build those ""intangibles"" that make champions."

NewYorkIslanders,345r32,TeethMummy,17,Wed Apr 29 00:46:17 2015 UTC,"For me, it's just a nagging hatred of the Caps' wider strategy in series. It reminded me too much of the NYI-TOR series in 02, where supergoons Tucker and Domi targeted and successfully knocked out key guys Peca and KJ.  In this series, Washington targeted and successfully took out two of our main D-men, piling on an already shaky 5-man blueline after Hamonic got injured in the CBJ game.  To me, that's just a bullshit strategy, and Washington should be ashamed of it. Folks keep calling it a physical series, but I don't think that paints a fair picture.   The Caps played on the edge of legality. They targeted and injured two key defensemen. Could have been much worse, with dangerous hits to Tavares, Hickey, and Nielsen.  We had a game 7 - a classic ""win or go home."" But thanks to the Caps' series-long strategy, we had a game 7 with a built-in disadvantage. Call it the playoffs, call it ""old time hockey,"" but they got away with much more than just playing hockey to win. They often played and worked to reduce the Isles - not just to win.  Sadly, it doesn't change the facts - they showed up to play, and we didn't.   Pass the salt."

A super impressive season so far, the Rags were nearly unbeatable after December 1st and are going to blaze through the early playoff rounds.

NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,ls1allday,11,Tue Apr 28 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"Size. We're too small. We need a few skilled big guys, especially one for JT. Could you imagine JT with a Perry-esque player? I don't think Brock will ever be that player, unfortunately. Two decent d-men. Vis is likely done (and if not, he'll be injured half of the time). I am not a fan of de Haan. Reinhart isn't NHL-ready. Can Mayfield or Pulock make the cut? If not, we need someone. Again, a few big guys would be nice. Better sticks."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,JAAAS,3,Tue Apr 28 13:44:30 2015 UTC,Maybe Lee can be the size player? Sadly his drop in the last month doesn't look good.
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,dl2316,3,Tue Apr 28 14:24:31 2015 UTC,Because hes not a skill player hes a get in front big bodied grinder who will shine with JT and not with other grinders.

NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,nofx516,6,Tue Apr 28 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"1 I agree that we need another sniper, but we just have too many forwards on the roster. I would probably look to unload grabner. I love watching him play and I'd hate to see him go, but I don't know who else you could really let go with little repercussions. You'd still have too many forwards on the roster with that move, but I digress. 2 I think lubo may call it a career. For his own sake. If not, he's another injury prone defenseman that would be more of a liability than help. I'd look to bring in our rookie defensemen and move on from strait, hickey, and tbh Donovan. They're good for depth purposes, and performed admirably, but we need to bulster our d with some fresh faces. I don't think we should pick up anyone there. Keep it in house.   3 id like to see neuvirth back next year. I don't think the sample size we saw was really a fair showing of his skills. If we get smart and hire a real goalie coach it would do wonders for him and jaro. Though I do think part of jaros drop off in stats towards the end of the year had more to do with misusage than anything else. Can't run a guy into the ground and expect his best stuff every night."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,superfluity87,2,Tue Apr 28 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"i like the idea of Neuvirth and Jaro for a full season. i have to believe that some of the games that Johnson dropped earlier in the year, when the team was firing on all cylinders, Neuvirth would have pulled out.   Jaro's performance in the playoffs showed he was a great pick up. However, it would be wonderful if our backup could win us some games next year so Jaro's load is a bit smaller."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,Waldo19,2,Tue Apr 28 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Johnson just never found his stride. He's always been on defense first teams, so I can see it being difficult to adjust to a completely different style of team. Best of luck to him, but I'm glad he's gone. Someone said it somewhere in a later thread that Rimer from the leafs would be a good fit for us. So I'd be pulling for him if neuvirth decides to walk. Personally I've never believed in putting a strenuous work load on your #1 goalie. The teams that have there starters play 70 plus games are insane. I'd like to see them split his time more like when he was with the blues with a slight tilt more for jaro.   Edit - just to clarify.I don't remember goalies playing so many games when I first started watching hockey. Then brodeur decided he wanted to attempt to complete a full 82 games and you had guys like Dipietro trying to emulate that. I think its why you're seeing more injuries these days, especially pulled groins. You can't put all that extra strain on a human body and not expect it to bend back."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,superfluity87,4,Tue Apr 28 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"1) I don't feel we need a trade, I think we got a first line winger for JT already and that's lee. We never got to see a legitimate lineup with lee up there. There's a reason why he was starting to go into the running for the Calder. He was potting goals like anything. Plus he has size. That's the winger we need. Enough of the trades everyone, I'm tired of trades; think back to early 2000's.  2) I can't see adding anyone. Even if the prospects aren't up the par, it's no use renting a guy for that short amount of time. Vis's career might be over but if not I'm fine with signing him at a low amount (maybe a mill) for a year and have him around as #7 or #6.  3) Nobody gave Neuvirth his fair shot. He had such a small sample size on a team that was entirely different than buffalo. I'd like to have him back but if he can't then I'd consider bringing up Williams from BP. Other than that just try to sign a ufa cause there's no sense in trading for one.  Bottom line; everyone has to stop thinking about buying/trading players. We're not the fucking rangers; Islanders drafted their key players for the dynasty years. My next season lineup is as follows:  Lee-JT-Strome  bailey-Neilson-Okie  kule-grabo-nelson  mc2  Leddy-boychuk  hamonic-pulock/mayfield/dehaan    (whichever fits better with hamonic)  mayfield/pulock-strait/vis/hickey    Jaro  Nuevirth"
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,leeber27,3,Tue Apr 28 15:05:48 2015 UTC,Coaching staff. They've gone as far as then can with Cappy and Doug Weight should be shot out of a cannon pointed west. Figuring out a first line and sticking with it.  Figure out if they need to address the back up goalie situation or if they're good with Mr. N.   A bright spot of this series was the young d in games 6 and 7. I think Mayfield is in next year for sure.

NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,karmapuhlease,2,Tue Apr 28 20:46:12 2015 UTC,exactly my point. He's still getting better as a player and he did that with rotating line mates for the whole year! Imagine him with two stud wingers! Assuming Okposo plays with him next year
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,odogangledrummer,2,Tue Apr 28 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"deHaan played pretty well especially when the D got thin, he just gets injured every thirty seconds."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,chiaestevez,2,Tue Apr 28 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"there really is only one priority - winger for JT.  We just do not have the guy we need in house - look around.  Sidney/Malkin, Perry/Getzlaf, Kane/Toews, Ovi/Backstrom, Giroux/Voracek, Parise/Vanek (ugh) - every team seemingly has a pair of studs that work together at least on the powerplay.  This is the free agent signing we need going into Brooklyn - a stud winger for JT to play with all season"
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,Skooby14,3,Tue Apr 28 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Problem is, that role probably won't be filled by a free agent. Take a look at the UFA's this offseason. Doesn't look too promising. If the Islanders are going to pick up any new players this offseason, it'll be through a trade."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,NordicReagan,2,Tue Apr 28 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Sniper for the first line to be paired with JT. The plan right now is probably to wait and let Dal Colle develop, but if there's a way we can pick up a first class winger through a fair trade this offseason, by all means do it. I'd love to see that line return to the level of success we had when Vanek was up there and I'm pretty sure a sniper is the missing piece. Someone who's shot is on point and isn't prioritizing passing as much as the other guys.  Shore up the defense. Vis is most likely gone. DeHaan will stay; one off year isn't enough to push him out of consideration. Hickey's job is definitely in jeopardy considering the plethora of young, talented d-men we have coming up. We may need to fill a hole here though if we make a trade. Our d prospects will most likely be our trade pieces.  I know it isn't necessarily roster related, but definitely coaching. I think Cap gets another year. Not that I necessarily agree with it, but I have a strong feeling management will give him one last go at cracking the first round in the playoffs. Weight, however, is most definitely gone. Our PP is stagnant, broken, and just downright pitiful."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,NordicReagan,2,Tue Apr 28 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"Goodbye Coaching staff. Special teams, goalie coach, conditioning coaches whatever. Get them out. Team looked unprepared way too often and especially in the playoffs. Exhausted every third period. Also terrible special teams cost this team so many points. Make Doug Weight the assistant GM. Try to Hire Hitchcock. I want no more of this amateur coaching staff.  Bigger Defensemen. The caps bullied this team. I want Reinhart Pulock or Mayfield in place of Vis. I don't like Hickey but I can deal with him. He isn't good with the puck in his own zone. De Haan should have a better year, Hamonic is growing. Leddy will still be great. I think this will be the year Boychuk starts declining a bit but he will be a good presence for the team and not that bad of a Defensemen. Patrick Sharp"
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,RyPhy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"A scoring wing with size and speed. Kulemin has size and speed, no offense. Lee has size and skill, meh speed. Bailey is a jack of all trades master of none. Really wanted E.Kane. The only UFA of interest is Joel Ward (whom I actually would love to snag on a 2-3 year deal). Trade wise O'Reilly would be overkill, Lucic would be costly and an ill fit, dont think Oilers move Hall after drafting McDavid. Could see the Blues move some older forwards, all of whom fit the bill. Dont think my other ideal guy in Simmonds would be available either. Another solution is to get a heavy center so you can use Nelson as a wing.  Get another heavy blueliner, but for the leftside. Doesnt need to be a big name, just someone who can play a competent 2nd/3rd pairing while Reinhart/Pelech develop.  Make decisions on Grabner, DeHaan, and I guess Bailey and the forward depth. Cappy didnt seem to keen on using deHaan (maybe he was nursing something...) and Grabner's been in the doghouse for a minute. Id hesitate to move CdH but he was putrid in the playoffs and has odd tendencies that Im not sure can be coached out (constantly backs the play up and gets too cocky behind the net, refuses to skate through lanes and activate as a 4th forward).    Since its not the roster... HM Coach. Cappy needs to go, he's done all he can and admitted as such. Babcocks deal is up, Hitchcock is uncertain, and one can dream of Peter. Id stay clear of Torts or Ron Wilson, both are sideshows."

A solid backup for Halak Bring in a new head coach at best, a new PP coach at worst.   I know they won't get rid of Cappy, but I honestly believe with him at the helm, they'll always be that scrappy team who's a tough first round opponent."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,pepimartinez,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"I would give Dal Colle a legit shot at making the team as a top 9 winger. He should be playing with the NHL players in preseason.     Go out and get a proven backup goalie. Neuvirth showed literally no reason to have faith in him     Trim ""the fat"". Grabner and CMac are wastes of roster spots. Grabner is not effective. Im fine with CMac in the minors. One of Hickey, Strait, and Dono should be our 7th D , the others should go (unless keeping 8 D is a normal thing). Mayfield showed he deserves a spot on the bottom pairing, and Pulock hasnt even been given his chance yet.  Then we have Reinhart, Czuczman, Pelech, and Ness. Plenty of depth       One other thing, Weight 100% has to go. Our PP was ranked like 17th in ths league and couldnt score in the playoffs. When you look at the talent we have, thats unacceptable."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,HypertextMakeoutLang,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:37:57 2015 UTC,Get new special teams coaching. 0/14 PP in the playoffs. I blame that reason alone for not winning this series. Figure out the lines. It shouldn't be a crapshoot or superstition as to who starts and who is scratched. Bring back Matt Moulson :D. Sign a decent backup goaltender. I don't think Poulin can play consistently at the NHL level. Neuvirth isn't gonna stick around as a backup.
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,morgrar,0,Wed Apr 29 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"New head coach, and power play work bad!!!!!!!!! Find out exactly what he have defensively, Mayfield and Donavan played well in the two games they were up. Obviously we are a much better team with a healthy Hamonic, but can we please do something about Strait? He is a sloppy passer and it definitely hurts. Sign a good defensemen? We got lucky with Leddy and Boychuk.  Get bigger! We have the two top hitters in the league but our team is small. I miss Chara.   Honorable Mention:    Back up Goalie. Cam Talbot anyone? Winger for JT, Strome was a good place holder but I think we need a more developed talent at his side. I loved the JT/Patrice B. combo in the All-Star game, thats most likely never going to happen! Especially after we stole Boychuk last year from the Bruins. But damn would I love to see Garth pull that off without losing everything. Need to stop passing on the power play so much, also the ditch and dump play in the last period yesterday was terrible, we need new game plans.    Edit: Why the down votes?"

NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,A_Charmandur,-4,Tue Apr 28 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"New coaching staff.  We need someone with experience who won't make bone head roster decisions. Backup goalie.  Jaro needs to stay fresh throughout the season.  My preference is to try and make a trade for Reimer or try and resign Neuvirth. Don't take on any bad contracts so they can get ""veteran presence""   We won all year because we out possessed and out skated every team, yet in the second half of the year and in the playoffs we tried to play a grind it out game and that's not what this team is made for.  If we are skating well no one can keep up with our speed.  My ideal lineup for next year:  DalColle - JT - KO  Lee - Nelson - Strome   Kuli - Grabovski - Grabner   Bailey - Neilson - Clutterbuck   Martin - Cizikas   Leddy - Boychuck   Dehaan - Hammer   Hickey - Pulock   Donovan  I think Straight needs to be traded so he can't be played.  I think him/martin/cizikas can be moved for a backup goalie."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,jp_the_orange,2,Tue Apr 28 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"You would keep Hickey over Mayfield? Martin and Zeeks now on D? You would trade 2/3 of the ""Best 4th Line in the NHL""?? You would now replace those two on the 4th with Bailey and Neilson??? Are you fucking mental?  Also, that is NOT a first line that will protect JT. I just... I just can't."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,ziggyetotis,0,Tue Apr 28 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Hickey has shown he's a dependable 5, a great puck moving D and is what the NHL is moving towards with a speed based game.  If you think Martin/Cizikas are better then Bailey/Neilson you are the one who's mental.  First let's look at simple box car stats Bailey/Neilson are 40pts a year players while Martin/Cizikas are 20 pt players at best (also check the HERO charts to see a big difference www.ownthepuck.blogspot.ca).  As much as I love the hitting and energy they bring you win by scoring goals and not by how many hits you make.  I have them listed as the 13/14th forward as well as dono as the 7th d.  I think Martin would be good in the Boulton role as a tough guy but with more skill."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,jp_the_orange,2,Tue Apr 28 19:34:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't breakup the 4th line under any circumstance. They were above and beyond our best line this series. Not all about point production from them, the energy they provide is invaluable."
NewYorkIslanders,345ah0,jp_the_orange,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they aren't good but if you can put in two 40 point scorers in their place you do it.  The reason we lost this series was because we didn't score enough goals.  Neilson, bailey and clutter would be a huge mismatch against other teams 4 lines.  I think clutter is the most important of the 3 as he is one of our best penalty killers and is what really keeps that 4th line being productive.  With mcdonald or mallrat in for clutter during this season the 4th line wasn't the same"
NewYorkIslanders,343u2w,crosby510,30,Tue Apr 28 02:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah...that's what this team is good for.  Celebrating single victories in the playoffs.    I know everyone here is patting everyone on the back for a good season...and I know I should be proud of our boys for making it to a game 7 with a depleted roster...but what the fuck was that tonight?  There was no juice whatsoever.  11 shots?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Pathetic.  More pathetic shit from this franchise that has been a laughing stock for a generation.  Fuck all this kumbaya bullshit, this was an epic failure.  This team needed to get out of the first round.  With an opportunity to face the fucking RANGERS?!?!?!  No, I'm pissed.  This team limped into the playoffs, and gave us just enough hope to make us believe, then crush us as it has time and time again.  This is just the beginning?  They are the juggernaut of the future?  I hope so...but let's all be cautious in our optimism.  This is, after all, the Islanders."

In fact the D was pretty unreal tonight considering were out 3 of our top 6.   But to the forwards: what the actual fuck? 11 shots is a fucking joke for a game 7 with potential to play the Rangers. This isn't the fucking minors. Not only did they play like they were gassed, they played like they didn't give a shit. They didn't even deserve the win.  Obviously we're young and I do think we have great potential. But we need a serious coaching and attitude change if we ever want to win a playoffs series anytime soon."
NewYorkIslanders,343u2w,simple10,3,Tue Apr 28 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"This is weak shit. Defense drives offense. That's hockey. I love what Mayfield did, but you think he's able to distribute like Hamonic and Visnovsky? We looked like shit tonight and I'm not excusing the weak game, but it's not simply defense doesn't suck and offense sucks because of goals scored. Our transition was killed on a road game with AHLers."

Regardless of Mayfields ability to distribute, we still weren't able to step the fuck up on any of our powerplays, or you know, when it really mattered in game 7. I know what hockey is, I played for 9 years. You can't blame it all on the AHLers.  edit: definitely hurt to not have Vis an Hamonic, I'm not arguing that"

NewYorkIslanders,343u2w,thewrongflag,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"and on another, Mayfield and Donovan played there ass off when our defense corps were pretty depleted, we have more d-men in Pulock and Reinhart coming on up, and more forward help in Dal Colle and Ho-Sang. Halak was at his best all year, as it could been much worse, and can only look to get better. Our guys looked pretty worn out from the seven game series and it seem enough to give them a taste of what's expected in the playoffs, considering at the end of last season nobody even expected us to get into the playoffs. And lets not forget Garth seems pretty lucid of our situation, as noted for the last off-season, so he knows that changes will be made, and hopefully for the better, as we can only get better. So even though the ending to this year's story was kinda a bummer, there's a lot to look forward to as we can say we are no longer ""rebuilding"" and we have a lot optimism to carry us to next season."
NewYorkIslanders,343u2w,cassettecowboy,6,Tue Apr 28 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"Halak deserves a goddamn medal after that kick save. The offense was the disappointment tonight.

NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,leeber27,15,Tue Apr 28 03:42:52 2015 UTC,Mayfield passed Reinhart on the depth chart for me.

NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,YoungTedDanson,6,Tue Apr 28 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"lol, I was thinking the same thing. Everything we wanted from Reinhart this series and didn't get, we got from Mayfield"
NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,ArtyThePoopie,3,Tue Apr 28 03:46:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, hasn't Mayfield had a lot more seasoning in the AHL at this point? Mayfield has had 3 years down there while Reinhart has had one. Sure, they're similar in age, but I'm not expecting much from Reinhart for at least another one to two years."
NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,NordicReagan,3,Tue Apr 28 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah totally. In another thread someone said to trade him but I argued saying hold onto him because everyone matures at different rates and he needs time to develop. However coming to this thread, my point is that mayfield deserves a spot with his play. Just because reinhart didn't play well doesn't mean he doesn't ever deserve a spot. He just shouldn't have one in the near future"
NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,leeber27,2,Tue Apr 28 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. I mean, 2 games is a small sample size but Mayfield really impressed me with his poise and physicality. I think if the Isles make a trade this offseason though, we'd either see him, Reinhart, or Pulock go. As much as that would suck, we have the majority of our d-core already locked up to deals. Depth is always good, but we can definitely spare one of them I think."

NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,Skooby14,5,Tue Apr 28 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"I like that lineup a lot. I feel strait totally deserved a spot on this team. I'm not sure if it's in every night line up, or as number 7. Regardless it's between him and dehaan and based on playoffs he gets the spot"

However Dehaan is a good player as well, I can't see him continuing to fall off and not figure it out. The isles traded up for him for a reason. I can see him being a regular top 4 defenseman averaging 18-20 mins a game in the next couple years as long as he has the character to do so."
NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,xjared45,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:46:26 2015 UTC,"im a big fan of dehaan - i like his style of play although we havent seen much from an offensive standpoint as we'd hoped for by now.  i just think that the big issue here is that there is too much competition and he may be good trade bait to make up for some lost picks.  considering the competition and his injury history (it is expected that his shoulder is what was hurt from that hit this series, again), he might be the expendable one.   only time will tell! its going to be a looong 4-5 months"
NewYorkIslanders,3444tn,slapshot18,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:53:20 2015 UTC,Sorry I just want strait gone. He's been better but de haan who you are missing. Donovan and hickey bring much more to the team. Strait isn't a guy who is on a championship team.

I don't know how many more hits he can take, but he has to be on the verge of it being extremely dangerous now. If you give any of our rookie d-men a shot to develop they'll show up in a big way.

When did I sympathize with the coaching staff in any of my comments on this thread or since i made this account? I simply stated that this season was the final proof that this coaching staff isn't a good fit for our team. Previous seasons they possibly had excuses in that our defense was young and/or lacking and goaltending was old and/or shitty. Anything less then riding the team of the whole coaching staff, not just Capuano, would be quite the mistake on Snows part given the fact that cappy's system doesn't work and special teams have been abysmal."

His post game discussions are always awful with them reeking of, ""better luck next time"".  We've made a lot of great changes this past season to really help solidify our core. Capuano (I'm going to insert Strait too) is the last dump before the flush."

NewYorkIslanders,343vj1,JAAAS,4,Wed Apr 29 00:10:42 2015 UTC,Highly doubt Capuano gets fired. He and Weight should be unemployed tomorrow but both will be in the same jobs next year.
NewYorkIslanders,343vj1,ArtyThePoopie,2,Tue Apr 28 03:23:29 2015 UTC,I really hope so. I don't know why cappy continued to attempt to make the isles play defense. They are so much better when playing aggressive and pinching their d-men than when they try to play a controlled game. although i was kind of proud of him for actually using his time outs this series.

The guy's a proven winner and can take us to the next level. I'd keep Cappy in as an assistant coach, maybe, as the players seem to love him. But there's no excusing 0 for 14 on the PP and a utter lack of motivation sometimes this season."

NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,mrbaren,8,Tue Apr 28 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"Hate to be that guy, but it's probably not happenin'.  1)I'm sure they pay him next to nothing, relative to other coaches.  2)Player-friendly coach, likely has their support.  3)Is Garth Snow's buddy from University of Maine.  4)At the end of the day, they had a 100+ point season. Not too many coaches lose their job after that kind of season, unless they have a history of losing in the first round."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,teenagewatermelon,3,Tue Apr 28 02:55:48 2015 UTC,We still choked and lost home field advantage. Bottom 5 pk. Awful pplay after a hot start in the season. Completely came out flat in game 7 and lost in the first round. Completely disappointed in how we finished
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,Clown_Shoe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a Capologist here (see what I did there?), but I just want to play devil's advocate for a second.    While, yes, we did perform terribly in the second half, we were down two of our better players during this period of time.   The failure of the powerplay will be pinned on Weight, seeing how that's his job. I'd expect to see him let go this offseason. Or moved to a different position.  We finished the last two games of the playoffs down 3 of our regular season defensemen. And I'd say them coming our ""flat"" in the third game is more so because of fatigue. The boys look fucking exhausted for 80% of last nights game.    I think all of these things will factor in when considering whether or not to bring Cap back. He just had a 100 point season and while it did end on a sour note, he should progress and brought a team destined to the playoffs to the playoffs.   If he fucks up next year though- either by (God forbid) missing the playoffs or not getting out of the first round again, I'd say he's most certainly gone."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,NordicReagan,2,Tue Apr 28 16:25:05 2015 UTC,How many games have we lost in the 3rd period with at least a 2 goal lead? Cap tends to just tell the guys to sit back and play defense and that is why we ended up losing the 2nd game of the series. He also is really poor at making in game adjustments to counter the other team's play. A lot of the glaring weaknesses on this team would be less apparent if we had a better coach imo
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,whitetoast,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:56:28 2015 UTC,Its on weight and capuano. He's the head coach. It all falls on him. Also the guy from Toronto who is our special teams coach.
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,Clown_Shoe,2,Tue Apr 28 16:27:35 2015 UTC,I have to agree with you. I just don't think Cappy is going anywhere. He's been seemingly holding on to his job by a thread for a couple years now but Garth won't pull the trigger

NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,teenagewatermelon,-1,Tue Apr 28 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"if not, then maybe as a consolation we can rid of Brian Strait, perhaps?"
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,cassettecowboy,2,Tue Apr 28 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"I was probably the single biggest critic of Strait in the regular season. And it kills me to say it, but he played at an entirely different level in the playoffs. If he can repeat that, then he's not the place to start reloading this team."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,mgiblue21,7,Tue Apr 28 13:39:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I want Cappy gone too.  He's not the worst and not the best, but I feel like the team would be better served in the long run without him.  Let's face it, there are just better coaches out there.  Whether we do get a new head coach, God only knows, but it's something to think about for the future."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,NHL_nutjob_19,6,Tue Apr 28 03:33:16 2015 UTC,"Saw an article a while ago about cup winning teams since 91. Basically no team has won a cup with the coach they had during their rebuilding era. Everyone's had a major change. We need Babcock. Man, we need a coach that can turn this around."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,islesandpizza,12,Tue Apr 28 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with firing cappy, but in his defense pulling halak on the pp would be really risky at that point. One successful well-aimed dump and the game is 3-1"
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,leeber27,8,Tue Apr 28 02:55:50 2015 UTC,I'll take the risk of the successful well-aimed dump to add another attacker in a position where you need to score to keep your season alive. No difference between 2-1 and 3-1.
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,leeber27,5,Tue Apr 28 03:10:45 2015 UTC,"3-1 with 2 min in the game is a lot worse than 2-1 with 30 seconds left. It's a fair argument. I'll be the first to nail the hand in the crucifixion of cappy, but not for his call on that. It's a hard call."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,Waldo19,2,Tue Apr 28 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"also, the caps kept clearing the puck, i'd like to think jaro would have headed sooner if a good opportunity had presented itself earlier. instead, he went when it was clearly desperation time."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,leeber27,0,Tue Apr 28 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"Agree, not the main reason for him to go. With all this said.. my gut says he stays :/"

NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,Waldo19,5,Tue Apr 28 03:22:53 2015 UTC,0/14 if you count the power play that could have sent it to overtime
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,ryan924,4,Tue Apr 28 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"give the guy some credit. the defensive game plan against the caps on the whole was pretty good. looking at the series as a whole, they did a great job limiting ovi and the caps pp, with 3 of their better defense-men out by the series end.   now where I would go after cappy was the teams performance in game 2. when you had a 3-1 lead against an AHL goalie who had seen less than 16 shots at that point. had a chance to take a strangle hold on the series and found a way to piss it away.   the game plan we saw in game 4, 5, 6 and 7 was largely based on keeping you hamstrung defense from being exposed. it worked in 4, and 6 and got you to 10 minutes left in game 7 with a chance to win.    he's not the best, but he's also far from the worst. and for all the blame and critiques he deserves he also deserves credit for the things he did do right. i mean good lord, the kings and bruins each had over 95 points this season and didn't make the playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,JAAAS,2,Tue Apr 28 03:26:44 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if he is not gone soon
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,Islesfan1026,2,Tue Apr 28 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"at the very least get someone new for the power play. pk shored up enough that i'm confident in them next year, but the pp has been frustrating as all hell for the past few seasons"
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,inxfinity,0,Tue Apr 28 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"in a magical world where our organization listens to the fans. we fire cappy and replace him with.......? babcock is going somewhere else(if he hasn't already?)  cappy is a bad coach who takes little money and he will stay. however, we may be reaching a new high point where even horrid coaching cannot stop us. hopefully."
NewYorkIslanders,343wrj,davegarri,-1,Tue Apr 28 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"They wont fire him. I bet he has another year left. Isles wont be good until after next season. Theyll get tons more cash from barclays and more fans, and at the point is when theyll consider changing cap.  Until then he'll stay. Butt buddies with snow or not they cant get rid of him until they increase their wealth"
NewYorkIslanders,3448wu,mcbordes,6,Tue Apr 28 04:20:00 2015 UTC,The hardest part to swallow is that I was looking forward to seeing if JT or anyone would step up in a game 7. 11 shots on goal and only 3 of them by forwards. Nobody stepped up. Nobody but Jaro.   I just wanna be alone right now.
NewYorkIslanders,3448wu,DLun203,3,Tue Apr 28 12:52:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan from out of town, and that Vancouver game at home is the only game I'll ever see at the Coliseum. I feel you, it hurts a lot right now."
NewYorkIslanders,3448wu,concordiacrescio,2,Tue Apr 28 05:06:30 2015 UTC,"The islanders are inexperienced and it clearly showed. Next time they are in that situation, hopefully they will react differently. You could see they were gripping the stick too tightly all night and even what little veteran leadership they have let them down. Boychuck not shooting in several situations was very disappointing and it was probably an indicator of the overall lack of confidence the team felt. The offensive effort was poor but I believe they tried their hardest under the circumstances. If they had played defense like they did last night in game two, they would have win the series and not been in a game seven. Very disappointing.   I don't think the team has much to be proud of yet. The season has to be looked at on the whole. They showed flashes of brilliance but a first round exit is not a victory (especially with the collapse after the all star break). First round exits are hopefully building blocks toward future success but they aren't successes themselves.  I'm concerned with the way the team faltered down stretch. If they play that way at the start of next season, it's back to the basement."

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,Mordosius,15,Tue Apr 28 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, for all the improvements the pk has done, a single pp goal could have been the difference in several games. 2, 4 and 7 all come to mind. a pp goal in game two could have put the game out of reach early (taken the caps out of the game and we never see the rally in the 3rd), game 4 could have prevented overtime and game 7 could have been the tying goal."

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,ryan924,6,Tue Apr 28 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"This is just so bittersweet. I'm so disappointed we couldn't make a run, but at the same time we have a whole team of young guys who got a taste of real tough playoff hockey. As great as it would've been to bring one more cup back to Nassau, we are going to be one tough team in the years to come. Good fucking seasons guys, I couldn't have asked for a better swan song."
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,Eyebleedorange,24,Tue Apr 28 02:12:55 2015 UTC,0 for 14.  Doug Weight better be gone next season.  I don't wanna see Capuano either.  Worst coaching staff in the NHL really held us back.
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,hockeycrazy033,11,Tue Apr 28 02:12:26 2015 UTC,Fuck Capuano. Couldn't get the team in gear for what could've been an amazing run
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,rock4ever3399,21,Tue Apr 28 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"or, did a good job managing a depleted defense and had them in a position to win a game 7 with 10 minutes left in the 3rd?"
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,Waldo19,8,Tue Apr 28 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"This is probably the most positive post I've ever seen here.  Not certain I agree, but kudos for good attitude"
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,isles27,3,Tue Apr 28 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"I mean he consistently fucked with the lines all season especially some of the most productive ones (Kid Line, MC2), he didn't get things in gear when he needed to, like the end of the season slump and the last 3 minutes of the game. Not pulling Halak until the PP is basically over is fucking ridiculous. He also wasn't able to light a fire under their asses tonight when everything was in the line.  The players are great for the most part, there's always room to improve as JT shows year after year, but their system is pretty shit. They fix that and they've got it made."

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,swimlamar,3,Tue Apr 28 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"Lee was horrible all series and contributed nothing.  I love him and he will be a great player, but he was a complete non factor, as rookies tend to be.  It's OK and he'll learn from it."
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,mattymonkees,2,Tue Apr 28 02:32:37 2015 UTC,Capuano will underperform with this talent again next year. He needs to go.
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,swimlamar,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:45:27 2015 UTC,Lee was a non factor for the reason he needs to have play makers on his line. Grabo and Kule with him in front would have been much better then Cmac
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,tanu24,2,Tue Apr 28 19:37:19 2015 UTC,He was passing when he was wide open in the high slot.  That's got nothing to do with who is on his line.

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,dl2316,13,Tue Apr 28 02:31:22 2015 UTC,Can't say halak didn't play tn.   We have a bright future in BK. And there's plenty more hockey to watch.   <3

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,BlackSailfish,2,Tue Apr 28 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"This is my biggest complaint. We played soft for 40 minutes. Had we had 3rd period effort game, we could have won easily."
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,dedtired,8,Tue Apr 28 02:27:29 2015 UTC,Guys look at it like this: This was out rookie rebuild season. our prospects are just starting. we still have so many more prospects to come (some even better than are here). we have our ROOKIES who have been some of the best that have so much more to learn. With all of that we took the Caps to a game 7. There is only up from here. we fix what went wrong this off-season (coaching) and we build on what we've learned. This season was nothing more than to show everyone that we mean business; next season is where things get interesting.  This teams story is just beginning boys. keep your chins high.
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,leeber27,5,Tue Apr 28 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just being pessimistic but I can't consider this a success. This wasn't a ""rookie rebuilding season"".  We were #1 in the east at the Allstar break.  We shouldn't lose the first round of the playoffs. Expectations were higher, to win at least one round."
NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,NYKyle610,2,Tue Apr 28 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"that is a pessimistic view. Regular season is a whole different game. Not to mention an entire season holding first is a challenge. This team is young and doesn't know how to keep at it yet. It was a ""rookie rebuilding season"", look how many young guys we had on this team. it's the first year our prospects are finally having a go.  Expectations got higher because of the way they played during the season. In hindsight to expect this team to go to the finals is way out there. They would literally go from a zero to hero team in an offseason, thats way too much to ask for"

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,leeber27,7,Tue Apr 28 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"Good game, that was honestly one of the best series I've seen in a long time. Ours teams were so evenly matched. Coming into this series I didn't know much about your team, but I can see that you guys are going to be really strong in the future.  Also, Halak tried his absolute hardest to shut us down again. Hold on to him, he'll take you far.  Good Luck"

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,BigE42984,5,Tue Apr 28 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"even though it went 7, i think this series was lost in game 2.  facing a backup goalie, we only get 16 sog, and blow two different two goal leads.  if we win that, we head back to the coliseum up 2-0, and firmly in control of the series."

Think about how far we have come as a team from where we were last year. We sent the barn out with an amazing win. We have a strong core of young guys coming back. Do we have things to work on, yes.

It would've been easy to get lost in the mix of all that shit but he was a fucking champ.  Mayfield, Pulock... Add Oduya or P. Martin. Start challenging some of the guys for their spots.

NewYorkIslanders,343ttr,mattymonkees,2,Tue Apr 28 02:22:40 2015 UTC,Donovan Mayfield should easily be a pairing to open next year.  Pair Hamonic with Hickey and bench Strait.  Pulock Reinhart the top pair in the Bridge.

At least maybe Capuano goes, Babcock comes.  At least this 0/14 Playoff Powerplay / 10 shots in Game 7 might shake up coaching staff.  We've come a long way, in a very short time.

This was a series. If we won then went at least 6 the next round, sure. But a run is not 1 series. Not in the slightest. We all had elevated expectations, and this is a letdown. The entire season after the all star game is a letdown. Was it a failure of a season? Not in any way! But to miss out on home ice, then not be able to win a series is disappointing. And this was not a run."

NewYorkIslanders,343tzg,viewless25,2,Tue Apr 28 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can hang my hat on about this season is that we must've been really good to make me feel this disappointed. I'm sad to say goodbye to the old barn. Hopefully, they can start a new legacy bringing a few Stanley Cups to the Barclays Center."
NewYorkIslanders,343tzg,iPappi,2,Tue Apr 28 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"This is just the beginning, they will see us again."

NewYorkIslanders,343xdq,HugeFedora,3,Tue Apr 28 02:38:21 2015 UTC,At least the isles won their last game at the coliseum. I still don't talk about what happened in 2008
NewYorkIslanders,343xdq,dl2316,-9,Tue Apr 28 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"I know that you came in peace, and I want to be nice, but I have no respect for Long Islanders who root for the Rangers. Are you a Celtics fan also?"
NewYorkIslanders,343xdq,ryan924,5,Tue Apr 28 03:15:39 2015 UTC,My father has had season tickets to the Rangers since 83. Grew up in section 413 last row of the building and Shea stadium 3 rows deep watching Eddie Murray's fat ass try to play first base.
NewYorkIslanders,343xdq,speedk0re,2,Tue Apr 28 10:54:58 2015 UTC,"rangers fan here as well (and friendly mod/creator over at /r/rangers), and initially came in peace, but this comment kinda irked me.  now that the islanders home base is in brooklyn, let's say hypothetically there's a new team that pops in a few years; and the barn is remodeled or some shit.  We'll call them the nassau county newport-lights, or the suffolk county boardy barns - your pick.  Are you going to switch your team allegiance just because a new one popped up closer?  hell no!  my stepdad was a diehard  rangers fan and got me into hockey in the mid/late 80s.  It was not easy being a rangers fan in the 80s mind you; you guys were coming off an incredible dynasty, and the 1940s chants were in full force.  my point is your team is your team, and you stick by them no matter what.  anyways with that mini rant out of the way, just wanted to say congrats on a great season, and the isles have a very bright (and scary) future.  i have many fond memories of the coliseum and even though i live in california now, it's sad knowing i'll never be able to see a rangers/islanders game there again when i come back to visit my folks.  the games were always exciting, i remember there was usually more fights in the stands than on  the ice.  good luck in brooklyn.  oh and of course, fuck the devils."

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Eargoggles24,15,Mon Apr 27 21:02:16 2015 UTC,That Ovechkin hit has to be illegal. How is that not boarding?  Only reason I am watching is I don't want us to play that dirty team.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Kirillb85,4,Tue Apr 28 01:08:18 2015 UTC,We knew that calls like that would be over looked coming into this game with O'Rourke
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,leeber27,3,Tue Apr 28 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"seriously. it was a cross check and a board. you could even argue a double for that, but no call? this is how players get hurt on both sides."

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,escapingNihilism,3,Mon Apr 27 23:24:22 2015 UTC,leave it all on the ice tonight boys. lets go islanders!!!
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,marti810,3,Mon Apr 27 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"i work the night shift. this 7:30 start time is bullshit. if it goes into overtime, i'm calling out."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,snacks69,3,Mon Apr 27 23:40:23 2015 UTC,puck luck ain't great yet but that will change
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,deathops,3,Mon Apr 27 23:50:09 2015 UTC,lucky the refs let that mayfield truck go
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,3,Tue Apr 28 00:05:27 2015 UTC,Lgi
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,QuietCakehorn,3,Tue Apr 28 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"however you feel about jack, you have to admit, this is the correct time to use the timeout given how things are going."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,2,Tue Apr 28 00:45:06 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure. I'm thinking potentially being down 1 late in the game might be a wee bit more useful.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,3,Tue Apr 28 00:45:48 2015 UTC,not liking the way this game is playing out. can we get the fuckin puck out of our zone and put some pressure on holtby?
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,5_on_3,3,Tue Apr 28 00:46:06 2015 UTC,Trotz using his timeout is even funnier.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,3,Tue Apr 28 00:49:46 2015 UTC,after watching the Ottawa game i think we were all expecting a whistle
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"we need someone to spark something.  idc if it's jt, boychuk, kyle, idc.  someone needs to do something"
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,3,Tue Apr 28 01:02:22 2015 UTC,Uh.. crosscheck.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Cay_Rharles,3,Tue Apr 28 01:03:51 2015 UTC,"knew this would happen. They've been kicking our asses all game.  We have no timeout to use in the third, too.  Our forwards are skating like they have concrete shoes."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,3,Tue Apr 28 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"well, i had hoped we could survive the 2nd without giving up a goal, but the isles were always going to have to score at least one. get to the horn and come out big in the third. you now have nothing to lose and everything to play for."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 01:12:56 2015 UTC,get these guys some 5-hour energy or something. there's gotta be a 7-11 near verizon center.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,JAAAS,2,Tue Apr 28 01:20:31 2015 UTC,No 7-11's near the arena.  There are a boat load of liquor stores selling 5 hour energy.

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Killsitty,3,Tue Apr 28 01:54:34 2015 UTC,just bad position on a heavy body. looked like nba center going to the rim on a guard.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 01:54:55 2015 UTC,Kyle can you put that fucking shot on net. Did you see nielsens goal? Holy fuck
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,isles27,3,Tue Apr 28 01:58:29 2015 UTC,man its less the idea of us possibly losing that bugs me and more the gloaty bullshit ill see from caps fans
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,deathops,3,Tue Apr 28 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"i am proud of this team. they are depleted and fighting. 5 minutes for the season, win or lose give it all."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 01:59:27 2015 UTC,can we get 1 lucky bounce
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,3,Tue Apr 28 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"well normally i'd be excited for a pp, but i feel like we're just going to waste 2 minutes."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,BigE42984,3,Tue Apr 28 02:02:44 2015 UTC,If the don't score on this powerplay I am turning it off. It is honestly the only thing I can think of that could possible make this game salvageable.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 02:02:54 2015 UTC,biggest popwerplay of our lives
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,deathops,3,Tue Apr 28 02:03:14 2015 UTC,we really could use that timeout now...
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,3,Tue Apr 28 02:03:17 2015 UTC,WHY IS JARO STILL IN NET
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,JAAAS,3,Tue Apr 28 02:04:59 2015 UTC,Fire cappy tomorrow

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Waldo19,3,Tue Apr 28 02:08:44 2015 UTC,can we ditch cappy now?
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,3,Tue Apr 28 02:09:23 2015 UTC,Better see crapuano and weight in the unemployment line tomorrow morning.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,BigE42984,3,Tue Apr 28 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"best thing to do right now is to log out, and punch a hole in the wall out of anger. no sense starting a ruckus guys.   love you all, it was a pleasure to be a part of this ride with you guys. can't wait until next year."
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,nothing_cleverr,6,Tue Apr 28 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you guys about the ovechkin hit, that was boarding, but so was a hit in the 1st on Chimera."

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,2,Tue Apr 28 00:36:35 2015 UTC,we need to get some pressure and the puck out of our end....

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,cadoin,2,Tue Apr 28 00:44:44 2015 UTC,can we keep in in their zone for more than 5 seconds?
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,Ummagummas,2,Tue Apr 28 00:47:25 2015 UTC,Been a loooooong time since I've seen an Isles shot...
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,3,Tue Apr 28 00:47:48 2015 UTC,we are getting outworked in their zone. Defense shortcomings and goalkeeping for once isn't our issue.  Our 'strength' in forwards is.
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,JAAAS,2,Tue Apr 28 00:49:35 2015 UTC,there we go nelson
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,deathops,2,Tue Apr 28 00:49:16 2015 UTC,well the timeout worked somewhat
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,deathops,2,Tue Apr 28 00:49:18 2015 UTC,cappy always looks weirdly happy when he is talking to pierre

NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,BigE42984,2,Tue Apr 28 01:10:46 2015 UTC,Wtf was Leddy watching?
NewYorkIslanders,342pd6,islander1,2,Tue Apr 28 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"17 minutes of ice time so far. Boychuk's done it before, but Leddy not so much."
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,viewless25,5,Tue Apr 28 02:10:49 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if Snow tries trading back into the first round. There's tremendous talent there this year.
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,ArtyThePoopie,6,Tue Apr 28 02:34:29 2015 UTC,The monster trade to unite the stromers....  Only in dreams...

NewYorkIslanders,343u14,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:52:17 2015 UTC,i cant see the isles waiting for the third round to pick. with the prospects we have a few will probably will be leaving.
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,dl2316,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, maybe Snow's omission of Pelech from the AHL call-ups has something to do with that"
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"reinhart, pelech, czuczman, colberg, are probably all extras. mayfield donovan, strait, and hickey, are all in limbo atm. reinhart has the most value imo, but we wont know until draft day."
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,dl2316,2,Tue Apr 28 02:59:37 2015 UTC,Why Hickey in Limbo? Is he a upcoming free agent? I hope he stays..I really like this kid.
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,N0s0up4u57,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:54:20 2015 UTC,I believe he is an rfa this year
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,dl2316,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:23:05 2015 UTC,"From what we've seen, I'd be comfortable trading Reinhart to get into the top 10-12.  Mayfield and Hickey should definitely stay, and Donovan probably has a role for now."
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,karmapuhlease,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:08:10 2015 UTC,Donovan might not be happy not playing for a good two months though.
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,dl2316,9,Tue Apr 28 10:23:42 2015 UTC,I admire your ability to move on to next year within minutes of losing. You must be a long time isles fan.
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,dabohr,8,Tue Apr 28 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"I have nothing else to talk about. There's no lineup speculation for the next game, and no point in going over what already happened and tear my hair out over this shitty fucking game seven.   Only place to look is forward."
NewYorkIslanders,343u14,ArtyThePoopie,4,Tue Apr 28 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"isles fans feel lost without talking about the draft. it usually happens at the end of regular season, but we had to postpone it for only two weeks :("

NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,totally__paranoid,7,Tue Apr 28 02:43:39 2015 UTC,Fact: the closest LIRR station to Barclays is one block away.
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,carpy22,6,Tue Apr 28 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"I have always disliked Brooklyn, but we will make it work. And God willing, we will get this team back home somehow."
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,ryan924,3,Tue Apr 28 03:13:40 2015 UTC,the way I heard the coliseum rocking in game 6 makes me so sad to see it go. I just cant see that type of atmosphere at the Barkleys center.  It wasn't made for hockey.  I feel the same sadness when shea closed down.
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,Number-91,3,Tue Apr 28 02:56:36 2015 UTC,If you think it wont be just as loud your wrong. The Coliseum itself is amazing but its our Fan base that makes it so good. A dedicated NY fan base is the best and loudest. Barclays on an isles day will rock the city.
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,DGGuitars,6,Tue Apr 28 02:58:50 2015 UTC,I mean this is nice but not really true. The acoustics of an old barn like the coli definitely helped us out a great deal. It was similar with the Vikings in the metrodome.
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,isles27,-2,Tue Apr 28 03:23:13 2015 UTC,Ok maybe im just biased to be a short $2.75 train ride away haha
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,DGGuitars,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right. I saw what happened when Shea was demolished and the Mets moved to Citi Field. Felt corporate, too many amenities to distract fans, and it never rocked as loud as Shea did. Now given, Mets have been bad for long time so that definitely doesn't help."
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,Number-91,3,Tue Apr 28 03:07:42 2015 UTC,From CT as well. This will make games so much more convient to attend for me. I know not everyone is happy about the move but this is the start of a new era.
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,3isfordale,2,Tue Apr 28 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Brooklyn will never be able to live up to the Coliseum.  If they don't come home before I move out of state, I probably won't be going to any more home games."
NewYorkIslanders,343y0d,McArctic,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:25:32 2015 UTC,"Any idea if y'all are going to get the issue with the sightlines fixed? I was browsing some of the virtual seat views tonight and it looks like a third of the arena is going to have obstructed views.  I know that having the arena much more accessible via public transit is really going to help you guys, but the Isles deserve better than to be crammed into an arena clearly not built for hockey!"

I haven't been to many Islander games and I wish I did, this year brought back the excitement in the team I once had. I am greatful I was able to attend 3 games including the very last one, game 6. Brooklyn doesn't feel right. Islanders are a Long Island team! (I know technically Brooklyn is on LI).  I just hope the excitement is still there and the die hards make the Barc as loud as it was in game 6."
NewYorkIslanders,343zki,Number-91,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:01:48 2015 UTC,It's gonna be hard. That arena was made to silence crowds to make music sound better.

NewYorkIslanders,343wu8,tkoyy,7,Tue Apr 28 02:33:45 2015 UTC,Pissed about Lee. He's a big bodied player who makes space for himself in front of the net. Easily one of my top 3. Wtf Capuano.
NewYorkIslanders,343wu8,simple10,3,Tue Apr 28 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned, but not pissed. A few things threw me off like Lee completely disappearing into thin air during the playoffs. I get that he's young and whatnot, but he's gotta step it up in the postseason.  im also really concerned that Reinhart is going to be a colossal bust. he was embarrassingly bad out there, even for an ECHL player.  but im confident Weight will be fired and possibly capuano, so im not losing sleep over next season."
NewYorkIslanders,343wu8,viewless25,3,Tue Apr 28 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"I think many of you fail to see the obvious reason why Lee disappeared.  When he was good who was he with? 18 and/or 91... Take all that away from a rookie and throw him on a garbage line, life gets hard.  Also I am concerned about Reinhart. He seems to be lacking the 'hockey sense' analysts like to talk about. If we got a do-over I'd ship him in place of Pokka in a heartbeat look at that smile"

Knowing that we had, what, 9 shots on goal in 57:00 of play -- absolutely, yes.  Knowing that the Capitals had no time-out to use -- judgment call :P I'd have done it!"
NewYorkIslanders,343w0d,bass_n_treble,3,Tue Apr 28 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"He coached OK. At best. I agree with not pulling Jaro. If we do that, they then have free shots at the empty net because of the penalty kill. But Weight is UNDOUBTEDLY gone! There is no way at all he can keep his job after this abysmal playoff pp performance. That was entirely on him, and he royally messed that up. Cronin can stay as he really righted the Isles PK towards the end of the season. Cappy is iffy. I can see that going both ways, and wouldn't be necessarily upset at him staying or going."

NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,ziggyetotis,4,Tue Apr 28 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think we should entertain thoughts of trades, especially to edmonton like you said. They have way too much offensive talent (even more with mcdavid coming) and no Dmen. However with that said we should not get ripped off. If a good deal cannot be made then I don't want it. He has opportunity, he just needs time to work on his skating and overall game. People mature at different rates"
NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,leeber27,2,Tue Apr 28 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"That's why I think a trade to Edmonton would work out for us. They want him bad, we don't need to give up prospects. It's recipe for a good trade for snow to make. I now have faith in Garth"

NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,ZoraHockey,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:30:51 2015 UTC,Reinhart has been absolutely unimpressive in all of his games here and apparently in the AHL. He barely skates and looked too scared to try anything. Mayfield is above Reinhart in the depth chart for me right now. I would absolutely trade him. Could we get someone like Eberle? Possibly.   Not sure how popular of an opinion this is.. But a good rental player for a couple of years to player with JT until Dal Colle/Ho Sang are ready... I kinda really love Patrick Sharp.
NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"Eberle is too soft. Wouldn't want him to be honest.  Only player I would trade Reinhart for on Edmonton is Hall.  As for Sharp, we could get him for a bargain because the Hawks are in cap trouble. He's probably the most likely option we would have as far as forwards go.  Personally I wouldn't mind going out and trading Reimhart for a top 4 defenseman who can a step in right now."
NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,ZoraHockey,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"I think if we have the depth of:   Boychuk, leddy, Hamonic, de Haan, Hickey, Straif, Donovan, Mayfield, Pulock.. (Vis?)... Then we are OK on D. JT need a real first liner to player with him, which is more important than the D to me right now"
NewYorkIslanders,3441gw,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"As of right now our defense will look like this next season.  Leddy-Boychuk  de Haan-Hamonic  Strait/Reinhart-Pulock/Hickey/Mayfield  Outside of Boychuk, Leddy and Hamonic it's a bit of a question mark. I'm not 100% convinced de Haan can be a legit top 4 defenseman. Strait and Hickey are both below average. I think Pulock will be solid and Mayfield should be a nice player too. If we were to add an above average top 4 defenseman our defense goes from the above to this (assuming Reinhart is included in the trade).  Leddy-Boychuk  X-Hamonic  de Haan-Pulock  Mayfield  Strait/Hickey (only need to keep one)  Donovan (maybe, not sure how the team feels about him)  This gives us an experienced top 4 and a solid, young bottom pairing with a couple decent backups.  As for the forwards, we could always go out and get Sharp. We just need a short term option because Dal Colle will be ready sometime in the 2016/17 season (sooner rather than later, the kid is going to be awesome). I'm not sure what we'd have to give but we may be able to get him for a fairly cheap price with the Hawks in cap trouble. May not even have to give Reinhart."

NewYorkIslanders,340vxn,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Mon Apr 27 16:23:53 2015 UTC,He has been amazing all series. Game 5 was really not his fault. If we had someone like nabby we would have been swept
NewYorkIslanders,340vxn,_stee,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"Wouldnt say all series. Hes looked beatable in a few games (not necesarily his fault, but cant call it amazing) but yes, far from Nabby where every rush was a goal."

NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,h0rst87,12,Mon Apr 27 15:49:40 2015 UTC,Let's beat the Caps first. No sense being nervous over what you cannot control These guys have had Lundi's # all year. What's his GAA against us?
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,kenlane,2,Mon Apr 27 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I still want to win, but a loss to any other team would suck so much less then to them."
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,Waldo19,2,Mon Apr 27 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"if my options are a first round loss to the caps or a 2nd round loss to the rags, i'll take the second round loss.   in 2013 the isles put up a fight in the 1st round going 6. obviously the isles didn't make the playoffs last year. going 7 games this years in the 1st round is great, but it really only means that we got back to where we were in 2013 (and we know the 2015 isles are much better than the 2013 team).   a win tonight and you can truly say this team took another step forward. i cannot overstate how important that would be moving forward."
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,leeber27,6,Mon Apr 27 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"I actually don't give two shits about next round. Going into this season I wanted this team to win that first round. THAT'S IT. Nothing more nothing less. They could get swept for all I care. All I want to see is that this team is improving.  However next season, I would hope they get further and beat the rags"
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,leeber27,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:33:12 2015 UTC,I'm hoping next year we can stay healthy all season and into the playoffs...And improve on our defensive play quite a bit hopefully
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,leeber27,3,Mon Apr 27 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hopefully next season we don't play a team that destroys our defensive core lol. Also, like you said, I have higher expectations since the rookies will no longer be rookies and we'll have huge stars coming up like pulock (and maybe in my fantasy land dal colle will be ready)"
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,Stalfo14,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:07:46 2015 UTC,Yea. Should only improve from here. I'd prefer if Capuano would let the defenseman shine defensively and not push them so hard on stepping up offensively. We give away to many odd man rushes for my liking throughout the season
NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,Letmeseeyourprops,2,Mon Apr 27 17:25:09 2015 UTC,That coaching situation is a whole other story... lol

NewYorkIslanders,341h2s,dekushrub150,5,Mon Apr 27 17:42:22 2015 UTC,No 100% nervous about tonight. I hope we come out and play our best hockey tonight and we can keep on going forward.

NewYorkIslanders,341pfa,thewrongflag,2,Mon Apr 27 17:45:25 2015 UTC,I know.  I hope we beat them and then kick the rags' asses so everyone will give us the respect we deserve
NewYorkIslanders,341pfa,hockeycrazy033,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"that raises the question of whether or not we truly want the other teams to respect us after thinking of us as garbage. let's say we beat the caps, then the rags, and the caps fans start saying 'omg isles so good'. we should give them a big 'fuck you' in return."

And I too am a Blues fan and was sad to see em go down but Jake Allen has real promise to be a great goaltender in a year or two, not to mention Tarasenko and all the other talent you have. I think the Blues will be a contender for the next few years. All that said though the Wild are a heck of a team and I think they're gonna come out victorious in the west.....and then lose to the isles in the cup lol."
NewYorkIslanders,33z69h,Fireislander,2,Mon Apr 27 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with that as long as they lose! Although I'm a little bitter still so I'm rooting for the flames. I do think you're right, they'll have a deep run if they keep playing like they did against us. We definitely have the pieces, I think a few tweaks is what we need to go all the way. Personally, I'm grateful for what Hitch has done for the team but ready for a coaching change. I'm excited to see what the offseason brings but first Halak needs to get you guys the Cup!"

NewYorkIslanders,344luj,ryan924,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"But at least this time, it feels like we're still positioned to return to the playoffs again next season. We had a lot of young guys this season who need more time to develop further, some veterans who just need another season with the team under their belt, and we had a lot of concerns regarding goaltending (specifically the backup situation and when Jaro would hit some bad streaky moments). Now that Grabovski, Kulemin, Boychuk, Leddy, Lee, and Halak have all played through a wild ride of a season with us, I think the team is gonna storm the Barclays with guns blazing next season. The last pieces of the puzzle that we need is a solid backup that we as fans can support rather than feel anxious when we hear they're getting the start that night and a reliable bottom 2 defensive pair. Despite our mediocre coaching staff and Brian Strait, we made it into the post-season and we gave Washington a run for their money. It's not like we clinched wildcard and we all sat back and waited to get swept. We went into the playoffs with a real chance to win this time. When we make playoffs again next season, it'll be a better team with the same players."

NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,bass_n_treble,5,Sun Apr 26 18:14:40 2015 UTC,At least we know that our changes can handle themselves. This is the depth in D we always wanted.
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,NordicReagan,3,Sun Apr 26 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh is that how that works? Interesting. I was never 100% clear on that. But still, it was nice seeing them hold their own, even if it was in a limited capacity."
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,Cay_Rharles,10,Sun Apr 26 18:32:41 2015 UTC,DESTROY CHUCK!
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,SamT323,4,Sun Apr 26 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"Bruins/Univ. of Maine fan here, Good to see Destroychuk doing his thing with you guys. I'm pulling for you guys tomorrow. I really want Cappy and Garth to do well too."

NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,islesrule224,13,Sun Apr 26 23:44:22 2015 UTC,Can't wait for all the caps fans to start complaining about how we deserved penalties there and they should have blown it dead cause we scored right after that.   Time to make some popcorn
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,DLun203,8,Sun Apr 26 17:55:47 2015 UTC,what's nuts is that this is the first time in /r/hockey that we haven't been down voted into oblivion. awesome!
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,BigE42984,5,Sun Apr 26 21:56:43 2015 UTC,None of them seemed to mind the 2 on 1 boarding of JT right before the goal though.
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,islesrule224,9,Mon Apr 27 01:53:51 2015 UTC,They already are.
NewYorkIslanders,33xsks,hardcorelegend43,12,Sun Apr 26 19:04:56 2015 UTC,Good news though it is being shot down. And by a Rangers fan. You know you r on the wrong end when you've got Rangers fans stepping up to defend the Islanders

NewYorkIslanders,33zce8,Salacondor,7,Mon Apr 27 02:42:40 2015 UTC,I was going to do it either way. I don't care if they do it or not
NewYorkIslanders,33zce8,Tissueboxhead,3,Mon Apr 27 02:52:48 2015 UTC,Their fanbase and sub reddit is completely toxic to anything blue and orange right now. I think its best to just let them be. I feel like it will just cause a ruckus more than anything else.

NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,PhunkyButtLoving,7,Sun Apr 26 16:00:28 2015 UTC,i pretty much had a heart attack since nbc announcers screamed goal  video
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,Fireislander,4,Sun Apr 26 16:35:54 2015 UTC,I think the announcers saw brouwer celebrate and thought it was in.  Beagle knew it wasn't though.
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,BigE42984,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:13:59 2015 UTC,I was sitting on the opposite end so it was hard to make out what was happening but I saw one of the caps throw their hands up and I screamed no! Thank god it was premature!
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,Number-91,5,Sun Apr 26 19:31:57 2015 UTC,I was sure that went in. Everyone in my section began cursing. I couldn't believe that didn't go in
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,Projectrevolution,3,Sun Apr 26 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Where were you sitting? I was in 332 and could have sworn that was in. Even when it was going under review, I didn't believe it until I saw the replay."
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,ZoraHockey,2,Sun Apr 26 18:44:27 2015 UTC,306- exact same reaction though. Didn't understand why it was getting waved off haha
NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,Projectrevolution,2,Sun Apr 26 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"Never had such an ""edge of your seat"" experience as that game"

NewYorkIslanders,33xgih,Jettavr6,3,Sun Apr 26 18:33:13 2015 UTC,at the end of the day they are people just like us. dirty disgusting wrong team choosing people but people.
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,SirFigNewtons,8,Sun Apr 26 22:47:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully. That would be amazing. Isles started off good away but wear out. They need to sustain it for them to win
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Number-91,22,Sun Apr 26 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"it's like their team can do no wrong and the islanders are this villainous, goon infested team. oh, and you think us fans were all inmates in san quentin with how we behave. while i'm at it, god forbid we chant something that they don't approve of.  holy shit didn't expect that rant.  oh and ovi and the rest of the team are angels who wouldn't hurt a fly."
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,nothing_cleverr,10,Sun Apr 26 23:46:35 2015 UTC,It sucks being in /r/hockey. We're so outnumbered and the flair-based downoting renders our opinions useless.
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,DLun203,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:56:31 2015 UTC,It's probably because you were a douchebag posting in /r/caps.  We've had no problem with Isles fans posting there in general but this kind of stuff is bullshit.
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Artoo_Detoo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"It's just as fair as the posts about one group of fans keying a car. If that see's the light of day, so should that. I know it paints your team in a bad light, sucks doesn't it?"
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,ManWithAPIan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:08:33 2015 UTC,"No, because I didn't infiltrate /r/NewYorkIslanders and make myself look like an asshole by posting that shit.  If you have a problem, tell /r/hockey and tell /r/NewYorkIslanders, posting that shit into /r/caps tells me you're an asshole, and you're being downvoted in /r/hockey most likely because you were acting like an asshole there as well."
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Artoo_Detoo,0,Mon Apr 27 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"No, because I didn't make a post calling out all Islanders fans in an Islanders-based sub, I only made a comment to call you out for your victim complex.  Like it or not, you're not getting downvoted because you're an Islanders fan, you're getting downvoted because you're an asshole.  The fact that you are the only one downvoting me is proving my point."
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Artoo_Detoo,0,Mon Apr 27 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know what has you so upset but from the first page of your history, this is the only comment that got downvoted:  http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/33h2wb/tom_wilsons_big_hit_of_lubomir_visnovsky_as/cqkzrj2?context=3  It's so ironic you're calling me hypocritical when you're the one who's been calling the Caps' fanbase classless over and over again after posting in our subreddit telling us to stop generalizing your fanbase.  This is not a downvote based on flair, this is a downvote based on your own stupidity."
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Artoo_Detoo,10,Mon Apr 27 16:15:21 2015 UTC,the chanting thing is hilarious to me. like people forget that it's supposed to be fun and chanting is fun.
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,edirusso,9,Mon Apr 27 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"this thread in the gdt had me laughing, two guys from two separate fan bases called them out on it, i thought it was funny   http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/33uauo/playoff_game_thread_capitals_32_at_islanders_23/cqol7nk"
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,nothing_cleverr,2,Mon Apr 27 16:26:35 2015 UTC,I don't even get that. Our chanting is stupid? It's chanting; it's for fun. It's people getting into the game and helping the home team get pumped. Are people not allowed to have fun now

Ferland was a saint for running into Lack and our player all the time but Weber was a dickhole for running Hiller once. This is how it is for every team no matter who they play in the playoffs though. It doesn't matter what happens, fans will watch the games of their respective teams with rose tinted glasses. Just gotta roll with the punches, man."
NewYorkIslanders,33ytr4,Colon-Dee,13,Mon Apr 27 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"They see what they want to see. I used to live in the DC area. They are a playoffs only fan base. For most of them, these are the only 6 hockey games they have seen all year."

We will still most likely be outnumbered so any borderline incidents will be met with a sea of angry fans who will not accept defense of the team they are playing. Best to just ignore these guys and not let them bother you.   Most of the Caps fans are good, but like any fan base they have some bad ones. Just ignore them as going to war with them leads to a brigade of the same comments thrown against you.   Don't be afraid, there will be plenty of us there and we will rock the thread like the barn was yesterday.   Let's go Islanders.   Also the thread goes up earlier than game start so don't be late or you have to deal with angry Eric Boulton"

NewYorkIslanders,33xa2h,thewrongflag,5,Sun Apr 26 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Some of our fans are pretty blind (I'm sure all fanbases have these), but if you just ignore them and hit em with a downvote, you'll have done exactly what most members of our own community do.  I'd love to have more Isles fans in the hockey gdt's, the one's who've been in there have been great to talk about hockey with.  For as bad as your fans have (largely incorrectly) been portrayed in /r/hockey, every one of you I've run into on Reddit has been pretty chill.    Hopefully it's a good game though, we have a knack for imploding spectacularly in game 7's, soooo enjoy that in advance if it happens.

I suppose a career in construction could make me somewhat biased in that regard. To play devils advocate, if you were to make up a name that epitomozes our loudness as a fan base what would it be?  Edit - perhaps more of a p.s., have an upvote because I really do enjoy that gritty response."

NewYorkIslanders,33xjsu,carpy22,2,Mon Apr 27 01:53:30 2015 UTC,I completely agree. We've held on through the worst of times and come together in a big way to end out the amazing history behind the arena we've called home for so long. If our minor league team wasn't the sound tigers I could definitely see us working that into an identity somehow. Personally I hope they get relocated here when they rebuild the coliseum so I can see some games and have a deeper understanding of our system. Any other ideas out of sheer curiosity?

Weve been to Sox/Yanks games where we heard a few f bombs, but this was a whole other level. And none of that ""hey there is a kid here I will restrain myself"". One woman a row back and a few over from us said to her husband ""babe please dont swear theres a little kid right there"" to which he said ""fuck off, this is HOCKEY"".

NewYorkIslanders,33vtgj,superfluity87,4,Sun Apr 26 05:19:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I thought that was just me.  I wasn't planning on going to the game because I just couldn't bear the thought of them losing at home to end it all. Then something clicked and I thought that if they were going to show up and make sure it didn't end like this, then fans like me had to show up too. So I decided to face it head on.  When the intro started, I started tearing up. All the memories of going to games since I was 10, and the thought that it could be all over in less than 3 hours was just too much. Seemed so unkind and unfair.  I was so on edge the whole game. I had barely any reaction when JT or Cool lemon scored, it was way too early too celebrate. When Clutterbuck scored the empty netter, I finally let it all out.  I can maybe deal with them losing game 7. I hope it doesn't happen, but losing in our barn would have been just soul crushing.  After the game, I went down to where they did the post game. I tried to get a drink at the pub (but it was after last call). These are all things I had never done before since I was usually with friends or family and we would all leave right after. I just wanted to soak everything up in case it's the last time and be among my Islander brethren.   On the train ride there and home from Queens 5 separate people saw my jersey and talked to me about how much the team meant to them.  I'm proud of how we played today and I hope we can get it done in 7 so all the fans get a chance for more memories in our favorite building. LET'S DO THIS!!!!"

I once located an former high school co-student working as a Brooklyn Cyclone girl.  not sure what they were called.. they just stood on top of the dugout between innings and threw t-shirts and whatnot.  unfortunately these type workers don't get paid much.  the NFL has recently run into some awful PR over their labor policies with cheerleaders.

NewYorkIslanders,33v1fw,Projectrevolution,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:56:49 2015 UTC,that's because the crowd was so thin that 329 were on an island at the top so they were not heard by the majority of fans.

Crowd is going to be huge for them.  And if the worst should happen yes it will sting a lot more than any other lose at NVMC but we as fans shouldn't feel bad about this season. The Isles finished dead last in the Metro last year with 79 points. They took 3rd place with 101 this year. That's huge. And if they could have won one more lousy game they would have taken 2nd. They lost Okposo and Leddy for long periods and still did alright.   Don't get me wrong, I'll be a grumpy fuck for about two weeks if they lose today but I have no problems with this season. They played meaningful hockey into April and for the first time since 06-07 entered the playoffs not in the 8th seed. Most importantly, this group is young and is staying together.  Now let's go win at NVMC and take this series back to Washington.  Edit: spelling"

NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,leeber27,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:13:03 2015 UTC,I don't beileve in Reinhart. we should trade him if he still has high value.
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,tanu24,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"After last game's shit show, it's hard to see any value/ have any faith in him. All I can say is it was unfair for him to be thrown into a playoff match like that. Last time we saw he he was much better. So mabye after a full season under his belt he'll perform much better"
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,leeber27,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:05:23 2015 UTC,He's yet to look good. I don't even think his ahl stats are all that impressive. He's slow and his size isn't much of an advantage in the nhl. Hope I'm wrong but I'd trade him and a player or 2 to get a stud
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,tanu24,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"His little stint earlier in the year wasn't miserable. An dyeah he's got the worst +/- of BP.

NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,leeber27,0,Sat Apr 25 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah ... I would say Donovan and Carkner, just because they both have experience. But I really don't know."
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,Rob_G,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:14:30 2015 UTC,"Dono already has a slot in the lineup, so that's not an option. Carkner was an option last game so guys wouldn't get thrown around. This game he shouldn't be due to his slowness."
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,leeber27,2,Sat Apr 25 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"I've watched almost every Bridgeport game this year and there is no doubt in my mind that Pulock is more ready out of the two even after the shoulder injury setback.  He is quicker than Reinhart and cuts lanes off better in the defensive zone on top of an accurate booming shoot.  Don't get me wrong, Reinhart will be a great defenseman in the future but just like most people in that position, he needs more time adjusting to the speed of the NHL."
NewYorkIslanders,33s8xc,iruber1337,8,Sat Apr 25 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Fuck the caps, fuck the rags, and fuck then pens for sucking. seriously though, I know the last game sucked, but we're not dead in the water. We have been the better team for the majority of play in this series. Fuck game 5. Get over it. Our D is banged up, but we're on home ice and Boychuck and Leddy are still playing. We still have the potential to turn it on offensively. It's not fucking over yet!! Stop with the negativity crap. I know it's tough seeing the rags Advance. I know game 5 hurt, but we can still pull this shit out! Have some fucking faith in this team. They're young and feisty. Anything can happen!  LETS GO ISLANDERS!!!!"

I don't get the point of any Isles fans saying stuff like, ""I don't see us winning."" What's the point of the negativity? If you truly think that, why not just shut up and keep it to yourself? Does it make you feel better to anticipate a loss?  We need wild optimism here. The game hasn't even been played yet. There's no telling what can happen. Start acting like a fan base!"

NewYorkIslanders,33pzii,purplehumpbackwhale,6,Fri Apr 24 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"our depleted defense is a big worry. but even if the caps hadn't had that huge third period it wouldn't have mattered because we only scored 1 goal.     we need offense tomorrow. grinding almost got us a win in game 4, but with our defense now in rough shape, I think we have to double down on speed and scoring. shots shots shots.    if the caps can win a game with an ahl goalie, we in theory could grab a win maybe even two with some less than ideal defensive pairs. however, I don't think we're gonna be able to hold the caps to 1 goal through 60 like we did in games 1, 3 and 4. I think we are going to have to put up 3 or 4 on holtby, cuz our defense is probably going to give up 2.   in any case. just gotta win tomorrow night, and in the NHL any team can win any game any night. some just do it more often than others. cautious optimism."

NewYorkIslanders,33ph2g,WaffleOnABike,4,Fri Apr 24 13:59:04 2015 UTC,"There's way too much generalizing on all sides right now, but then again that happens in sports. The woman in the tweet even is doing it with ""Caps fans...""  I mean, if you want to kill your liver take a drink every time someone says ""Oh, but [Blank] fans are [stereotype]."" It's just what people do. The best thing to do is to just not get too incensed and heated about it and realize it's just human nature to try and replace a sea of ""enemies"" with one ""face.""  Edit: And for the record, anyone celebrating injuries (especially brain injuries) on either side needs to evaluate themselves and their love of the sport. I know, as a hockey/caps fan I was excited about Wilson's hit, but DEFINITELY NOT excited about Lubo's injury. There was an adrenaline-by-proxy surge in me, but seeing a player have trouble getting up makes me stomach turn a bit."

NewYorkIslanders,33pw6o,mcbordes,2,Fri Apr 24 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"Andy, it's one thing to constantly post about your blog and podcast.  Posting Steiner ads is just ridiculous."
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,AussieIslander,4,Fri Apr 24 10:24:01 2015 UTC,"In case you haven't noticed, their bottom 6 is mostly made up of guys that are much bigger than anyone on our fourth line, or anyone on our team who's not a defensman and not named Kyle Okposo for that matter"
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,ArtyThePoopie,2,Fri Apr 24 15:36:38 2015 UTC,Top 6 is pretty heavy too. Ovi and ward are the biggest guys.
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,PROSTATEMONSTER,4,Fri Apr 24 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"Caps fan coming in peace, just so you know we have the one of the biggest (I think biggest) teams in the league.  That's the reason a lot of caps fans have been waiting for the playoffs, we built just for this.  And even though I hope we win tomorrow I hope it's a great game in your stadium (because hopefully the last).  Cheers to a good game!"
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,dles,7,Fri Apr 24 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"well, lee and clutterbuck tried stooping to their level last night, and that was fantastically horrible.  here's the reality that a lot of people have trouble accepting: the isles are a young team with a slew of inexperienced guys playing important roles, doubly so because key players are hurt.  when you see things like anders lee passing up shots in the high slot, that's when you know the whole team is not quite right.  i personally don't really blame capuano or the coaching staff for anything in this series.  the guys were generally the better team in 3 out of 5 games.  they were one clutterbuck post/crossbar away from being up 3-2.  in a seven-game series, bounces of the puck will make a big difference.  barry trotz also deserves some credit.  he knew that the only way the caps would be able to win is by beating the shit out of the isles.  their only advantage was size and physicality, and they had to use it.  in both a micro sense and a macro sense, the isles have been worn down.  as i mentioned before, if not for one bounce of the puck, the isles are still ahead despite that.  this team has a bright future ahead of it.  i don't know how anyone could look at their results this season and not see that.  if they can't pull out this series win, they will use it as fuel for the next time around.  that's tough to accept at this time but will be easier to swallow when we all look back on it later."
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,mattymonkees,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:32:53 2015 UTC,Well said. It's evident that coaching is a key flaw in this teams playoff success and we saw it the last month of the season
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,FinalxFlash,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"i am actually not as down on capuano as others here, but capuano is not the right coach.  what pisses me off the most is the bad line changes and other fundamentals.  here's my view on cap.  positives: team plays max effort for him most of the time, they love playing under him, and he has to get credit for building the culture that has led a lot of people to want to take less money to stay on the team.  negatives: his team's fundamentals are sometimes lacking, he makes some puzzling roster decisions, and he's not a very good in-game coach.  i think what the isles need to do is get a player's coach who has had playoff success before and has decent x's and o's knowledge.  they don't need a disciplinarian like kenny hitchcock, peter laviolette, or john tortorella.  more like a darryl sutter type."
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,mattymonkees,2,Fri Apr 24 18:32:44 2015 UTC,Yeah except the players locked daryl sutter out of the locker room and left before he finally got in near the end of the year. I don't think they like him
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,_stee,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:03:54 2015 UTC,Well that's the thing it's not like I hate the guy I was a huge supporter of him during the regular season but the playoffs do a great job at exposing coaching flaws and us being down like this proves it. Without the game two collapse abd the viz targeting we easily should have swept the caps
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,FinalxFlash,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"all I want is to see them play a full 60 tomorrow at that top level we've seen. Might not be enough to win, but if it's gonna end tomorrow at NVMC lets make sure it's a game to be proud of, regardless of the outcome."
NewYorkIslanders,33p44r,RIPwhalers,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:30:48 2015 UTC,I agree.

NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,superfluity87,8,Thu Apr 23 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is not as bad as you think he is."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,QuietCakehorn,6,Fri Apr 24 00:28:40 2015 UTC,he fucking has been all year. a bit mistake prone but his numbers have been incredibly solid
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,AC3FACE,4,Fri Apr 24 00:42:51 2015 UTC,He's been solid all year. Gets the worst rap by fans. If he was our worst top 9 forward we'd have swept this series already.
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,islander1,3,Fri Apr 24 00:57:03 2015 UTC,you should have for a while now.  he's a half a point a game player for the past few years.
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,mcbordes,2,Fri Apr 24 01:28:57 2015 UTC,"I've really been liking his play for most of the year, and how could you argue with a point per game in the playoffs?  my only note is that he's still afraid to shoot the puck or he's stuck in a pass-first mentality.  some plays you just want to see bailey rip the puck but instead he makes an unnecessary 2nd, 3rd, or 4th pass that diffuses our scoring opportunity.  otherwise he's been a really solid 2 way forward."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,ill_regret_this,2,Fri Apr 24 08:00:27 2015 UTC,my one gripe with him is that he'll make that extra pass when he should shoot.
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,marti810,2,Fri Apr 24 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"If he is strictly a playoff player and this isn't a fluke, I PROMISE I will NEVER trash on him since he's important where it matters."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,leeber27,2,Thu Apr 23 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is not as bad as you think he is."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,QuietCakehorn,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"He's a very solid 2-way player, the original expectations were just too much."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,CaptWinkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:54:24 2015 UTC,I never thought I'd see the day where Josh Bailey is the offensive meat of the team in the playoffs.
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:53:53 2015 UTC,"the title of the post implies that you had some sort of resistance to seeing him in a positive light, which is probably true for a vast majority of the fan base.  i personally don't get it.  if you looked at him from a neutral standpoint, it'd be obvious that he is a big net positive for the hockey club.  being perhaps the best ""clutch"" or ""money"" player on the team is a nice bonus."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,mattymonkees,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I did view him in a neutral light initially. Like someone else said here already, my expectations were probably a little too high. I felt the same way about okposo initially, but he's also finally rounding out to be a great player. This is something of an apology after seeing his performance this playoff."
NewYorkIslanders,33niaz,mattymonkees,2,Fri Apr 24 17:35:50 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I think we've yet to see the best from him.
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,thewrongflag,6,Fri Apr 24 05:36:51 2015 UTC,"we won't know until later on this summer. concussions have a sort of cumulative effect, and they get worse every time. this may have been his last season either way."
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,fuccimama79,6,Fri Apr 24 07:51:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah either way, I don't think the isles had any intention of keeping Lubo past this post-season. He's one of our most expensive guys. The money we spend keeping him we could pocket and put toward extending the kid line and getting a real backup goaltender. Plus, we have Pulock and Reinhart to fill an defensive holes for next season. I'm counting on one of those guys to be in the lineup at the beginning of next season."
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,lighthousefisherman,4,Fri Apr 24 08:51:23 2015 UTC,Neuvirth is a goalie would love to keep with the team. He's got a bad rap since joining the team when they hit their worst stretch of the year.
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,eggy333,6,Fri Apr 24 12:26:06 2015 UTC,That's a career ending hit for him.  We would have let him go after this year anyway and chances are he was looking at retirement regardless.  Shitty way to go out tho
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,brodels420,4,Fri Apr 24 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"Last time he had a concussion he was ""having bad days"" for months afterwards, and he didn't return for a long time. I'd bet a decent sum that he's done for good this time, especially considering his contract situation too."
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,karmapuhlease,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"if he had just sufferered a 6th or 7th concussion at the age of 38, I'd advise him to stop playing if it were my job to advise him."
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,escapingNihilism,-9,Fri Apr 24 21:21:37 2015 UTC,Why has this organization not retaliated
NewYorkIslanders,33oktc,AussieIslander,6,Fri Apr 24 09:14:51 2015 UTC,"But they did retaliate, with the fight, and with the late game antics. Clutterbuck tried to punish Green towards the end of the first. But when you focus on punishing another team you lose sight on beating the other team."

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,mattymonkees,3,Fri Apr 24 00:16:25 2015 UTC,now would be a great time for our power play to wake up
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,MassiveJammies,3,Fri Apr 24 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"Hickey on the PP epitomizes our defensive trouble.   RP made warmup skates, he was so close."
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Musclesjones,3,Fri Apr 24 00:32:19 2015 UTC,7 shots in the period to caps 17....somethings not right here...
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,MassiveJammies,3,Fri Apr 24 00:34:34 2015 UTC,remember in game 4 when we just threw everything at the net?  we look just so tired and beat this game.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,JAAAS,2,Fri Apr 24 00:38:36 2015 UTC,Exactly they are dragging.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptWinkie,3,Fri Apr 24 00:41:30 2015 UTC,Lee just standing there watching
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Mordosius,3,Fri Apr 24 00:41:08 2015 UTC,And passing up shots in the high slot.  He has been abominable all series.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,deathops,3,Fri Apr 24 00:48:00 2015 UTC,We look defeated.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptWinkie,4,Fri Apr 24 00:43:25 2015 UTC,Goonies never say die
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,ArtyThePoopie,2,Fri Apr 24 00:45:08 2015 UTC,let's hope they don't. Huge kill here... can only hope the boys are up for it and then we get some chances the other way.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,AlonsoFerrari8,3,Fri Apr 24 00:47:22 2015 UTC,well then......
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,dl2316,3,Fri Apr 24 01:03:10 2015 UTC,Kennedy needs to get that deep
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,deathops,3,Fri Apr 24 01:03:42 2015 UTC,Way to take advantage of the kill fellas.. This is what happens when you fuck up the fundamentals and you're sloppy with the puck. Embarrassing.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,dl2316,3,Fri Apr 24 01:04:09 2015 UTC,0/11 on the PP. How is Doug Weight employed
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,cadoin,3,Fri Apr 24 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"really hope deHaans injury isnt too serious, that could be bad"
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,wolversheen,2,Fri Apr 24 01:09:08 2015 UTC,Our D core is fucked as it is. This blows.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,JAAAS,6,Fri Apr 24 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"damn, dude. cal tried to chop laich in half"
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,6,Fri Apr 24 01:26:09 2015 UTC,something something lubo
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,NordicReagan,4,Thu Apr 23 22:27:15 2015 UTC,dehaan hit   https://twitter.com/myregularface/status/591408216929603584
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,wolversheen,3,Fri Apr 24 01:09:42 2015 UTC,thats a fucked up hit
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,deathops,6,Fri Apr 24 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"but remember, the refs only have it in for the caps /s"
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,2,Fri Apr 24 01:12:29 2015 UTC,because that wasn't late
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,jeffyoungguns,4,Fri Apr 24 01:10:36 2015 UTC,it only makes sense to pull halak at this point
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Cay_Rharles,4,Fri Apr 24 01:17:17 2015 UTC,should have pulled him after the 4th
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,jeffyoungguns,6,Fri Apr 24 01:17:58 2015 UTC,Jaro used up his rainy day saves already it seems
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,nothing_cleverr,4,Fri Apr 24 01:17:23 2015 UTC,my god is it obnoxious over there. I couldn't imagine how it would have went if we celebrated Matt Martin contributing to the ending Ballards career like they are with viznovsky.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,isles27,6,Thu Apr 23 22:33:58 2015 UTC,for lubo
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,zeile33,3,Thu Apr 23 22:46:02 2015 UTC,they can't get in front of the net with the puck. i don't know if I can watch the 3rd. i might get thrown out of my house because of how frustrating this game has been. refs aren't fucking making it any better isn't that a fucking surprise. isles are getting lazy. halak is the only one keeping them in this game.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Chrismercy,6,Fri Apr 24 00:55:46 2015 UTC,"as much as i thought it should have been whistled, halak also should have gotten back into the play and maybe saved that second goal"
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,deathops,3,Fri Apr 24 00:57:31 2015 UTC,😠🔫
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,ZoraHockey,8,Fri Apr 24 01:16:55 2015 UTC,is it cool if i watch the rest of the game with you guys? whiny capitals fans on /r/hockey are really ruining the game for me.

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Musclesjones,2,Thu Apr 23 23:47:02 2015 UTC,Boychuck almost separated Ovechkin from his abdomen
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Memag1255,2,Thu Apr 23 23:47:12 2015 UTC,Ovechkin is lucky his body isn't fucking split in half right now.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,2,Thu Apr 23 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"just got in here and holy shit, that one shift reinhart had where he looked lost. he was just standing in the middle of nowhere frantically looking around. i felt bad for him"
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,ugotpandaowned,2,Thu Apr 23 23:56:40 2015 UTC,its nice to have a GDT of just us Vislanders bros
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Axel2134,2,Fri Apr 24 00:08:38 2015 UTC,why is there nobody near the net when we shoot? The rebounds just bounce out into no mans land.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Memag1255,2,Fri Apr 24 00:12:24 2015 UTC,hey jt took a shot and didn't break his stick

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,andyOrbit,2,Fri Apr 24 00:41:21 2015 UTC,I believe
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptWinkie,2,Fri Apr 24 00:42:51 2015 UTC,LGI. looking forward to us starting the period with a fresh sheet of ice. gonna make it that much easier to score that short handed goal.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptWinkie,2,Fri Apr 24 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"they need to wake up, they look sluggish out there. start the period with a goal get this team fired up."

Grabo doesn't look ready, Reinhart out of his league. Need Boychuck/Leddy/Tavares/Halak to make big plays if we're going to pull this one out."
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Memag1255,2,Fri Apr 24 00:54:06 2015 UTC,pk ends and they still look like they are on the pk haha
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,daveedgamboa,2,Fri Apr 24 01:02:53 2015 UTC,Halak's misplay generated that goal.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,nothing_cleverr,2,Fri Apr 24 01:03:28 2015 UTC,uninspired play form the Isles
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,daveedgamboa,2,Fri Apr 24 01:03:58 2015 UTC,capuano's job on the line. better get these guys playing.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,NordicReagan,2,Fri Apr 24 01:05:31 2015 UTC,deHaan out too..alright well thats it

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,2,Fri Apr 24 01:08:38 2015 UTC,GG Islanders
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,wolversheen,7,Fri Apr 24 01:42:36 2015 UTC,Went back to the other thread and caps fans still complaining about the goal and now boychucks almost hit.   they are worse than pens fans right now
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,SumDudeInNYC,6,Thu Apr 23 23:52:15 2015 UTC,I gave up on that thread too. They really suck at watching hockey. Don't know how to pick and choose what to complain about at all and as a result come off as super whiny.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,dl2316,4,Thu Apr 23 23:54:43 2015 UTC,"Even though my flair may be upside down, LET'S GO ISLANDERS!!"

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesandpizza,3,Thu Apr 23 22:41:37 2015 UTC,HEY!!!!! JOSH BAILEY!!!!!!!! WADDAYA KNOOOOOOOOW YOU SCORED A GOAL!!!!!!!
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Undercover_Mop,3,Thu Apr 23 23:28:09 2015 UTC,that puck should have been frozen
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,5,Fri Apr 24 00:21:54 2015 UTC,if you watch it again halak doesn't have full possession but you usually get that call
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Undercover_Mop,3,Fri Apr 24 00:30:35 2015 UTC,"i'm getting annoyed by this, i wish they blew the whistle too but in truth halak never had it and they were right not to blow it."
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,DrMarioLutherKing,2,Fri Apr 24 00:31:40 2015 UTC,hopefully home ice calms them down because the entire team is rattled
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,fashionabletaco,4,Fri Apr 24 00:49:09 2015 UTC,friendly reminder that all post game comments should be posted in the official post game thread. it will be posted shortly after the game ends

NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,GeoffreyDaGiraffe,3,Fri Apr 24 01:17:25 2015 UTC,hate to say this but the isles should take note of how the caps are still attacking the zone and not sitting back on d.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,cadoin,3,Fri Apr 24 01:17:53 2015 UTC,it's the nhl playoffs. crazy shit happens all the time. this isn't the end my friends. let's go islanders
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptainNoKills,2,Fri Apr 24 01:24:13 2015 UTC,pathetic display
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,4,Fri Apr 24 01:37:18 2015 UTC,Gotta love how the refs are letting everything go and now they start calling shitty penalties. Fucking caps have been pulling shit all series
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,JAAAS,2,Fri Apr 24 01:39:09 2015 UTC,we don't need no stinkin' /r/hockey!
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,DrMarioLutherKing,3,Fri Apr 24 01:08:39 2015 UTC,the wheels on the bus are falling off
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,DrMarioLutherKing,6,Fri Apr 24 00:02:07 2015 UTC,cappy needs to go. and the caps need to stop targeting our d-men. here's hoping saturday is kind to us.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,JAAAS,4,Fri Apr 24 01:19:13 2015 UTC,The game thread in /r/hockey is a fucking cesspool. How half the shit in there is allowed I'll never understand. Just constant comments shitting on the Isles.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,run_nyg,10,Fri Apr 24 01:21:52 2015 UTC,Sucks. It is like before that Pittsburgh massacre where we are still thought to be just a circus act for everyone's amusement. Jets aren't getting shit on. Fucking infuriating
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,Teenbasketballstar,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:26:43 2015 UTC,and it looks like fans are even coming in here and down voting. it's pathetic
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,CaptWinkie,3,Fri Apr 24 01:30:02 2015 UTC,lol i love the dickhead caps fans calling for the penalty on every play. sit the fuck down
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,andyOrbit,9,Fri Apr 24 01:32:10 2015 UTC,...he did get hit in the face by a high stick though.
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,islesrule224,2,Fri Apr 24 00:35:43 2015 UTC,lee won that right?
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,deathops,2,Fri Apr 24 00:42:09 2015 UTC,Wilson fell first so..
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,SirFigNewtons,2,Thu Apr 23 23:21:50 2015 UTC,Halak got robbed
NewYorkIslanders,33n8z5,isles27,2,Thu Apr 23 23:23:02 2015 UTC,or not
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,Fireislander,25,Fri Apr 24 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Well that was worse than death.   I'm not completely sure we can recover. Injuries, poor play and obviously none of that fire we had during the first half of the year.   I really hope I'm wrong but we were playing way better against Pittsburgh and just didn't have the goalie to win"
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islesrule224,2,Fri Apr 24 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"With our injured D it is possible -- though not likely -- that neurith plays well. He did in Buf anyway so maybe? That being said, I don't want to test this theory in the playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,kenlane,7,Fri Apr 24 01:45:05 2015 UTC,He was good in Washington as well.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,arv98s,2,Fri Apr 24 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Honesty, I think we need a new goalie coach, or we need to develop our own talent. Nobody plays as well for us as they do elsewhere."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,kenlane,2,Fri Apr 24 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"Im not going to say our goaltending hasnt let in soft goals at times and it sucks we have injuries but all f'n season we've been herendous in our own zone defensively, even in our best games. We need a revamping of our whole coaching staff. Our pp sucks, as does our pk. Our goals for has high numbers but our GA is one of tghe worst."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,AfellowchuckerEhh,4,Sat Apr 25 02:58:36 2015 UTC,How long have you had you current goalie coach?
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,arv98s,3,Fri Apr 24 01:53:29 2015 UTC,I see I'm not the only drinking tonight.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,kenlane,2,Fri Apr 24 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"Lol, swiping drunk ain't easy."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,arv98s,5,Fri Apr 24 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"So Mike Dunham is the goalie coach. He is in his 7th season, but look at the facts. Johnson, Neurith, Halak, and Nebby. All of them -- except maybe Nebby -- have played worse than one would expect based on their previous play. Nebby was old, so maybe he was just him. But look at Pullin, guy came up, was ""good"" and couldn't even hold his stick up here. The ONLY common denominator is the coaching in my opinion. Maybe it's cappy, but I think the goalie coach has to be responsible if the goalies underperform."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,kenlane,2,Fri Apr 24 02:00:03 2015 UTC,If he's been there for seven years and hasn't developed anything he should go. That was my argument for wanting Rex Ryan gone from the jets.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,arv98s,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Why is the goalie coach being brought into question after this game?  1 goal last night could be considered a really bad goal. And before the 3rd Halak kept the team in the game.  Look at the team, Bailey is the leading scorer... 1 GOAL FOR. The team was absolutely terrible last night. But let's be real here, losing 2 D and now a 3rd is absolutely killer."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,CanadianBobert,2,Fri Apr 24 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"l'd say decent at best; he's kinda a career back-up.  Edit:  This lower-case only thing is hilarious.  lf l use an ""l"", however, l can pretend it doesn't affect me sometimes."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,dontyoutellmetosmile,14,Fri Apr 24 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"of all the fucking disappointments i have witnessed in my 15 years as an isles fan, this game has been the biggest. absolutely awful performance and having to resort to gooning it up. really fucking disappointed and that says something after all the shit i've seen."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,AC3FACE,2,Fri Apr 24 01:44:27 2015 UTC,they mailed in game 2 as well.  It's just sad.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islander1,28,Fri Apr 24 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"Tough loss but the series ain't over. We need someone to step the fuck up.   Im not even gunna waste time speculating roster/line moves before Saturday, they can put whoever the fuck they want on the ice. Someone just needs to fuckin step up."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,isles27,-11,Fri Apr 24 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Let's hope for the best. It has kind of been a stinky series. If you take away the broken sticks, the 0 power play goals, etc etc, we could have easily swept. We are better than them, we just gotta step up"
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,_stee,5,Fri Apr 24 02:13:51 2015 UTC,you can't take that away though.. thats part of the series and hockey. If it wasn't the broken sticks it'd be something else.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,amarras,12,Fri Apr 24 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"Can cappy ever get angry with his team? They just got their fucking asses handed to them and he's smiling with Shannon, saying puck possession was the biggest problem? No, the biggest problem was the team was GROSSLY outplayed, they didn't get very physical and they dicked around on the PP yet again. Isles can still win this, but they need to get their heads out of their asses. Play like it's the fucking playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,Eyebleedorange,5,Fri Apr 24 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"what justification would there possibly be for him keeping his job if we lose this series? i know most of us went all ""snow must go!"" last season and were proven wrong, but I just don't see how they can keep capuano on. teams miss the playoffs once and fire their coaches."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,UnCommonBackrub,11,Fri Apr 24 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"Wish they could have showed up tonight, got revenge, and took control of the series. But they didn't show up, didn't get revenge, and now have the series and their season slipping out of their hands."

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,DrPepcraft,5,Fri Apr 24 02:55:26 2015 UTC,Take a piece with you.  It's not like they've ever had all the seats anyway
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,RomanReignz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:13:21 2015 UTC,not a bad idea... what should i take? seat seems like a pain in the ass to remove
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,elgobbler,4,Fri Apr 24 03:22:48 2015 UTC,I mean I normally don't encourage vandalism but it's waaaaay easier than you would think to break off a seat by jumping because the majority of them are pretty old.  Or you could try and bring a wrench set with ya lol
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,RomanReignz,2,Fri Apr 24 03:43:50 2015 UTC,definitely bring a small toolkit. breaking the seats is unwholesome when you could cleanly and simply unscrew them.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,thewrongflag,8,Fri Apr 24 05:17:01 2015 UTC,this has been a rough series. hopefully the old barn can put some fire into these mother fuckers.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,CaptainNoKills,5,Fri Apr 24 02:31:06 2015 UTC,one goal a game just is not going to cut it in the playoffs

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,cjm427,5,Fri Apr 24 01:55:00 2015 UTC,maybe someone like a former 30 goal scorer who is one of the fastest guys in the league. if only we could put someone like that into the lineup. cappy can be so frustrating sometimes
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,dl2316,16,Fri Apr 24 01:57:22 2015 UTC,"This is why you don't play AHL defensemen for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Every time I see people saying, ""Reinhart? Pulock? Come on Cappy!"" I think to myself, just stop. Donovan or even Carkner would have been at least serviceable D-men. Reinhart looked awful. And he has a bright future. But you don't just throw a bunch of rookies into the playoffs. ""What about Reinhart? What about Pulock?"" Just shut up already."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,Rob_G,14,Fri Apr 24 01:42:33 2015 UTC,Yea donavans gotta be like wtf???
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,threemilesd0wn,2,Fri Apr 24 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"Don't joke carkner is a horrible decision, every ahl defensemen is better than him.  You don't fucking judge all ahl defensemen based off of reinharts performance."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,isles27,11,Fri Apr 24 01:47:27 2015 UTC,They're done. They had a good game 1 and played well in game 3 but they have been sporadic. PP is down right putrid and have trouble scoring more than 1 goal.  they look flat and I don't know if playing at home will provide enough juices to get them through it. If they manage to win that aren't winning game 7.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,Number-91,6,Fri Apr 24 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"they played well in game 4 too. if they had just taken game 2 when they were getting the breaks, the series would be so different."

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,threemilesd0wn,2,Fri Apr 24 03:45:32 2015 UTC,That game shouldn't have happened the way it did. Cappy and JT should have gotten a hold on the team and directed their frustration properly. This is pretty damn telling of Cappy as a coach for anyone who wasn't sure of his credibility.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,kenlane,6,Fri Apr 24 04:04:04 2015 UTC,So about the majors for martin and cbuck...what?
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,arv98s,17,Fri Apr 24 05:05:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly the refs just wanted a clean game and were on a zero tolerance policy. If Washington had tried something at that point they would have gone too, at least this is what I believe.   Though that hit on DeHaan was certainly questionable as well so maybe I'm misreading it and the refs are just calling it based on who is worse at looking innocent."

No matter what, we are some of the biggest fans in hockey.my dad has been a fan since the 70s and has seen the cup wins and the disaster that was the 2000s.  I'm only 16 and have been an islander fan for 3 years. But if the team is here, and the heart and fans are here, what more could you want? We'll win the cup again one day, and it might be this May!

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islesrule224,3,Fri Apr 24 01:45:28 2015 UTC,I think those ejections were done to both help the isles and protect players. The 4th line was getting fairly chippy out there and those ejections possibly protected clutter buck and Martin from a suspension/more isles and caps from injuries.
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,acalltoarms1087,4,Fri Apr 24 01:47:08 2015 UTC,Caps have used playoff experience to out advantage the Isles all series. They know exactly what they can get away with and are destroying us with it. Now we are also getting injured left and right as well. Totally fucked up

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,boldbird,2,Fri Apr 24 01:51:42 2015 UTC,that was Cizikas
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,Virginiafisher,0,Fri Apr 24 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"He wasn't actually ejected.  He was given a misconduct, effectively ending his night since there was less than 10 minutes left."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,inxfinity,2,Fri Apr 24 01:56:38 2015 UTC,Right. That was pretty brutal though. Everyone knows the berries are sacred
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,RyPhy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"its really disheartening. Everything about this team and coach just seems to be that they're just doing what they can to get by.  There is clearly a fire in the team but there is no direction, or real push to get it. Cap just sits back and says ""thats ok"" the entire time.  At this point, as an Isles fans, I kinda want them to go to Brooklyn. Maybe the move will bring in alot of fans and rejuvenate the club. Right now, they're not a team anybody is betting on anymore, and when your rival team is one of the fan favorites, it absolutely sucks being a fan.  Honestly, this season I feel like was the killing blow. You got the move coming, you got the total letdown of a end season streak, a couch who gives no fucks and then when you're looking on the other side of the coin, you got the rangers. They're losing alot of fans this year."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islesrule224,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:37:06 2015 UTC,All I'm hoping the Brooklyn move does is leave the trashy fans out and end the curse the hockey gods put on this team.

NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islesrule224,3,Fri Apr 24 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"It sounded to me like he was just saying that not to blast the guy. No need to say to a rookie ""yeah you kinda sucked kid.""  At least he blamed Kennedy (indirectly) for the third goal. Get that puck deep ya jerk."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,JAAAS,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:00:16 2015 UTC,We have had way to many costly turnovers.   I understand protecting reinhart but I think he could have said something else
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,islesrule224,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but I think he should blast de haan before he blasts reinhart. De haan is terrible with the puck and turnovers and he's one of our regulars.   I think Donovan should have started tonight instead of reinhart though."
NewYorkIslanders,33nwz4,isles27,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:48:40 2015 UTC,Same. I think DE haan has been good defensively but horrible with the puck which is confusing cause he is supposed to be a puck mover...

NewYorkIslanders,33og4x,Number-91,2,Fri Apr 24 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"It's hockey. both the caps and isles have each had only 1 game they weren't in until the horn (game 1 for the caps, and game 5 for the isles). Our loss looks worse (and it was) but it counts the same. Game 2, 3, and 4 were all 1 goal games (2 in overtime).   It's hockey, any team can win against any other team any given night. We are hurting but we're not done yet.  Look at the wild, Dubnyk shut out the blues in one game and then got shelled in another.  anything. Can happen in one gAme.  Halak could stand on his head, Holtby could be off, or we have another 1 goal game that breaks the isles way.   Cautious optimism going into tomorrow."
NewYorkIslanders,33og4x,RIPwhalers,2,Fri Apr 24 14:22:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty excited to see Pulock on the blue line next game. Hopefully he can bomb one past Holtby.
NewYorkIslanders,33og4x,eggy333,3,Fri Apr 24 14:58:30 2015 UTC,Two AHL defenseman scares the shit out of me.
NewYorkIslanders,33og4x,Chrismercy,3,Fri Apr 24 15:50:25 2015 UTC,I think we have to double down on scoring at this point. go with speed and scoring potential. we probably don't have the defensive talent to try and win a grinding 2-1 game at this point.  but we might have enough offensive talent to win a game 4-3. if the power play ever wanted to show up tomorrows game would be a great time too.
NewYorkIslanders,33og4x,Waldo19,3,Fri Apr 24 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Boychuk has done great making shutting down Ovechkin his personal job. Okposo and Bailey have been some real gems. Tavares is playing steady. Really, our only three real threats are 1) that bastard Holtby is having some great games, 2) Backstrom being ignored by the Isles in the presence of Ovechkin, 3) Wilson starting shit the past two games. Lee gave a sloppy fight, but damn what a good teammate. He stuck up for Lubo and got Wilson down on the ice for him. That's a teammate right there."

NewYorkIslanders,33lg7l,ZoraHockey,6,Thu Apr 23 14:12:06 2015 UTC,"I believe arthur's been saying nelson or lee. I get that neither are playing to their potential, but they're kinda playing the ""scrap line"" (that's what I like to call it). The 4th's line got their purpose and meshed, same with the first and second. The third is kinda the leftovers put together and asking for them to produce isn't easy. Personally? I'd like to see:  Strome - JT - lee  okie - neilson - bailey  kulemin - nelson/grabo - nelson/grabo  mc2  let it be known that it's not a knock on kulemin AT ALL. He's been fantastic, I just feel lee needs to be on the first to produce, and kule can add stabilization on the third."
NewYorkIslanders,33lg7l,ZoraHockey,3,Thu Apr 23 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"I pretty much posted the same lines on the other post here in this sub, except I had the third line as Kulemin-Grabo-Kennedy. Nelson is just invisible to me outside of the first game"
NewYorkIslanders,33lg7l,FinalxFlash,2,Thu Apr 23 14:29:40 2015 UTC,Personally I think Kules belongs on the top line with JT he plays incredible defense in the neutral zone and compliments jt well in the o zone. As for their line mate that spot is easily interchangeable imo
NewYorkIslanders,33lg7l,ZoraHockey,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"That's the argument against Lee. If they get Ovi and Backstrom out against 27-91-18, 14-?, we are pinned pretty bad"

It's really annoying. Ever since the South Africa World Cup I can't stand these stupid things.  I was at the first Isles Devils game this year in Newark and we were sitting in a big section of Isles fans and I'm pretty sure someone got in a fight with the vuvuzela person because they were in our section.

We've seen chemistry between Lee and JT, JT and Strome, and Lee and Strome so why not try all 3 together?   I like the line of 12-51-21. I don't see the need to separate them.   Sitting Nelson may not be the most popular idea among us, but he's been pretty much invisible outside of the first game. I like Kulemin and Kennedy working the boards and creating space for someone like Grabo.   Fourth line stays together for obvious reasons.   On defense.. I really don't know who should go in. There's arguments for all. Donovan? He has the most NHL experience and has played well when called upon. Reinhart? He's the biggest body and has some NHL experience. Pulock? Has more offensive upside and a right handed shot. Hell, you could even make an argument for Carkner.   I hate to be Cap today"

NewYorkIslanders,33lgxw,tanu24,3,Thu Apr 23 14:50:44 2015 UTC,Nelson isn't much of a playmaker and hes playing with two other non playmakers. hes very similar to lee and as hard ad kennedy skates and as fast as grabner skates neither of them are much of puck carriers and passers. He needs to be moved to a wing   The problem some of this sub and cap can't seem to understand is people need to mesh. that's why kyle looks better now and despite him being better then lee is worse on johnnys line. Nelson would fit great next to grabo and kule
NewYorkIslanders,33lgxw,nofx516,2,Thu Apr 23 15:33:45 2015 UTC,I agree.  Nelson always did well with playmakers that could highlight his bigger more grindy side.  3rd line center maybe but maybe a higher line winger for sure

NewYorkIslanders,33lgxw,Chrismercy,2,Thu Apr 23 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"So I've given this an absurd amount of thought and I've come to the conclusion that the dman should be either Dono or Pulock.  The reason is largely due to the types of opportunities we give up, fast breaks. Reinhart would have to play very soft in the o-zone to have any chance at retreating against fast break/outlet opportunities since his speed is a question. In game 2 we played soft coverage with little d activation on offense and they punished us for it. Therefore Reinhart may lull us back into a play style that has failed us previously.   We need active attacking d men with speed."

NewYorkIslanders,33lgxw,patio_himself,2,Thu Apr 23 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world you are correct. But Carkner has hight and weight on Reinhart. And experience over Dono. The guy was given an ""A"" after all our I jury's last season, clearly he has leadership abilities. Carkner's biggest problem is he always landed in the box taking dumb penalties. This series has been called extremely lightly. Caps are getting away with things left and right. Trots knows this and is most likely encouraging it. Goals could get by on his shift but frankly they could get by on Dono or Reinharts shifts. Carkner knows his role and wouldn't get fancy. He probably won't play but I definitely see his case over the kids in this situation. We have enough youth on the blue line to begin with."

Many of us probably knew from the beginning that the guy who wrote that blog post was antagonizing fans to begin with.  We know it's not right to cheer an injured player, and that our fans were cheering the big hit that Okposo laid on Fehr, but we get called out for it while as we speak there's that post that you mentioned.  The hive mind has latched on to this idea of who the islander fan is and how we behave, and it won't let go. It's frustrating to read the comments, but as islander fans, we're used to frustration.

An Islander gets hurt and everyone's telling a 14-year NHL veteran to keep his head up.  I read one response arguing against the 2min minor call with ""it's hockey, as long as the hits are legal, let them play.  Mop up the blood and teeth after.""  I don't want to see a Capitals player injured this series, or any time soon.  But this is hockey, and eventually someone on Washington will sustain an injury from a questionable hit.  Unfortunately, it happens.  When that happens I'm sure I'll see the /r/hockey consensus:   Why'd they even call that?  yeah I saw the hit.  Byfuglien explodes his shoulder into Ovi's face, but he didn't leave his feet.  And yeah, Ovi's been face down on the ice for a minute or two, and he'll for sure be out for the rest of the playoffs, maybe his career, but that's what you get when play with your head down along the boards, man.

Wait, I'm not going to do that because I don't care that much.  TBH - I think the biggest point anyone should be arguing here is the leagues lack of consistency. Regardless of your feelings, the principle point of contact was the head, a hit which the NHL is trying to eliminate and the onus has publicly been placed on the checker to be sure he is doing everything within his power to deliver a clean check. If the NHL comes out and says ""Hey guys, principle point of contact was the head, we reviewed it, no supplemental discipline for X reason. Go Oilers"" then great, whether or not you agree or disagree with the call there is an explanation into it and that's that. I have issues with the way the referees have been letting the teams play (questionable in both directions) but then will call a weak penalty. There should be no difference in the calls from the Pre-, Regular, or Post season.  That and the fact that supplemental discipline is (and should not be) be weighted move heavily in the playoffs.  EDIT - Don't forget what happened to Charlie Conway after he realized being a tough guy wasn't cool. That's not the way the real Minnesota Miracle Man was."
NewYorkIslanders,33j12m,Minnesota_MiracleMan,5,Thu Apr 23 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"Rule 48 – Illegal Check to the Head 48.1 Illegal Check to the Head – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent’s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted. In determining whether contact with an opponent’s head was avoidable, the circumstances of the hit including the following shall be considered: ... (ii) Whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position by assuming a posture that made head contact on an otherwise full body check unavoidable.   Contact with the head is not an immediate penalty in the NHL. Visnovsky, being that low and with his head down, put himself in the position for a legal hit to make contact with the head. Wilson followed through, did not launch, did not target, did not reach, and did not target the head. Unfortunate it happened, but Visnovsky can't skate around the net with his head down and not aware of who is on the ice and where they are.  Also, take your kid to work day, so its slow as shit for me today. And I don't have kids.  And to finish, Charlie is a bitch and will never be any form of the Minnesota Miracle Man. He's the worst player on the team. Bombay was going to sit him anyway for Russ Tyler."
NewYorkIslanders,33j12m,MrMilano12,2,Thu Apr 23 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"I understand rule 48.1, no need to reiterate it. This seems to be problem with this whole discussion pertaining to this hit. Everyone is so eager to be like ""hey this is the rule you guys don't understand it and are dumb stop be homers."" My reply actually had nothing to do with the legality of the hit yet you still turn around and defend it.   My response is on the fact the the principle point of contact is the head, nothing to do with whether Viz did something to alter his body angle immediately prior to the hit (which in my opinion he doesn't) or whether I think Wilson's hit was dirty (jury's still out on that one). It has to do with the inconstancy of the league in supplementary discipline. Because I am fairly certain if this hit happens during the regular season there is some kind of look from the league.  So, I'll unfairly single you out right now and say that this is they way this discussion has gone in r/hockey that someone wants to express an opinion on it and they are immediately downvoted into oblivion (which hey, if you want to downvote me because I think Conway sucks go for it, but don't downvote because you don't agree, thats not how it works).  Do you want my take on the hit? I don't care here it is. Its extremely questionable. I agree Wilson didn't launch or reach or Viz's head. Were not going to argue if he targeted it because were not playing. If Wilson takes any other penalty besides Kneeing before going into the box, I probably wouldn't think twice and say hey he got him high whatever; but he take an extremely dangerous penalty in kneeing, leaves the box and immediately delivers a dangerous hit (that's putting opinions aside and making a comment on the sole fact that it was charging penalty (which is dangerous). Two dangerous plays within all of 15 seconds of ice time, only to have your teammate Laich say is was a ""good penalty"" to take. Knocking a puck out of play as its about to fall into the goal or slashing a stick on slam dunk is a good penalty to take...injuring an opponent is not. Its boneheaded. I also don't agree that Viz is skating with his head down like everyone says.  In closing, apparently today was take your kid to work day. I'm sure my imaginary kids are upset they missed it.  I'm glad we can agree Conway is garbage though. Heart and soul kinda guy but ultimately barely had enough skills to make it and only liked the coach that favored him like a son. Total bitch move bailing on your team when your coach actually wants you to play hockey. Bombay would never sit him but Orion definitely was ready to."
NewYorkIslanders,33j12m,Minnesota_MiracleMan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"Hey bud. Just seeing this now. Don't want to leave ya hangin. Not sure who's downvoting you, I have actually been upvoting you and many other's who are here to discuss things. Chalk it up to Caps fans who don't have a life and feel the need to blindly downvote opposing teams' subs.  I get what you're saying. I don't think its suspendable, even in the regular season. But I do think that the NHL needs to do more for checks to the head. I know it will be tough to enforce, especially for height differences, but checks to the head can and probably should be penalized more. Those just aren't the rules right now.  Conway is a bitch and its a shame he gets the girl at the end of it."
NewYorkIslanders,33j12m,MrMilano12,2,Fri Apr 24 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it was you (nor do I care for that matter) I just know a lot of post up in r/Hockey were getting buried because of it.  I agree. I'm not sure this hit is suspendable given all of the factors you mentioned, but a move toward eliminating dangerous plays will only make the sport better. As I mentioned, I don't agree that there are different rules in the playoffs and regular season. It very quickly came out that the league wasn't going to review it (which just set everyone calling for Wilson's head off more). Personally, I think it turns out differently for Wil's if its the regular season (at minimum there's much more media hoopla about it) but it is what it is.  Let's be real for a minute though, we all know Cake eater was definitely slaying Conway's girl once they hit 11th grade."
NewYorkIslanders,33j12m,Minnesota_MiracleMan,0,Fri Apr 24 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just know Caps fans are kind of known for that type of shit and I hate it. Upvotes and downvotes are stupid as it is, but to see someone get downvoted and only one person conversing (who is actually upvoting) is always frustrating to me. I come one here to have discussions, and sometimes arguments, with other people who love hockey. Not to give or take away internet points and think I'm a cool guy for doing it.  And guaranteed. Conway wasn't making it through the summer with that girl. I'm also torn on Banks. He's the best player. But dude can't stay healthy. I know its on some cheapshots, but toughen up, cake eater. Guy Germaine is the fucking man. No doubt he is slaying it and Connie doesn't give a fuck about it. She knows he's the best. By and far best flow in D3."

NewYorkIslanders,33ji8p,Axel2134,5,Thu Apr 23 00:47:02 2015 UTC,"As the unofficial Pulock bandwagon driver there is the question of how he manages the pro level physicality.  I think this move would put us all in tomorrow night. If I did this I would couple it with loading up the top line, 18-91-27. Throw caution to the wind and see if they can out score us when we dial it in.  If you put Griff in you have the option of playing another gritty grindy type of game which could be viewed as safer by some.  The important thing to note is that whomever they choose to play tomorrow night, they will give no inclination prior. Or atleast they shouldn't, sometimes Cappy surprises us."
NewYorkIslanders,33ji8p,isles27,2,Thu Apr 23 00:55:05 2015 UTC,Great analysis.  I'd go with Griff over Pulock.  He had a couple of good games up here.
NewYorkIslanders,33ji8p,zeile33,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:10:35 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the 18-91-27 line, I think Lee needs a bigger chance to produce, despite having a combined 8 shots with Kennedy last night I feel like he's been a bit invisible, and that hurts to say as I'm a big fan of his. Grabo coming back might fix that, and perhaps spark some of the Grabo-Kule connection magic they once had."
NewYorkIslanders,33ji8p,isles27,2,Thu Apr 23 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah obviously Lee needs a good center to work off of, we all love Brock but he isn't that center. Kulemin has been good up there and created some shots but you can't deny the chemistry that 91-27 have offensively, 18-27 have, and 91-18 have just developed. Seems like a good match but Cappy has to be extremely careful with which d pairing is on the ice with them. If hickey+ mystery player are on the ice with that line for long stints they are way soft defensively and will let in a bunch of goals."

NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,ArtyThePoopie,9,Wed Apr 22 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"/#2 is especially important. Clean hit or not, there were atleast 2 boarding hits on lubo this series and then all these other huge borderline hits. It is certainly targeting and they got exactly what they wanted."

NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,superfluity87,-1,Thu Apr 23 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, I wouldn't say asking for it. Also they were targeting him the whole series"
NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,isles27,5,Thu Apr 23 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"maybe its me, but after watching the replay over and over it almost looks as if lubo looks up at one point, see's wilson, and is preparing himself for the impact with the first impulse being duck. especially when you've had a target on your back the entire game for no reason. when a guy comes flying in on you like that its hard to react fast enough to put yourself in the position to safely avoid it. its definitely a charge, and theres no doubt in my mind he had every intention to hurt lubo. that being said what's done is done. the best way to get revenge is to show them an early exit from the playoffs. sending out goons will only get us in trouble. remember, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. now let's rally behind lubo and above all else, let's go islanders!!

NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,JCAPS766,-3,Thu Apr 23 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that saw Wilsons shoulder target Visnovsky's head?  Vis had his head down but he was playing the puck on the boards. Anyone that's ever played the sport knows you can't play in close quarters like that with good posture.   When the game thread started it blew up with comments like ""Unleash Tom Wilson"" The guy wasn't on the line up to play the puck, he's there to beat us up. Which is fine, that's how cups are won. but don't act like targeting of Visnovsky wasn't his intention.  Laich confirmed it this morning...   “What it did was  Visnovsky got knocked out of the game. That puts them down to five D in the second period, which — the way he plays with a heavy forecheck, a grinding forecheck […] — playing with six defense is tough enough, but playing with five is even more difficult. So it’s a quote unquote good penalty to take. It knocks them down to five defensemen, we kill the penalty off, we get momentum, and now we can really start to lean on their corps with only five guys left.”   Edit: I'm getting showered in downvotes over in /r/hockey for posting this comment. Funny, when I empathized with caps fans for the treatment of that one guy in the parking lot I was praised for my unbiased commentary. Now that I'm criticizing what I feel was an egregious hit suddenly I have my ""homer goggles on""  The only way to be taken seriously in that sub is with no flair at all."
NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,dmbreakfree41,7,Wed Apr 22 20:56:08 2015 UTC,Visnovsky is 5'8.  Wilson is 6'4.
NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,ZebishopREVO,0,Wed Apr 22 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you don't see guys like chara targeting the head despite his size. Wilson shouldn't get a free pass on headshots because he's tall."

To remind me of?   For a guy making memory jokes you're pretty quick to forget  that hit resulted in Chara getting a game misconduct from the NHL and an investigation from  the Montreal police department"
NewYorkIslanders,33ikka,smb1921,2,Fri Apr 24 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"You suggested that height is not a particularly meaningful factor in how violently a hit is taken, citing Chara as an example.  You are incorrect."

You are an asshole to wish or celebrate an injury to any athlete and their livelihood. If you see a dirty hit, that makes sense. We both have a rooting interest in it being ""clean"" or ""dirty""  But stop being such bitches about this hit. You all are acting like a clean hit with a bad result deserves a dirty shot back as retaliation. Wilson is a big boy, he knows there's a target on his back. You just sound dumb saying oh that's such a dirty play, we need to go out and injure Wilson or anybody else. I wish your coaches would listen to you all, get off gameplan and try to match us in a physical game as retaliation, the advantage goes to us if you all just wanna beat the shit out of each other.

NewYorkIslanders,33igwq,zeile33,3,Wed Apr 22 20:17:55 2015 UTC,Not so sure I agree with this.  Grabo going in after not playing so long in a crucial game?  That's tough.  Putting a rookie d man in?  Also tough but we need the size.

NewYorkIslanders,33igwq,woodhouse17,3,Wed Apr 22 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"More interesting part of stapes tweet is that he believes 29 gives way to 84  The case against 29:  In g2-4 he has only 2 shots, including 0 last night while TK and Lee combined for 8.   His puck transportation skills are nowhere close to grabovskis   His fo% has been absurdly sporadic, g1 18 g2 66 g3 38 g4 53, perhaps odd numbered games in the series are his downfall.  The case for 29:  He plays PK minutes, especially important when other pkers r in the box  He is healthy  Who the hell else is going to put a puck in the net on pp2?  Solid defensively   27 is other option, but with 7 shots in last 2 games it looks like he is finally coming alive + he thrives with good possession players, which could be great if grabovski plays like grabovski."

NewYorkIslanders,33gv4g,cadoin,3,Wed Apr 22 12:40:07 2015 UTC,"Infuriating. Definitely infuriating when losing good opportunities in the offensive zone because of a broken stick, and clearly even more infuriating when it happens in  the defensive zone.   Something I was thinking after Sundays game actually - Would it be a huge loss if you broke your stick in the d zone and instead of playing the shift without one, playing down a man for all of .. 10? Seconds to go grab another or to change?"
NewYorkIslanders,33gv4g,6PercentOfTheTime,5,Wed Apr 22 14:19:50 2015 UTC,i made the same comment to my friends on sunday - skate to the bench and grab a stick. they all agreed it would be worse to be a man down as you can always screen or put your body in front of a shot.
NewYorkIslanders,33gv4g,zimmelbc,5,Wed Apr 22 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"hockey player here, can confirm. just play the body, block shots, rest of the team tries for a whistle even if it's icing."
NewYorkIslanders,33gv4g,purplehumpbackwhale,0,Wed Apr 22 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and disagree with your friends.  IMO, The player should always skate to the bench to grab a stick.  I've often seen a player break a stick and then have the play go on for well more than 10 seconds in the zone while the player without the stick is doing everything in their power to obstruct the play.  The problem with this is that the other team knows they can exploit the stickless player.  Here's the crux of the issue:  Teams practice 5 on 4 situations all the time, but they do not practice 5 on 5 with one player short a stick.    This is hugely significant, because it changes the entire dynamic of the defense.  If you play a 5 man defense, and one guy has a stick, then one opposing player is undercovered.  See the OT winning goal.  In a normal 5 on 5 situation, you could see that JT would have been able to either knock to the puck away or force a pass.  Without the stick a dangerous shot on goal was allowed.  If the team rule was ""go grab a stick"", the rest of the players on the ice know to switch to a PK formation until the player returns.  This means, that while you are short a player, you are now accommodating for the situation.  Players change their positions, cover the ice differently and know to help out with the additional coverage.    By leaving the player on the ice, no adjustment is made and you effectively have a hole in your defense.  Sure, some players are very good at improvising and getting in the way with their body, but more often than not, I've seen that player exposed, which either gives the other team a great scoring opportunity, or allows them to maintain possession for much longer than they otherwise would.  Edit: It took me longer than I'd like to admit to catch on... but great job at banning all caps!"

NewYorkIslanders,33fk0r,trickface,4,Wed Apr 22 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"Puck was right in the corner. He had just played it and Wilson came to finish his check. It's been a physical series and it sucks to hear Visnovsky could be out but you can't deny that it was a penalty because of the result of the hit by a 6'4"" guy on a shorter defenseman. Not dirty at all"
NewYorkIslanders,33fk0r,mattymonkees,-15,Wed Apr 22 03:00:12 2015 UTC,He left his feet
NewYorkIslanders,33fk0r,caponslugger,8,Wed Apr 22 03:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even though I haven't seen the MSG coverage, Pierre McGuire even acknowledged that Wilson didn't leave his feet after seeing the replay"

NewYorkIslanders,33fk0r,TwoMinuteMinor,-8,Wed Apr 22 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"The call was correct - it was a charge. Nothing to do with leaving his feet. He skated through the hit and didn't pull up at all. Could be called intent to injure, with the head contact."

NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,ForeverAnIslesFan,10,Wed Apr 22 12:26:46 2015 UTC,Yea they did it at the very beginning of the game before any shots were even taken. They need to cut that shit out.
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,jackstraw92,19,Wed Apr 22 02:49:02 2015 UTC,Your supposed to serenade a goalie when he makes a mistake or is struggling. Not when he's playing well/carrying his team.
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,ChedSpiffman,3,Wed Apr 22 02:52:31 2015 UTC,It makes you look like shit when that goalie carries his team to a victory
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,jackstraw92,4,Wed Apr 22 03:05:25 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fact that he really tones people out and has ice running through his veins, he get serenaded like that in almost every arena and I'd give an estimate of about 70% of the time for no reason.  It really makes no sense except for when he's actually struggling. (Plus he get fuel from knowing he's in your head)"
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,caponslugger,7,Wed Apr 22 03:07:10 2015 UTC,The guy is carrying his team. Phenomenal goalie. Leave him alone he's not fleury.

NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,easy_Money,8,Wed Apr 22 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"he is the opponent and we should jeer him when he makes a mistake!!!  currently he is the best player on the team. not only does jeering him before play even starts further motivate and already extremely motivated professional athlete , it makes our fans look poorly because it gives off the vibe that we don't know how to properly heckle. he is the opponent, which is why i don't like him, but we should be spending that time motivating our own guys, not the other way around."
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,jackstraw92,2,Wed Apr 22 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think they would've chanted the name of any goalie who was playing, I don't think it's anything specifically with holtby"
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,Minnesota_MiracleMan,6,Wed Apr 22 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"Caps fan here. Really not trying to troll. But the ""Can you hear us"" chant was a Rangers chant. I'm glad to see someone with the Isles call that out. I was really disappointed when I heard that. I expected something about what Ovechkin said, but copying a Rangers chant?  My point is: While we don't like each other very much right now, we both fucking hate the Rangers. Don't give them that ammo against you guys.  Also, this is going to post every grammatical capitalization lower case, right?  Edit: My eyes may not see the capitalizations, but my heart sure as hell does. You win this one /r/newyorkislanders mods.  Edit 2: Also, great game. 1st one of the series where both teams didn't lay a total stinker. Caps were better near the end and Isles needed to score on those PP's, but both played very good hockey games."
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,Minnesota_MiracleMan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:08:05 2015 UTC,yea that the rags chant i was talking about. honestly thats what happens when teams are good; fans that may not necessarily have strong feelings towards one team or another copy stuff from other teams. its just frustrating because this hasn't been an issue all year and now we look foolish.
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,Projectrevolution,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And if you guys beat us, you know that they will start Game 1 with a ""We are louder"" chant. Hell, they will think they are hot shit and do it against us too."
NewYorkIslanders,33fjsm,DLun203,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"I don't care if it's considered a ""rangers chant"". They've done it for what, 2 or 3 years? It's a pretty general chant. Were not whistling lets go band and yelling one of their former players suck. It's only being done due to Ovi's comment, and hopefully will and should cease after this series."

NewYorkIslanders,33fqe3,A_Charmandur,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:31:34 2015 UTC,Jt's problem is the faceoff.  that stick in ot was a freak thing.  they used to have okposo take the faceoffs earlier in the year when they played on the same line.  i don't think reverting to that or strome taking them depending who is on his line is that bad of an idea at this point.

NewYorkIslanders,33fj8i,carmelocleanthony,4,Wed Apr 22 02:50:36 2015 UTC,That is the worst part. They dominated but lost over the two luckiest goals of the series.   Could have been avoided had they scored on the powerplay.

That puts them down to five D in the second period, which — the way he plays with a heavy forecheck, a grinding forecheck […] — playing with six defense is tough enough, but playing with five is even more difficult. So it’s a quote unquote good penalty to take. It knocks them down to five defensemen, we kill the penalty off, we get momentum, and now we can really start to lean on their corps with only five guys left.”  Team is already ticked off and Viz is beloved. Thats lockerroom material. If you thought Okposo was playing angry, wait till you see them in game 5. Wow is Laich playing with fire."

NewYorkIslanders,33fj8h,FinalxFlash,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:59:08 2015 UTC,broken sticks and power play is going to end this playoffs for us. Goals are scored when someone is in front of the net.

NewYorkIslanders,33fkb8,isles27,2,Wed Apr 22 02:58:55 2015 UTC,Another fix is calling JT and Doug Weight out which our coach is too much of a softy to do. Tell them to simplify the game. Enough fancy bullshit.
NewYorkIslanders,33fkb8,RyPhy,3,Wed Apr 22 05:13:05 2015 UTC,if we lose this series i'm 100% on board kicking out the coaching staff and going after mclellan/babcock etc.  It really is unacceptable to be so bad on a very important part of the game.
NewYorkIslanders,33fkb8,deathops,4,Wed Apr 22 02:52:55 2015 UTC,So you want the same guy who squandered a 7 year San Jose window to come in and squander our window?
NewYorkIslanders,33fkb8,mattymonkees,2,Wed Apr 22 03:30:44 2015 UTC,I don't really think its fair to put all that blame on him man. And its less that I want him and more that cappy is just becoming intolerable in certain situations.
NewYorkIslanders,33fkb8,deathops,2,Wed Apr 22 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"then why are we putting the blame on cappy with regard to this series?  his staff has shown they can repair special teams because the pk has been really good.  there will be imperfections with every coach.  i don't think cappy is the greatest coach ever, but be careful what you wish for.  the team is very motivated under him and loves playing for him."

NewYorkIslanders,33egxu,bass_n_treble,2,Wed Apr 22 02:55:41 2015 UTC,its a tough decision to make. playing a man down was really starting to show towards the end. at the exception of the powerplay there was some positives there. we've been holding the top goalscorer in the league down pretty well.

NewYorkIslanders,33e5nc,hockalo0gie,11,Tue Apr 21 20:09:00 2015 UTC,is anyone else really pissed off that the commentators you have watched with all year who feel like they are right there on your couch will not be calling the most important games of the season (read: decade)?  Just seems wrong - I'll miss Howie and Butch for the rest of this ride.
NewYorkIslanders,33e5nc,Skooby14,2,Tue Apr 21 20:16:16 2015 UTC,If only it was our last broadcast on msg ever... yes?Sny? Too bad broadcasting contracts make DP's contract look reasonable in comparison.
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,deathops,3,Wed Apr 22 02:56:03 2015 UTC,They will freedono. this isles coaching core shys away from exciting risky decisions. Conservative and boring.  But Dono has actually played pretty decently. There were a couple games where he looked bad but he was paired with strait/hickey when they were in their mid season slide  There was also that one game where Cappy decided Dono would be the only d man on pp1. That was peculiar and interesting
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,isles27,2,Wed Apr 22 03:04:11 2015 UTC,"ah yeah that totally makes sense. If we had one more big body defenseman who wouldn't get taken off the puck I would be so happy, but our potential guys to come up play don't exactly fit that description."
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,isles27,2,Wed Apr 22 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Reinhart fits that description pretty well. He was just very raw the last time we saw him in the NHL, not sure how he managed in bridgeport"
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,mattymonkees,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:12:20 2015 UTC,yeah I mean depends on if he actually starts hitting people. But I haven't seen him play since them so I have no clue to how he has been doing
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,s7ev,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:13:20 2015 UTC,They need someone who QB a PP and Dono is the only guy with experience who fits the bill
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,isles27,2,Wed Apr 22 03:31:51 2015 UTC,prolly Reinhart. Any updates For Hamonic?
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,s7ev,2,Wed Apr 22 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone I've spoken to that has seen him says he is still limping. It can't be an acl because that requires surgery and he would've already undergone it, so there is a possibility it is an mcl."
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,mgiblue21,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:13:58 2015 UTC,I haven't heard any updates. wish cappy would actually talk about injuries so we wouldn't have to hope he comes back or had an actual timeline
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,h0rst87,2,Wed Apr 22 03:01:59 2015 UTC,he is probably not back for awhile so hes not even mentioning it :(
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,mgiblue21,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:03:39 2015 UTC,Butch and Howie said post game last night that as far as they knew he wasn't even skating yet
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,skibble,2,Wed Apr 22 13:13:19 2015 UTC,id love to see reinhart. hes a big boy and a raw talent. perfect spot for him to step up into the fold. lubo's career is likely over.
NewYorkIslanders,33fkyb,seanjasey,2,Wed Apr 22 12:43:52 2015 UTC,I think it needs to be Reinhart. They need his size and strength
NewYorkIslanders,33fvwj,Macinman719,5,Wed Apr 22 04:39:12 2015 UTC,This is the worst night for this. We just lost a heart breaking playoff game.
NewYorkIslanders,33fvwj,ryan924,2,Wed Apr 22 04:40:06 2015 UTC,"I saw, I was hoping to kick up some past excitement instead of present sorrow."
NewYorkIslanders,33fvwj,Chrismercy,3,Wed Apr 22 04:41:28 2015 UTC,Keep an eye on Cal Clutterbuck15. The 4th line is the most entertaining line to watch shift after shift.
NewYorkIslanders,33fvwj,Lostinthemist81,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are some good highlight videos of the cup years on youtube.  As far as up and comers to keep an eye on, the top prospects are Pulock and Reinhart on defense and Dal Colle on offense.  It looks like we might see 1 of the first two on Thursday if Visnovsky and Hamonic are both still out of commission.    There are a number of good blogs to follow like Islanders Point Blank, Lighthouse Hockey, Eyes on Isles, and Insider the Islanders.  Good people to follow on twitter are Arthur Staple, Dan Friedman, and Dan Petriw.  That said, I really like the Avs as well.  It seems like you guys are certainly up and coming considering the avg age of your team is like 22 lol."
NewYorkIslanders,33fjye,Axel2134,6,Wed Apr 22 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"I was serious a month ago when I asked, at what point do the avantages of these sticks get outweighed by their constant breaking?   how many caps goals now have come from plays with broken sticks? then add in the broken sticks in the offensive zone botching good looks.   I know you need flex to do what you need to do at this level but my word if their isn't a rival company offering a more resilient product while maintaining similar weight and flex i know what my next start up is."
NewYorkIslanders,33fjye,RIPwhalers,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:59:02 2015 UTC,the solution isn't the stick.  it's johnny taking faceoffs.  he has too much torque for the stick to handle on the faceoffs in either zone.  gotta have okposo take the faceoffs on powerplays like he used to or strome when he's on the line.
NewYorkIslanders,33fjye,mcbordes,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:56:32 2015 UTC,"Given the fact that he's only averaging 2.5 shots per game and like breaking two sticks a game he's not contributing with that flex.  The one goal he's scored all series has come from a short angle that could have been done with a pure wooden stick and the same curve.  In a tight checking series like with a total of 1 rego goal per team in the last two games, he should really sacrifice his perfect shot for a defensive play.  A goal saved is the same as a goal earned.  He could even use multiple sticks for different situations like Mike Green of the Capitals, use a stiffer stick for taking defensive zone draws and use his normal one to take offensive zone draws or be on the PP, cause this is just a joke."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,elgobbler,11,Wed Apr 22 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"it's not to the chicken dance, its to if you're happy and you know it clap your hands. I was at the game sunday as well and it played as it does at every game. I don't have a problem with it. I think its a fun little chant that even the opposing team can join in on. also I'm not sure if you're familiar but the rangers blow a whistle and scream ""potvin sucks"" at every home game."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,mc11050,-1,Wed Apr 22 15:23:59 2015 UTC,the 'if you suck and you know it' chant is stupid because at the end of it the fans are the ones clapping!
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,Number-91,6,Wed Apr 22 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"It's ""if you know the rangers suck clap your hands"""

NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,Musclesjones,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:45:32 2015 UTC,who cares. They are cheering and involved. Can't say that for the last couple years when hardly anyone was going to games.
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,kenlane,4,Wed Apr 22 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"I like it. It's hard to say why I like it, but I can tell you from experience many teams have an equivalent (or at least teams with die hard rivals).   It really helps get you into games that are slow. That may not be necessary in the playoffs, but it sure as hell can be necessary mid season and early on in the season, or in years where the team is not so fortunate as to make the playoffs.   It has a purpose, doing it every game I think is a good thing, and if nothing else it means everybody knows it."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,ArtyThePoopie,5,Wed Apr 22 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"eh, take it or leave it imo. is it cheesy to do it against other teams? yeah. does it bother me? not really. Plus they do potvin sucks every 2 minutes so i think we're deserving of at least a couple ""if you know the rangers suck""s down the stretch here"
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,islesrule224,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:29:37 2015 UTC,See I love it and it's funny cause every team we play goes what was that.   Oh that was our Rangers suck chant.   Ha that's great you guys hate each other that much.   It furthers the belief that no matter what Fuck the Rangers
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,zeile33,3,Thu Apr 23 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yes they do, ""Potvin sucks"".    I have no problem with this and I miss the chicken dance version."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,ryan924,2,Wed Apr 22 16:48:19 2015 UTC,they do the potvin chant every game
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,Musclesjones,2,Wed Apr 22 16:53:16 2015 UTC,Don't the rangers do potvin sucks? Even when not playing Islanders? The guy retired in 1988.
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,isthatyoujohnwayne_,2,Wed Apr 22 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah but at least our arena doesnt play the song for it anymore so the fans have to whistle, while the coliseum plays the clap your hands song at every game. And yes, Potvin sucks is stupid."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,RyPhy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"Well the fans made the song up, the organist never intended for it to be a chant."
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,Musclesjones,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:38:56 2015 UTC,Yeah he's just playing a easily recognizable clap along song. Can't control what the fans sing
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,RyPhy,2,Wed Apr 22 20:19:35 2015 UTC,They do Potvin sucks like 10 times a game this series vs the pens. It's part of the rivalry.
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,leeber27,0,Wed Apr 22 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"You serious right now? They've been doing this for years, decades even. Rags do potvin sucks, we do the clap. Why bring this up now and not years ago?"
NewYorkIslanders,33he1e,mattymonkees,-1,Wed Apr 22 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"i dislike it, but it's here to stay regardless.  i've never seen the mets do anything like it with the yankees.  there is no de facto sponsorship of an anti-yankee chant at a mets game.  as a mets fan, i hold basically no venom toward the yankees; they're not division rivals, their success doesn't impact the mets in any fashion, and i view them as rather neutral.  the only reason mets fans ever root against the yankees is because they don't want to hear it from yankee fans.  that's basically it.  if you're like me and you're not really around any obnoxious yankee fans, the yankees are just sort of there.  it's even acceptable to root for both teams considering how infrequently they play each other.  same for jets-giants; the only reason any fans of those teams dislike each other is when fans of the other team rip on them.  that's basically it.  there's no issue rooting for both teams because they're in different divisions and almost never play each other."
NewYorkIslanders,33eu1s,goagro,2,Tue Apr 21 23:11:06 2015 UTC,New Islanders fan as of this year. This has just been such an amazing season. I hope you like the video I made and it pumps you up for the playoffs.

A plastic cup of beer is insulting, but stop pretending any fan base is immune from this. Youtube capitals fan fights and you can find a caps fan trying to push a rangers fan down a flight of stairs. I guess your fanbase is terrible too. If you're going to throw a cup of beer on the ice, at least hit someone on the other team."
NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,isthatyoujohnwayne_,-1,Wed Apr 22 03:57:38 2015 UTC,Nobody was happy to see that. It was a clean hit anyway. Stop trying to defend throwing beer at players. Just mad because you lost.

NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,braddaugherty8,-2,Wed Apr 22 04:06:27 2015 UTC,Targeted the head? Tell vis to keep his head up. Charge? The puck was right there. Shouldn't have even got a penalty for it. The result was unfortunate. Clean hit.
NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,isthatyoujohnwayne_,2,Wed Apr 22 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"Once again, not how the game is called in this era. Don't use that to excuse a dirty hit. and on charging: Rule 42 of the NHL rulebook dictates that charging ""shall mean the actions of a player or goalkeeper who, as a result of distance traveled, shall violently check an opponent in any manner. A 'charge' may be the result of a check into the boards, into the goal frame or in open ice.""[1] The infraction may warrant any severity of penalty or combination of penalties as the officials deem fit, including a major plus a game misconduct, or suspension if the infraction results in injury to the opposing player."

NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,AmazingShurtle,2,Wed Apr 22 04:11:18 2015 UTC,Principal point of contact was the head. The onus is on the checker. I know no one has cared about the capitals since 2009 (must be why your playoff tickets are so cheap) but head hunting isn't legal in the NHL anymore.
NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,leeber27,3,Wed Apr 22 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"Right, because lubo was turtling before the hit even came. Second time that game he put himself in the position, turned to face the boards when ovi came in to hit him. At least I'm not the one advocating throwing beer at players lol."
NewYorkIslanders,33fqqd,AmazingShurtle,0,Wed Apr 22 04:23:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, onus is on the player throwing the check. Chara can't just elbow Gaudreau in the face because he's shorter than him. If you worry about beer throwing more than reckless hits, you have your priorities fucked up."

I didn't start any of those interactions,  but I'm not about to go cry to the world about my experiences at other arenas.   The guy is a fucking crybaby.   https://twitter.com/drivenbyboredom/status/589796448872570881?s=09"
NewYorkIslanders,3386k0,isles27,8,Mon Apr 20 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"He also admits, in several tweets, that he was taunting people. Except, in his mind, it is ""all in good fun"" whereas when people don't like it, they're ""crossing the line"".   Clearly keying a car is crossing a line. Homophobic slurs and racist slurs are just pathetic.  But he, and his friends, went to the game with the purpose of ""being heard"" and making a statement. I don't think it is a very good idea to taunt a mob, and I think it is incredibly disingenuous to claim ""victimhood"" when you show up planning to taunt people.  As I learned in my teenage years, if you're looking for trouble, you're going to find it.  They did a TV interview in the concourse area before the game talking about how they were planning to ""soak in"" all the boos and still be heard, etc...  They also said the building is a dump, calling it a high school gymnasium; and that fella who indicated he'd never been to the Coliseum before later said on twitter that he had been there, ""but there were never any Islander fans there"".  Does that sound like a suffering victim to you? He was a jerk who went looking for trouble, then found it; then blogged about it. He's a self-aggrandizing prick and he doesn't deserve our sympathy.  Although the person with the keyed car does."
NewYorkIslanders,3386k0,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Mon Apr 20 21:38:17 2015 UTC,I'm in full agreement.   The guy probably had most of his letter drafted before he arrived at the Coliseum.

NewYorkIslanders,3392v0,elgobbler,5,Mon Apr 20 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"i think the last update was that there was no timetable for his return... i think that was pretty much capuanos way of saying his season's over, or at least this series. it sucks, a lot, but luckily we've got a deep defensive squad and we'd all been dying for dehaan to get back in. now's his chance to prove to capuano that he's better than strait."
NewYorkIslanders,3392v0,purplehumpbackwhale,8,Mon Apr 20 17:37:09 2015 UTC,Strait is getting the shit end of the stick lately.  He's actually probably our most improved player this season.
NewYorkIslanders,3392v0,bass_n_treble,2,Mon Apr 20 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"youre right, he is doing much better absolutely. still takes too many penalties though, and the fanbase grew pretty fond of dehaan when he was a full timer.   regardless, i was moreso saying, whether or not dehaan is better, he is still playing under the assumption that this is his chance to prove to capuano that he is better, which should light a fire under him and strait both."

NewYorkIslanders,3392v0,purplehumpbackwhale,0,Mon Apr 20 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"this would only be if hamonic comes back   That's what I was referring to.  If Hamonic comes back (which it's looking like he won't), I am not certain inserting him into the lineup would really be beneficial at this point except as a last ditch effort if someone else gets injured.  Being that Hammer has not skated, if anyone goes down Reinhart will probably step up."
NewYorkIslanders,3392v0,bass_n_treble,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"ahhhh, i see what you meant. i wasnt even considering the idea of hammer being the one that sits but yea, that makes sense. i was also thinking about the future in general, not just these playoffs.  but yea for now, unfortunately probably a moot point since hammer might be down for the season."

NewYorkIslanders,338h6x,Cay_Rharles,8,Mon Apr 20 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"all you have to do is look at the shot totals in each period. it tells the whole story.   i think we started playing dump and chase way way way to early in the third, considering we only had a one goal lead.   the last 5 minutes of that period, once it was tied, the isles looked like the team that dominated periods 1 and 2.    we need the team to play that way until they have a solid 2 or 3 goal lead with 8 minutes to play in the 3rd.  then I am fine with seeing dump and chase.  As a team we seem to do just as good a job of killing the clock when are actively trying to score as we do when playing a more conservative game."
NewYorkIslanders,338h6x,Waldo19,3,Mon Apr 20 15:04:04 2015 UTC,Completely agree.
NewYorkIslanders,338h6x,dontcallmepeenut,2,Mon Apr 20 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"i think everyone has it right - they cannot play consistently with a lead.  dump and chase is not the answer, we all know that.  you saw immediately the mentality shift after the caps scored.    also, at home, there is no excuse for icing the puck late in the third like we were doing.  this is the only time where trotz can get ovie and backstrom out there with favorable matchups - which is what lead to that endless cycle and eventually the tying goal.  thats a mental issue, but i believe its a mental issue that comes directly from the dump and chase mentality - carry the puck, make good passes - there's no need to panic and ice it.  just my $.02.  lgi!"
NewYorkIslanders,338h6x,Skooby14,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"first, who is done celebrating yesterday? i am going to glow from that game until they drop the puck tomorrow. i love the pressure my ranger fan friends are feeling now prior to their game 3. this is awesome!  your observation is spot on. this team has mental lapses. not sometimes, often. regularly losing 2 and 3 goal leads. even halak's mistakes are judgement not skill related. you'd think the coaches would have tried the obvious like riding them, pointing it out, etc.   what's next? i just keep hoping they rise to the playoffs and lessen the lapses. game two broke my heart in that way. they just sat back 10 minutes into the first period. let's see who shows up tomorrow."
NewYorkIslanders,338h6x,Azabuplace,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"As you pointed out, the first 45 was incredible. It's the exact kind of play we know they can do and have done back when they were killing it this year. That's what it takes to win a series.  As for the last 15, this team gets into ""defensive shell mode"" whenever they're up. They're too damn nervous to give up the lead and thus stop that offensive pressure that got them where they were. After that goal however, they got the pressure back and dominated once again.  bottom line, the team needs to evaluate ways to mentally over come the thought of losing the lead."

NewYorkIslanders,336dud,Tilt23Degrees,7,Mon Apr 20 00:43:02 2015 UTC,The building after the first goal was absolutely insane. Never heard anything like that in my life
NewYorkIslanders,336dud,Tilt23Degrees,5,Mon Apr 20 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I was at the DC game on Friday, tripped down south for it with a few of my buddies.  Verizon Center was loud, but I'm sorry...it's just not as loud as the barn.  The fan base on Long Island, we are so obnoxious. I love it."
NewYorkIslanders,336dud,Tilt23Degrees,2,Mon Apr 20 00:46:20 2015 UTC,I was wondering from the perspective of someone who was at both games after ovechkin said verizon center was louder
NewYorkIslanders,336dud,mcbordes,3,Mon Apr 20 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"It was loud when they scored goals, only because the islander fans there were so loud and obnoxious the rest of the game; they felt inclined to rub it in our faces when we ended up losing.  The first period was a library over at VC.  The barn is just all around more energetic.   I'm sure Ove feels dumb saying what he said, especially after all the ""can you hear us"" chants we started."
NewYorkIslanders,336dud,nothing_cleverr,2,Mon Apr 20 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"the you can't hear us chants were great but they made me nervous. When a player hears a chant like that, they usually try to make a statement play to shut the crowd up"

NewYorkIslanders,336dud,DancesWithCanoes,2,Mon Apr 20 02:08:02 2015 UTC,i'm sure tilt23degrees will agree but it was like a library in there during the first period.  the only difference i noticed between this game and a regular season game i went down there for was the horns/siren/goal song was a bit louder.

They'd been going back and forth all game, I don't think it's really that big of a deal.  I think a lot of the Caps fans who are salty about  it are just salty about the game-- you can't blame us, losing is tough-- and displaced it onto Cal, given that he's a bit of an easy target with this clip (though that's his job-- deflect from the guys who do the big production).    I thought it was a fucking amazing game, and I hope that game 4 is as good, though perhaps a little less lopsided early on ;)"

NewYorkIslanders,335suw,firebird65g,2,Sun Apr 19 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"I was having this discussion earlier with a friend - Are hockey arenas as full of drunks and/or loud superfans in general in the south as they are in the north? It always seems to be a much more casual environment in the newer hockey cities like Atlanta and Tampa Bay, for example. I haven't been to a game, I'm just judging from the loudness of games on TV and what I see. Anybody know?"

NewYorkIslanders,335suw,jester92800,2,Sun Apr 19 21:58:24 2015 UTC,"haha yeah i got tagged with some beer or water in 329 after the goal, it's all good in my book since we got the win.   we had an exceptionally rowdy crowd on hand this afternoon, it's a trade-off for the electric atmosphere in the building in my opinion. i don't want the fans sitting on their hands for a playoff game, but unfortunately some people take it too far, it's just a reality.   you can't purchase tickets in 330 row n and think it's going to be a picnic, the craziest, drunkest fans sit up there."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,jester92800,4,Mon Apr 20 03:01:04 2015 UTC,"Question-- why don't they hand them out as you come in like they do for bobbleheads and stuff like that?  I gotta figure this would be rampant anywhere they do the towel draped over the seat thing, not just unique to New Yorkers (though I imagine you guys get some bad ones by virtue of your proximity to rangers fans ;))"
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,bige693,2,Mon Apr 20 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"This is the question everybody was asking. I figure it's because they took a picture of the Coliseum being ""ready"" and it had the towels out, so it was for a good photo op? I don't know, they don't do this for regular season games with giveaways."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,MrMilano12,4,Mon Apr 20 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"It makes for a hell of a photo op, to their credit.  If it makes sense, I feel like your crowd doesn't really ""need"" towels, yanno?  Like, you don't really need any instructions on how to support the team, you just need them to be good enough to make it to the dance, which they are finally/deservedly."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,Salacondor,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't think they were really ever used in unison today. But I like them because I use them in my car - the one I currently use from the '04 playoffs is a little beaten up, so I finally get to replace it."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,Salacondor,2,Mon Apr 20 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"The caps used to give away pom pom things back in the 90's (when we still wore white at home).  I still have those all hung up on my office wall.  Lately it's been playoff t-shirts for each postseason, but I stopped getting those-- I'll buy one when we make an ECF/SCF, otherwise I keep telling myself that my hubris caused our collapse, haha."

NewYorkIslanders,335suw,babygirl052594,2,Mon Apr 20 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I mean that the caps actually make t-shirts (they're always red) with some sort of slogan/theme.  This years are Abe Lincoln themed because we give out a stovepipe hat/beard to the player of the game."

NewYorkIslanders,335suw,isles27,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"It's kinda the ""playoffs"" thing to do. I know it sounds dumb, but the Islanders are just trying to fit it. Plus, I feel like laying the towels out assures that the arena is full of them and that it's not just a scattered assortment all around. Fans will inevitably forget to grab a towel or just not want one. Laying them out makes sure that they are all over the arena which looks better on TV. Also, if they just handed them out at the door, the douchebag fans will still be around either way and they will visit each gate 2 or 3 times to get a handful of towels for their buddies."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,ippy116,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"This exactly. Myself and a few of the other season ticket holders I am friend with make it a point to avoid the front entrance and enter at a door by our gate, our reward? Never getting the fan give away. We typically have to call our reps ahead of time to make sure we are going to get something so I don't believe handing them out at the door is the solution. They should have the security guards and ushers there doing to something to stop this from happening though."
NewYorkIslanders,335suw,Musclesjones,9,Mon Apr 20 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"The bottle was a mistake and I could see that happening because they were drunk. But, the stealing of the towels and mocking the handicapped kid was fucked up."

That's a dumbfuck thing to do.  And it could have been anyone in that seat and it's an asshole thing to do - the fact it was a kid, and then a handicapped kid on top of it?

He went by  Alexander the Gr8 and made many of those who allowed him to reign the infamous region known as the ""left circle"" regret it in doing so. Many times his fellow sharpshooters would make a playoff push, only to be thwarted by heroic Rangers, Zeus' Lightning, and hardy Canadiens. The year that marked one decade of his reign, there were a rag tag rebel faction known as the Islanders, led by their Savior, JT. Just months away from eviction from their beloved homeland, the Islanders faced Alex the Gr8 as his band of Southeast tyrants threatened the Eastern Seaboard. The rest is to be continued..."""

I mean it's not like he got carted off or anything, and you can't really fault a little passion from fans after a great hit like Okposo laid on him, he just went in awkward and tweaked something (probably a shoulder or something).  Nothing for him to get mad over like this."
NewYorkIslanders,335js6,Axel2134,0,Mon Apr 20 02:00:52 2015 UTC,I was at the game an nobody in my section even realized he was hurt. We were all pumped about the game going well. From what I heard the people by the tunnel were cheering but no one there even noticed

It is certainly appalling, but it is not uncommon at any sporting event in any city. This is a societal/cultural issue rather than an Islanders hockey issue.   I feel bad, but the positive should be emphasized in that isles fans helped these people and prevented things from escalating.  Unfortunately there is nothing even a good samaritan could do to prevent a car from getting keyed, the parking lot is open to all and the staff is hard pressed to monitor such a large area as intently as may be necessary at times."

Not condoning the keying of the car and such but there is a Good chance this group was being obnoxious as well and pushed some drunk fans too far. The guy sounds like an asshole writing it. He's probably upset that his ear drums are blown out by how loud the barn gets and Washington sports fans are just used to quiet.

What happened there I'm not sure, but I've seen and heard about islanders fans being wasted and acting like such assholes so many times, that really I have no faith in there being a second side to this."
NewYorkIslanders,336hwd,ZoraHockey,0,Mon Apr 20 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"i thought the asshole chant was just a classic sports chant  ive seen it done good-naturedly whenever someone wears the opposing teams jersey, then they sit down and everyone leaves them alone"
NewYorkIslanders,336hwd,jackwoww,3,Mon Apr 20 07:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the more I looked into everything, the more I realized that the ""asshole"" chants weren't really the issue (they seemed to kind of relish in that, and said it was expected). They also seemed to ""instigate"" that.   But, it's the car damages I have a problem with really.. Which I imagine was just one or two bad fans ruining it for everyone."

What's great about Bailey (and gets noticed in the playoffs more) is that while he can have quite a few visually frustrating hesitations and second guesses, he so rarely makes the idiotic play that leads to a real chance for the other team.   Edit: Pronouns"

NewYorkIslanders,3371qo,watchstarsgoout7,4,Mon Apr 20 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"I said something similar in the thread on /r/caps. It's fun to give an opposing fan shit, but personal attacks, abuse, and damaging of property is never ok. Doing it because someone roots for a different team is just pathetic.

We can all say ""if I was there, this wouldn't have happened..."" Or ""we aren't all like that!"" but guess what? It only takes one time to make everyone look like pricks.  In the end, we are all accountable for this bullshit.  Do these idiots think the players would be proud of shit like this? No! I'm sure they are fucking disgusted.  Damn, this has me heated. Oh yeah, sure the guy might have shit talked, that's part of the fun but in the end you laugh it out, have a beer, and bond over the damn game.

NewYorkIslanders,334jnm,mattymonkees,4,Sun Apr 19 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"This is what happens when you have a terrible coach. His game plan is to play the trap in the third with a one goal lead. You need a better defensive team for that. They're strength is out playing teams down low in the other teams zone. The caps didn't adjust, we sat back."
NewYorkIslanders,334jnm,IslesMetsJets44,4,Sun Apr 19 18:41:41 2015 UTC,And suddenly we control the offensive play again. It's so obvious that it's sickening.

And it may have been a dump - alarm clock sound system, tiny jumbotron, basic plastic hot dogs for food - but it was your dump. I'm a met fan and I said the same thing about Shea. Yeah it was a dump but always loved watching a game there. Citi's not quite the same - but hey, looking like it might be different this year. I just don't know if Barclays will give the same experience. The islanders are second tenants there and it's a basketball arena with a hockey rink squeezed into it.   Hopefully with the Coliseum renovations there will be room to expand it back to 15,000-16,000 seats or so and the Islanders can move back in 10 years."

Still, we're in good shape. The caps came out hard and used their size. Now we have to come out hard and use our speed. We've already seen that both teams can dominate, so it's a matter of execution. Also, I felt there was much more panic on the Isles' side tonight than game one. Lots of quick/sloppy clearing attempts and awful passes that the caps gobbled up.  We'll see which team shows up on Sunday. I've a feeling it'll be the team we saw in game 1."
NewYorkIslanders,32zmqe,snapfractalpop,9,Sat Apr 18 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"honestly, on paper, it looks bad. they blew another two goal lead. but, consider this:    the caps had their backs to the wall like never before, so some honest credit to them (lets not be foolish to think their efforts are irrelevant)    we blew the lead on some unfortunate events (a lousy penalty and broken sticks everywhere)    we were still in this to the very end, and now we have home ice advantage in a 5 game series.    we need to rest up, get our eat / rest cycle in order, and rock the motherfuckin barn for a showdown at high noon    no sleep till brooklyn. -peace"

NewYorkIslanders,32ys74,andyOrbit,2,Sat Apr 18 01:38:53 2015 UTC,Our d is too small. They were dominated in the corners
NewYorkIslanders,32ys74,IslesMetsJets44,2,Sat Apr 18 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"what a fucking wasted opportunity. some good and bad luck,  that goalie wasn't good. the 3 goals on 16 shots shows that. if we had gotten anywhere near or usual that game is ours.   credit to the caps.  happy to be leaving with the split, but also disappointed."
NewYorkIslanders,32ys74,Waldo19,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:43:09 2015 UTC,Caps deserve credit for this.  Knew they had to play desperate and they did.  Isles can learn a lot from this.  Did what they had to do in DC... now it's time to take care of business in Uniondale.
NewYorkIslanders,32ys74,mattymonkees,2,Sat Apr 18 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"fuck ill accept that we will drop some games but i wont accept that shitty level of effort. why is the d playing so fucking soft. why can't we slow down transitions, holy shit stop letting them walk in."
NewYorkIslanders,32ys74,isles27,2,Sat Apr 18 01:44:36 2015 UTC,they came out too hot and then dragged their ass. terrible passes and giveaways. they need to play the body more. caps are a physical team and isles need to shove it right back at them.

NewYorkIslanders,32zuhy,ZoraHockey,4,Sat Apr 18 03:14:17 2015 UTC,ko admits he is a notoriously slow at getting himself going. grabovski has been participating in some form of team activities for well over a week now and he fills the exact need we have.  what better spot to assimilate back into the lineup than on the third line? he is never coming back in like ko did and getting an instant 18+ mins a night. he will come back to 12ish minutes like any player should. even pre injury he rarely eclipsed 15min. the circumstances revolving th return of ko and grabovski are entirely different.
NewYorkIslanders,32zuhy,isles27,-2,Sat Apr 18 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"True, but it doesn't change the fact that someone comes back from being out for so long to suddenly being ready for playoff hockey just because of some practice time. (Unless you are someone like Kane.. Which Grabo is not). I really think the best current solution is Kennedy in for Grabner"
NewYorkIslanders,32zuhy,isles27,4,Sat Apr 18 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"but then when does grabo get an opportunity to get into playing form if we follow that path? do we leave him out for the remainder of playoffs out of fear that he isn't in live form? the games don't get easier.   at some point you'd have to say he has practiced x amount lets get him out there and see what he can do, and i believe that point should be asap. without a doubt he is our best option, if it proves too difficult for him then we default to kennedy the game after. it isn't as if the third line could produce any less."
NewYorkIslanders,32zuhy,ArtyThePoopie,0,Sat Apr 18 03:55:18 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point, about when do we get him in. But with a lot on the line, do we go with the question mark in Grabo or the experienced guy where we know what we're getting with Kennedy? The issue with putting Grabo in, if he's struggling to get to pace, he might be more of a handicap than a help. Could lead to throwing away a game and no opportunity to get to those later, more challenging games.   Overall I just wish he never got hurt and this wasn't an issue :("
NewYorkIslanders,32zuhy,lighthousefisherman,4,Sat Apr 18 04:44:53 2015 UTC,if or when grabovski comes back i pray to god he's not on the ice with orpik  if there's one guy on the caps' roster that i fear would injure one of our players it's that shithead

NewYorkIslanders,32xux2,ZoraHockey,4,Fri Apr 17 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"If he's offering them for a decent amount cheaper than similar seats on stubhub then that's what would be a red flag for me.   Also take this as you may but I've never seen a ticket say ""ADULT"" on it.   Also, ""upper level 214"" makes NO fucking sense for the barn."
NewYorkIslanders,32xux2,seannymo,4,Fri Apr 17 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"Here's some info that might help.  Playoff tickets for my season ticket seats look like this.  I also purchased additional tickets and they came in PDF form from TicketMaster.com.  So the tickets in your image are not either of those.  I did have my tickets printed at the box office a few times this past season and the printouts don't look like your image either. From what I remember the box office printouts have an all white background with blue text and borders.  I'm not saying the tickets in your image are definite fakes but I haven't seen tickets that look like that all season.  Also, it looks like they were purchased on February 23rd. I received the invoice for playoff tickets on March 13th so not sure how they were able to purchase in advance of everyone else."

They are good at printing fakes please save yourself the hassle."
NewYorkIslanders,32xux2,DGGuitars,3,Fri Apr 17 19:30:00 2015 UTC,It also says the date of purchase was February 23rd which is way too early in the season.  I would err on the side of caution and say no.. This is playoff tickets we're talking about so it's not the time to take the risk and lose out on that money.
NewYorkIslanders,32xux2,NHL_nutjob_19,2,Fri Apr 17 19:36:37 2015 UTC,There's no gate number. Every ticket that I've ever seen for the Coliseum has a gate number.

NewYorkIslanders,32xux2,fabutzio,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:50:56 2015 UTC,ticketmaster tickets do not burn like regular paper. take the receipt ticket and put a flame to the bottom of it. the burn mark should start to appear on the opposite side of the paper first. the tickets should only leave a burn mark and not catch on fire (at least right away like paper would). try it on an old stub.  additionally only accept payment through something like paypal. if he asks you to send it via 'friends and family' to avoid fees tell him you will add 3% of ticket price to his asking price and send it as regular payment. this way you keep paypal guarantee (not offered amongst friends) and he gets asking price he was asking for.  link with info on burn test: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./gdead/faq/fake-tickets.html

NewYorkIslanders,32xdv2,macoun2002,6,Fri Apr 17 14:38:00 2015 UTC,"interesting. on paper holtby not being able to go would be a big boost, and while i don't wish for the other teams players to be hurt or sick, if grubauer is in net we need to take advantage and do everything possible to make him feel uncomfortable.   i don't think the islanders have really taken advantage of backup goaltenders all that much this year.  thinking about the vancouver game in particular (although eddy lack is now starting so maybe thats a little excusable).   it will be interesting to see how this plays out. #nocaps"
NewYorkIslanders,32xdv2,Waldo19,4,Fri Apr 17 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"holtby played pretty poorly game 1, but has certainly been unbeatable in the past."
NewYorkIslanders,32xdv2,Waldo19,3,Fri Apr 17 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"yeah i think him not starting would still be considered an advantage, at least until the puck drops.  nhl is crazy and almost any goalie has the potential to stand on their head on any given night, the best ones just do it more regularly."
NewYorkIslanders,32xdv2,kyleb23,3,Fri Apr 17 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"i don't know about that. holtby has played 74 of 83 games for the caps, so fatigue has to be hitting him. and facing a goalie in his first playoff appearance could be a wild card (see darling, scott).   also, i've heard reports of his teammates expecting him to start, so it'll be an interesting storyline to watch the next few hours. #nocaps #LGI"
NewYorkIslanders,32xdv2,RIPwhalers,3,Fri Apr 17 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"even holtby playing but under the weather is an advantage on paper. i just hope this isn't an m.j. with the flu deal where he is sick but plays like a monster. ive seen the isles on the wrong side of to many hero stories this year (that minn wild come back after the injury, etc  probably not even gonna talk about it in the dressing room other than telling the boys to keep the pressure on"

That's just all the more reason to take this place over and show this city what the islanders fans are all about. wednesday night's attendance was a great indication of the fanbase we have on the ues and I think tonight we'll see even more faces come out to support the team.   2) there's been a lot of discussion about the overlook bar in midtown. my response is, why not embrace both options? i'm happy to keep the overlook bar in consideration if we hear reports after tonight that the place is absolutely off the hook. But for the time being I'm content with staying local and carving out a go-to Isles hangout on the ues. but please, let's take over the overlook too!  3) if we consistently let our voices be heard and provide jack russell's with our business, there's no reason why we can't work something out with the owners/bartender to provide the same level of hospitality that the overlook bar would. if they say no, then we can suggest that we're taking all of our business to the overlook (gotta love leverage).  anyway, hope to see some new faces tonight and thanks nycgillian for putting this post together! lgi!"

NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,h0rst87,2,Thu Apr 16 16:48:57 2015 UTC,so they took the pic off the instagram?

NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,celtish,0,Thu Apr 16 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"nice. are all 3 jerseys aliexpress specials? i mean, its entirely possible you bought a legit jersey and then had someone sew on the name so it isn't garbage ironed like at the team store. did you notice a difference in your jersey from the authentic? I have an aliexpress okposo, the thing looks amazing, the only way you can tell the difference was the smell after being delivered via china post boat, and the name was actually stitched. #nocaps"

NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,Musclesjones,2,Thu Apr 16 18:50:58 2015 UTC,I'll never understand how they were able to tell those look amazing! The fact that they deleted the picture and the tweet is a dick move IMO but whatever it's still a sweet ass picture. I actually made the live feed on snapchat for the playoffs because they gave me a caps rally towel anyway even with my isles jersey on but it just dropped from the story after a while. People tweeted at me saying they saw me so I have that to vouch for me haha
NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,ls1allday,2,Thu Apr 16 17:00:39 2015 UTC,How can you tell these are fake
NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,xchester77,4,Thu Apr 16 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"very easy to spot a fake 3rd. look at the numbers, the real ones use numbers that are long and skinny, quite different from the style used on our reg home/away. the fakes use a number more like that on our home/away. the crest which obviously you can't see in the picture, isn't ""chrome"" like it's supposed to be, it's white."
NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,kyleT_NYC,2,Thu Apr 16 17:24:14 2015 UTC,the knockoffs also use a different sting for the tie-up.
NewYorkIslanders,32tdua,ArtyThePoopie,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"If you look at the bottom of the jersey, the fakes have a thick white line and the real deal is thinner and makes a v cut on the sides"

NewYorkIslanders,32spjs,johnzanussi,2,Thu Apr 16 20:37:13 2015 UTC,Throughout the summer they usually have at least a few players do signings at the Coliseum team store that anyone can go to.  That's how I got my JT jersey signed by Martin and Nelson (I had nothing else to sign so I just went with that haha).  They say only the first 150 people are guaranteed a signing but tbh if you get online at a reasonable time you'll get a signature

NewYorkIslanders,32rox8,dabohr,2,Thu Apr 16 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"i love martin. i know it's way too early to discuss this but for curiosity sake, how much do you think he's worth when he's a ufa in 2016? he's only cost $1m a year aav. he's the league-leading hitter and our best enforcer. and he's willing to put his body on the line as we saw last night. guy loves being an islander. he's worth so much more. thoughts?  nocaps"
NewYorkIslanders,32rox8,DLun203,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:21:04 2015 UTC,i am a big martin fan and i have his jersey signed and everything but..... you probably don't want the real answer to this question.  martins relative value to our organization will continue to drop if our forward depths pans out as expected. dal colle and ho-sang are going to need roster spots. if collberg gets bigger he has undeniable skill and he may command a roster spot as well.
NewYorkIslanders,32rox8,isles27,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:44:48 2015 UTC,It breaks my heart but it's true. I want martin to develop his stick handling a little more in the off-season. He's someone I'd hate to see go.   Ho-Sang better work out. I hear he's a cancer in the locker room. If that's the case I'd say trade him before he adds unnecessary drama off the ice.

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,ryan924,3,Wed Apr 15 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, my kid has a concert tonight.  On a scale of 1-10, how bad is it if I watch the game on my phone with no sound?  Let's go Islanders!!!"
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Eiramasil919,2,Wed Apr 15 21:39:45 2015 UTC,How are you watching it? All I have is the radio stream on the Isles app.
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,FogItNozzel,2,Wed Apr 15 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"I was trying to get ragecenter to work but it didn't.  I'm home now, short concert."
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Eiramasil919,2,Thu Apr 16 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"I pulled out my laptop and im on a tbs stream. But the commentary sucks, so I have Radio Hofstra on for audio"
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,FogItNozzel,3,Thu Apr 16 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"They say we play loose as a negative, but when we are really loose the pace is too insane for the 'elites' to keep up with. Play tight, lose slowly. Come out swinging boys."

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,TranceState,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:49:28 2015 UTC,Its like Hockey PTSD. Every-time the clock hits the 1 min to go mark I start feeling panicked.
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Waldo19,3,Wed Apr 15 23:50:41 2015 UTC,Same old Islanders. Will they ever not give up a momentum killing goal with minute left off of an unforced error.
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,RIPwhalers,3,Thu Apr 16 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"At what point do the guys in locker room say ""fuck this...we are going to own the last minute"" every game we spoil a good period with a weak goal in the last minute.   It's the fucking playoffs. Come the fuck on."
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,clarkbrain1,3,Wed Apr 15 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Gotta start the period like we did the first one, and finish it like that for once.   Let's go Islanders!!"

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Waldo19,3,Thu Apr 16 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"I tell you what, this has been a great game looking at it neutrally for a moment.  a lot of speed, a lot of forechecking, a lot of hitting. This has the potential to be a sick series."
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,islander1,3,Thu Apr 16 00:52:35 2015 UTC,New York Islanders ‏@NYIslanders  14m14 minutes ago Jason Chimera is called two minutes for roughing after the period ends. The #Isles will begin the 3rd on the power play.

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,nothing_cleverr,3,Thu Apr 16 01:08:47 2015 UTC,So one worry I have is that Washington is capable of getting to a pens level of agitation and hurt someone. Especially with the refs calling it playoffs style. Hopefully we keep hitting back
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,islesrule224,3,Thu Apr 16 01:14:37 2015 UTC,bullshit call

We could easily drop the first two games here and from then, its over before we even get to Nassau. That CBJ game Saturday night fucked me up. I couldn't even stomach seeing Islanders news since then. But hey, fuck it! LET'S GO ISLANDERS!!!"

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,downtownflipped,2,Wed Apr 15 23:38:06 2015 UTC,Idk what bothers me more. Another goal in under a minute left or the HD channel jumping and freezing every 10 seconds
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,andyOrbit,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:48:52 2015 UTC,Fios? Same problem here. Switched to Direct TV USA feed.
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Waldo19,2,Wed Apr 15 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was a vintage 2015 goal against. Halak poorly plays the puck, and they score with less than a minute left in the period"
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Azabuplace,2,Wed Apr 15 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"Caps look like garbage, soooo let's give em a goal."
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Ummagummas,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:50:24 2015 UTC,We have been giving so much help to other teams its amazing.  Can't expect the Caps to to return the favor.
NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,Waldo19,2,Wed Apr 15 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, we will not win the cup with those kinds of mistakes.  Positive: we outplayed them in the first period. Good start for the team. Many more periods remain.....we can beat the Caps!"

NewYorkIslanders,32q8hp,nickban,2,Thu Apr 16 01:46:10 2015 UTC,Caps don't have the depth. Holtby isn't going to have the juice to make it through the series.  Fourth line is back together. We got JT and Strome and Neilsen again. deHaan is back.  Wait it's on USA? Well fuck.

NewYorkIslanders,32rn3b,zeile33,5,Thu Apr 16 03:53:26 2015 UTC,meaning that the capitals will now have to win a game at the coliseum in order to win the series.
NewYorkIslanders,32rn3b,Pepperpwni,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:15:40 2015 UTC,so odd that i've never heard that before.  makes sense i guess but not like we get game 7 at home!  edit: no caps
NewYorkIslanders,32rn3b,_stee,4,Thu Apr 16 11:06:11 2015 UTC,"If washington won every home game, they would have won the series. Now that we won a road game, if we win all of our home games, we win the series"
NewYorkIslanders,32rn3b,HypertextMakeoutLang,5,Thu Apr 16 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"So think of it this way: We are up 1-0 right now. We play the caps again in Washington next game. The worst case scenario is that we lose and the series is tied 1-1. 3 of the next 5 games after that are played at Nassau Coliseum, so its eseentially like a best of 5 series where we have the advantage"
NewYorkIslanders,32rn3b,viewless25,3,Thu Apr 16 12:01:26 2015 UTC,"The order is as follows from the start:  WAS home  WAS home  NYI home  NYI home  WAS home  NYI home  WAS home  so we already won the first game, so if we lose friday, we'll have home ice advantage for a best 3 of 5 games of the series, and if we win, we have that plus a two goal lead in the series."

NewYorkIslanders,32r9i6,seannymo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:13:13 2015 UTC,Just swing the t shirt like a towel. I know that's what I'd do.

NewYorkIslanders,32rl64,Rob_G,4,Thu Apr 16 03:35:27 2015 UTC,Won't be relevant unless the Isles and Rags win their first playoff series.

NewYorkIslanders,32pxoq,laxwkbrdr2,4,Wed Apr 15 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"that might be because last time we played down there, me and a group of about 21 other isles fans came down from NY and all had seats together, which was about 1 row over from another group of 8 or so isles fans. we just about joined forces, and there was a decent showing elsewhere in the building, so we actually had some really solid isles chanting throughout. as caps fans pointed out, isles chanting was audible on TV which rules.   hafta say, the caps fans were surprisingly amicable, and they handled our albeit-lighthearted chanting well. no real personal fighting broke out except one sour caps fan towards the end of the game that started bragging that they were winning (we scored like a minute later with a min left in the game so he shut up, although we lost in OT. didnt hear from him after that though, luckily)"
NewYorkIslanders,32pxoq,purplehumpbackwhale,3,Wed Apr 15 19:52:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I was one of the other group of 8 there and definitely enjoyed the solid chants!

NewYorkIslanders,32pxoq,purplehumpbackwhale,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"From reading their thread, I would say that if the isles can come out strong and get a win tonight it would break their fan base down hard and give us excellent momentum going into Friday then back home!"

They have one chant that is prime to hijack because their fans don't know it but it is the same as our Let's Go Isl-an-ders chant! Most of their fans only know the three horn then Let's Go Caps chant!
NewYorkIslanders,32qa02,laxwkbrdr2,2,Wed Apr 15 21:29:13 2015 UTC,I was in 425 not far away! I was very impressed with the Isles turnout at the game tonight. I even had a caps fan sitting behind me ask about the YES chant (he was genuinely curious and actually not trying to make fun of us haha).  I had a great time!
NewYorkIslanders,32qa02,laxwkbrdr2,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:11:10 2015 UTC,I thought it was a great game!  I definitely enjoyed the chants coming from 422/423! I know the caps fans nearby were definitely done with playoffs abs ready for the baseball season!
NewYorkIslanders,32qa02,karmapuhlease,2,Thu Apr 16 03:22:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw them the whole time it was a good time! I was just getting random high fives and cheers from all these fellow fans and it was just great! The YES chants had momentum too and I only paid 40 bucks for my ticket!

They're technically a Rangers bar so I'm not sure we'll get sound but they have plenty of TV's and they've always been accommodating of my Isles and Habs viewing requests one way or another.   EDIT: In other words, you're welcome to join, or I can let you know what the situation is like tonight and if I think it would be a good place to try again for Friday!"
NewYorkIslanders,32pv6x,kyleokok,3,Wed Apr 15 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"In case anyone's curious, Jack Russell's is playing audio for the game and there's about 7 of us in here making some noise for our boys."

Bottom line is there's enough bars on the UES that are hungry for business.  If we can get 15 or so people to show up to one, they'll accommodate whatever we want eventually.  There's no shortage of Isles fans in the city, just a lack of cohesion"
NewYorkIslanders,32pv6x,kyleokok,2,Wed Apr 15 20:31:11 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more on your last point. I'll be dressed in plain sight as I want to test the waters before I don my Okposo jersey.

But I have all the faith in the world in this team.   In 2013 we were serious underdogs, an 8 seed vs the 1 seed Penguins. We took them to 6 games and held our own with Nabokov in goal and without the defensive weapons we have today.  We know we're absolutely capable of taking the Caps. Just need to wake up. This is when we wake up."

So for ~$80 you could snag tickets, an afternoon bus down and the midnight bus back to NY!   Let's show DC what true fans are like! I loved it at the last game in the Verizon Center when we hijacked their chant and outcheered them with Let's Go Islanders!"
NewYorkIslanders,32kou9,laxwkbrdr2,4,Tue Apr 14 18:34:01 2015 UTC,"Let's show DC what true fans are like!    You're off to a bad start buddy.  Washington DC Fans have gone 24 years in four sports without a championship (have only made it as far as the semi finals once in fact) and still show up every night.  Think about who you're doubting on before you call anyone less than a ""true fan""."
NewYorkIslanders,32kou9,Rudacris,0,Wed Apr 15 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"I've lived in DC and gone to plenty of Caps games over the past few years. I'm not doubting that there are some die hard hockey fans, but by and large DC has the same bandwagon fans that launch themselves  behind any team that looks promising for the moment, and then dump that same team the second the momentum changes. The same people who bought their first wizards t-shirt last Spring and were blasting the world with #DC Rising will show up again, but it may take a game or two before they realize that the NHL playoffs have started and the Caps are in. There's a reason you can go to a Caps game and sit in the Acela club Level for $20 if the Caps have lost 2 games in a row, but have to pay $70 the next week after they have won 2.  There is something to be said when your playoff tickets are going below face value.    I have to say the best fan base right now, in the NHL, is Winnipeg, you cannot get playoff tickets for their game.  I believe they sold out all homegames in <5 minutes and only have 9 tickets on stubhub all in the last row and all going for over $600.  I would love to live in an area with that type of devotion."
NewYorkIslanders,32kou9,dukedog,2,Wed Apr 15 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"Winnipeg is a town with one sports team that has qualified for the playoffs for the first time since their team left two decades ago.  What a completely fucking lopsided apples to oranges comparison.  Even without that I'm sure their tickets would sell for more but I'm not sure how that's a measure of a good fan base.  To be honest with you the TV experience compared with how awful it is to get to a weeknight game in Chinatown does keep a lot of our fan base away from weeknight games, which I don't get but go to any bar in Northern Virginia on a game night and you'll see our fan base is a lot more than just the phone booth.  Either way, I'm flying in from California to go to the game on Friday so forgive me if I take offense to your statement."
NewYorkIslanders,32kou9,laxwkbrdr2,2,Wed Apr 15 01:19:38 2015 UTC,"The thing about DC is that there are a lot of transplants who end up moving there for jobs. They bring their former team allegiances with them, and if they have kids, they raise them as fans of that team. I don't have the statistics handy but based on my experiences living in DC, I'd wager that most people who move to the area are from the Northeast.  It's only been in the last 2 decades that the DC area has exploded in population like it has, so the organic Caps fans are going to be harder to find compared to a metro area that doesn't have as significant a transient population. The Redskins have a large fanbase because pretty much all of Virginia and parts of NC, WV, and MD have a significant number of fans in them.  Unless you live near a metro line, or work in the city, getting to the game on a Wednesday night can be a nightmare due to the traffic. If you are a fan of the Caps and don't live in DC (like Richmond, Charlottesville, or Virginia Beach), it's pretty much impossible to get to a weekday game unless you take off work that day.   The bandwagoners who happen to follow the Caps part-time is the product of people who moved to the DC metro from some other part of the country and weren't raised in the area."

If he's not on crutches I have a hard time believing he has any torn ligaments. But a sprained knee can be quite painful. I hope he's back in time for games 3 or 4  Edit: slow motion

Over the final six games we've seen flashes of that form.   Zero expectations from the rest of the league. I love it.  People are predicting an easy series for the Capitals.

(Another reason I hate the shootout, a win is either a win or it's not.)  The picks I've seen treat the Isles like they sneaked in with 87 points or something and the Caps are this team on an unstoppable roll that we can't compete with.     For me, it's simple.  If Halak plays well, we stay off the PK, and Capuano resists the urge to play our scrubs like McDonald and Strait in place of more talented players, we win."

Pretty sure they could have pushed him to return saturday, but decided to give him the few extra days, IMO.

NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,ArtyThePoopie,7,Sun Apr 12 23:53:34 2015 UTC,Pulock should've been called up ages ago.
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,mattymonkees,2,Mon Apr 13 00:52:47 2015 UTC,He not very good defensively from what I've heard. Reinhart is more what we need.
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,eggy333,0,Mon Apr 13 10:40:28 2015 UTC,Who are you talking to?
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,Clown_Shoe,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:12:11 2015 UTC,"3 games left for AHL I think. We might see a Pulock call up, maybe not with Donovan here though"
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,ZoraHockey,6,Sun Apr 12 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"Guys, there is probably zero percent chance he plays.  He's probably up here to be around the team during the playoffs, get some experience.  If Hamonic is out, Dehaan, Strait, or even Donovan would get the nod first."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,cjm427,3,Mon Apr 13 01:17:46 2015 UTC,You make a sound logical argument. The only fault with this is that Capuano does not adhere to those same standards.
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,_jared,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"""This makes too much sense, how can I fuck this up."""
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,PeterBarker,3,Mon Apr 13 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"I think this could be a sign of hamonic not coming back, the team wanting size in playoffs, or both. Don't forget in playoff time we can call up as many players as we want. Maybe they just want him a round to practice with/ let him see what a playoff experience is like.  I also see this turning into a huge controversy. If Cappy decided to put reinhart in over dehaan then we have a nino situation with both donovan and dehaan."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,leeber27,2,Mon Apr 13 03:19:25 2015 UTC,He should play alongside de Haan in place of Strait if Hamonic is hurt.
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,mattymonkees,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:15:36 2015 UTC,"He should, I'm sure that's what everyone would want. Will he? Probably not, knowing how much of a hard on capuano has for strait."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,leeber27,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"The one virtue of Strait is that he is something like the second-best penalty-killing defenseman on the team.  Doesn't mean he should be playing, but against a team with a strong power play, he'll at least be a net positive in that regard."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,mattymonkees,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:58:32 2015 UTC,"I feel his numbers are very skewed because of the amount of ice time given. Lately the PK has been very good, but it's hard to credit it to him alone."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,leeber27,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"The numbers on him are pretty good, though.  He has definitely helped the PK.  So has the return of Grabner.  Somebody made a good point to me recently that off eye test alone, Strait may be better equipped to handle the Caps series anyway because he is big and the Caps are a larger team.  That theory sort of makes sense.  The same person was worried about how Hickey/Vis would hold up."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,mattymonkees,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:22:46 2015 UTC,"I think the recent success can be accredited to Grabner, not strait. We've had strait in the lineup since the all star break and back then the PK was bad. Only recently (past month maybe) the PK has been killing it. Not coincidentally, that's when Grabner has been making appearances.  As for his size, he's nothing spectacular compared to the rest of the defense (aside from hickey and viz like you mentioned). I'm not sure if that's enough to have him earn a spot over dehaan.   I'm not sure where you're going with this, but if this is turning into a ""hump brain strait"" series of replies consider me done cause there is no point in discussing with someone who thinks on the same level as capuano."
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,leeber27,3,Mon Apr 13 16:42:15 2015 UTC,.....Any news on Hamonic yet?
NewYorkIslanders,32duyg,chiaestevez,3,Mon Apr 13 01:27:14 2015 UTC,"Someone has to take Hamonic's place in practice drills. Defensemen on the roster have their own things to work on, so they'll call up players to fill spots even if they're not going to be on the roster."

Especially game 1, few coaches are going to an untested rookie Dman if he still has 6 healthy D (7 with Donovan) unless Cappy is dead convinced he needs another big-body D. But, against a HEAVY Caps team, wouldn't be surprised if you see him in there if Game 1 goes sour."

NewYorkIslanders,32dxqk,mattymonkees,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:33:56 2015 UTC,that's correct.  you'd win $18 for every $1 you put on the table.
NewYorkIslanders,32dxqk,tanu24,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:03:37 2015 UTC,Winnipeg at 25:1 is a fantastic bet.  Blues and Blackhawks should be the prohibitive betting favorites.  Way too much stock into a month and a half of hockey.  Ottawa has no business at 16:1.

While a long walk from the Barclays I had an awesome time watching a game back in December at the The Black Swan in Bed Stuy.   The team is coming to Brooklyn so if its an establishment in Brooklyn, I can't imagine why they would be unwilling to show it.  Making a true Islanders bar in Brooklyn is just going to come down to Islanders fans routinely going to an establishment and making it an Islanders Bar. I don't expect any owner to set out with the goal of making one. But if your a regular and you pay good money,.."
NewYorkIslanders,32dp2t,Musclesjones,3,Mon Apr 13 02:54:25 2015 UTC,Brooklyn has lots a cool spots. Just don't know of any near Barclays
NewYorkIslanders,32dp2t,jackwoww,3,Mon Apr 13 03:45:40 2015 UTC,If that's what you think you clearly don't know what you're talking about.  Woodwork on Vanderbilt and Dean is a great sports bar and the owner makes sure you leave drunk.

NewYorkIslanders,32dp2t,jackwoww,3,Mon Apr 13 18:00:02 2015 UTC,They'll probably change their tune about the audio if a good amount of Isles fans show up and demand it.  There's also a pool hall/sports bar on Flatbush and 7th Avenue.

Likely won't be able to have a real dedicated NYC bar until the team actually starts in BK next season and the area around Barclay's gets flooded with Isles fans on gamedays.

NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,RIPwhalers,3,Sun Apr 12 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"You know who is in the playoffs? The New York Islanders! You know who's not? Last years Stanley cup winners and president trophy winners!  Teams with 95 and 96 points respectively didn't make the playoffs! That is insane. The Islanders survived one of the most brutal runs to the playoffs ever. Idk if the league has ever been this competitive. Even the tanking teams were winning games here and their. Like the Oilers beating the Kings or Philly beating the Pens and Isles.   The Islanders have shown they can hang with Washington, despite how good Ovi is. If we can just stay out of the box (hopefully don't see last nights refs) I like our chances.   It's a new season baby! Just gotta win one in Washington and suddenly we got home ice.   We don't have to play the Capitals the Captials have to play us!   lGI!"
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,RyPhy,3,Sun Apr 12 19:41:11 2015 UTC,Hell yeah dude....i'm feeling good about our chances.
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,Scapone22,5,Sun Apr 12 20:04:44 2015 UTC,I hate to be negative but it's all I know. I don't understand how to react when all of my early season fears become realized every damn season. Its difficult to trust this team with your heart as they will not handle it with care.
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,Scapone22,2,Sun Apr 12 08:38:36 2015 UTC,If you wanna be a pessimist go ahead but I don't see how that's fun at all.  I'm enjoying the shit out of this team and the fact that we are IN THE PLAYOFFS for like the 3rd time in 10 years. Why not be pumped up?
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,mc11050,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being a pessimist and being realistic.  This team is almost certainly not winning a cup.  Not for a couple of years or so realistically.    It is also very likely they don't make it out of round one.  It's a very even series and we've get less post season experience than most teams.    It's very possible, but I wouldn't put money on this team and that's just being realistic.  I'll be at games 3 and 4 screaming my head off but that's my heart, my brain knows this likely isn't the year.  Awesome progress though, really excited for the next few years!"
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,mgiblue21,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:57:17 2015 UTC,Well said and I 100% agree. I guess I just expected more enthusiasm from this sub. However I realize when I made this post we just blew another lead to lose home ice so not everyone was too happy. I was drunk and feeling pumped up tho hahah
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,mgiblue21,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  That last game really did a lot to sway my opinion.  If we held that original 3-1 lead and took home ice, I would give us the edge, but I really think it's THAT close of a series.   Not just home ice but also momentum took a huge hit in that game. It's good that Washington ended the season with a loss, but it was to the best and hottest team in the NHL (as much as that hurts to say).  Us losing to a non playoff team in Columbus (who was admittedly on fire) at home in the final regular season game at the coliseum, with home ice in our reach...really fuckin stings.  I think that mental blow is almost as important as home ice.  All that being said...Let's go islanders!! This is still a winable series, as winable ad I've seen since Toronto in 01-02, but even then we didnt have the core we have now."
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,RIPwhalers,2,Tue Apr 14 04:20:15 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you. Seeing all this negativity doesn't change anything. I was at the game last night and it was sad to lose the last regular season game but I was grateful for being in the playoffs. I feel like many people forget how much we've improved in only one year. The team is still very young and has a very bright future ahead of them for many years to come.
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,RyPhy,2,Sun Apr 12 13:17:04 2015 UTC,Some people choose to be miserable and are never satisfied.
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,lighthousefisherman,2,Sun Apr 12 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the last four weeks of the season? There is very, very little reason for optimism.   Hell, just look at last night. There were constantly Blue Jacket shooters wide open in our defensive zone. Now, imagine thats Ovechkin."
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,BroadwayJayEsq,4,Sun Apr 12 16:10:36 2015 UTC,We're in the fucking playoffs dude...
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,jeff25624,5,Sun Apr 12 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"And is that good enough for you? Because its not for me. This team was in 1st place for so long, and they have been on a major decline since the all-star break. If that doesn't worry you going into the playoffs, then I don't know what to say."
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,mcbordes,3,Sun Apr 12 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Were the Isles in the playoff last year? No. So yes, I am happy they made it. That is the first step to playoff success.  Am I as optimistic as in January, no but the Kings have shown you just gotta get in and then play your best.  The Islanders got in. Now hopefully we see their best. There have been glimmers of it over the last few games.  Given this teams young talent, missing the playoffs wouldn't be a good thing.  Boston is an old team and missing could be seen as a good thing because it will start the rebuild. Isles don't need a rebuild, our core roster is mostly set moving forward.  We need some experience.   We need to take this thing for a ride and see how she handles, not trade it in.   If they get bounced badly in the first round Cappy is gone (same as if we missed all together). So I'd rather watch at least 4 playoff games. If they win a round then they win a round and that's awesome."
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,mgiblue21,3,Sun Apr 12 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not good enough and of course it worries me...but we are a young team who are just getting their wings. we obviously have a lot of growing to do and growing pains are all part of it.  My point of this post isn't to say there aren't any concerns, the point is that i'm shocked that in this sub there seems to be a lot of people who aren't excited about being in the playoffs, just a lot of whining about how we stumbled into the playoffs. We did that last time too, and with some better goal tending we would've beat the Pens.  I'm being positive because the playoffs are a whole new animal and there is no reason not to be optimistic about our chances. We showed this season that we definitely can beat the Caps and we know we can beat the Rags/Pens if we get there, too.   Bottom line, no we aren't where we hoped we would be in the standings and i know this team has let us down before, but I just don't see the no need to dwell on our past shortcomings.   It would just be nice to see everyone excited for the playoffs. Advance or not, this season will be a big step forward for this young team trying to get better and keep it up for years to come."
NewYorkIslanders,32b6tp,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"This team showed potential to be a cup contender earlier in the year. Now I don't care how bad they were last year, you can't go one and done this year. They have looked better than a first round exit. It would be a failure. Winning a series is the accomplishment I want to see to know that the team really did take the step forward this year.   And as sad as it is I have no doubt in my mind that Ovechkin is going to kill us dead."

I've literally seen hundreds of games there from 5 years old to now. I just wanted to see them win. I'm pretty upset about the loss. The Isles moving is honestly like closing a book to me. Granted ik they're not moving far but not being in the backyard anymore...idk...I just wish the Coliseum had a proper send off. I grew up in that place. Know it like I know my own home. Especially to lose that way...just feels like the epitome of the Islanders...tasting it and having it ripped out of your mouth. Tbh I don't even think they make it past the Caps....we'll see I guess.   TL; DR: I'm sad."

And while I dont like Capuano at all, last nights goalie choice was a damned if you do, damned if you dont scenario. If he starts Halak, its ""oh he's tired, should have been the backup"" but if he runs Poulin out there people will say he didn't play for the home ice. I think he would have played Neuvirth there if he'd been healthy."

NewYorkIslanders,32aj7b,RyPhy,0,Sun Apr 12 14:04:40 2015 UTC,Fucking shit fuck goddamn cunts.   At least we don't have to do the skills comp in the playoffs
NewYorkIslanders,32aj7b,three_dee,0,Sun Apr 12 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"After they scored and Cappy put the 4th line and strait on I knew they were scoring again. Why has this amateur coach been given the opportunity to be the brain in this organization, it seems he's lacking one of his own.  Capitals in 6. Sorry, I have no faith in this team. 6 wins in a month and a half with playoffs closing in and home ice within grasp. Countless blown leads with defensive mishaps and failed clears or weak goals. They play with zero urgency, occasionally for minutes on end they just stop skating and continue to lose puck battles and races to loose pucks in their own end. When Howie and Butch talk about the team's mental fortitude, I wonder that maybe they are a little too secure with not playing their best and not winning all the time. And just in case you were wondering about the blown leads, the caps are in fact the best team in the NHL at over coming 2 goal leads.   Our special teams are not going to be good enough to give us the advantage over the caps. No Hamonic for game 1 so that means Strait will be guarding Ovechkin on the PK second unit. Fucking great.  The only way I see us winning is if Halak plays unbelievably well, and holtby shits the bed. If they return to the islanders we saw in November December and early January we could beat anyone.  I hope I'm wrong with my prediction, but if I'm not, hopefully it means the end of this whole coaching staff's tenure. I seriously think this team would be a cup contender if we had Trotz or AV or any coach that really has a clue and has had playoff success.  The good news is,this isn't the end for the islanders. We have a very bright future no matter what happens and although I will miss the coliseum, the place does not give me that feel of ""Stanley Cup Winning arena"" like MSG or other big name modern Venues like Barclays center. It's hard not to believe that this team isn't cursed and I think moving well help them shake off the losing culture. Nothing goes right for this team ever, we all know it. JT and Jamie Benn know it.   Goodbye Coliseum, I'm going to miss your atmosphere and your Sounds, sight lines, all of it. Doing the Yes Chant was kind of unreal. I know Brooklyn will never match that intensity and that makes me upset."
NewYorkIslanders,32aj7b,Get_Suga_Tenshou,3,Sun Apr 12 02:05:00 2015 UTC,I know Brooklyn will never match that intensity and that makes me upset.   Why won't they match that intensity?  People in Brooklyn can't chant?  Maybe if there was a little more intensity about hockey in Long Island... they wouldn't be moving out of Long Island.
NewYorkIslanders,32aj7b,bass_n_treble,-1,Sun Apr 12 07:42:43 2015 UTC,Cap is a good coach with a young team but they are past that point we need another coach that can give them that killer instinct to close games out strong. You can tell when they get that 2 goal lead they start skating carefree and turnover the puck they get complacent. Is it just me or do we get fucked over constantly by the zebras? Lol
NewYorkIslanders,32aj7b,three_dee,2,Sun Apr 12 17:15:44 2015 UTC,Cap is a good coach   What game were you watching today?

But this was supposed to be a send off for the majority of us who can't go see playoff games. This was a big deal and it ended on a sour note. Fans are allowed to be a little bitter. I clearly can't speak for you but as someone who has been going to the colliseum for over 20 years, and grew up in those seats, I was a little sad to have the last regular season game end in a loss. Im not saying this team is dead or we can't make a deep playoff run or anything like that. I'm just saying that maybe in this one circumstance, we can be upset with the outcome of a game."

NewYorkIslanders,32anhf,leeber27,0,Sun Apr 12 02:40:30 2015 UTC,They really forced that assist on him at then end. Really? secondary assist? That's just a big FU to JT.
NewYorkIslanders,32anhf,RyPhy,-1,Sun Apr 12 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"All the blown three goal leads, almost choking out of the playoffs while your biggest rival takes the presidents trophy, the Schenn 2 second goal, losing home ice in a Shootout that was one save away from being ours, and now this. These are only from this season but stuff like this has been happening for years to this team. Any dash of hope gets destroyed in the worst way possible. And although winning this trophy means nothing, I'd like to use it as an example of this teams excellent Fortune. I really don't want to hear any of you calling realists ""downers""next year like we've been seeing this season. You should know by now this franchise will never have luck or predictability in its favor. It is ok to worry or vent when they show any kind of weakness.  We are the opposites of the Rangers, they consistently have a goalie who bails THEM out, a great coaching staff..... And luck. None of which the islanders have had in decades. But for some reason I still like this team more than the shitheads in Manhattan. Speaks volumes doesn't it? Maybe I'm just crazy. Crazy enough to shrug this art ross loss off because I predicted it. ""Watch Benn win the trophy with just seconds left"" I said with 5 minutes left in the Stars game. But Jamie can go take his Trophy out to the 18 holes because I know he wishes he still had unplayed games remaining. He's a great player, but its not difficult to feed one guy the puck when the pressure to win is extinguished and you're only looking to pad your captains stats."

He did it in within 7 years of the birth of the club. He went on to win an amazing 1500 games. Billy Harris was a fine player (yes Im old enough to remember him) and perhaps should have some recognition as well, but when you talk about the glory days he isnt going to be one of the first names out of your mouth. I thought it was awesome bringing out the Arbours for the puck drop. Just imagine the feelings Al got when he watched his family drop the puck at the final regular season game in his honor. It made me very, very happy that somewhere in Florida, our coach was on cloud 9.   When people ask me who my favorite Islander is, it will always be Al."

NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,jokesonjokes,-2,Sun Apr 12 02:00:06 2015 UTC,Who else do you put out there?
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,IslesMetsJets44,7,Sun Apr 12 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"Cizikas, strome?"
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,Clown_Shoe,2,Sun Apr 12 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"Why them over clutterbuck? Didn't clutterbuck score on a breakaway against Detroit? Strome is a playmaker not a goal scorer, Casey has 9 goals this year."
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,IslesMetsJets44,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:03:57 2015 UTC,Casey has 9 goals how many does Cal have? Cizikas literally scored on a breakaway last game and you bring up Cals goal from however long ago
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,Clown_Shoe,2,Sun Apr 12 02:20:23 2015 UTC,"If clutterbuck scored then it's not even a question, and if he puts in Casey and he doesn't score, people like you start arguing the same point.  We blew a 2 goal lead and a 1 goal lead with home ice on the line, that's the issue. Except everyone wants to focus on the skills competition  line up. If Jaro makes 1 save, we're not even having this conversation, and I'm not even mad at him. After JT and OK, we have no other stand out goal scorers."
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,IslesMetsJets44,0,Sun Apr 12 02:24:05 2015 UTC,No I could at least understand other decisions. He didn't score though did he. So if a manager makes a bad decision that doesn't work he deserves the criticism. Cal and bpulton would be bottom 2 of my list for the shootout as far as forwards go.  Halak sucked but what does that have to do with this decision. You are changing the subject because you know your point is stupid.
NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,Clown_Shoe,3,Sun Apr 12 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Strome, Nelson, even Bailey. Not the guy with 7 goals. And I love Clutter but c'mon man."

NewYorkIslanders,329mr1,hockeycrazy033,5,Sun Apr 12 02:06:30 2015 UTC,We blew another two goal lead against a non playoff team. Capuano needs to go. We shouldn't have even gone to the OT.

The Pens collapse had more to do with the Islanders getting Washington in the first round than the Islanders slide (unless you think the Islanders could have realistically kept pace with the Rags).  Given the choice between the Caps, Habs and Rags, I'll take the Caps in the first round thank you very much.  Did everyone forget that the Caps didn't make the playoffs last year either?  I said it before and I'll say it again.  We don't have to play the Caps. The Caps have to play us.  LGI."

NewYorkIslanders,32atc0,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:36:06 2015 UTC,"Even though Capuano is far from an ideal head coach, his team made it to the playoffs, which means his job will most likely be secure. As shitty as that is, it's most likely the reality."
NewYorkIslanders,32atc0,mattymonkees,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:12:39 2015 UTC,"Capuano is not good.  Let me make that clear off the top.  That being sad, if you're looking for an explanation about March/April, here it is:   Injury.  When Okposo came back, he was a complete liability for 15 games, and it fucked up line chemistry (players commented on this in the post game).  Various nicks and bangs kept out several other players, including Visnovsky, Nielsen, Martin, Clutterbuck, Cizikas, Boychuk, Leddy, and now Hamonic.  This led to line and D shufflings, plus a lot of ice time for Brian Strait, who we all know is not an asset in the long run. Bad luck.  Willhoft proved this statistically when he cited their 96 PDO in March, by far the lowest in the NHL.  This reflects that they ran into goalies on major hot streaks (Talbot, Dubnyk, Hammond, etc.).  It also reflects bad bounces like the Dubinsky goal last night and the goals in the previous Columbus game. After effects of a condensed schedule.  The Isles had a brutal February and early March in which they played more games than almost every other NHL team.  That eased up in mid March but coincided with several injuries.   This is not to vindicate Capuano as a great coach.  His roster decisions and line matchups are still super retarded.  Where he shines is getting consistent effort out of the club and keeping their collective ear.  You have to hope that this is enough for the Isles to perform well in the postseason."

I know they won't play there anymore but my mind and body won't accept the fact that there gone once the playoffs are done. It deeply saddens me and now I'm clinching on a prayer that one day they will return. And even by some miracle they do return, it won't be the same old barn. Man I don't know, very few times I felt surrealness and this probably one of the biggest one I will ever feel."

Just go to a playoff game if you want to go to the coliseum one more time that badly.  Get this person out of your life if possible.  Trust me.

NewYorkIslanders,325pgj,jokesonjokes,4,Fri Apr 10 20:14:09 2015 UTC,I feel everyone who think that less fans will appear are delusional. There are SO many Isles fans in the city there will be no issue filling the place up I went to the pre season barclays game the place was nearly full tons of Isles fans. hell after the pledge someone screamed RANGERS SUCK. Yeah not the at home feeling like the Coliseum but it will be a good fit. Nassau just could not hold the team to a quality standard.
NewYorkIslanders,325pgj,DGGuitars,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"What I think the issue is, is that with the islanders majority fan base being super-regional the real nearby local fans are like ""this is our team, they can't sell out and go corporate in Brooklyn"". Barclays center and the co-branding they'll share with the nets will do wonders for this team. The nets were irrelevant in NJ (I know that for a fact, I'm a lifelong jersey boy). When they moved to Brooklyn, I couldn't go anywhere without seeing at least five people in Brooklyn Nets gear in New Jersey. Hopefully the same thing happens to the isles because a new wave of bandwagon will ensure a nice boost in the fan base that will keep the team around."
NewYorkIslanders,325pgj,lighthousefisherman,2,Sat Apr 11 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"All these articles about the Brooklyn move are starting to get old. Yeah, it sucks the team is leaving the Coliseum, but there's nothing anyone can do about it. It's better they stay New York rather than move elsewhere. Thankfully, they found a place that will take them in and keep them at least near their home. Would rather see the islanders stay the islanders rather than become a team out of state. A two hour move beats the hell out of moving multiple States away. Plus, Barclays is not that bad if you avoid corner seating at the one end of the ice, and yeah, like they said in the video, the food is pretty fucking good."
NewYorkIslanders,325pgj,lighthousefisherman,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"no doubt about it that a lot of fans wont be able to come to every game, i gone to 10+ games this year because i know very well that going to games next season will be a hassle ill be lucky to go to 5 games next season. What im worried about for the team is all the fans from other teams will make the commute and take over the arena more then the islanders fans"
NewYorkIslanders,325pgj,babygirl052594,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"New Jersey people who don't watch hockey will hop on the Brooklyn Bandwagon, especially when they can just take a train there. Trust me, I'm a new Jersey Isles fan. Once the nets LEFT the state for Brooklyn, everyone in New Jersey started being fans. For whatever reason, people in New Jersey love Brooklyn. When the Islanders start having an association with Brooklyn, all the New Jersey people who don't already have a hockey team will go to the Islanders."

It's considered the largest dance festival in the world, and people usually go with a flag of their home country.  Rather than be another American with a USA flag, I thought I'd go with something that represents better where I'm from (Long Island). And I thought an Islanders flag would be a good flag to bring (and an easy way for friends to find me on the livestream).  When we were facing the possibility of not getting in the playoffs, I had sent out a tweet to the Isles that I would not go with the flag if they failed to make the playoffs.  Thinking my original tweet may have been too harsh, I thought I could ignite a fighting spirit by saying if they can eliminate the Rangers from the playoffs (at ANY stage), I would find every camera at Tomorrowland, and get the Isles logo beamed around the world (it's broadcast on YouTube with a very high audience level).  So, if we face the Rangers at any point, and eliminate them, I will get the Islanders flag in front of every camera at the world's largest festival."

NewYorkIslanders,32311m,A_Charmandur,4,Fri Apr 10 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I love Sparky. The pure ridiculousness of his inception as the Islander's mascot is more than enough to justify his worth to me.   Besides, he's a fucking dragon. Who cares about relevance when you've got one of the most badass fictional creatures repping your team?"
NewYorkIslanders,32311m,NordicReagan,3,Fri Apr 10 16:57:58 2015 UTC,Sparky is awesome and did a great job pumping up fans and hanging with the kids in the crowd. Its gonna be interesting to see what comes in Brooklyn. I know the guy behind the costume from my community and he used to be Mr. Met also!

NewYorkIslanders,3209b7,Cay_Rharles,4,Thu Apr 9 15:48:24 2015 UTC,When the same problems keep happening it's coaching. Coaches get fired despite making finals and conference finals and playoffs. Hopfully we make the same power move because we are a very talented team.
NewYorkIslanders,3209b7,tanu24,3,Thu Apr 9 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if March had gone just ok, I think Cappy could have survived a first round exit. Especially, when you consider that the PK, the thing we all were screaming needed to be fixed, did actually improve a lot since the all star break.   Now I think he needs to get the team to like game 6 of the 2nd round in order to not worry about his job security.  Especially if some of the other coaches around the league who might get the axe become available.  There may be some very talented coaches becoming available this off-season.  Many of whom probably just need a change of scenery and finally the Islanders look like an attractive destination."
NewYorkIslanders,3209b7,Waldo19,2,Thu Apr 9 16:01:56 2015 UTC,He just doesn't seem to know what hes doing. And hes just making up lines. Honestly the fact that he shot Kyle into the top line and PP despite the fact our first line was on fire was just so bad. Also the fact that Lee plays a much more complementary role to JT compared to Kule. It's like watching someone make up lines on NHL 15.

NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,bass_n_treble,0,Thu Apr 9 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"Remember how 8 years ago the Islanders needed to win all of their games and have a couple of other teams lose in order to make the playoffs, and it actually happened? Well, call me a crazy pessimist, but I have a feeling this year will be the opposite - the Islanders will spectacularly miss the playoffs.    EDIT: Nevermind."
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,BroadwayJayEsq,3,Thu Apr 9 12:33:46 2015 UTC,Nah dude.  We are going to take the Pens out to the shed and put them down on Fri.
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,bass_n_treble,-7,Thu Apr 9 13:29:32 2015 UTC,They really shit the bed this season.  Anyone almost hope they don't play well in the playoffs?  Capuano MUST GO or this team will never have future success.
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,BroadwayJayEsq,3,Thu Apr 9 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"Anyone almost hope they don't play well in the playoffs?   No, I want the Islanders to succeed. As you can tell by my flair and my presence in the subreddit, I'm an Islanders fan."
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,bass_n_treble,-2,Thu Apr 9 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"Tone it down a bit, man.  Are you saying a playoff run that would ensure keeping Capuano's job next year and continuing to lose 6-8 games a season on his behalf (bad lineups, not taking good timeouts, putting cold shooter in shootout, etc) just so we can get the 7th spot in the playoffs again next year is good?  Is it not okay to want a wakeup call to management and the owners, who will undoubtedly have less patience and more wherewithal to fire someone who doesn't help the club?  If it means Stanley Cup Finals next year, I wouldn't mind another 1st round exit if Capuano and his University of Maine cronies getting the can as a result.  Did you not want the 1st draft choice in 2009?  Or did that make us losers?  Are Buffalo fans not really fans because they want Connor McDavid, or are they going to go 82-0 next season without him?  I want what's best for the team.  A mediocre coach is not what's best for the team.  They will not win with someone who thought Conacher was a 1st liner and who won't put Grabner, the best PK guy on the team, in the lineup, among other things.  Do you really think we're winning the Stanley Cup this season?"
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,BroadwayJayEsq,2,Thu Apr 9 16:32:33 2015 UTC,Do you really think we're winning the Stanley Cup this season?   Why not? We're the top score-adjusted Fenwick team in the league.  We're one-point away from a playoff berth and we're getting back several injured players right now.  The best thing for this team is NOT to lose games and miss the playoffs just because YOU don't like the coaching staff. That's dumb and it has nothing to do with '09 or Buffalo.
NewYorkIslanders,31yhaa,bass_n_treble,0,Thu Apr 9 17:18:49 2015 UTC,Reality:  we won't win with Capuano.  I'm moving on to the next step because I don't like seeing our very talented team limited by a mediocre coach.  Accept it.

Yet they are fighting for President's Trophy err home-ice advantage in the East umm home-ice in the first round wait any place except the Rangers in the first round oh any spot in the playoffs.  Maybe the Islanders would have beat the Penguins if Capuano stopped starting ice cold Nabokov every game or pulled him when he was playing a .750 game.  I mean, it's not like unemployed Penguins coach Dan Bylsma couldn't figure it out when be put Vokoun in.  Coaching clearly has nothing to do with success or failure, amirite?  Let's hope Ledecky and Malkin are stupid enough to not fire the entire staff when they take over so you can cheer on Fred Flintstone and we can pile up 15th selections in the next 10 drafts instead of Stanley Cup rings.  Cheers!"

I'll miss how the building echoes all the fans cheers, making it seem louder and louder. I'll miss the smoke stacks next to the coliseum, where my group and I have an on going joke that it's Moulson up there, smoking (since he kind of looks like a pothead).   Most of all.. I'll miss going with my brothers/friends. We all meet at my house and get into my car, which holds 8 people. They'd all give me money for the tickets that I bought on Stub Hub. We listen to some awesome CDs during our drive from Suffolk. We have our routine.. Park near the exit, so we don't have to wait in a line of cars to leave. Pee at the Marriott before and after the game. Do the good old honk honk honkhonkhonk after a win. Get some fast food afterwards, usually Sonic since there isn't one near us in Suffolk. Get home full and exhausted, but satisfied with an awesome night.   Sigh... I'm going to miss everything."
NewYorkIslanders,31ylqp,ZoraHockey,8,Thu Apr 9 04:22:52 2015 UTC,The concrete. The huge blue doors that make me feel like a little kid every time I pass through them.

NewYorkIslanders,31ylqp,lsp2005,5,Thu Apr 9 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"The smell of the concourse. The texture of the seats. Banging my feet on the risers in the last two rows. The smell of the $3 pretzels ""cooking"" above a tin pan of charcoal in a shopping cart outside. Honk honk honkhonkhonk. Post-game McDonalds with my dad or my friends. Driving to the game. The walk from the parking lot to the coliseum; no matter how cold or how many times I've cursed it. And the Islanders being ten minutes away."
NewYorkIslanders,31ylqp,ArtyThePoopie,4,Thu Apr 9 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"Being born and raised in a part of New Jersey that is rather far from Uniondale, I honestly have only been to the Coliseum 5 times. Most of the time I would catch the isles on road games against the devils and flyers. The last home game I'll ever see at the Coliseum was the game last week where we shut out Buffalo. I took the time that day to let it all really sink in. So, here's what I'll miss:    How the place truly still has that old time hockey feel. It is the last of its kind. You look around the seats and you just think: ""This is it. This is classic hockey.""  How the concourse is just one giant, endless ring around the rink.  How you could sit in any seat, close your eyes, and imagine you were there the minute Nystrom scored the goal that would begin the dynasty.  The road trips. I mean, fuck the belt parkway, but the reward for the long drive was the rare chance for me to see the boys in home colors.  Going to the games, and actually feeling the sense of community amongst fans. I didn't feel like the one weird isles fan in Central Jersey at the Coliseum."

But then I was blown away by Citi Field. Definitely doesn't have the same feel as Shea but it was the stadium that the fans and team deserved. A great mix of classic baseball and modern conveniences and amenities to be one of the best stadiums in baseball. It really feels like the Isles and fans will be getting none of that and it's super depressing since I've seen the great things a deserving team and fan base could get.

Walking in hearing people chant LGI the second you enter the over packed concourse. smelling the rock hard churros and hotdogs.

NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,Axel2134,2,Thu Apr 9 04:04:06 2015 UTC,Babcock is definitley an amazing coach. What he has managed to do during his tenure with the wings is nothing short of amazing. He's handled a conference change better than I could have ever imagined. I have a ton of respect for that man. I could definitely get behind that change.
NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,ponradcrofit,10,Thu Apr 9 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"Cappy has got to go. he is holding this team back. get an experienced NHL coach, this team will make even bigger strides."

NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,DancesWithCanoes,3,Thu Apr 9 13:50:33 2015 UTC,New coach
NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,leeber27,3,Thu Apr 9 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"1) new coach. As someone previously said it would simply be amazing if we could grab bobcock. Sadly though, I feel his heart is still in Detroit or he might want Toronto more. However, maybe wang will still wanna impress the new owners and spend a shit ton for him.  2) Get a rental winger. I think we all love lee-JT-Strome, but that's showing signs of not happening under current management. Thus, if my first point isn't done then the isles will need someone to hang around for one year while we wait for Dal Colle.   3) get a backup. No idea why there's so much hate for Nuevo on this sub. Most of his goals against haven't been his fault and have been the fault of miscommunication from the defense. However, if he is unattainable then perhaps look for someone to just fill that role for one year. That kid williams is playing great in BP, we'll need just a year for him to be ready if he continues to show signs of excellence.  4) I'd resign vis (for the right money). Maybe he wants another year of play, obviously he's not worth what he is now, but he is worth maybe 1.5 mill. It's well known pulock will be up next year, it's just a matter of when reinhart is ready. We can't have strait or hickey in the lineup while we wait for reinhart so we might as well have vis back again. I'm thinking 1.5 for 1 year contract."
NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,mcbordes,2,Thu Apr 9 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"First step is to make QO's to the RFAs.  Then re-sign the RFAs, let the UFAs walk.  Bring in a few depth forwards for less than $1M/year.  If Lubo wants to come back for cheap let him.  Same goes for McDonald. Neuvirth is going to want to start somewhere so he'll be gone.  Sign a journeyman to back up Jaro.  If no one comes cheap Kevin Poulin should still be around anyway."

If they win a round, holy shit forget it - he is going to sign a long term deal.  You forget that this Isles team is the most successful in the last 2 decades - management is going to look at that and say you are crazy to file the coach.  It's frustrating because I don't think he is a good coach, but it's out of the question he's getting fired."

NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,isles27,0,Thu Apr 9 16:42:00 2015 UTC,I would ship 27 91 18 to some summer camp bonding NHL defensive instruction course for 3 months. If one of them can play defense effectively we would have our first line secure for the next 4+ years.
NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,Skooby14,2,Thu Apr 9 15:14:46 2015 UTC,don't think you're paying close attention to JT this year.  He is a turnover machine - he consistently gets pucks off opposing players like its his job (which it is).  He is all over the opposition.
NewYorkIslanders,31ydrz,isles27,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"Chasing a puck carrier down does not constitue good defense. Good defense requires consistent effort on and off the puck, which JT severely lacks. His movement in the defensive zone off the puck is poor."
NewYorkIslanders,31wyre,mcbordes,2,Wed Apr 8 20:25:29 2015 UTC,Not really a huge deal because I see him at the Coliseum all the time.  Finally had a chance to talk to him about that Miracle on Ice game which I figured he'd be sick of by now.  Very nice guy.

NewYorkIslanders,31xbnp,Waldo19,2,Thu Apr 9 00:56:07 2015 UTC,I'd prefer a Washington loss since neither results will clinch anything for the Isles
NewYorkIslanders,31xbnp,IslesBeBack,2,Wed Apr 8 22:13:46 2015 UTC,This decision of who to root for would be a lot easier if this game was tomorrow and the Rangers Sens was tonight so we knew that outcome.    Ultimately if Boston loses 2 of its last 3 in regulation we clinch. Idk who would own the tie breaker if Boston gets to 98 with a win and an OT loss.   If the Rangers beat the Caps then the Islanders can still pass them with 2 wins. I think you gotta pull for Washington tonight. At the very least route for it to end in regulation.
NewYorkIslanders,31xbnp,RIPwhalers,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Wash wins convincingly.  their one remaining game is a 12:30pm game against the Rangers, who will have nothing to play for.  the Isles chances of home ice took a big hit tonight, but at the same time, the odds of falling out of the postseason entirely also took a major hit.  most likely the Isles will be competing with Pittsburgh for the right to play Washington instead of Tampa/Montreal/NY Rangers."
NewYorkIslanders,31xbnp,Waldo19,2,Thu Apr 9 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I'll take it. The worst outcome would have been if Boston Washington had gone to OT.    Its true that the Rangers will probably not play Washington to hard, The hope is that the Rangersthey want no part of Ottawa in a 7 game series which is something they do have some control over.    The Sens need 4 points, the Bruins need three and the Islanders need just 1.  At least something broke our way tonight."
NewYorkIslanders,31xbnp,three_dee,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"The chances of missing the playoffs were already almost nil, so I would rather have seen Washington lose.  For the Islanders to miss the playoffs, THREE teams currently in the playoffs that are behind the Islanders, PLUS Ottawa who is out, would ALL have to pass the Islanders.  That would have required a ridiculously convoluted combination of events."

NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,wolversheen,2,Wed Apr 8 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"Surely he does, but he won't. Just like how Nash is a finalist for the Hart and Tavares isn't."

NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,Lostinthemist81,3,Wed Apr 8 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but JT has more goals so that breaks the tie."
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,Lostinthemist81,2,Wed Apr 8 17:17:41 2015 UTC,Ahhhh very good
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,DLun203,-4,Wed Apr 8 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"This is gonna piss a few of you off, but a small part of me wants to miss the playoffs. Hear me out...   It would suck a lot to watch another postseason without the Isles but at least it would shut up all the Capuano supporters. Inconsistency like this is because of one thing: Lack of discipline. We'd have clinched a few games ago if we'd had a more passionate coach. I don't see any emotion at all out of Cappy.  Also if we're playing this way now it'd be an agonizing 5 game series and I'd be more defeated than I was last night.  Down vote away, I don't care."
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,mcbordes,3,Wed Apr 8 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"So first of all, since they don't have any draft picks in the first 3 rounds, there is no real difference between a 5 game exit in the first round of the playoffs and not making the playoffs since either may cause Cappy his job the exact same amount.  If they somehow get 98 points and miss the playoffs I don't think he gets fired anymore than he would have with an embarrassing first round exit.  Next, I disagree that these late goals are his fault.  None of them are because the players stop skating or a breakdown in the system.  Why does no one give Halak shit?  I really don't understand it.  He has a history of giving up late goals as he seems to mentally head to the dressing room in the final minute of periods.  They tied the game up on a set play off the faceoff.  That's coaching.  A shitty shot from the point squeaking through is not."
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,DLun203,3,Wed Apr 8 19:19:27 2015 UTC,"Halak has given up a few last minute goals. A few that cost him a shut out. The Ranger game in January comes to mind.  It's hard to fault the goalie though when his SV% is .92, the lowest it's been all season"
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,mcbordes,2,Wed Apr 8 19:23:07 2015 UTC,But what is it in the last minute of the period?  I don't actually know but based on watching every game it can't be on par with his save % in the first 19 minutes of each period.
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,islesrule224,2,Wed Apr 8 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"His problem with me is the strategy of shutting down on offense to focus on defense in the third (the claude Julien strategy), which leads to us sitting back and hoping time runs out before we blow it. If we are playing well enough to be up why change how we are playing. I'd rather lose playing our game then sitting in a trap attempt and then typing to turn it back on when it is to late.   He has been like this since he started coaching us. I remember his first year our third period strategy was to flip the puck off the glass and out every time. Now it is dump it deep and go back to the Blue line and wait for the attack"
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,mcbordes,3,Wed Apr 8 23:43:34 2015 UTC,This has gotta be the most well thought out criticism I've ever read on Cappy.   I totally understand where you are coming from.  I don't think the neutral zone play really changes that much at the end of the game though.  I think it just seems that way because when they are losing they get away from their defense first mentality and try to go all out and score.
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,islesrule224,2,Thu Apr 9 01:13:43 2015 UTC,"It isn't our neutral zone play as much as the offensive zone play. When we have a third period lead we don't attack as much and allow the other team to shrink the rink by a zone. Our forechecking is one of our biggest assets. When we are forechecking well it makes it almost impossible to set up an offense. When we sit back and let teams come to us we are not good enough to survive that, especially against playoff caliber opponents. That is why we struggle to hold leads and throw away so many points.   I can accept breakdowns when we are trailing and have to take chances to tie it but we get so scared of blowing a lead we sit back and try to protect it and lose anyway."
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,replayer,3,Thu Apr 9 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"I don't care about lack of passion on the bench.  I care about his lack of awareness that some of the players that he keeps running out are not as good as players he sits in the press box.    I care about his inability to not put together lines that make sense.  About the fact he keeps playing a PK that has been dismal all season, and putting players on the ice that should NOT ever be on a PK.  On the ice after we tied the game last night, where all we needed to do to clinch was to hold them for 28 seconds, were McDonald and Strait.  Enough said."
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,_stee,2,Wed Apr 8 20:07:36 2015 UTC,Good point.
NewYorkIslanders,31w2oe,DLun203,2,Wed Apr 8 21:09:10 2015 UTC,Yeah because an angry coach helps. Remember when Mike Yeo flipped out on his team. They played worse for the two weeks. The only reason they won was because of Dubnyk

Those 3 goal leads we blew without even getting a point has caught up to us. This team is basically playing like ""As long as we make it we're good"". We should have home ice advantage in the first round and now were close to playing the Rags or Canadians. also losing the last two is very very possible."
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,tanu24,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"We are playing the same way we played last playoff appearance. The one were we dropped into a seed against a real tough Pittsburgh team.   I hate that it seems like we are always making the same mistakes game to game, week to week, year to year.  We played an amazing first half and have been trending down since then and it doesn't look like they are gonna turn it around soon. I hope I'm wrong but this feels like the Islanders from last year."
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,islesrule224,4,Wed Apr 8 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"I am not particularly scared of any playoff match-up. I am concerned about not getting into the playoffs.   The problem isn't that Halak almost never gives up that goal.  That logic is sound in November, no need for alarm.  The problem is that it's April and Halak let in that goal.   Two games to go and only needing 1 point is still better than most of the other teams in the East.  However, our final two games are Pittsburgh and Columbus. Pittsburgh still dangerous and more than capable of breaking out and Columbus is playing like the team they were expected to be had injuries not devastated them.   They also beat the Islanders a few days ago in somewhat similar fashion to what went down last night.    The best gift the Islanders can receive in the next two days would be a Capitals win tonight, and a Rangers and Habs win on Thursday. With last nights loss we now have to worry about the Sens, Bruins, and Wings, in case we don't take care of business Friday.    If the Islanders win out, they are still in ok shape, but I fear the psyche of the team may be really damaged by last night....I know mine is.    LGI."
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,Waldo19,2,Wed Apr 8 17:00:09 2015 UTC,Truthfully I don't think the islanders missing the playoffs is a legitimate concern. It would mean 3 other teams winning out and us not getting a single point. Very unlikely.
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,sans_,3,Wed Apr 8 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"I my brain agrees, but my gut is still very concerned."
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,Waldo19,2,Wed Apr 8 17:33:19 2015 UTC,They don't need to win out. Just one measly point
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,BrainOfG,2,Wed Apr 8 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to ignore the fact that we did dig deep and come back from that 4-1 hole. What I'm upset over is the fact we got into that 4-1 hole in the first place with all around shit play... and Halak muffing that puck at the end was the straw that broke the camel's back.    We need a big win on Friday."
NewYorkIslanders,31vxm2,CaptWinkie,2,Wed Apr 8 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. And I'm usually super optimistic about the team in the face of whatever odds.

That game wasn't that important. But it still fucking sucked."

AND Ottawa has to win their last two. AND Pittsburgh has to win their last two. There is a 99.5% chance that all of those things will not happen."
NewYorkIslanders,31tmli,xchester77,0,Wed Apr 8 02:30:05 2015 UTC,"God, I hate being an Islanders fan sometimes. The fact that a significant portion of our fanbase is just happy to make the playoffs after we were in contention for the division title a month ago is fucking pathetic. I hate being satisfied with mediocrity and the fact that we'd rather get swept by the Rangers than not make the playoffs at all is extremely telling of how conditioned we are to failure."
NewYorkIslanders,31tmli,Waldo19,2,Wed Apr 8 03:55:08 2015 UTC,I am not content by any means. I appalled at their play the last month but these are the odds. We should have cruised in but cappy decided to rest players a month ago
NewYorkIslanders,31tmli,AC3FACE,2,Wed Apr 8 04:42:51 2015 UTC,Are you saying that you would rather not make the playoffs at all than make the playoffs and get eliminated?

In either scenario Cappy is gone, so why not see some playoff hockey.  Hell, I expect that Cappy will be gone even if they put up a good fight in the 2nd round.    Nobody is happy with the results over the last 4+ weeks.  But the playoffs are the 2nd season.  Once you get in anything can happen.  But you gotta get in.  Just like you we want a strong showing in the playoffs. Well, they gotta make the playoffs first."

NewYorkIslanders,31tmli,Chrismercy,2,Wed Apr 8 02:10:01 2015 UTC,Guys we had a great comeback. Let's get Pittsburgh coming up

There was no pass coming. Brian strait had 30 empty feet in both directions. But yea, keep sucking his dick, Jack."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,SirFigNewtons,9,Wed Apr 8 02:05:24 2015 UTC,Cappy must know his job rides on our ability to win a playoff series this year. I'm so tired of hearing that the team's misfortune isn't his fault. This is a team that is fully capable of winning and we just haven't been doing so these last 5 weeks
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,DLun203,3,Wed Apr 8 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"Tonight's lose is the best example. Took the tie for granted and got burned. Why the top defensive, possession players weren't on the ice is a mystery. On this one I have no sympathy. Yes Jaro should save that shot, but when you could have had better players on th ice, the couch deserves blame."

NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,ziggyetotis,6,Wed Apr 8 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"This is the exact same thing that happened during the shortened season. We collapsed at the end and got a horrible seed and had to play Pitt. We consistently blow leads despite bringing in a ton of new players. All of that points to coaching problems. To top it off, Colin McDonald was getting deployed like he was Frans Nielsen or something last night. I saw him on a few PP2 lines, and he was out there when we had the goalie pulled. He tried to deflect a shot / pass through his legs, missed the net, got a bad carem off the boards and gave a perfect breakout pass for the Flyers to go for an empty netter.      If you know anything about hockey, you don't put a career fucking AHLer with horrible puck possession ability out there"
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,HypertextMakeoutLang,5,Wed Apr 8 12:13:19 2015 UTC,"Horrible decision making from the bench, I feel like having Capuano back there is handicapping us."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,CaptWinkie,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:31:34 2015 UTC,One other horrible decision was the center ice face off we took with an empty net. We burned like 20 seconds trying to keep the puck out of the net
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,HypertextMakeoutLang,3,Wed Apr 8 13:39:53 2015 UTC,Capuano was a career AHL'er. He sees a little bit of him in all of them.
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,Chrismercy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:58:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but in a funny coincidence, McDonald was the Isles' best possession player last night by Corsi (59%)."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,mattymonkees,3,Wed Apr 8 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been patient with Cappy, but the teams inability to play with a lead.  Which for all intents and purposes was what they should have been doing in the last 30 sec of that game, is on him.   If the goal had happens with the best defensive/possession lineup on the ice, then it would be a tough break, but it wasn't. There was a better option.    The players do need to be responsible, and the players on the ice took the tie for granted and make poor decisions. But very clearly so did th coach by not putting out the best lineup."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,RIPwhalers,2,Wed Apr 8 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't appreciate the effort the teams made this season...but Capuano was a coach I didn't see lasting with the team once we started coming together as a team. A great coach that knows how to utilize a team can turn a mediocre team into a decent playoff team, a bad one can turn a good team into a jumbled mess. Watching this team ive noticed with Jack on the bench, when we play good, we look excellent in offensive zone...but from the offensive blue line back the team looks lost. When we're bad, all we can get going is just dumping the puck at the goalie which makes us give the impression everythings ok with the shot total being so high with non quality shots"
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,AfellowchuckerEhh,2,Wed Apr 8 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Have you watched the Rags? I have and they are a textbook example of what great coaching can do for a team. I'm just hoping the Islanders collapse these last 2 months means Cap is out and a new, real, truly excellent coach can replace him. Then we'll go back to being serious Cup contenders."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,dukemantee,2,Wed Apr 8 04:59:27 2015 UTC,If this season went without a hiccup then he would be getting undeserved credit. This was a necessary evil to ensure a bright future.
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,Chrismercy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:59:30 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Rangers fan here with a question: Do you think (in the event of Capuano getting the boot) that the Isles will go after Bylsma for the coaching position? I'm a huge fan of his and wanted the Rangers to go for him back when Torts was fired. Obviously I'm pretty happy with what AV has done for us, but knowing how much firepower you guys have up front and how good your forecheck is, Bylsma seems like a no-brainer to replace Capuano. Thoughts?"

NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,Chrismercy,6,Wed Apr 8 13:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ugly effort. Sure, they showed up again for the last 5 minutes of the game. We've seen that happen plenty before. They didn't nearly put in a full 60 minutes. They only played with urgency and like the game mattered late in the third. So yes, ugly effort."
NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,ZoraHockey,2,Wed Apr 8 14:44:42 2015 UTC,I think we did watch the game of the year...it just didn't do our way. :(

NewYorkIslanders,31tph5,Chrismercy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:38:56 2015 UTC,I gotta disagree. Sure there was some real effort in the end but you can't win games when you're only playing for 10 minutes.

The real problem is that they are giving away positioning with these losses."

NewYorkIslanders,31xk2b,i_am_a_gamer_AMA,2,Thu Apr 9 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"It's important for both sides to note several facts -   The Islanders haven't won the championship since the early 80s.  The Rangers haven't won the championship since the early 90s.  Aside from home ice advantage and match up posturing, anything that happens during the regular season (hot streaks, collapses, sustained play, mistakes, injuries, etc) doesn't fucking matter. To wit, if a team gets hot at the end of the regular season, they have to keep that going for another 16-28 games, or it doesn't fucking matter.   No one on either fan base has the ability to predict the future. Let your team take the ice, sit back with some snacks and some booze - if that's you're thing - and enjoy the spectacle.   Rangers fans want to talk about knowing what it's like to win. Okay, that's fair. They've been close recently and the Isles haven't. However, Nick Leddy and Johnny Boychuk have both won cups in the last 5 years. The Rangers don't have a single player with a ring from the last 5 years. (please fact check me, I checked the rosters over, but it was on mobile, I could have missed someone). At the end of the day - either organization you talk about  hasn't won diddily in over 20 years.   The shit talk is gonna fly around until one or both teams fall out, or one wins, I'm aware of that. End of the day, all these posts prove is that NY fans on both ends need to stare reality in the face and realize that until one of these teams hoists that beautiful bastard up to the sky, nothing else fucking matters. Even if they meet in the Conference Quarters or the Semis and one forces the other out, that ain't the goal. It doesn't matter. Just sit back and enjoy the sport."

NewYorkIslanders,31u06r,wolversheen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"No, we never root for the fucking rangers. We need to beat the fuck out of the penguins Friday night. I hope ottawa makes the playoffs and beats the rangers first round. We beat the pens, we are guaranteed at least third."
NewYorkIslanders,31u06r,Waldo19,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"We are rooting for the Rangers to win both their games honestly.  It would mean a Sens lose (clinch) and a chance at 2nd in the division if the Islanders also beat CBJ and the Caps lose to the Rangers.   Since we didn't get points last night we probably want a Washington win tonight too, but whatever happens we don't want it going into OT.    Looking down the stretch we are also probably rooting for the Habs to beat Detroit, the Flyers to beat the Sens and the Panthers and Lightning to beat Boston. Just in case we can't take care of Pittsburgh.   The Islanders still don't need help, but I am not going to be upset if they get some."
NewYorkIslanders,31u06r,DLun203,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:49:29 2015 UTC,They got the PT. Wouldn't surprise me if AV played some scrubs to rest the all-stars. I'm not counting on their A game.   I'd much rather just crush the Penguins though.
NewYorkIslanders,31tsd3,TriviaWhiz,2,Wed Apr 8 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, I have to.   I'm going to be in Pittsburgh Friday at the game.   LET'S GO ISLANDERS LET'S GO ISLANDERS LET'S GO ISLANDERS"
NewYorkIslanders,31tsd3,BaneDad,2,Wed Apr 8 02:48:37 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is I had to root for the pens tonight and now I have to root for the rags?

NewYorkIslanders,31tmbd,JAAAS,-1,Wed Apr 8 01:44:11 2015 UTC,Look at the positives. We had an awesome comeback. Time to get Pit.
NewYorkIslanders,31tmbd,_stee,5,Wed Apr 8 01:45:30 2015 UTC,stop with this moral victories shit. They don't put points in the columns. We will never rally of something with a coach like this
NewYorkIslanders,31tmbd,patio_himself,-1,Wed Apr 8 02:38:00 2015 UTC,How is this the coaches fault?!
NewYorkIslanders,31tmbd,_stee,5,Wed Apr 8 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"1) were a ""playoff bound"" team with a lot to lose, playing against a team that has nothing to play for except being the spoiler..we come out flat and can't even score on a 5-3... Coaching  2) Brian strait is playing while Calvin dehaan sits..coaching  3) COLIN MCDONALD AND BRIAN STRAIT WERE OUT THERE WITH 10 SECONDS LEFT INSTEAD OF AN APPROPRIATE DEFENSIVE LINE. THE FOURTH LINE WAS MISSING ITS TWO CRITICAL PARTS AND WERE MADE OF OF AHL ENFORCERS. ....MOTHER FUCKING COACHING!   seriously, this loss and most of the losses this season are on the coaching staff."

NewYorkIslanders,31tmbd,patio_himself,3,Wed Apr 8 17:38:45 2015 UTC,The team actually showed some fight and wanted to win the game instead of sitting back and taking the loss

NewYorkIslanders,31uaxd,escapingNihilism,7,Wed Apr 8 05:12:23 2015 UTC,Ottawa is going to get their asses kicked by the rangers just like they did last week.  Much rather see the rags play Boston or Detroit.

NewYorkIslanders,31uaxd,eggy333,3,Wed Apr 8 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"If you want something to be happy about just consider how good Lee has been in the clutch this year.  Tampa at home  Dallas  Philli  Just to name a few. It is nice to know we have him to fall back on as our secondary clutch player after JT while KO still struggles to find consistency.   KO has to do something on the defensive end though, flailing around doesn't constitue as defense, mark your man. He wasn't the only one puck watching hardcore, but he is a leader on this team and needs to put in more effort. JT may be lackluster on defense, but we've seen his intensity on that end and it is reassuring."
NewYorkIslanders,31uaxd,isles27,2,Wed Apr 8 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"KO has been TOUGH to watch since he's been back.  I mean like a shadow of himself.  Cannot hold onto the puck and, like you said, non-existent on D."

NewYorkIslanders,31uaxd,eggy333,3,Wed Apr 8 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"I am about as positive as it gets about this team, and even I lost a lot of sleep last night.  Man did that suck so hard.  Anyway, by far your best solace is in the pure numbers.  The Islanders are tops in Fenwick and close to tops in score adjusted Fenwick.  Their PDO in this stretch has been beyond horrible and will eventually regress to the mean.  Cold comfort if they can't take care of business in the next two games (ask the Kings).  By the same token, however, many people are putting a lot of stock into a good 25 game stretch by certain teams in which the numbers are simply unsustainable.  The Rangers have had a season long PDO of 102, which is a trend that statistically cannot continue yet seems to never tip in their disfavor.  Montreal is also up there.  If the Islanders can fulfill their 99.5% odds of playoff qualification and NOT bungle this all away, the stats say they are very dangerous.  It'll be interesting to see how the psychology of the stretch run plays out if they do get there.  If they're reasonably healthy and getting average puck luck, they should be favored in any first round series by raw numbers (yes, including against the Rangers, though the intangibles probably weigh in somehow or another)."
NewYorkIslanders,31uaxd,mattymonkees,2,Wed Apr 8 10:55:19 2015 UTC,"With ya there in losing a bit of sleep. I'm still in shock from last night, we played so hard in the second half of the third, we dug deep and our skaters came through.... to lose like that is the absolute definition of heartbreak.    I can't even think about the playoffs right now, we just have to focus on the next game. All we need is one measly mutherfucking point... course it has to be so fucking hard to get."

It is too soon to make playoff predictions. I think the entire post season mentality of this team will be forged in Pitt on friday. If they come out like beasts pissed off about last nights game and kick the pens around and then come into the coli and take care of business in front of that sold out crowd of wild isles fans, i think we go in strong and have a chance. Theres still an opportunity to roll into the playoffs with confidence, dont you think?  If we get killed in Pitt or lose in another heart stomping way on Friday, we are fucked. LGI baby!"

That said, if we continue playing like we've been playing we're out in 5 games.

NewYorkIslanders,31skyn,_jared,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"Well they really haven't played well in the 1st most of the year. The difference was that in the first half, a switch seemed to go off and they just battled back like there was never any doubt they were going to tie it up.  Kinda like how Ottawa and Minnesota have been playing in the 2nd half."

What's everyone's take on Kennedy?  Is he just a failed experiment at this point?  Personally, I just see him as a sub player in case anyone gets hurt in the playoffs.  Don't see him cracking the lineup regularly in the postseason."
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,Skooby14,3,Tue Apr 7 16:54:50 2015 UTC,I see him as playoff depth in case we lose a lot of forwards.
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,_stee,2,Tue Apr 7 17:01:49 2015 UTC,He was a RW NHL'er that we got dirt cheap to use while Grabner and Grabo were down. He was so much better then the current options in Bridgeport.
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,Chrismercy,2,Tue Apr 7 17:10:48 2015 UTC,this and hopefully only this.
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,nofx516,3,Tue Apr 7 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"Think about it. Grabner is good but with the road he was on getting hurt every few games he was bound to be back on IR by now. He has also proven he can make an immediate impact even after long stints without playing. Now we can insert him back into his slot without having an AHL liability filling that slot for the past 2 months, and frankly Kennedy made a bigger splash then I was expecting early on. He helped prevent an embarrassing shutout or two if I recall."
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,Chrismercy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"Boulton is in because Philly plays ""tough"" And instead of beating them with speed and skill Cap wants to play their game.

NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,tanu24,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair they have played well the last two games with Boulton, and he did score a goal and hasn't played bad. Do I think he should play over anyone else? No. But he hasn't done anything stupid or taken penalties and has as many goals this season as deHaan."
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,jp_the_orange,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:07:02 2015 UTC,The best part of Boulton playing is it limits the amount of time cappy plays the 4th line giving more time to the top 9 as it should be.  It also gives him a reason to not play the 4th line in the last few minutes of a close game.  I think this is the reason why we win with Boulton in the lineup as much as I like our fourth line there is no reason to play them against a top line especially at home.

NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,bass_n_treble,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:24:58 2015 UTC,I'm hearing Grabovski is near a return too.  This team probably doesn't even realize how much they need him back in the lineup.
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,CaptWinkie,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"I like these moves, Colin plays with a ton of heart and has decent chemistry with our veterans. Grabs just needs to be his usual speedy self."
NewYorkIslanders,31rgs6,NordicReagan,3,Tue Apr 7 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"I just wish his shot would improve a little bit more, ya know? I love the guy, but whenever he gets a breakaway it always winds up with a shot to the pads. Still, it'll be great to seem him back!"

NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,mcbordes,3,Tue Apr 7 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"I don't have any confirmation on this but I'm like 80% sure he has the mumps.  Grabner had it first, gave it to Kennedy and CDH."

NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,mcbordes,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:02:04 2015 UTC,Yes.  Came back for the Kings game and hasn't played since.   Mumps has an incubation period.

NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,hockeycrazy033,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:34:25 2015 UTC,"deHaan's offense is really disappointing this season. I thought he was supposed to be the offensive defenseman  kind of the opposite of Hammer as the defensive force. But his offensive numbers are awful. And watching him play every shot is wide or blocked or terrible. And as a real shot, he has as many goals this season as Boulton and MouseRat."
NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,tanu24,2,Tue Apr 7 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Who cares, he is an upgrade from Strait's offense no matter what!  He can only get better, but he cant improve by sitting, and apparently he has better than average possession numbers, unlike Brian Strait.  Brian Strait is also maybe the slowest defender in the league, which I can't stand."
NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,tanu24,-1,Tue Apr 7 21:22:42 2015 UTC,He had a couple bad games and is young so hes out.
NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,morgrar,6,Tue Apr 7 18:35:28 2015 UTC,So if you're old and have ONLY bad games you get to play?
NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,purplehumpbackwhale,2,Tue Apr 7 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Do you remember Reasoner? Pandolfo?
NewYorkIslanders,31rw10,tanu24,2,Tue Apr 7 18:51:21 2015 UTC,I forgot about Reasoner until now. I thought I'd never hear or see that name again.
NewYorkIslanders,31trdv,viewless25,2,Wed Apr 8 02:20:23 2015 UTC,"Those dudes just battled back and tied an otherwise lost game in the lat two minutes. Lost on a fluke. With all due respect, your opinion is stupid."

NewYorkIslanders,31trdv,Datdude_717,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:22:40 2015 UTC,Not making the playoffs is a stretch. What happens in the playoffs is where your pessimism is best suited; as I think everyone is now convinced this team will not bring it and get out of the first round.
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Rob_G,6,Tue Apr 7 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"Grabner and Mcdonald go in for Frans/Martin, No change in D, Halak in net"
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,mc11050,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:48:09 2015 UTC,They really need to sort the defense out. With Hickey getting sloppy lately and De Haan still getting scratched has made me a bit nervous.
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,CaptWinkie,3,Tue Apr 7 17:57:02 2015 UTC,I'd expect bouton and either grabner or kennedy to hit the lineup tonight
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,mc11050,2,Tue Apr 7 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like they're resting everybody up now that the playoff picture looks a little more certain."
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Skooby14,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:56:58 2015 UTC,It will definitely be boulton and kennedy.  We are not going to see Grabner no matter how much we all want to. Maybe cappy will have Strait center the second line so we can see DeHaan back
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,mc11050,5,Tue Apr 7 14:59:28 2015 UTC,Strait hasn't been nearly as bad as he was earlier in the season (thats not saying much) but regardless I would like to see DeHann back in before the playoffs
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Skooby14,3,Tue Apr 7 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I'm not a Strait hater, but I think we have better options at the ready (DeHaan).  Also, I really liked the DeHaan/Hammer pairing all season long and would like to see it in the playoffs.  At this point, I don't think we are going to see DeHaan in the playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Skooby14,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"I like de Haan, I really do, and I think he has a bright future with the team. But, he's basically a rookie. It's the same reason why we aren't bringing up our star D prospects in Bridgeport this year. D-men take time to develop, and de Haan in my opinion isn't reliable enough for playoffs. But I think he's got nowhere to go but up."
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,jp_the_orange,3,Tue Apr 7 15:11:45 2015 UTC,I think DeHaan makes better decisions than Hickey.  Just sayin....
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Bigtwinkie,2,Tue Apr 7 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hickey hasn't been great lately. I really thought he was going to have a breakout year. Then again, I also thought Conacher was going to be a star based on his fancy moves in game one against Carolina."
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,_jared,2,Tue Apr 7 15:21:07 2015 UTC,Strait has only played 10 more career nhl games than deHaan so I don't think experience should be a problem.
NewYorkIslanders,31r4bl,Chrismercy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:26:22 2015 UTC,I was just about to post that.  127 vs 116 according to Yahoo.

I have a ton of skepticism with all the things you hear about how shitty the Barclays is when it comes to hockey.   Keep in mind there's a very vocal minority of fans that are really upset about the move that are slandering every aspect of the Barclays anyway they can.   Deff check it out for yourself. I was skeptical but ended up going twice and loved both games.
NewYorkIslanders,31r9d0,barclayswasterrible,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"never saw hockey there, but i saw a concert. was in the nosebleeds, and it was the most cramped seats ive ever had, anywhere. big enough maybe for women or children, but my averaged sized friends and my averaged sized self were all touching elbows and shoulders. everyone had to get into the aisle if someone had to go to the bathroom or what have you. no lines, at least. but from the nosebleeds, the view was pretty bad and the acoustics were terrible. might be better for hockey, but i truly hate that place"
NewYorkIslanders,31r9d0,n0her0es,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:59:05 2015 UTC,Barclays wasn't meant to accommodate a hockey rink. Would you buy a bicycle that wasn't meant to accommodate your ass? I think you'd want to ride it first at least.

NewYorkIslanders,31r9d0,mcbordes,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:44:09 2015 UTC,I emailed a ticket rep and he's having me come out Friday with my father to look at a pair. He's gunna give us a tour of the stadium and pick out our actual seats by seeing them in person

NewYorkIslanders,31oc20,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"If this is your first trip down to the Wells Fargo Center my personal advice as a flyers fan:  A.) Sorry for the asshats. I think every team has them, and Philly gets a bad wrap. I was at a playoff game against... Buffalo? I think... anyway, I ended up getting beer on me. However, the away team fan was cursing out just about everybody. Exchanges are going to happen. We have holding cells in the Linc if things gets out of hand. (I believe there.)   B.) Xfinity live can be fun, but if you don't need to go, I personally wouldn't bother. I'm not a big crowd / bar guy. I was there a few times, and I couldn't stand waiting in line to get in to overpay for beer. But I'm local, and can tailgate, y'all coming down wouldn't have that option, most likely.   C.) MOST IMPORTANTLY: when you beat the flyers in a shootout, as is the trend, remember that they stopped selling everything half way through the third.   Have fun, go islanders. (As a flyers fan still, y'all winning helps push shitsburgh out. A big helping of humble pie to the front loaded pens would make the floundering flyers season almost tolerable. )"

NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,tanu24,3,Mon Apr 6 19:53:03 2015 UTC,No okpuso in the lineup. Bold strategy.  I'd also like to swtich Kule and Lee.  18-91-27  21-51-12  84-29-86  17-53-15

NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,tanu24,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:21:05 2015 UTC,Cap always seems to have it out for someone. De Haan sitting for Strait. Casey used to sit for Reasoner. Lee on the third Grabner not playing. I honestly don't know what goes on sometimes. Because Lee's skill set is perfect for JT and that's why well it worked so god damned well.

NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,ArtyThePoopie,5,Tue Apr 7 10:41:53 2015 UTC,Just keep your head up this time.  please
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,Chrismercy,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:00:23 2015 UTC,He won't.
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,Waldo19,2,Tue Apr 7 10:43:07 2015 UTC,"We need speed. Speed's what we need. Greasy, fast speed!  It would be a wonderful lift he can return in good form. However, a slow return to form like KO's wouldn't really be all that useful.  Gotta trust the coaching staff on this one, for both Grabo's safety and the overall good of the team."
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,LooseSeal-,2,Mon Apr 6 15:26:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. Luckily we are pretty deep on forward. We could afford to have him in the linup this week with limited minutes. I think the coaching staffs goal has been to go into the playoffs fully healthy. This is why Lubo has been in and out of the linup and Grabner is still sitting. The irrational fan would scream that the linups aren't the best they can be but when you concider after 82 games guys get banged up and have small injuries it's a perfect idea to sit them. I'd rather go in fresh and healthy as a lower seed then banged up as a higher seed. The top 8 in the east are all capable of deep runs.

NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,CaptWinkie,3,Mon Apr 6 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this is outstanding news! We could really use Grabo back in the lineup."
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,_stee,2,Mon Apr 6 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this could be the difference between us getting the cup or not. I always bring it up but the on the Isles pod cast guys from last week, Grabo has THE BEST possession stats on the team by a wide margin. Moreover, when people play with him, their possession stats all increase by at least 5%.  I think we will look a lot better. Hopefully he comes back soon!"
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,leeber27,2,Mon Apr 6 17:30:21 2015 UTC,Getting the cup is a very bold statement... This team has to look at making out of the first round. Very hard for a squad to make it to the cup when most of them haven't even won a round.
NewYorkIslanders,31ms6l,_stee,2,Mon Apr 6 21:02:49 2015 UTC,(Shhh I'm trying to bring up the optimism)

NewYorkIslanders,31my2k,purplehumpbackwhale,2,Mon Apr 6 17:58:57 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I feel shafted.
NewYorkIslanders,31my2k,Chrismercy,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:18:38 2015 UTC,"The face value on the tickets is insane.  Round 1 for my seats were 220, and Round 2 is 264 per seat...per game."

It was about $2000 per seat for 8 games in row AA of the 100s.  I doubt any will make it past the next round of season ticket holders.  The good thing is they weren't crazy expensive so some people may dump them for ""cheap"" closer to game time."

NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,Knight_Of_Cups_,12,Mon Apr 6 05:58:13 2015 UTC,"A Isles win and a Senators win Tuesday is my favorite scenario. That puts Pittsburg in real danger of missing the playoffs, which gives me the giggles. Also, I'd prefer the Rags to play a red hot Ottawa over Pittsburg."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,fuccimama79,9,Mon Apr 6 10:42:05 2015 UTC,"And we get to play a very hot Washington team. Not impossible, but ide love a revenge series vs pitts."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,Chrismercy,3,Mon Apr 6 10:47:21 2015 UTC,Its like a pick your poison scenario. Makes me nervous.
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,bullbolony,3,Mon Apr 6 11:11:04 2015 UTC,The good thing w/ the caps is that I saw a stat OV has 23% of the teams goals this year. Put hammer or Leddy on him and he will probably be shut down
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,_stee,6,Mon Apr 6 12:57:57 2015 UTC,"still have to actually beat Holtby, though."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,islander1,2,Mon Apr 6 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"true, but as much as the Islanders struggled to beat Holtby, the Capitals also have struggled to beat Halak.  I'm feeling a lot better about that match up with the improved Islanders PK as of late."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,Waldo19,2,Mon Apr 6 14:47:41 2015 UTC,I'm feeling better simply because Jaro is in playoff form right now. It's the rest of the team that isn't.
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,islander1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"Washington has the best powerplay in the league at over 25%. No matter how hot the pk is, that isn't a winning matchup."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,_jared,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"No doubt. Rule #1 playing Washington is still stay out of the box.   The hope is that with an improved PK and good discipline you can limit the damage over the course of the series.  With the way the PK was performing in the first half of the season it looked like the Caps could win a series almost solely on their PP, even though the Islanders are probably the better team 5v5.  Now I think the Isles PK is good enough that the Islanders advantage 5v5 can carry them through a series with Washington."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,Waldo19,3,Mon Apr 6 15:34:53 2015 UTC,Ovechkin has 4 goals in 4 games vs the Isles this year.
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,_jared,2,Mon Apr 6 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"That's a real comforting stat, the problem I have is every time we seem to play them Cappy/the players forget he's leading in goals and never covers him..."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,leeber27,3,Mon Apr 6 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"We are probably playing the Caps no matter what, in the 2-3 matchup."
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,dedtired,2,Mon Apr 6 11:29:19 2015 UTC,"Pittsburg in real danger of missing the playoffs, which gives me the giggles   I'm getting more of an evil grin from this"
NewYorkIslanders,31lnr4,EinsamWulf,4,Mon Apr 6 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"I, for one, would prefer to play Pittsburgh if it can work out that way. Rematch from a couple of seasons ago, and they look shaky. We almost had them with half the team we have now."
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,escapingNihilism,13,Sun Apr 5 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"Really rooting for pit. I'd hate to see the caps first round with ovi and holtby being this hot. Isles NEED the rush of creaming Pitt the first round to slingshot them through the second.  I also feel that the caps would pose a big challenge to the rags, which I would love to see."
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,leeber27,4,Sun Apr 5 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the Penguins are now in very serious danger of missing the playoffs.  Tuesday's game against Ottawa looms large for them.  By Friday, it may very well be that we have home-ice locked up, and the Penguins are fighting for their playoff lives. Who would have predicted that just a few days ago?"
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,GoldenMarauder,2,Sun Apr 5 19:42:36 2015 UTC,they play @Ottawa and then home against the NYI.  both should have a 'playoff feel' -- the Isles cannot have home ice locked up before the @Pittsburgh game.
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,GoldenMarauder,4,Sun Apr 5 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes they can.  If the Islanders beat Philly on Tuesday and the Penguins lose to Ottawa, that leaves them with 100 and 95 points respectively with two games left, meaning that the Penguins cannot catch the Islanders.  If Washington loses on Sunday to Detroit, and on Wednesday to Boston, then they will have 97 points with one game remaining, which means they cannot reach 100 points either.  So yes, it is very possible for the Islanders to have home ice in the first round locked up before puck-drop on Friday night."
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,GoldenMarauder,3,Sun Apr 5 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"ok, I didn't realize WAS had two games before the PIT game.  thanks"
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,kenlane,2,Sun Apr 5 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"No worries, easy mistake to make.  :)"
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,GoldenMarauder,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:30:54 2015 UTC,Actually my friend was saying this to me exactly a week ago. He's a huge Pit fan so I told him we'd go to playoff games together ( :( ). Pitt is ending there season badly. whoever gets them might win in 4-5 games.
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,lsp2005,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:54:48 2015 UTC,If the Pens make the playoffs they're getting wrecked.  Their defense is so injury-ridden and their depth is collapsing on them.
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,_jared,5,Sun Apr 5 20:10:46 2015 UTC,If Toronto beats Ottawa tonight then are we in the playoffs?
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,lsp2005,4,Sun Apr 5 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"If it's in regulation, yes."
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,kenlane,3,Sun Apr 5 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"Then for tonight's game, go Leafs!"
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,clebo99,3,Sun Apr 5 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"If we win 2 of our next 3 we are in really good shape. I personally think we can, and will win all 3. PHI is beatable if Cappy tells them to get  in front of the net (Mason didn't control rebounds well today). Pitt is currently struggling, and Columbus is ending the season in Fort Neverlose. Nuff said?"
NewYorkIslanders,31jri5,ryan924,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:53:37 2015 UTC,Me living in Baltimore has me hoping for the Caps so I can go to one of the games here in DC with my Isles jersey!!!!
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,FioMonstercat,5,Sun Apr 5 23:49:18 2015 UTC,"To add on to what TriviaWhiz said, not sure how well you know the rules but being home not only gives the fan advantage but also other things as well. For example, the biggest advantage is that the home team changes their lines second. This means that the home team coach can see what line the other team puts out, then act accordingly to always have the best match up. Also, the other rule I can think of is that on faceoffs, the home team puts their stick on the ice second which can help w/ faceoffs too."
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,_stee,11,Mon Apr 6 00:26:59 2015 UTC,"quick, someone send this reply to cappy"
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,nofx516,3,Mon Apr 6 02:37:14 2015 UTC,Also it is your rink which you know better than the other team. Like our chaos creating zamboni door   We lost vs Toronto in a seven game series where home team won all games. Had we been higher seed we may have won that series
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,islesrule224,3,Mon Apr 6 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"They talked about this on hockey night live too. If the devils had home ice or the rangers, maybe one would have beaten the kings. Also the 94 rangers won probably because of home ice too"
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,_stee,4,Mon Apr 6 01:39:07 2015 UTC,94 rangers won cause they bought half of edmontons roster; however i'm sure home ice helped.
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,leeber27,6,Mon Apr 6 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"The higher seeded team gets Game 7 on their home ice if it comes to it. In a series-decider, having home-ice advantage can be critical."
NewYorkIslanders,31kk5x,TriviaWhiz,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:56:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone's comments are right on. Home ice advantaged team also plays the first two games at home too. So, it could swing the series in their favor early."

NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,dedtired,6,Sun Apr 5 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"As long as they don't win in regulation, we're in, right?"
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,Waldo19,6,Sun Apr 5 01:42:43 2015 UTC,ohhh...is that correct. In that case I guess I do want Ottawa to win in OT? So the Islanders secure the playoffs and take sole possession of 2nd in the division.
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,_jared,7,Sun Apr 5 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"You want Ottawa to win in regulation. Islanders need two points to clinch, that's a lot easier than staying ahead of Washington."
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,dedtired,3,Sun Apr 5 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Just checked and according to NHL.com, the senators had to lose in regulation. Dang."
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,Waldo19,2,Sun Apr 5 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"Ok that what I thought. So more or less the worst outcome happened. Sens and Caps got points.    Oh well, Islanders have sole possession of 2nd and the Sens have to win out for the Islanders to get bounced, if the Islanders don't pick up anymore points."
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,_jared,2,Sun Apr 5 01:55:47 2015 UTC,"Isles need to either get two points, or Ottawa miss out on two points to clinch. Since Ottawa just went to OT, they cannot clinch tonight."

NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,trireme32,8,Sun Apr 5 21:39:02 2015 UTC,A win is a win.  Just shut the fuck up and go away if that's your attitude.
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,trireme32,6,Sun Apr 5 01:55:42 2015 UTC,"Seriously - what the FUCK more could you want than a shutout?  Yes, the Sabers are a god-awful team (much like the Isles were in the past 20 years).  But holy shit was their goalie incredible.  Dude made some incredible saves for his 1st game.   And we shut them out.  No, it wasn't the Rags.  It was the worst team in the league.  So be it.  Let me ask - what would've made you happy?  5-0?  10-0?  We got a win, and a shutout to boot.  I presume you were an Isles fan a couple years ago when they came that-damn-close to beating the best team in the league in the playoffs.  You should know that it's all about each individual win.  The Isles got one tonight.  Halak is once again close to yet another record, and is in the company of Smitty and Resch.  JT is in the hunt for the most fucking points scored in one season.  Don't even start to pull the whole ""same old Islanders"" shit - because this isn't the same old Islanders.   I said it before and I'll say it again - if that's your attitude, just shut the fuck up and go away."
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,trireme32,2,Sun Apr 5 02:00:51 2015 UTC,I'll ask again - they got a 3-0 shutout.  What would have made you happier?
NewYorkIslanders,31h87c,sans_,2,Sun Apr 5 02:41:22 2015 UTC,You are the absolute worst type of fan.
NewYorkIslanders,31h864,islesrule224,3,Sun Apr 5 01:31:28 2015 UTC,Wouldn't we be just 2 ahead of Washington if the scores hold? Or are you counting a tiebreaker I'm not considering?
NewYorkIslanders,31h864,Waldo19,2,Sun Apr 5 01:34:33 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I didn't expect them to tie it
NewYorkIslanders,31h864,Waldo19,3,Sun Apr 5 01:42:18 2015 UTC,So its now tied between Ottawa and Washington. I really hope that game doesn't got to OT whoever wins. I really don't want Ottawa to get 2 points and the Caps 1.
NewYorkIslanders,31h864,Eiramasil919,2,Sun Apr 5 01:41:02 2015 UTC,Fucky ah!!!  Sorry so wasted right nozzle.  Go isles!  I love this fucking team!!!!   Yeah!!

NewYorkIslanders,31gegn,Waldo19,2,Sun Apr 5 00:29:32 2015 UTC,Waldo - please - I can't lose another optimist.  The Isles owned this game.  They killed those 4 minutes with authority.  They got the shutout and had great fundamentals throughout.  After all the crap posts I see every game - please don't tell me that you've lost your luster.  Hell - it was just a game ago that you helped bring the energy that snapped the special teams back.
NewYorkIslanders,31gegn,trireme32,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:00:11 2015 UTC,Oh not to worry. I remain an optimist.  That was just a moment of weakness. Thanks for helping keep me grounded.  I was trilled that they played a full 60 and eventually got the goals their play deserved. I'm hoping they can build on it in Philly.

NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,fuccimama79,0,Sun Apr 5 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"Strait has been playing really well and de Haan has not. I know the Strait hate runs high in this sub, but it hasn't been warranted since before January."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Rob_G,5,Sat Apr 4 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think the message has been sent to de Haan at this point. Strait is suppose to be the extra D.. But now he's apparently playing over 20 minutes a game. I don't think Strait has been bad.. But you can't sit de Haan forever, and Id much rather him in there come playoff time then Strait."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,ZoraHockey,3,Sat Apr 4 17:33:33 2015 UTC,I heard Cappy made Boulton captain after his goal last game. He plays solid Islander hockey.
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Rob_G,3,Sat Apr 4 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"To all those wondering, why are you using the same lines, consider this: those same lines got you a 3-1 lead halfway through the 3rd period, and the goal they gave up in the 1st was a fluke.   Now, don't get me wrong those lines shit the bed in the final 10 minutes or whatever. But its not like they got blown out, they just didn't seal the deal.    We are all frustrated and lashing out at Cappy, but the problem wasn't the lineup it was playing on their heels and not finishing the game."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Waldo19,3,Sat Apr 4 17:52:14 2015 UTC,So like every lead we play on our heels? He needs to stop playing that kind of hockey when we have the lead. Also we are 4 games from the playoffs our best lineup needs to be playing. De Haan grabner and Kennedy bring more skill and speed to the team. Boulton and Strait should not be starting for a playoff team.
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,tanu24,2,Sat Apr 4 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest problems all season has been playing with the lead.  I don't think thats a line-up problem.    From a locker-room perspective, sitting Boulton after he scored a goal, and recorded the first 2 Islanders shots of the game sends a weird message. Although a more confident couch would probably do it anyway but I'm not gonna crucify Cappy over that one.  Strait has been a solid 7th d-man for almost 2 months now. De Haans upside is still much better than Straits, but there is no guarantee that that version of De Haan is going to show up.    Strait has at least been consistently serviceable.  If we were a lock for the playoffs, I be starting De Haan because we could survive any growing pains, but we just don't have any cushion anymore. So going with the known quantity may make more sense the gambling with the unknown De Haan.  My bigger point is that the lineups aren't as big an issue as the on-ice coaching."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Waldo19,2,Sat Apr 4 18:35:42 2015 UTC,Any word on Grabner?  With the flu and lower body issues n such?

NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,jpe81,2,Sat Apr 4 16:41:23 2015 UTC,Yup sounds about right. Cappy clearly needs guys who sit in street clothes in the stands to lead us over buffalo. He definitely doesn't believe one the most dangerous penalty killers or a cup champion grinder can do the job..
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,FinalxFlash,2,Sat Apr 4 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"ITT: People complaining about keeping the same lines without offering any suggestions for realignment.   As /u/Waldo19 pointed out, the lines weren't what caused us to lose to Columbus and aren't the primary source of our problems.  We let up when we have a lead. The boys get complacent and just hand over momentum to the other team.   Also if you really think ONE player, whether it be Bailey or Strait or whoever the fuck, is the sole proponent for us (or any other hockey team for that mater) losing, you're insane."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,NordicReagan,3,Sat Apr 4 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Brian Strait is the new random guy from Boston who plays for no reason. Guy is a terrible hockey player. At his best he's our worst dman. If your gonna scratch CDH, why not play Donovan? Strait fucking sucks: isn't physical, can't skate, can't pass. Even the struggling Hickey atleast has a track record of playing well.   Boulton less tight about if only because he plays a competent game as a goon. Still a poor decision. Between Martin and him, how heavy of a lineup do you need? Jackets have some scrappy guys who play hard, made sense. But Sabres? The team is dead. Much rather have Kennedy/Grabner in there.   Cappy = :("
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Stonecipher_LaVache,2,Sat Apr 4 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"You obviously haven't been paying attention to the games since January. Strait plays solid, consistent D. It's really just lame and easy to bash on Strait. It's the Islanders equivalent of going on reddit and writing, ""This."" Donovon is by far the worst player on the team. And de Haan hasn't been playing well in a while. Grabner is obviously hiding an injury, and Kennedy's brief experience with the team has showed a lack of chemistry that, if I were coach, I'd be hesitant to rely on as well.  Seriously, the Isles are doing better than we could have imagined this year. The ""fire Cappy"" bullshit is getting tired. There's a really ugly, negative streak to this fanbase which, up until now, I guess I've always just associated with us having a perpetually losing team. But now that they're doing well? Get out of here, you're making us all look like a bunch of whiny little assholes. At least pay attention to the game before you go online and start repeating the same boring mindless drivel game in and game out."

NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,Rob_G,3,Sat Apr 4 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Permission to joke sir?  Granted  LGI indeed. I'm not going to lie though, the team has been playing like shit lately. I think Cappy has a lot to do with it. He's poison to our young guys. That is just my opinion. Boulton has no place on a team with this much talent.  Edit: and I'm sorry brother, but Strait is fucking awful. He might be the worst player that we have in the organization. Including the Sound Tigers."
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,DukeRamswell,2,Sat Apr 4 17:33:52 2015 UTC,Who are you people that think the Islanders are playing better then projected? We have a talented team. I put money on them winning the cup once Leddy and Boychuck came.   Strait plays average at best defense but anytime he touches the puck it's miserable. He just shoots it off the boards hoping to get it away from goal. He doesn't bring anything extra to the team. We blow leads like it's our job. Kennedy doesn't have chemistry with the team so why sit him with 5 games before the playoffs? Also remember when he played on the top fucking line like 3 games in and now hes out for Boulton. Cap just doesn't know what he doing at an NHL level.
NewYorkIslanders,31fbj4,tanu24,2,Sat Apr 4 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Oh please. Strait is horrific at shot suppression and zone gains, he has no measurable positive aspect to his game. de Haan and Donovan are both capable of moving the puck and CdH is very good at shot suppression. Him and Hamonic are an awful pairing and its not because of Hamonic.   As for fire Cappy, dudes an ok coach who makes some poor lineup choices. His man crush on Strait, if it continues in the playoffs, will be an issue. Kennedy was playing fine, hes a player who shoots the puck at all times, he's not a thinking player. His chemistry wasnt an issue in games I observed, hes a bit like Grabo in that his game has a natural lone-wolf look to it."

NewYorkIslanders,31eep7,lighthousefisherman,9,Sat Apr 4 07:15:34 2015 UTC,I remember the only thing keeping my hope alive during the 08-09 season was the chance at Tavares. Rock on Buffalo.

NewYorkIslanders,31crdx,viewless25,9,Fri Apr 3 21:53:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather go into the playoffs with momentum rather than limp into the playoffs prior to getting swept in the first round
NewYorkIslanders,31crdx,xchester77,2,Fri Apr 3 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"As long as the kinks get worked out, AND they still make the playoffs above a wildcard seed, I'm ok with anything.   Giving up two goal leads is unfortunately the number one kink the isles have had for a few years now. So much so, feel like it's part of the fabric of the team. No matter the goaltender or defensemen, in this system, no lead is safe.  If these losses only serve to deflate confidence, and reinforce negative feelings on the team (which I personally believe they do) then I could live without them.  I really hope they can sort this out before they have to play montreal or tampa in the first round."

I'd almost rather not make the playoffs than get the 8th seed and get crushed by the Rags in round 1.

NewYorkIslanders,31biua,JAAAS,5,Fri Apr 3 16:14:37 2015 UTC,Isles-Rags has to be the second round - HAS TO BE
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,Skooby14,2,Fri Apr 3 17:24:44 2015 UTC,Or they get out round 1
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,Salacondor,8,Fri Apr 3 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"Alright.. I'm just gonna say it. Islanders v Rangers would be an all out war. Losing to the Rangers would be the single greatest blows to our egos I can honestly begin to Imagine. Now, with that being said look around the east. Watch a Rangers game. I really think we stand the best chance at taking them out. However big or small that chance may be. I don't believe any team could come out to play with the same level of intensity that we would. I'm not saying other teams wouldn't play to win but for us it's more personal. That goes both ways. I think if we really want to see round two we need to play a team the guys REALLY want to beat. Sometimes to get the job done you have to do it yourself, and I think this may be that time for us. This is a go big or go home type post season for us. This is OUR best shot at keeping them from the cup. I'd love for their ""magical"" season to come to an abrupt end by our hand."
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,Chrismercy,8,Fri Apr 3 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think the Rangers have way more to lose than the Islanders if we played a series together.  The Rangers are in win-now mode, this is their time to win a championship.  Us, on the other hand are still in 'getting better / rebuilding' mode.  If we lose then whatever, we still have a few years before we hit our full potential."
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,NYKyle610,2,Fri Apr 3 18:01:03 2015 UTC,Halak has been superb against them this season. We have been great against Lundqvist. We only lost our 2 games when Talbot played. We all know Hank will be in net for them through the majority of the post season. I wouldn't exactly be excited to see them round one but certainly not the worst thing for us.
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,Chrismercy,2,Fri Apr 3 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more, the most I want is to win a round, anything after that is just icing on the cake. As you said, rags have a shit ton more to lose this season considering they don't have too much of a future, all we gotta do this seasons is prove to the team and fan base that we're improving by winning a series. Next few seasons is where it's important for the isles"
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,leeber27,0,Fri Apr 3 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"As much as we all talk, I don't think any true Islanders or Rangers fan wants to actually play each other. Aside from the embarrassment and heckling for the fans from the other at a direct loss, if these two teams meet in the playoffs it will be all out war and whoever stumbles out of the series alive, will be shot and have nothing left in the tank for their next opponent."
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,mgiblue21,3,Fri Apr 3 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yes I do. For that exact reason. I'm a true Islander fan but I do not realistically see this as our year. This was a year of great emergence for us but we aren't a cup team..yet. That being said, unfortunately the Rags are.. I'm just being real. Now what would be better then A. Beating them outright -or- B. Making it as physically hard for them as humanly possible?  I would take them head on Rd. One happily."
NewYorkIslanders,31biua,Chrismercy,-1,Fri Apr 3 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"War is an understatement. Nothing good comes from this series. Either the Isles win and we have to hear excuses for the foreseeable future about why the Rags lost, or the Isles lose and we have to hear how they're the ""better"" team for a foreseeable future.   Personally I don't feel like dealing with their bullshit."

NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,_stee,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. Two points, the podcast guys also pointed out that even though CBJ have been playing well, there score adjusted corsi is still 46% or something awful during their wining streak (aka they are still playing bad).

NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,mgiblue21,4,Fri Apr 3 02:22:14 2015 UTC,Okposo has not been himself since coming back from the injury.
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,Skooby14,5,Fri Apr 3 12:58:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, I agree with this more than Okposo was good because be played with JT - not the case (just look at last year after JT went down - Kyle was fine).  He was a power forward tough to move off the puck and always driving to the net.  This was prior to the injury.  Since back, he is knocked off the puck constantly, has no vision (pun intended) on the ice and looks tired and tentative.  I hope this is just a conditioning issue.  They need this guy if they want to make some noise in the playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,mgiblue21,2,Fri Apr 3 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"Its probably part conditioning at least. And part is his timing is off, which only repetition can give you. He's definitely not one of the players that is only good with JT. But he's not the Okposo we know right now either."
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,tanu24,2,Fri Apr 3 13:48:03 2015 UTC,"Can I say this here?

Points earned head to head  Islanders have beaten the Pens 3 out of 4 games with one remaining and hold that tiebreaker.  Islanders and Caps split the season series, but the Islanders won both their games in OT, Caps one in SO one in regulation, and hold one more point.

NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,islander1,3,Fri Apr 3 13:55:03 2015 UTC,"tanking continues.  What's worse is, Halak is literally playing his best hockey since November.  His save% since March 1st is .923  That would be plenty good enough for us to make a Stanley cup run. Except our offense is in the toilet after pretty much carrying Halak much of the year.  Seriously, other then the months of November and March, Halak has almost literally been no better than Nabakov. His save% those other months are comically poor:  .889, .898, .901, and a barely passable .910."
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,CaptWinkie,3,Fri Apr 3 12:25:39 2015 UTC,It seems like we can't get our whole game clicking at once. Did you say our Goaltending has been good!? Let's dry up offensively guys! /s    So frustrating to watch such a talented team hit the skids so hard so close to the playoffs.
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,islander1,2,Fri Apr 3 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"There's still time/ability to turn it around. If I had to have one or the other happening going into April, I'd rather have Halak in-form, to be honest.  We were never going anywhere with him playing subpar.  Yeah, we were in first the whole time, but people shouldn't fool themselves. A .910 or below save % is getting you nowhere come playoff time.  The game is completely different. 91% is barely average now."
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,CaptWinkie,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:08:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, having a strong goaltender is paramount to making any kind of run in the playoffs. But that goaltender has to play behind at least a somewhat competent defensive corps as well, and they've been missing assignments, making sloppy clearances and turning over the puck. These issues seem to be plaguing the team as a whole though, not just the defensemen."
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,islander1,2,Fri Apr 3 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"When I saw we were outshot 39 to 26 or whatever, I thought I had it backwards.  The Islanders most of this season would have been the team with 39 shots."

NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,deathops,0,Fri Apr 3 01:49:54 2015 UTC,pretty frustrating loss. Combination of Isles incompetence and ref incompetence makes these types of losses so hard to stomach. Thank god we got one point out of it though.
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,xam2y,-1,Fri Apr 3 01:52:01 2015 UTC,Those incompetent refs gave you guys a power play in the last 2 minutes of the game...

NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,xam2y,-1,Fri Apr 3 02:36:17 2015 UTC,Because I wanted to see what people thought of the refs.
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,DrPepcraft,5,Fri Apr 3 02:38:12 2015 UTC,They missed calls on both sides like always.
NewYorkIslanders,319hn8,deathops,3,Fri Apr 3 02:41:22 2015 UTC,I never said they called things not in our favor. Rather I think games with shitty reffing are frustrating all around because it leads to so many what ifs. Like what if the cross check on Tavares had been called? Could have been a different ending. It's unfortunate is all. Don't see how I deserve downvotes for thinking that.

In terms of getting there, you need a car.  Public transportation is horrible in the area of the Coliseum so it's the easiest way to get there just a heads up.  This is the page for the team store.  It has the address, hours, phone number and what not.  Check it out it should help you."

The team store has tons of cool Merch but if you're staying in Manhattan I'd recommend checking out the NHL store instead.
NewYorkIslanders,317u7m,jokesonjokes,3,Thu Apr 2 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"Williams is a decent prospect. Had excellent Fresh and Junior numbers, had to fight for his starter job as a Soph. Isles best G prospects are Sorokin, Williams, then probably Poulin (though hes likely getting released this offseason).Motte is on an AHL deal, but probably him next? Then McAdams and Soderstrom I guess.  Sorokin is the one guy to watch. Drew alot of praise from scouts, one of Russia's best young goalies. Signed for a few years and was the KHL's youngest starter, but was acquired at trade deadline by CSKA, the elite of the KHL. Could see icetime dip but also could be used as a starter. Performed well in his stint there. They have two vets but one is a Canadien NHL bust, the other an ok Russian guy. Struggled at times in the WJC, but was lights out vs Canada stopping 50 of 51. If he takes that starter spot he's gonna get ALOT of attention next year as he's also slated to play on the WJC roster again."

But he hasnt taken the starter role yet, they split three games between two goalie who were holdovers from before they went D1 who still have a year of NCAA eligibility. Unless he plays lights out better than them, he's not gonna get a look at starter till his senior year when they are graduated."

How do you blow a 2 goal lead in the third against a team that has nothing but pride to play for? Why are you in a defensive shell? Keep them hustling and playing hard and this game is over. Capuano needs to go."
NewYorkIslanders,318hnl,IslesMetsJets44,6,Fri Apr 3 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"seriously this a thousand times.  What other team gives up 2 and 3 goal leads in the third period, every single game!    That being said, islanders just got a huge break with this PP.  maybe they can score this time."
NewYorkIslanders,318hnl,hockeycrazy033,6,Fri Apr 3 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"Nope. But you know, Tavares gets cross checked in the back, no call. Crosby, Ovi, Nash, stamkos...they get that call."

It would be awesome to be able to consistently go to an ""Isles Bar"" for games. Anyone want to try and sort that out, so we can gather attendance momentum over these five final games?

I don't care is the blue jackets won 7 straight, you have to win that game. 3-1 in the third should be a lock for a playoff bound team but we have an AHL coach.

NewYorkIslanders,318hnl,islesandpizza,2,Fri Apr 3 01:50:17 2015 UTC,Capuano needs to go. Capuano needs to go. Capuano. Needs. To. Go. Giving up wins with 3 goals in the third happens WAY TOO OFTEN to this team. They did a great job on a PK that should have never been called (I've seen refs dish out weak penalties way too often in the first minute of OT in pro and college hockey this season) but they need to work on not getting in these situations. As much as I want to see us win a Cup I really want to see Capuano go instead.

It's been a fun ride filled with the highest highs and some very low lows. We saw some rookies emerge with some great talent. Locked up 2 heavy hitters on defense and watched a goalie set franchise records. Right now all I wanna see is them make the playoffs and at the very least try their damnedest to win. Before last night our magic number was 5. That's 2 games and and OT. We can view last night as that OT and now we only need two wins. realistically you were assuming that game as a loss right up until the second period i'm sure. These guys managed to pull a point out even with an incompetent coaching staff. They really are playing with a significant handicap in that reguard. I would bet money if you slapped a different logo on their chest and put them in front a different coach we would clinched by now, is that a fair statement? It would truthfully hurt us long term if cappy could have rode the backs of these players without a hiccup and was viewed in a better light then he actually  deserved. I truthfully can't imagin jack wiggling his way out of this. So, lets get a new coaching staff, a piece or two in free agency and make next year our year."

They either secure a playoff spot tomorrow (if Caps win), or reclaim the 2nd seed (if Sens win). Both good things.  Provided the Islanders take care of business in Buffalo.  The worst outcome would be an Islanders loss and an Ottawa overtime win, where the Caps also get points.   Last night sucked, because not only did the Islanders lose in the SO, every other game broke the wrong way. Rags, OTT, Caps, and Bruins ALL won and many of those teams were behind for a significant portion of the game.  Fucking ridiculous.    However, its important to keep in mind that while the Islanders are struggling so is Pittsburgh and Detroit. So its not like the Islanders are the only team stumbling.  You know..for what thats worth.  The Islanders have the 3rd seed right now and still control their own playoff destiny in most respects, with 4 games to go.  It is still a better position than most other teams in the NHL.    Win tomorrow and everything gets easier."

NewYorkIslanders,317nmr,CaptWinkie,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:42:43 2015 UTC,I don't think it's terrible to sit Kennedy for one game and have Boulton come in. One big hit and/or fight can really light a fire under our team.

NewYorkIslanders,319o66,_jared,3,Fri Apr 3 03:25:49 2015 UTC,I don't
NewYorkIslanders,319o66,ArtyThePoopie,3,Fri Apr 3 03:08:52 2015 UTC,The second round shouldn't even be a part of any discussion right now.
NewYorkIslanders,319o66,CaptWinkie,-1,Fri Apr 3 03:47:06 2015 UTC,"I hope we make the fucking playoffs. We're in some serious shit right now. I'm tired of the forged optimism of this sub, it's time to be real. This team is choking. And we will be lucky to even sniff the second round with our current style of play."
NewYorkIslanders,319o66,IslesMetsJets44,3,Fri Apr 3 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"Playoffs are all but guaranteed at this point. What team with 96 points have you ever seen miss the playoffs? While yes I'd love home ice advantage, I'm not in panic mode. If we find ourselves down 2-0 in the first round, then I'll go to panic mode.  Edit: 95 points is the record for most points in a season without reaching the playoffs."
NewYorkIslanders,319o66,eggy333,0,Fri Apr 3 09:52:43 2015 UTC,"The playoffs are not guaranteed. The senators are hot, the capitals are hot, the Penguins are the Penguins. The Bruins are the only team Playing like us. There is a chance that if we don't turn this shit around, we could miss the playoffs. We have to beat buffalo, but then we have three tough games left that are not guaranteed wins."
NewYorkIslanders,319o66,IslesMetsJets44,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"I see no point in being pessimistic about something I have no control over. Is me getting upset about the team going to have any positive impact? Nope.  That said, I totally get your frustration. We've been playing shitty lately but Id rather them get this out of their system now than have it start once the playoffs do."
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,tacofever,2,Thu Apr 2 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say Pulock makes the team next year since we probably won't be resigning Vis. It looked like he was going to be brought up this year before we signed Leddy and Boychuck anyway.  As for forwards, I'd say we'll still pretty much be the same team. The only question marks in my mind are Kennedy and Grabner. Kennedy hasn't shined too brightly since he's arrived (I mean, he hasn't been here super long and expectations weren't crazy high for him to begin with but still) and Grabner is sort of the odd man out. Solid on the PK and has tremendous speed, but his shot has always been lackluster.  Not sure if we make any sort of trades come off season. I still think what the team really needs is a legitimate goal-scorer/sniper for the first line but management is probably just going to sit and wait for Dal Colle to satisfy that need. Not a huge deal, but it would awesome if we could find something."
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,NordicReagan,5,Thu Apr 2 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"Dal Colle and Ho-Sang are not eligible to play in AHL or NHL until 16-17 season.  Lubo and Kennedy probably won't be back.  Have to think Poluck and Reinhart have a solid chance to make the team barring any injuries and a solid camp.  Other than JT on the first line and some combo of Martin/Cizikas/Clutterbuck/McDonald on the 4th predicting the lineup, let alone the actual lines, for next year is almost impossible at this point in time."
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,johnzanussi,2,Thu Apr 2 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Dal Colle and Ho-Sang are not eligible to play in AHL or NHL until 16-17 season.   They're on ELC's, they can be called to the NHL rosters at the beginning of the season, but have to stay there. And they can't be placed on any AHL or ECHL rosters. So they are eligible, and Dal Colle has a solid chance of making the roster.  You're probably right about Kennedy and Lubo, I might throw Grabner and Hickey in there as well.  They do, but Reinhart's development has definitely been concerning."
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,viewless25,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:45:04 2015 UTC,I think they'll give Reinhart another year down in the AHL. Defensemen are notorious for taking longer to develop. No rush to get him up here anyway.
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,NordicReagan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:44:55 2015 UTC,I think Pulock has a better chance than Reinhart.  Mayfield might get a look too.
NewYorkIslanders,317jo3,jackwoww,0,Thu Apr 2 20:48:17 2015 UTC,I think the lineup for next year should look like: DalColle - JT - Strome   Grabner - Neilson - KO  Lee - Nelson - Bailey  Kuli - Grabovski - Clutterbuck   Leddy - Boychuck   Dehaan - Hammer   Hickey - Pulock   Although I doubt they don't play Martin (should take over Boultons fighter role in the press box) and Cizikas.  It also seems cappy doesn't like grabner so idk.  If this is the lineup they will without a doubt have the deepest/highest scoring offense in the league.  Reinhart needs a little more seasoning but I can see him replacing Hickey (whose a great 6/7 D)

NewYorkIslanders,312fjx,thewrongflag,2,Wed Apr 1 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"If the Islanders can't win against mediocre and terrible teams when they have to, then they can't be expected to win against the best in the NHL. This is a test, just like every stretch of tough hockey they played through this season.  The good news is that even if they fail this particular test miserably, they'll still almost certainly see playoff hockey."
NewYorkIslanders,312fjx,fuccimama79,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"The Islanders have a bit of a history of taking the pedal off the gas against weaker teams and/or starting slow.   One need only look at the Toronto game a few weeks back, where it took a herculean effort in the 3rd to secure points or the multiple blown 3 goal leads earlier in the season where the Islanders pissed away points.    As long as they put in a full 60 minute effort against these teams they should get points of these games. However, because of the march Skid the cushion is all but gone, so they really can't take anything for granted.   As long as they take care of business the 2 or 3 is their for the taking. Faulter and well...who knows."
NewYorkIslanders,3107ji,islesandpizza,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"Well so since Ottawa won in the shootout, they can only tie the Islanders ROW for the season, which would then bring them to head to head which is also a tie (Isles actually have the head to head advantage in real life but the first game in the Coliseum isn't counted because they have played and uneven amount of games against each other).  The next Ottawa non ROW or Islander ROW will subtract another point from their magic number."
NewYorkIslanders,3107ji,mcbordes,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yes because the magic number is now 5 for us which means we cant clinch on Thursday.  If we win both games and Ottawa only gets a point or less then we clinch that way, If we only get a point in two games, but Ottawa looses both games then we also clinch that way. And the date is 3/31"
NewYorkIslanders,3107ji,bones074306,2,Wed Apr 1 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"Should have specified, the article is from 3/29. It looks like our odds of clinching are pretty solid though, playing Columbus and Buffalo."

The Islanders are making next to nothing on their current lease agreement... which is why they had to move in the first place.  The idea that they will somehow make LESS money in Brooklyn is just so absurd as to almost be an April Fools joke."
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,5_on_3,14,Wed Apr 1 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"Nassau politicians grasping at straws. At this point, it's comical whenever these stories are released. The Islanders are going to Brooklyn. Increasing seating at the Coliseum isn't bringing them back, slapping a fresh coat of paint on the bathrooms isn't bringing them back, putting more porta-potties outside isn't bringing them back. Putting less dated HD tvs in the concourse isn't bringing them back. Need I go on with the asinine ways that Nassau County thinks they can lure the Islanders back, all the while dancing around the 3000 pound elephant in the room?  Nothing short of selling the Coliseum and all of the surrounding land to the Islanders/owners and allowing them to build a development in addition to the Coliseum so ownership of the Islanders can make money on owning the team, is bringing the Islanders back.   If the county couldn't figure all of this out since 1972, what makes these jackasses think they can get this all accomplished in 5 years.  It's like a bad break up. Nassau County being the ex who just can't get it through their thick fuckin heads that the relationship is over. Making promises of ""I'll change.""

A significant portion of the fans you see at Nassau are from Brooklyn, manhattan, Staten Island and Queens/rockaways. We have been making the commute season after season through thick and thin for this team. Frankly, if L.I natives can't figure it all out for the Islanders then maybe we really do deserve the team over here."

NewYorkIslanders,30y870,5_on_3,2,Wed Apr 1 11:37:20 2015 UTC,I am sure. The Islanders will not be returning to Nassau Coliseum in 5 years. Those diehards will be replaced by fairweather fans in Brooklyn. Maybe those fairweather fans will become diehards. But at the end of the day a fairweather fan's money is just as green as a diehard fan's money.

Nassau County and the Town of Hempstead had the chance to keep the team here.  Yes, they may not have been great back in the day, but how many true suburban areas can say they have a professional league sports franchise? Not many, that's where the Isles were unique; they built their whole identity on being Islanders and not city folk.  This should have been enough reason to keep them here because one day they were going to become a better team, and now that has come.  Now politicians are pretending to care and think they can try to win the team back.  Kate Murray is a rotten bitch who basically let slip away one of the few real assets this area had.  Brooklyn is better than out of the New York area, even in an arena not designed for hockey, but it just won't be the same even if they play 6 games a season in the renovated arena."

We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.   —Charles Wang, 2000.  Barring a turnaround this season, the trend of losing in the playoffs has not been altered by our penny-pinching real estate mogul/slumlord criminal Computer Associates jackass.  He opened up his wallet this year for the first time in 14 years, to impress Ledecky and Malkin while still employing an AHL coach, a completely gutted scouting staff, and alienating almost every Islander great at one point or another (mostly LaFontaine and Trottier).  While he will get the credit for ""keeping the Islanders in New York"", people will conveniently forget he invested absolutely dick zero into putting a winning product on the ice.  I use the word invest because I don't think he realizes how much of the money he lost was his fault entirely for lowballing players over the years and trusting an idiot Mike Milbury."
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,RebeccaNobody,3,Tue Mar 31 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"people will conveniently forget he invested absolutely dick zero into putting a winning product on the ice.

NewYorkIslanders,30y870,thenewguru2,-2,Wed Apr 1 01:03:58 2015 UTC,"And he learned the hard way that things dont always work out the way he wants. Or he didnt, as evidenced by how he has completely gutted this organization in every way. If the fucking retard had any idea how sports work, the isles would never be leaving. Wang thought he could put a garbage product on the ice for years and stil get what he wanted. THIS IS HIS FAULT"
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,hockeycrazy033,3,Wed Apr 1 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"theres many to blame, but Wang is not one of them.  He tried twice to keep the team on the island."

Fans clamored for years for him to add veterans in key spots, and it's no coincidence that the year Snow was finally able to do that (Leddy, Boychuk, Halak, Grabbo, Kulemin) was the year the Isles rocketed towards 100 points."
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,hockeycrazy033,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"I was mostly speaking on the subject of not being his fault the Islanders are leaving Nassau.   Sure it was frustrating when he would only pay league floor, and that sucked, but Idk if I even fully blame him after the way Nassau county treated him and the Islanders.  They turned down his plans for the Lighthouse project, which would have helped make money, so after that, If I was owner of the team that was losing money every year, I wouldn't open my wallet either."
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,gotroot801,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Well, luckily he's pretty low on the blame list. I think he has to bear more blame than Ed Mangano, but way less than Kate Murray and Jay Jacobs.  But I think if the team were more successful when he went looking for approval to build the Lighthouse it would have been a much easier sell. The fact that so many politicians are falling all over themselves to keep the team here all of a sudden now that they're winning is a pretty good corollary."

I think a split home arena situation could occur as well.  But I agree with most of the posters here.  Fuck Nassau County and Garden City for fucking letting the only real LI sports franchise out of their grasp.  Fuck them all..."
NewYorkIslanders,30y870,briankev,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"This is coming from a Rangers fan, but someone who grew up in Nassau County and has attended quite a number of Islander games at Nassau Coliseum.  I felt during the whole debacle between ownership and the county, the Islanders were too demanding of having full development rights over the area, but the county retaliated with pretty much no concessions at all.  Long story short, I could totally see why Wang and ownership didn't want to build and develop based on the restrictions of the county.  I also completely see the county's (and its constituents) rationale for not paying/subsidizing an arena.  In any event, it remains to be seen what impact Barclays will have on the Islanders.  If they field a good team, folks will turn out and support the team.  Sure, there will be more hipsters and all, but the fans will be there if the team wins.    Even if the team doesn't win, the move makes financial sense based on the precedent the Nets set in moving to Brooklyn.  The Nets literally have the poorest TV viewership, yet are drawing two times the number of viewers they had when they were the NJ Nets.  They are also probably valued close to twice their valuation in Jersey."
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,livefromjewyork,2,Tue Mar 31 21:16:25 2015 UTC,PLAYOFFS?  I think when we clinch we'll hear from the team
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,viewless25,4,Tue Mar 31 21:39:13 2015 UTC,Whats that?   ...  PLAYOFFS?!
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,ill_regret_this,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:09:31 2015 UTC,There is an hfboards thread discussing this. They have concluded but not confirmed that  no tickets will be available to the general public since STH have lost their rights to extra tickets and the isles sold a ton of those February ten pack with playoff right reservation packages. One poster also said someone is suing them for the package being overpriced. No STH will have their accounts charged until they officially clinch according to the little reps that are still employed. I'm basically reiterating that thread from memory so go check it out if you want a more solid answer
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,bewareofjames,2,Tue Mar 31 23:29:39 2015 UTC,I would be very surprised if this is true.  Take anything HFBoards says with a mountain of salt.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,GoldenMarauder,0,Wed Apr 1 00:06:29 2015 UTC,If there's one thing I've learned about hfboards after years of browsing hfboards it's that you really shouldn't believe most things you read on hfboards.   The users tend to be overly dramatic and tend to exaggerate. Especially since the move to Brooklyn was announced. There's a lot of salty long islanders slandering the organization because they're all butthurt the isles are leaving. Take everything you read there with a massive grain of salt.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,Questionguy58,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:48:28 2015 UTC,Playoff tickets have already been sold to season ticket holders and 10 game plan holders.  They are all gone.  I was told by my rep that 1300 tickets remained after the first round of sales to STH and partial plan holders and none would be available to the general public.  I'm fairly certain they will list them on Stubhub themselves.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,mcbordes,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:07:10 2015 UTC,Just got an email from the team. Season ticket holders will have the option to purchase two additional tickets for both the first and second round.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,johnzanussi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:43:42 2015 UTC,Well someone else has been a season ticket holder since before 1990.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,mcbordes,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:05:13 2015 UTC,I bought 2 on stubhub for $500.
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,Chrismercy,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"Reiterating what's already been said but, most 1st and 2nd round tickets have already been purchased by sth/partial plan holders. The plan holders received an invoice which was due March 20th.  The team did the same thing in 2013 which is exactly why I jumped on that 10 game February plan this year.  HOWEVER, I would keep your eyes peeled. In 2013 the team released the limited number of leftover tickets to the general public with very little warning shortly after they clinched. At first just the first round and then the second a few days later."
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,ls1allday,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:52:32 2015 UTC,It looked like on Stubhub they only had tickets for if they get home advantage. Will there be tickets for the other games God forbid they don't get it or do those tickets switch to the other games?
NewYorkIslanders,30z1eb,dekushrub150,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"By home game 1, I'm guessing they mean the first home game of the series and so forth.

The tickets on sale at Stubhub are most likely not tickets they actually have on hand, but the promise of tickets they will acquire once they go on sale."

NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,CaptWinkie,7,Tue Mar 31 18:40:32 2015 UTC,I think Hammer has gone from good to great. Not sure if maybe AMac held him back in the past but now he is fantastic.
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,isles27,4,Tue Mar 31 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"I agree - Hammer has become a great shut-down defenseman, and he is picking his chances and moving with the puck well too."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,Skooby14,3,Tue Mar 31 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"Hamonic has to be the winner.  He has been quietly fantastic-- Leddy and Boychuk were the flashier names, but Hammer has been excellent."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,mattymonkees,8,Tue Mar 31 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"I hate to admit it, but Bailey has exceeded my expectations. I used to bash him incessantly but he has picked his game up pretty consistently thus far."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,DukeRamswell,0,Tue Mar 31 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"i disagree that Bailey has stepped it up ""this year"". He's only slightly ahead of his point totals from last year. I think he's been much better than he has in the past but I wouldn't say the difference was made this season."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,Questionguy58,2,Tue Mar 31 18:38:01 2015 UTC,I'd say he's put it all together this year.  His back checking skills alone are enough for me to say he's stepped up

NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,johnzanussi,2,Tue Mar 31 19:14:59 2015 UTC,I know he has a major cool down but we cannot forget what Brock did for this club early in the season. He was a real driving force behind a lot of the success that we are still riding today. I vote 29.
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,Chrismercy,2,Tue Mar 31 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"Cizikas has come back strong and Hickey continues to make things happen, but Strome is really coming into his own."

NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,GoldenMarauder,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"Guys previously on team: Bailey no question. He's played a physical, two-way game that lets him fit anywhere as a positive piece. Bailey may not be a core guy, but he can play all 3 forward positions and brings a solid combo of speed, grinding, and soft hands/decent vision to play on our top lines.  New faces: Leddy. Had a lot to prove after getting called out by coach and having his ability to compete called into question.   Kulemin also, though Malkin tried recruiting him heavily so its really more that Toronto has bad judgement (expected him to produce more, cut ties when he couldnt) more than he's played any differently."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,Stonecipher_LaVache,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"How has no one said Brock Nelson? Yes, he did have a streak of points and then it died out a little, but this guy is a great skater, good stickhandler, I would say behind Strome he's our best young guy forward."
NewYorkIslanders,30y7v8,vbar44,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:59:19 2015 UTC,Brock Nelson and espcially Anders Lee.  have established themselves as perfectly legitimate 2nd/3rd line NHL forwards.
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Joppop1,20,Tue Mar 31 02:41:38 2015 UTC,"He's pretty much what I expected, which is a good thing. He's not an elite, top 5 goaltender, and I didn't expect him to be. But he's very good, quite an upgrade from recent years, and seems to always give the team a chance to win. I'm very happy with his debut season."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,ZoraHockey,5,Tue Mar 31 03:04:46 2015 UTC,Same. I like him. He's not flashy but when his positioning is good he plays amazing
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,_stee,2,Tue Mar 31 04:31:41 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. Once our defense has time to mature and come together, itll take a lot off of him and hopefully allow him to shine even more"
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,AfellowchuckerEhh,2,Tue Mar 31 13:20:09 2015 UTC,"We've all seen how a better defense can make a goalie look better, which I expect us to have next season, so good times are continuing to come"
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,ZoraHockey,2,Tue Mar 31 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"I think you sum him up in one sentence better than anyone can in ten - He seems to always give the team a chance to win.  He's no better, no worse."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,vbar44,14,Tue Mar 31 14:10:21 2015 UTC,He's been delightful. I definitely feel better about last year's Vanek catastrophe knowing that the 4th round pick we got out of it was used to acquire the goalie who would make the All Star game for us and break 2 franchise records in his first season.
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,viewless25,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you - too many comments in here about Halak being ""adequate"" or ""average"".  Come on, people - he is nothing short of fantastic for this club and is having an amazing year (I don't really give a shit about the stats because I feel like he is a stalwart back there and gives the team confidence to just go out and play their game).  Jaro!  Jaro!"
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Skooby14,4,Tue Mar 31 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Defineitly an upgrade, he has some major flaws like how he handles the puck but nonetheless he's an upgrade."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Salacondor,2,Tue Mar 31 03:12:17 2015 UTC,He's really a under-rated puck handler. He made two costly mistakes midway through the season nobody can forget.
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,eggy333,3,Tue Mar 31 03:57:03 2015 UTC,He can do some pretty risky stuff
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Salacondor,3,Tue Mar 31 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"DiPietro - now that was ""risky stuff"" when it came to puck-handling.  Haven't seen Halak go up to center ice to play the puck yet."

NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,eggy333,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:58:10 2015 UTC,Through the season he sailed out from behind the net upwards of about 5 empty netters.  Edit: He has been way more careful as of recently
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Chrismercy,3,Tue Mar 31 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"Why I haven't looked for a reddit NYI board having been on HFBoards for so long I have no clue.   Greetings from a Isles fan since 93 currently in Texas. Here's hoping for good things this postseason!  Halak is a teeny bit shaky, but oddly will come up big as needed a little more often than not.  I think he was overworked this season, but Chad Johnson proved to be a product of the Bruins statistically, and Neuvirth is still getting acclimated."

NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,whistlemissile,3,Tue Mar 31 15:12:58 2015 UTC,Bring back slick Ricky!   Just kidding. He's a great upgrade in net.
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,cwgbobbo,2,Tue Mar 31 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"I think he's been great and an absolute upgrade from last year; which is exactly what this team needed. By no means is he an allstar and sure, he made some mistakes. However, a lot of people forget he's always been fighting for that number 1 slot on a lot of teams. This is really one the few seasons that he's played as the number 1; that's something that's really hard on a goalie.  Something I look forward to is next season where he'll get his ""rookie"" starter season out tof the way and learn from his mistakes and improve on them in the off season and be even better next season."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,leeber27,2,Tue Mar 31 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think he's been more or less what the Islnaders were probably hoping for when they signed him.   His age isn't an issue so the 4 year term is not a problem, and it gives the Islanders time to develop some quality depth in nets as well.   I'm a Habs fan, so forgive me if they have a good goalie pool and I'm ignorant to the fact.   I think that it'd be a shrewd move this offseason to try and get an upper echelon back up. Halak has never been a 60+ game goalie and he has had some injury issues in his career regardless as well. Not really sure who would fit the bill, or if maybe acquiring a younger guy with some potentail makes more sense, but I think that for 2015/2016 if they have a guy who COULD play for 6-8 weeks if need be, and if not, give a solid 30-35 games, that'd go a long way to helping the team next year.  They have the cap space for it too."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,TheJustin72,2,Tue Mar 31 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"Halak has exceeded all reasonable expectations. It just gets drowned out in what will probably be looked back on as the season of the goalie.    With guys like Ottawa's Hamburgler, the Wild's Dubnyk, and the Rangers Talbot all coming out of more or less nowhere. Not to mention the other great goal tenders in the league, many of who went on impressive runs at different times in the season. Halaks great year gets lost.   The winning streak was awesome. Also, he could easily have two more shutouts on the year, were it not for lazy play in front of him in the last 30 seconds of those games.   Despite the rough start yesterday, that stacked pad save in crunch time was key. He is certainly good enough for a Stanley Cup contending team."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,Waldo19,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Enroth, Neuvirth, and Lindback who played way above their level for the worst team in the league."
NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,McArctic,2,Tue Mar 31 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"I mean the numbers speak for themselves in terms of records. He set two franchise records in less than a season. Most consecutive wins and most wins in a single regular season. Those show he is a promising upgrade, definitely, but I'm realistic about Jaro and I wouldn't put him up there with the elites. However, with the team we were building before the start of the season, he was exactly what we needed: a goaltender with diverse experience that isn't too old. Nabby had quite the resume when we got him, but he was past his prime. Jaro has been shipped around all over the place and has played with many different players and teams. He get can get slumpy, but that's nothing to fixate on with his first season playing for a new team. He knows how to play, he's realistic about his own flaws and what he needs to improve on, and he's very good at staying level headed when he's on the ice.  That kind of mentality is what you want in a goaltender. He's the kind of guy who can be a team leader from his crease. Also, you can tell the guys love him. That's important. Jaro certainly has chemistry with the team.   All-in-all, he's the biggest upgrade we've had in a while and I admire his dedication to always improving his game, his leadership qualities, and his visible chemistry with the team. That's a goalie those guys want to fight for and not disappoint."

Absolutely great pickup and a HUGE reason we are where we are in the standings. I don't want to hear he gives up soft goals and makes bad decisions cause EVERY NHL goalie does that now and again, if Nabby was still goalie then we would be fighting for a playof spot.

NewYorkIslanders,30vsv1,slapshot18,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"He's been exactly what the Islanders need him to be: simply average. Every goalie has good games and bad games, highlight reel saves and soft goals. All they needed was for Halak to have a couple more good games than bad ones. I don't think anyone is deluded enough to think these Islanders are a team that depends on goaltending, they are a run and gun team. When you play that style, 2.5-3 GA per night is going to be enough."

NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,Punk_In_Drublic16,2,Tue Mar 31 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"I bought a Nielsen one recently and they needed to make it because they had none on hand. I bought it like 20 minutes before the start of the game and it was done by the first intermission. If they need to make it then it is best to order before the first period,."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,moonyj,3,Tue Mar 31 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"IIRC, They have the press in the concourse, but they a lot of pre-made sweaters on hand in the team store as well, behind the counter. The team store definitely has the popular ones, like Tavares and Okposo. They probably have Strome too. I'm am sure some of the guys who get to more games then I do can give you all the ins and outs shortly."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,Waldo19,2,Tue Mar 31 01:23:16 2015 UTC,Do they have the away jerseys at the Coliseum store?
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,Shmeepster,2,Tue Mar 31 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I bought an Okposo away in December"
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,1mqn,3,Tue Mar 31 05:05:33 2015 UTC,"Hey I am going to be at that game too, if you see a guy wearing a stadium series tavares jersey and This hat, say hi to him."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,Shmeepster,3,Tue Mar 31 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to the Buffalo game too! Anyways, my last trip to the Coliseum was this past October for the Stars game on the 25th (being from Jersey it's harder to make it out to games). So that game was the week before my birthday and I decided I wanted a Clutterbuck Stadium Series/3rd Jersey for my collection. I go to the team store during the game and they have Tavares and Martin 3rds on the wall that day. I asked the cashier if I could get a Clutterbuck one made and she said ""We can have one made for you, but it'll take two to three weeks and you'll have to come back and pick it up from here."" Being from a part of NJ that makes going to the Coliseum a road trip and a half, I decided to instead drop the cash to just get a Tavares one since it was already there and made. So, if they don't have Strome jerseys already available for purchase that night in the jersey format of your choice, you could either put in an order for one to pick up later like the cashier suggested to me, or bite the bullet and buy whatever players they have available for that game."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,lighthousefisherman,2,Tue Mar 31 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the responses guys! This really helped a lot! Shmeepster, I'll totally say what's up if I see you there!"
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,NotThe1UWereExpectin,2,Tue Mar 31 14:20:08 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if they will number a blank jersey there? Got one online from reebok during a sale and I want to get Leddy on the back
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,hgli,2,Tue Mar 31 14:28:30 2015 UTC,You can order the jersey from them over the phone and pick it up at gametime.
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,CaptWinkie,2,Tue Mar 31 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"I've bought a few Jerseys from the Coliseum store and they're not bad for what they are.  If you want it as fast as possible then they can heatpress for you right then and there and have it ready after a period or so. But if you want it stitched (something that I highly recommend) they send it out to a place called StitchesNY in Queens.    I have two jerseys that were heat pressed at the Coliseum and three that were stitched and Queens, and the stitched jerseys are much more comfortable and more durable."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,lighthousefisherman,2,Tue Mar 31 18:03:25 2015 UTC,Couldn't you just take the pressed ones to an embroidery place and have them stitch around it? That would ensure the name and numbers never come off.
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,CaptWinkie,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"That's what I wound up doing for my heat-pressed Jerseys I got from the Coliseum. For the jerseys I bought after that I just mailed them to stitches in Queens and had them stitch everything on, it's cheaper (you don't have to pay to have it heat pressed and stitched) and they do a great job. Stitches is where the team gets their jerseys done."
NewYorkIslanders,30viwk,lighthousefisherman,2,Tue Mar 31 19:12:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the only issue I had. I didn't wanna wait to have it all done in Queens. I either just front the extra money to have a complete numbered jersey shipped my way or I just buy what's already there at the team store. It gets a lot more complicated for fans like me that live nowhere near the Coliseum
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,moonyj,5,Mon Mar 30 19:40:47 2015 UTC,I got the last two seats in section 211 back in January. Row 15 seats 13 and 14.  View from my seats while sitting.

NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,A_Charmandur,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:47:50 2015 UTC,obstructed by what exactly?
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,_stee,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:32:31 2015 UTC,"The railing to the left, it blocks the goal and a little bit more up to about the circles"
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,A_Charmandur,2,Tue Mar 31 04:05:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure how high it was. The layout for this arena in general is very poor, even for Basketball. We'd be better off playing outside at Yankee Stadium or Citi Field if you asked me."
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,bageloid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:52:39 2015 UTC,"It's high enough that if i was 4 seats over it would block things significantly. As is, I can see the whole rick perfectly and because of the angle I never really have to turn my head. Could have been one section to the right a few rows lower but that was 35 a ticket and I liked these seats better."
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,A_Charmandur,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:14:15 2015 UTC,Those prices are pretty cheap. How high up are they?
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,bageloid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"High up there, but that just means you get a full view of the ice."
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,mc11050,2,Tue Mar 31 15:42:09 2015 UTC,how bad is the actual obstruction? and who would I contact for info on getting seasons like yours?

NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Tilt23Degrees,7,Mon Mar 30 20:29:49 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to the concourse actually being walkable in between periods (if i needed to take away a positive).

NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,jackwoww,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:55:10 2015 UTC,Well.  Keep hoping.    The concourse at Barclay's is very narrow.
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Madlameusername,7,Mon Mar 30 23:51:50 2015 UTC,Way better than the coliseum. There are multiple levels so it doesn't get too congested.

NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,johnzanussi,-5,Tue Mar 31 14:32:26 2015 UTC,Have you gone during a game?  It's hard to walk around when everyone is out during intermission because of the crowds.
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,aguywiththoughts,7,Tue Mar 31 00:13:21 2015 UTC,You must be taking about NVMC? The Barclays was refreshingly navagitable the two times I went. It seems much much much larger than Nassau. It was most notable in the restrooms.  I waited no more than 5 minutes compared to the usual 10-15 at NVMC.

NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Tissueboxhead,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:04:43 2015 UTC,Partial plans won't come until the summer I'd say. They want to get as many people buying up full season plans before they offer up partials.
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I know I'm most likely going in for a partial plan, can't do a full plan.  As a resident of Manhattan, the idea of a 30m or less subway ride to the game is a great thing.  Of course, I'd rather be going to fewer games / year, and still have the Old Barn, but if they're going to be in Brooklyn, might as well take advantage of it.  Now to only find a section/seat that actually can see most of the ice."
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Tissueboxhead,-1,Tue Mar 31 11:50:32 2015 UTC,Sorry but this place sucks for hockey. There are no good seats in the building. Every section is on too much of a gradual incline and the ones that are elevated are too far away from the ice. I loved sitting behind the goal the Isles shoot twice at in the 200's section. Perfect sight lines and great combination of elevation and closeness. Now every seat is almost level with the ice.  Edit: I'm no architect but it seems like there is a ton of room to expand the interior on the end with the obstructed seats. It would be a big project but it looks like it could be done.
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,A_Charmandur,3,Tue Mar 31 04:48:32 2015 UTC,I found the guy that's never been anywhere but NVMC.
NewYorkIslanders,30uai5,Madlameusername,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:35:41 2015 UTC,I've never been to another NHL arena but I've been to the minor league arenas in Binghamton and Bridgeport and both of those were great for hockey. There's probably a few around the league that aren't great but Barclays has to be up there with the worst. It's a bit ridiculous that there isn't one good seat in the building. The best ones are average views at best.
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,trireme32,37,Mon Mar 30 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"if not, hopefully the Coliseum is registered as an organ donor  ba dum psh. but seriously"

NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,bass_n_treble,-4,Mon Mar 30 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"Any chant where SUCK is heard prominently on TV is going to be nixed by the NHL, sorry."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,nothing_cleverr,5,Mon Mar 30 20:55:45 2015 UTC,I don't know what you mean by this? I can hear that chant clear as day on TV
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,GoldenMarauder,2,Mon Mar 30 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"Have you ever watched a game on TV?  You can hear a lot of those chants, and a lot of booming ""Refs suck!"" chants around the league."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,leeber27,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:33:40 2015 UTC,"True, but the one we're using now is pretty well heard through the tv."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,purplehumpbackwhale,0,Mon Mar 30 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"how exactly does the nhl nix a chant? this just isnt the case, we can hear the rangers suck chants every islander game as it is. has the NHL ever intervened in an organists song before?  not to mention, suck is completely acceptable on television, it's not even a bad word."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,Madlameusername,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"how exactly does the NHL Nix a chant?   The same way they nixed the chicken dance. They just tell the team to stop.  The reason you never hear the chicken dance anymore is (allegedly) because either the league or isles organization decided it was harmful to the family friendly atmosphere they we're trying to create. I'm not sure why it would be any different from ""if you know the Rangers suck"" but that's what I've always heard.   And telling someone they ""suck"" is probably a lot more risqué than you realize. It implies that their sucking a dick. I think the league wanted to keep the number of times isles fans were saying the Rangers/their fans like to put penises in their mouths and suck on them till then cum all over the place to a minimum."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,GoldenMarauder,0,Tue Mar 31 01:34:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's not what you're saying when you tell someone they suck...
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,Madlameusername,2,Tue Mar 31 14:34:56 2015 UTC,Then what are they sucking?
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,GoldenMarauder,-2,Tue Mar 31 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to be that literal about it, the saying most likely has its origins in farmers who used to say ""That sucks hind teat"" to decry someone/something as inferior, as the rearmost teat of a mother pig/dog/etc. was considered the least desirable from which to obtain nourishment.  But even if it wasn't, that's not what the phrase means anymore, and acting as though the origin of the term is so overly important is somewhat silly."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,Questionguy58,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"But even if it wasn't, that's not what the phrase means anymore, and acting as though the origin of the term is so overly important is somewhat silly.   When you tell someone they suck, to this day, it's pretty common knowledge that you mean they suck dick.   Do people really walk around their entire lives telling people they suck dick and not realize what their saying?  That's hillarious."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,GoldenMarauder,-1,Tue Mar 31 18:42:10 2015 UTC,I think you're reading far too much into something that has become a colloquialism of the language at this point.
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,Questionguy58,0,Tue Mar 31 18:47:14 2015 UTC,I don't think so. It's very common knowledge that it means they suck dick. I'm actually surprised there are people that didn't know this.

NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,A_Charmandur,3,Tue Mar 31 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"Awful place to put it, its literally at the entrance of a section. Who the hell planned this building??!?!?!?!"
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,bass_n_treble,3,Tue Mar 31 10:57:02 2015 UTC,"I have talked to Paul Cartier, the organist, on social media and during one of the Barclays Center preseason games.  He played in a roped off area pretty much in plain sight of the stands and the ice.  From the looks of it, he plays a standard Hammond organ so I don't think they necessarily moved the Coliseum's organ, they probably just bought another one for the Barclays Center and Paul wrote down the settings he uses at the Coliseum.  Almost positive all the sounds of Nassau Coliseum from the organ to the goal horn will remain the same (although the goal song will likely change next year to something shorter so the YES YES YES happens during replays of the goal rather than during the next faceoff).  Soundboard songs will probably be the same as the Nets or at least updated from the current Ramones/Billy Joel/ACDC/Metallica stuff.  I have thought about this quite a bit."
NewYorkIslanders,30szqd,_stee,3,Mon Mar 30 20:50:08 2015 UTC,When I went to the Devils-Isles Pre-Season game this year @ Barclays and they had the isles Organ and the guy who plays it right in front of the arena when you walked in.

My only NHL experiences since I've moved from the Island 5 years ago were at the AAC, which is a really nice, modern venue like Barclays.  There's just something... different.

NewYorkIslanders,30r022,islesrule224,11,Mon Mar 30 00:11:27 2015 UTC,Only saw last 3 minutes. Dare I say a fire has been lit under the pp and offense?

NewYorkIslanders,30r022,RyPhy,5,Mon Mar 30 00:33:14 2015 UTC,First rule of Nassau Coliseum is don't talk about Nassau Coliseum.
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,teslasmash,8,Mon Mar 30 03:24:43 2015 UTC,Holy shit my voodoo thread worked.   Even the prophecies of Brock and Cal were seen.
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,thewrongflag,6,Mon Mar 30 01:06:53 2015 UTC,So much weight off of all our shoulders. My butthole is finally relaxed.
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,RyPhy,7,Mon Mar 30 01:00:37 2015 UTC,"Three Powerplay goals against a top 5 PK. Our Goaltending has been Great, Penalty Kill is spectacular. Keep the PP and Secondary scoring going and we are fire in the playoffs.   Rangers look to be cooling off, every team has a hot streak but theirs lasted ridiculously long. Just got blown out back to back by teams they will face in the first round. That's some good news.  Momentum matters so much more than seeding the way this Eastern Conference is going. LGI and fuck the fucking rags."
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,Mrmentortv1,5,Mon Mar 30 03:28:58 2015 UTC,GUYS I THINK I MIGHT BE THE LUCKY CHARM BECAUSE YOU GUYS WIN AS SOON AS I WALK INTO TOWN!!
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,bass_n_treble,3,Mon Mar 30 02:40:45 2015 UTC,Good win but sloppy.  Need to clean up their game before the playoffs.  I liked the line changes and I'm happy Nelson and Okposo got on the board.  Tavares had 2 or 3 pts?
NewYorkIslanders,30r022,EinsamWulf,2,Mon Mar 30 12:06:24 2015 UTC,Woot woot!

NewYorkIslanders,30q3g0,tacofever,2,Sun Mar 29 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"refresh your score, we are less than 2 minutes in and getting a tie looks unlikely at this point."

NewYorkIslanders,30q3g0,Waldo19,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:11:20 2015 UTC,Does anyone one consider strait better than de haan?
NewYorkIslanders,30q3g0,IslesMetsJets44,3,Sun Mar 29 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"depends on the day. Strait has been good recently, and that was a fairly light hooking call. Career wise, de haan is the future, but for the short term, Strait has been pretty ok."
NewYorkIslanders,30q3g0,Waldo19,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"I can't believe this is even a debate lol.    De'haan is young, BIg, and has offensive upside.  Strait is SLOW, thats why he was beat and took that penalty, and he has NO offensive upside.  De'haan is our future, he might as well get minutes."

NewYorkIslanders,30pfs2,Chrismercy,3,Sun Mar 29 20:45:37 2015 UTC,Who has been excited about the PP at all this season?
NewYorkIslanders,30pfs2,_jared,3,Sun Mar 29 15:41:14 2015 UTC,They were pretty solid when Brock was scoring all those goals. He was a PPG leader early in the season.
NewYorkIslanders,30pfs2,Chrismercy,8,Sun Mar 29 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"Brocktoberfest may have ended, but hopefully we'll see the return of Chewbrockka before the playoffs."

NewYorkIslanders,30pfs2,Salacondor,2,Sun Mar 29 18:42:46 2015 UTC,Switching seats and going deep into the closet for a Witt shirt and a Peca jersey.   SURELY this will be the laugher we've been waiting for

NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,lighthousefisherman,7,Sun Mar 29 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"Neuvirth has been shaky but he's also had horrible breaks. I think he has had 4 goals assisted or put in by his own players now.  That said, I was very discouraged yesterday when he had difficulties holding onto any pucks shot at him."
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,isles27,7,Sun Mar 29 20:58:20 2015 UTC,Nope don't think it at all actually. Take a look at the goals scored against him. Most of them have been unlucky breaks; stupid bounces that Price can't even stop.
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,leeber27,5,Sun Mar 29 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree at this point, but for what it's worth Chad got hurt and he's out for the rest of the season. What's the lesser of the two evils?"
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,downtownflipped,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"True, but still, I'm thinking post-season right now.  Something tells me Enroth is the backup we need. I've always liked the way he plays"
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,Chrismercy,3,Sun Mar 29 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen him in Blue and Orange long enough to cast judgment. In his defense, he came during a very... Interesting part of the season."
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,AC3FACE,3,Mon Mar 30 00:36:07 2015 UTC,"I think he's worth giving another look next year. I don't have confidence in Poulin being the backup and I doubt there will be many options in free agency. Unlike Johnson, Neuvirth put up good numbers behind a bad defense in Buffalo. That has to count for something. Even Halak was shaky for us at first."
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,hockeycrazy033,2,Mon Mar 30 00:19:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel the same way.  It's crazy how many teams have such good backup goalies and prospects tho.    Talbot has seriously steped up this year for the Rangers, could anyone imagine if Johnson had to do that for us, lol.  And the Rangers AHL goalie idk his name is 2-0-0 with a shutout.  Ducks had Hiller, trade him, Anderson steps up(seriously robbed us last night on that powerplay), Gibson has gotten quiet a few starts.  Andrew Hammond coming out of NOwhere and holding the fort down in Ottawa with a long term injury of Craig Anderson.  Dubnyk's crazy run after being picked up by the Wild, launching them into a playoff spot.    Plenty of surprises this season for goaltenders, but nothing too pleasant to say about either cJ or Neuvirth.  I still have faith in Neuvirth tho.  Also Carry Price's season, just wow."
NewYorkIslanders,30qecy,whistlemissile,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"It's clear that a 1B goalie is needed; it's unwise to overwork Halak, and who knows what'll happen in Bridgeport with Poulin & now Motte (who I think may wind up being more than just a blip on the radar....)  Neuvirth can be that, but it won't happen overnight. It'd be nice if there weren't such a dire need to build momentum; they could play him and fine with whatever result had they team not slipped en route to what should have been clinching."
NewYorkIslanders,30paci,Salacondor,6,Sun Mar 29 14:40:27 2015 UTC,"We have to root for any team that plays the Penguins, Capitals, Bruins, and Senators. Unfortunately that does include the Rangers.. But like you said, they're already in, so it is what it is."
NewYorkIslanders,30paci,ZoraHockey,3,Sun Mar 29 14:42:53 2015 UTC,I want the Bruins to face the Rags round one sooo bad
NewYorkIslanders,30paci,tanu24,2,Sun Mar 29 15:26:46 2015 UTC,Way more then the Sens.
NewYorkIslanders,30paci,Chrismercy,2,Sun Mar 29 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"It's probably the worst matchup for the Rangers in round 1, so agreed"

If it's down to rooting for other teams to lose so we can sneak in with an 8th seed when the Isles should have won the Metro outright then I call bullshit. Win the games or go home."
NewYorkIslanders,30paci,dukemantee,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think the OP was concerned about the Islanders missing the playoffs; rather, that the Caps losing this game was better for Islanders playoff positioning."
