anarchomemes,3e1gks,grapesandmilk,16,Tue Jul 21 05:48:02 2015 UTC,"How in the world is that supposed to be an anarchist position? Of course every human being should have the right to have their basic needs fullfilled. As anarchist we shouldn't abolish these rights, but rather see to it that they are guaranteed by the community under a collectivist paradigm and not the state under a capitalist one.  I absolutely cannot understand how anyone could consider the lack of these rights freedom. If you need to struggle to fullfill your basest needs you have the least freedom of all, as you don't have a choice what work to accept, you don't have the resources to do anything besides work and the lack of basic resources will sooner rather than later have anegative impact on your health limiting your options in any regard even more. The only things this shows is how little regard libertarians actually have for the freedoms of anyone who isn't part of the upper class."
anarchomemes,3e1gks,BaronMuenchhausen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Only if we take good care of each other can we abolish the need for unwanted authority.  To get rid of it, we have to show that it is no longer justified.  Of course, actually it should be the other way around: the burden of proof should always be on authority to justify itself, rather than on us to prove it's not justified.  But either way you must alleviate the need for the hierarchy."

If we attack from within our existing ideological structure it's meaningless. Capitalism isn't based on ethics, it's based on stories like ""being wealthy is good,"" ""people who work hard get to be wealthy,"" and ""the system is fair because it values hard work.""  All of these narratives are false, and none of them can be attacked from within a narrative that respects ethics. Capitalism ideology describes it's ethics internally. Those who follow the ways of capitalism are blessed by the invisible hand, those who commit the sin of being lazy (or following the evil path of communism) are punished. Wealth is justice and wealth is right, everyone who suffers is just suffering for the good of the greater capitalist cause. Capitalism, so the idea goes, will bring about a better would through it's continual spread. The exploited are really just building wealth with the assistance of the glorious job creators.  Of course, like all mythological systems, these stories are simply intended to maintain the existing social order. And, like all other mythological systems, they must be attacked and treated as other systems of faith. The religion of capitalism must be attacked based on the tenants of faith. One of these tenants is that it is logical and based on science... That is, if we want to attack the religion of capitalism we should first point out that it is a religion."

We appear to be in violent agreement.    OK lol  Our Immediate Tasks   We must call attention, among the workers parties or the extremist tendencies within those parties, to the need to undertake an effective ideological action in order to combat the emotional influence of advanced capitalist methods of propaganda. On every occasion, by every hyper-political means, we must publicize desirable alternatives to the spectacle of the capitalist way of life, so as to destroy the bourgeois idea of happiness. At the same time, taking into account the existence, within the various ruling classes, of elements that have always tended (out of boredom and thirst for novelty) toward things that lead to the disappearance of their societies, we should incite the persons who control some of the vast resources that we lack to provide us with the means to carry out our experiments, out of the same motives of potential profit as they do with scientific research.   We must everywhere present a revolutionary alternative to the ruling culture; coordinate all the researches which are currently taking place but which lack a comprehensive perspective; and incite, through critiques and propaganda, the most advanced artists and intellectuals of all countries to contact us in view of a collective action.   We should declare ourselves ready to renew discussion, on the basis of this program, with those who, having taken part in an earlier phase of our action, are still capable of rejoining with us.   We must put forward the slogans of unitary urbanism, experimental behavior, hyper-political propaganda, and the construction of ambiences.
