He grew up on my family estate called Double Cabins Plantation. The son of a cotton gin maker, Shatten C. Mitchell Sr. who was married to Mahala Burdette. They had 15 children. Shatteen, Jr. was killed At the Battle Of Wincester, Sept. 1864. He was married to Chloe Bartlett daughter of Dr. Myron Bartlett who founded the Macon Telegraph newspaper in the 1820's.  I'm told there are letters out there of evidence of his death of friends of his that served with him. He was a Captain and beloved by his men. I was contacted by an attorney in D.C. who had letters and info. about how he died but I've lost his name and number. IF anyone has any relatives that served with Shatteen Mitchell, Jr. of GA. I think it was the 13th regiment. Please contact me. I am writing a book."

I have always favored the Armies of the Trans Miss and think they do not get enough credit for the brutal fights. I mean just look how far the men marched under Van Dorn 3 days before the Battle of Pea Ridge in 62. Not to mention it was all done in snow and ice over the Ozarks. Then take a look at what Hindman managed to do post Van Dorn in 62. He pretty much rebuilt the whole Trans Miss military and went on to hold on to Arkansas a little longer. And even though he retreated at Prairie Grove, I still think they would have won. But when you are using the only army in the Trans Miss I can understand why you would want to be cautious.   Finally there was a lot lot of small battles out here that got intense. Not to mention several that involved the Kansas Colored division that fought and were formed way before 54th Massachusetts, and in my opinion they fought harder and it is sad to see they get zero mention usually in history."

Also, frontier people had to know how to make their own clothes. The easiest shirt pattern was made of two halves of the same pattern, sleeves and all. The shirts we wear today are made of upwards of four components - front, back, sleeves. These frontier shirts were called keyhole neck shirts, because the neck-opening shape was that of an old keyhole to allow for one size fits all adjustable neck...that was prone to tearing over time since elastic had not yet been invented. This is where the bib front design came in. It protected the neckline from wear and tear, and it looked more handsome as the puffy and frilly styles of the late 18th century gave way to more fitted styles of the 19th. While the advent of sewing machines came about in time for mass production of civil war uniforms in 1856, the style was still all the rage."

When Louis XIV adopted the style, it quickly became all the rage among men of means...as a side note, Louis XIV was also the regent credited with starting the perfumed and powdered wig craze. Which caught on primarily as a means to combat the hair loss caused by untreated syphilis.   Full brimmed hats have always been around to combat sunburn as tan skin wasn't popular until the mid-20th century.

When he was at Bowdoin College he had a professor - Calvin Stowe, whose wife was Harriet Beecher Stowe. In fact, when he was hired at Bowdoin College, he replaced Prof. Stowe.  From his own autobiography: ""Slavery and freedom cannot live together. Had slavery been kept out of the fight, the Union would have gone down. But the enemies of the country were so misguided as to rest their cause upon it, and that was the destruction of it and of them. We did not go into that fight to strike at slavery directly; we were not thinking to solve that problem, but God, in His providence, in His justice, in His mercy, in His great covenant with our fathers, set slavery at the forefront, and it was swept aside as with a whirlwind, when the mighty pageant of the people passed on to its triumph.""

USCivilWar,3cz5ri,knobthis,8,Sun Jul 12 02:43:35 2015 UTC,Gettysburg is without a doubt my favorite civil war movie. It has one of the best original soundtracks I've ever heard in a movie. The acting and storytelling is absolutely brilliant. Glad you liked it. Have you seen Gods and Generals?
USCivilWar,3cz5ri,Roof_Tinder_Bones,7,Sun Jul 12 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I watched Gods and Generals based solely on my love of The Killer Angels and Gettysburg. I found myself to be sorely disappointed. After watching Stephan Lang play such a fantastic George Pickett, I couldn't believe him as Stonewall Jackson. I will second you on the Gettysburg soundtrack, though. 'Fife and Drum' is my favorite track.   Edited to add that Gettysburg is also my favorite Civil War movie, rife with inaccuracies or not. I love it, and have since the first viewing. Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain makes that movie for me. Well, that, and it's endlessly quotable."
USCivilWar,3cz5ri,girlkamikazi,3,Sun Jul 12 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"I hear ya on the disappointment. Stephan Lang did a helluva job as both Jackson and Pickett, but it was kind of weird to see someone else playing Pickett. Not to mention the absence of Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen. All of that said, Jeff Daniels was once again brilliant as Chamberlain."
USCivilWar,3cz5ri,Roof_Tinder_Bones,3,Sun Jul 12 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Maybe having Sheen and Berenger on board would have improved it somehow. Martin Sheen is my favorite Robert E. Lee, ever."
USCivilWar,3cz5ri,girlkamikazi,3,Sun Jul 12 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more about Martin Sheen.

Lee was always known as a deeply spiritual man, and Sheen brought that out in the character so well.  Buster Kilrain is my other favorite character. I was gutted when that little Irishman died, am still every single time I watch.  Michael Shaara wrote a helluva novel. Whenever I read the book, I can see the movie in my mind, and vice versa."
USCivilWar,3cz5ri,girlkamikazi,3,Sun Jul 12 05:34:34 2015 UTC,"Lee at Gettysburg was a very different man than Lee at Fredricksburg.

USCivilWar,3cz5ri,winowmak3r,2,Sun Jul 12 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I guess director Ron Maxwell wanted to get in all the camera work he liked most, but it did seem to loose its pace.   Still, the musical score bothered me more than than the lengthy scenes and fly-over shots.  The up-lifting mood set at the beginning was appropriate, but it should have turned to darker music the charge failed with men exploding in all directions.  The ""proud and valiant"" charge music began to feel forced and awkward (at least to me).  I think I understand that Maxwell wanted to make it feel proud and glorious, but the longer the killing and dying continued as they approached the wall getting ripped apart by double canister, the more the music seemed horribly ill-suited for these scenes.  I'm no movie critic, but I'm pretty sure most critics would agree with me on that point.  In fact, no music at all would have been more appropriate.  No music was really needed with these grim scenes.    Well, one thing that scene drove home for me as it dragged out... it made me wonder how on earth Lee - in all his brilliance - could have believed that charge would have ever succeeded."

He wrote in his journal(the blank pages of a family bible) about a conversation with this man. The man didnt care about slavery or even states rights. The man was fighting for his home. His home was invaded and that was his cause. Along the lines of what you wrote we all need to also remember that everyone fighting for the confederacy wasn't a raging racist that had oppression on the mind.

He didn't own slaves, at least from what we can conclude from census records, so it was probably more along the lines of what he thought was protecting his home from an invader, too.  Do you still have your ancestor's Bible? What a  treasure...we don't have any letters or possessions, and what documents we do have come from archives. There is a great book called Keep All My Letters; it's a collection of letters home written by someone who served in my ancestor's regiment, so that's the only real glimpse I have of what his experience might have been. He served in a different company of the regiment, so it's unknown whether they might have known each other, but it's the closest we've come to understanding his life in that time."

USCivilWar,3bu8sh,crocodial,2,Thu Jul 2 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"Lost Cause of the Confederacy:       The Lost Cause is a regional American cultural movement, based in the South, seeking to reconcile the traditionalist white society of the antebellum South that they admire, to the defeat of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War of 1861–1865.  It forms an important minority viewpoint among the ways to commemorate the war. The United Daughters of the Confederacy is a major organization that has propounded the Lost Cause for over a century.  Supporters typically portray the Confederacy's cause as noble and most of its leaders as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry, defeated by the Union armies through numerical and industrial force that overwhelmed the South's superior military skill and courage. Proponents of the Lost Cause movement also condemned the Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, claiming that it had been a deliberate attempt by Northern politicians and speculators to destroy the traditional Southern way of life. In recent decades Lost Cause themes have been widely promoted by the Neo-Confederate movement in books and op-eds, and especially in one of the movement's magazines the Southern Partisan.  The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives. They collectively sought to justify their own actions and allow themselves and other former Confederates to find something positive in all-encompassing failure. They also wanted to provide their children and future generations of white Southerners with a 'correct' narrative of the war.

Article III, Section 3, of the Constitution, any person who levies war against the United States or adheres to its enemies   by giving them Aid and Comfort has committed TREASON within the meaning of the Constitution. The term aid and comfort   refers to any act that manifests a betrayal of allegiance to the United States, such as furnishing enemies with arms,   troops, transportation, shelter, or classified information. If a subversive act has any tendency to weaken the power of   the United States to attack or resist its enemies, aid and comfort has been given. The South attacked the North, and If   any question of the reason, one just has to read the southern states ""Declaration of Secession"", it spells their reason   right out very clearly as SLAVERY."
USCivilWar,3bu8sh,haroldpoole,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with teachers and text books tracing nearly all of the causal facets to slavery - mine certainly did when I was in school.   But I don't think that we need to abandon nuance and complexity, especially at the level of the individual soldier, in order to understand the importance of the slavery issue leading up to the Civil War.  Just because issues of interstate travel, international trade, private property, and proportional representation in gov't are all tied closely to slavery does not mean that we shouldn't speak in specific terms.    And don't get me started on the renewed efforts to remove paintings, statues, and memorials (even memorials to the casualties of war).  The personal views of almost every officer in both armies are reprehensible by today's standards.  ""White supremacy"" was the norm.  Grant and Sherman (in addition to one of them waging deliberate war against a civilian population) were raging anti-semites.  Should Sherman's statue right near the White House be taken down?  Or is it possible that memorials and monuments remind us of our shared history and invite us to learn about the 19th century in all its fascinating ugliness?"
USCivilWar,3bu8sh,CellularPeptideCake,2,Sun Jul 5 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary to use nuance to understand the central role of slavery in causing the Civil War.  The states that seceded said they were seceding because the North was threatening slavery.  When they spoke of States' Rights, it was in opposition to the North exercising their States' Rights to undermine the Fugitive Slave Law.  When they spoke of interstate travel, it was about being able to take their slaves to other states.  They explicitly said time and time again that they were seceding and fighting to protect slavery, which they considered to be a just and noble institution, ordained by God, beneficial to both white and black - they considered black people to be inferior, they wrote these things explicitly into their declarations of the causes of secession.  It was only after they lost the war that they began to try and deflect the cause to other things."

It's pretty clear that the war was about defending the institution of slavery.

USCivilWar,3b5mn8,diddlemethat,2,Fri Jun 26 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, that's one state.  Only four states even issued Declarations of Causes - that's out of eleven.  Second, four states seceded specifically because of Lincoln's call for troops, including my home state of North Carolina.   Whereas: By Proclamation of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, followed by a requisition of Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, I am informed that the said Abraham Lincoln has made a call for 75,000 men to be employed for the invasion of the peaceful homes of the South . . . . And, whereas, this high-handed act of tyrannical outrage is not only in violation of all constitutional law . . . [but] conceived in a spirit of aggression . . . . Now, therefore, I . . . do hereby issue this, my Proclamation, notifying and requesting the Senators and Members of the House of Commons of the General Assembly of North-Carolina, to meet in a Special Session at the Capitol, in the City of Raleigh, on Wednesday the first day of May next . . . . United action in defense of the sovereignty of North Carolina, and of the rights of the South, becomes now the duty of all.    John W. Ellis, Governor of North Carolina, from a Proclamation, April 17, 1861    It's pretty clear that the war was about defending the institution of slavery.   Ah, I see, one state speaks for all eleven.  In a confederacy.  In which four of the states didn't leave until Lincoln started his war.  Incidentally, you're over-simplifying even the pro-slavery statements.  South Carolina was outraged at the fact that the North was violating the Constitution in its actions against slavery - while I would certainly agree those parts of the Constitution needed to be changed, the fact is that it was being violated blatantly and repeatedly.  It wasn't merely ""hurr durr slavery is in danger"" as you so dishonestly spin it, it was ""the very fabric of our government is being blatantly disregarded without so much as lip service to the Constitution.""  Oh, and by the way?  The only thing that's clear about slavery and the war is that it was a big factor in some states' secession.  Slavery was, by and large, completely and totally irrelevant to the WAR.  This is painfully obvious.  The Confederates were fighting for independence, and the Unionists were fighting against it.  That is literally what the entire war was about, the question of secession.  Why a state seceded is largely irrelevant to the war itself, and the question of the war was whether a state had the right to secede.  Union high command was explicit that they didn't give two flying craps about the slaves, their concern was preserving their idea of Union, and the Confederate high command was explicitly fighting for independence (and a heavy portion of it was anti-slavery).   Now think about how the confederate battle flag all but disappeared until brown v board and you see the dots slowly connecting themselves.   But it didn't ""disappear.""  It was still flown, it just didn't appear on the SC state house until '62.  Which, of course, I'm sure had nothing to do with the Civil War centennial or anything.  No, it's always race with you people.   The fact that we are still so divided about what it means, regardless of ignorance, means that the wounds created by the subjugation of other people are still fresh.   No, the wounds are not fresh - what we see is not ""fresh wounds,"" it's race-baiting and entitlement mentality spread by dishonest hypocrites who get rich off of inciting riots and promoting racism.  The only fresh wounds here are those caused by you Yankees constantly and unceasingly telling us that we're bad and evil and we never did anything good and our culture and our history are all slavery and nothing else.  And subjugation of other people?  Just what do you call invading a sovereign nation that had never harmed the United States, torching its cities, looting and burning farms, plantations, and slave quarters alike, ""freeing"" blacks only to enslave them for the Army, and then enacting brutally corrupt and vindictive ""Reconstruction"" policies that did nothing but foster even more resentment, cause further economic destruction, AND drive racial tensions up through the roof?  Is that not subjugation?  Because it sure looks like it.   You need to re-evaluate what it is you've learned about the war   Actual truth with historical context?  I've been evaluating and re-evaluating constantly.  It's what anyone intellectually honest would do.  Of course, you're not actually asking me to re-evaluate it, you're asking me to disregard everything I know and accept the hilariously dishonest and simplistic comic-book Yankee version of history, instead of the complex truth that is equal parts tragic and heroic, with people who are actually human rather than caricatures and many-faceted causes all too often tarnished by the evil intrinsic to human nature.   and examine the present context of the conversation.   The ""present context"" is a bunch of emotional imbeciles who can't think demanding that anyone who ""offends"" them be erased from history.  By the way...  Just as a thought experiment.  Let's accept your absurd, completely and obviously incorrect premise that every state seceded over slavery and nothing else.  Just for fun.  Now let's do an analysis.  The Confederacy declares independence solely over the issue of slavery.  The Union invades the Confederacy to bring it back into the Union, slavery being a completely irrelevant side issue to them.  There's obviously no good guy in this situation, but generally, if you're invading someone for a really crappy reason and not doing a single thing to right any actual wrongs, that makes you the bad guy.  So even accepting your historically incorrect and blatantly absurd premise, the Union still comes out as the bad guy."

He wouldn't betray his home, and the villages that raised him. This was true for a great many CSA soldiers. And not only that, but they believed in the legality of the succession too.

Some CSA veterans were horribly racist and wanted to punish black people for Reconstruction.  Honestly if you're going to point fingers at the post-war South you can't give the Federal Government a free pass.  They didn't re-build the South like the U.S. did in Germany and Japan after WWII.  Many Southerners actually starved to death.  The South remained devastated until well into the mid-20th Century.   Feds allowed many Confederate leaders back into positions of leadership instead of holding them accountable for the war.  Then, after reconstruction, the South was just kind of forgotten about and allowed to do whatever it wanted with black people.  They literally could have had equality right after the war, but the Federal Government just seems to have lost interest in protecting black folks rights.  By the time they became interested again in the Civil Rights era, terrible policies had been entrenched for generations.  At the end of the war, there was an idea that wealthy slaveholders' property should be divvied up and given to ex-slaves.  This was NOT done, and the people who started the war were still the prosperous landowners afterward, exploiting everyone everyone else who just remained in some degree of poverty."

One of the great what-ifs from this period has always been how different reconstruction would have been had Lincoln not been assassinated. Its not hard to find people who have speculated on whether his version of reconstruction would have been less punitive, and therefore more successful long term.   Feds allowed many Confederate leaders back into positions of leadership instead of holding them accountable for the war.   Wouldn't banning them from government positions (salaried or elected) further radicalized them?  Unless you expect northern carpetbaggers to go into the south and take over their government, there was this big problem where so many of the south had been preoccupied with fighting the war, and so many of them killed, that there really wasn't much of a well educated class left behind ready to replace them if a ban on government involvement was put into effect. They would have had to wait years (how many I don't know) until enough freshly educated university graduates of a new generation existed & were willing to take over.   there was an idea that wealthy slaveholders' property should be divvied up and given to ex-slaves.   If that had been done you would have seen a lot more of a post-war insurgency & terrorism. The elites would not have simply stood by and allowed their plantations to be divided up & given away to their former slaves.  The best the US could have done along these lines, IMO, would have been to use the western frontier to give the former slaves land. But this is problematic from the perspective of Native Americans, and the white northern leadership were never going to fly this idea since they had envisioned setting aside that part of the country to expand N.E. white culture into (see: The Free Soil Party and their thoughts on the subject).  Last but not least, we need to somewhere in all this consider the fact that the 13th Amendment was written by Unionists.  I would like to draw your attention to this part:   Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime   In my opinion the 13th amendment was penned to found the replacement for slavery in the form of prison-labor. The south's well known post-Civil War chain gangs were fully sanctioned by the North by its inclusion in the federal law of the land banning slavery. And we see the fallout from this to this day, with a prison industrial complex so powerful that in Pennsylvania (to use an example) two judges were convicted of being bribed to send little kids to private run juvie prison centers. Now luckily the judges were convicted, luckily they will do some lengthy time, luckily they will be treated poorly by their co-inmates in prison.  But I'd like to end this post with a question: Isn't it illegal to bribe government officials? What happened to the private prison complex that bribed them? If you guessed ""at most a slap on the wrist"" you'd be totally correct. And that's a problem."

What seems to have NOT worked so well is to free the slaves but give them nothing at all to start a life with.  We now know that people born in poverty for the most part die in poverty in our own time.  Assuming this was true back then and given that the society of the South was mostly pretty much the same after the war, what chance did freed blacks have?  Add to this that ex-Confederates were allowed back into elected office and it just seems to me that you have a perfect storm for scapegoating ex-slaves as the reason the South remained devastated for so long.    I am not an expert on the post-war South though."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,sg92i,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"what chance did freed blacks have?   Not a very good one, and I have to wonder how it compared to the free slaves that went North. Poverty puts a stranglehold on upward mobility anywhere, and when a complete lack of education is thrown in on top of that, its a very oppressive scenario to be in.   the reason the South remained devastated for so long   Personally, I think a lot of that had to do with poor decisions on economic planing within their society. I have to believe that DeTocqueville was right when he talked about how dead the south was to innovation. Most of the elites were elites because they were born into wealth and used that money to run huge plantations. The self made elites, say as a result of technological invention, were rarer and didn't stick around. The McCormick family for example came from Pre-Civil War Virginia. Invented a great deal of very important agriculture technologies, saw the other southern elites not caring about technological & scientific progress (after all, why should they if slave labor is so cheap?), so the family basically said screw-this and relocated to Chicago's North Side. At the time, this was the most exclusive neighborhood in the country and was the place self-made innovators from around the country tended to move to, to get away from the more apathetic old-moneys. This, the McCormick family included, eventually became the centralized location if there ever was one for the post-war Republican Party.

USCivilWar,3b5mn8,Cunty_McShitterton,6,Fri Jun 26 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"Except that this isn't Twitter, and everything doesn't have to be dumbed-down and over-simplified until a complicated issue is made trivial.  Most of those men didn't own slaves.  PERIOD.  Troops were raised by other states and sent into YOUR state.  Now just what exactly do you think Johnny Reb should have done with an invading army coming down the road?  Do you have even the slightest idea of what an invading army does?  Especially when there are a few frothing extremists like yourself thrown in the mix.  Johnny Reb was afraid people like you would burn his house down and murder his family.  In the 19th Century, men weren't complete pussies who would stand for that sort of thing.  When you read diaries from both sides, most made it VERY plain that they were not fighting for black people one way or the other.  In fact, it's painful to modern sensibilities to discover just how racist 19th century men were.  Yes slavery was involved, but the war began over the question of how much power the Federal Government had over the states and whether the states had a Constitutional right to secede."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,DragonflyRider,-3,Sat Jun 27 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"When your nation secedes directly due to slavery, then starts a war, and you join your nation to fight the nation it is making war on, guess what?  You've made the decision to support the institution of slavery. Plenty of border states sent soliders both ways, so your argument does not hold water. The North didn't secede, or start the war. The South did both.  If you've joined a belligerent nation, you support that nation and its policies. The Confederacy's major policy difference from teh North was slavery.  YOu can't explain that away. You also can't explain away the fact tha the vast majority of soutehrnors were extreme racists who believed in the institution of slavery, if for no other reason than to prevent blacks from fucking white women and murdering whites.  Slavery was not ""envolved,""  Slavery was the cause."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,DragonflyRider,2,Sat Jun 27 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"This is why context is needed, to understand why we should honor and support the troops on both sides.  Not everyone fought with the same conviction for the same issues.   If you think the general Lee was a unique case in which he fought for his nation because it was his duty to do so, you're dead wrong.  If you think that all Union troops shared the same conviction as the most impassioned freedom fighters, you're also dead wrong.  Also, it's important to keep in mind just how racist most Americans were back then, when looking through a 2015 social lens. Though at this point, one must ask themselves seriously and critically, how much of our own progressiveness is the result our own Internal Carrot, vs the Stick of Social Condemnation.  The only real explanation that can explain the statistical difference in progressiveness between our current population and the civil war era population, is the Stick of Social Condemnation, or some kind of major evolutionary change since then.  So if you wanted to figure out where your stance would have been back then, since being racist against black people was not socially condemned, is to evaluate your own ability to consider the perspectives of others that don't coincide with your own views, how quick you are to judge others, and challenging the status quo when it could result in your own social ostracism, financial ruin, or death. Because that's what made the civil war era freedom fighters stand out. They were some of the first to die for their cause, and their own government executed them.  Trust me when I assert that, the common Union soldier did NOT share that conviction.  In that regard, the union soldier was fighting a rebellion, and the confederate soldier was fighting an invasion."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,DragonflyRider,-1,Sat Jun 27 18:36:15 2015 UTC,The Union was fighting the rebellion of a group of states who were rebelling to protect the institution of slavery.

USCivilWar,3b5mn8,Kindahar,3,Sat Jun 27 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"You're again inserting ideological motives into the common soldier, which isn't the case. The facts don't have your back here, the soldiers did write letters, just like generals Lee and Grant. They don't need you to, nor would they want you to speak on their behalf.  We need another war to help put things in perspective for you.  If you were to be drafted into another Vietnam, would you burn your card and move to Canada? Some would harshly judge you for that, some wouldn't. Those that wouldn't do that and decided to serve, some would be judging them harshly, some would be honoring them.  Me, I would respect the decisions of both. The draft dodger has his conviction, but many would still call him a traitor or coward. The recruits would be serving their country.  At the end of the day I think it says more about the individual doing the judging than it says about what is being judged."

From its original purpose representing an army defending a society based upon slavery to its use by white supremacist groups, to it being hoisted over state houses in the south during the 60s as a protest against civil rights and desegregation. That flag has always been a symbol of those attitudes which aimed to subjugate others based on the color of their skin.

It's good that people are finally acknowledging that.   An no the CSA weren't Nazi's but I can understand why some people draw parallels between the two. If only to draw contrast between the relative treatment of the two despite each fighting for some of the worse causes man has ever fought for.  Again the people of the South weren't Nazi's but just like the Germans aren't proud of that particular bit of their history I really don't see why Southerners should be proud of their ancestor's involvement in the ACW."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,sg92i,5,Fri Jun 26 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Who besides random internet idiots are calling for it to be completely removed from society?    I agree with you 100% except for the part I just quoted.  I think we are already seeing a big push in removing the flag out of situations where it is reasonable to be there. Like Apple pulling Civil War games out of the App store.  The reason for this is simple enough: From a purely capitalist perspective, if you're running a business of some kind, it is easier to ban things than it is to risk loosing sales by offending someone. It does not matter in this context whether the person being offended is being rational about it. Corporations have this huge incentive to create an environment of sterility where the amount of people, however crazy, who will be offended, is kept to a minimal. It's why so many companies over the last 10-15 years have done a 180 on everything from dresscodes to tattoo policies in an attempt to wallpaper over their employees to promote uniformity.  The problem lies in the fact that in the internet age a small amount of businesses control the vast majority of the marketplace. eBay for example does not allow the sales of things with the swastika on it. At a glance this is not a big deal, after all, if white supremacists can't buy nazi crap on eBay why should I care?  But it creates unexpected problems. For example, many museums turn to venues like eBay to buy items for their collections. Most people don't know this. So if a museum is trying to acquire a rare item they want for an exhibit, and that item by is nazi related, they can't buy it on eBay. So where else do they go? There's nothing else on the internet comparable to eBay that is 1- popular world wide, 2- has such a large userbase, 3- is likely to carry military related antiques. So they have to put the word out to the community that they want an item and HOPE that someone, somewhere, who hears that call will find the item (purely by chance) AND be willing to donate it, lend it out, or sell it to them. This is not an easy proposition. I have a background in this and I am telling you places like eBay are really important for preservationists. You can create a saved-search for the item you are looking for and bite your time waiting for someone to list the item you want. It may take you years to bare fruit, but it works better than randomly taking time out of your life to walk through every antique dealer, estate auction, or flea market you can find in the hopes that you'll luck into the unlikely-to-be there item you're looking for.  So imagine a world where: eBay, Amazon, Etsy, Steam, Apple, and Google won't get involved in transactions where a confederate flag is shown. This will be a huge problem for genuine historians & museum curators. It will be a problem for educators. It will be a problem for gamers. Yes, it will also be a problem for white supremacists, who I don't like, but I just can't bring myself to pay that cost of admission to make it mildly more difficult for them to acquire paraphernalia.   A few weeks or months ago there was a big outcry on the internet over an auction full of WW2 Japanese internment artifiacts. They were going to be sold in an estate sale by a regional smalltime auction house who paid to have a historian do a proper inventory & catalog in advance. But the shitstorm this caused, by people demonizing the family for trying to ""make money off of the blood & tears of internment victims"" & the auction house for going along with it, got the auction pulled.  The family probably wishes they had just sent all those artifacts into the local landfill, since at least then no one would be giving them death threats or telling the world that they are literally hitler. Any museum that was hoping to get any of those items is now SOL. And if there are any items the family was not planing on selling at this time, you're probably never going to see or hear about ever again because they're going to be too afraid of people being mad at them if they try to find homes for the stuff again like they did this time. This is for a bunch of artifacts of significant historical significance that were acquired LEGALLY. This isn't stuff stolen from people or looted as war trophies."

USCivilWar,3b5mn8,golikehellmachine,3,Fri Jun 26 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"and I will not let them visit a house with a confederate flag.   Not everyone who owns these kinds of artifacts has them because they're trying to make a political statement. Plenty of historians have collections of artifacts, which they use in educating people or maintain for preservation purposes. Other families have these kinds of artifacts because their ancestors had acquired them during times of war.  I have some Imperial Japanese battle flags. I don't know about you but I think Imperial Japan was one of the worst regimes of the last hundred years, easily on the same plain of wanton evil behavior as Stalin or Hitler. I do not fly these flags. Almost no one even knows I have them.  They were acquired by my family in that theatre after the Japanese units they belonged to were either defeated (as in killed) or surrendered. I have a couple headbands that were literally worn by Japanese infantry on banzai charges.  I keep them because I know how important they are, and that humanity needs such artifacts preserved. And so that's what I do with them, keeping them in storage along with other artifacts I have acquired over the years for different research projects. I have them next to a manuscript from one prominent defense contractor that is so rare less than half a dozen institutions in the world possess a hardcopy.  When it comes down to it, most collectors are really amateur historians. There aren't enough museums in the world to preserve everything of importance for future generations. Private collectors play a key role in conservation work."

If you've ever heard of the war as 'The War of Northern Aggression', that is how the name was rationalized. The states entered the union willingly, and so they felt justified to willingly secede. Key word being 'secede'. The federal government was not as powerful back then, and respected president Jefferson even gave his blessing during his inaugural address.  In war, the victor decides the outcome, and we are much better off with the precedent being set that states cannot leave the union, even though some state constitutions still declare that they reserve the right to do so. (Texas)  The spirit of Lincoln would return to whoever happens to be president, if that were to ever happen.  The states certainly knew that there would be war if secession were to happen, that was no surprise, but they did not consider themselves rebels in a rebellion."

USCivilWar,3b5mn8,Ignatius_Atreides,2,Mon Jun 29 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"It's not the flag of the Confederate States of America, though, it's a battle flag.  You said that's not unpatriotic, but it represents the dissolution of the union, treason, and the preservation of a racist institution.  You're a historian, I know you know how long the USA had been struggling with threats of succession from the southern states, from John Calhoun and others.  We absolutely should honor the people who fought and died because they were our ancestors, but it doesn't mean that we should relive their mistakes.  I don't know how some people can identify with a flag that white supremacist groups use to represent themselves, especially when there are so many others to choose from."
USCivilWar,3b5mn8,Kindahar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need to be flown at government buildings, I can understand why people would be offended by it.

Support the troops, condemn the war, just like our other shameful wars. I guess thats the real difference that you get when you study it. You see them all as americans, confederate and union alike.

If you fly that flag at anything other than a Civil War reenactment (and even that is questionable), you are announcing to the world that you are a white supremacist. That's why they started flying it in the 1960s and why people fly it in the North. The swastika means good fortune in Indian culture, but it has been stolen. If the Confederate flag ever meant anything positive (I don't think it did), it has been appropriated by white supremacists."

USCivilWar,3b359q,DigitalZiggurat,2,Fri Jun 26 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"The reaction to the debate on the CSA Battle Flag is really disappointing. I totally, 100%, agree that the Battle Flag has no place flying over public buildings. One of the National Flags also wouldn't have a place, but would have more of a place in representing and honoring those states' Civil War heritage (not that they are ignored today) than the battle flag used by one Confederate Army, and co-opted after the war for a far more sinister purpose.  However, the response by many to the debate over the flag's place on public buildings has been absurd. The flag has come to symbolize more than just the Army of Northern Virginia, or even the Confederacy as a whole. It's unfortunate, but I recognize that is the case, and that many people, for good reason, are offended by the out of context use of the flag. It's heavily racist undertones and history of usage by the KKK and similar groups mean that it has no place flying over government buildings, and a person is perfectly within their rights to disassociate themselves with someone who uses the flag out of context. However, the backlash has spread far beyond the narrow confines that it should be limited to: out of context use on government buildings, or even out of context use in general. It has begun to spill over even to in context usage. The most egregious is Apple's response, especially in relation to Ultimate General: Gettysburg. The flag is in the game to represent the Confederates because that is literally the flag that was used at Gettysburg. The Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was flown by the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, and Ultimate General seeks to do its best to have a historically accurate game. The flag is in its proper context. This is one of the few places that it would be in it's proper context. Most usage of that flag is out of context and it is easy to see why people would be offended by the usage in those situations. But there's nothing wrong with in-context usage."

It shouldn't be a choice between flying a battle-flag of a single army over a courthouse and having the flag in any context become so taboo that no major corporation will stand for its presence.  As for Apple, in a way I am not surprised. Corporate culture in the US (I can't speak for elsewhere) seems to advocate very strongly for some type of sterility, figuring that it is always best to simply make something disappear than to risk offending someone no matter how irrational the remarks of offense happens to be."

Re Gainesville in Confederate Texas, where forty suspected Unionists were hanged in October 1862, and where others were shot ""trying to escape"", as well as in Cooke County men were killed in Grayson, Wise and Denton counties.  Most were accused of treason or insurrection, however few had actually conspired against the Confederacy, and many were innocent of the abolitionist sentiments for which they were tried.# - In other words they were ""witch hunted!"" Ed.   As for being ""Suspected Unionists,"" many of the hanged men had told the secessionists, they intended to abide by the just laws and constitution of the United States, just as their forebears had been doing since 1776.  While many of the ones who responded to the rhetoric, which evoked passions more suited to football rivalries than political discourse, who raised no objections to the hangings, deserted the Confederacy in droves when war became a reality.  Re Samuel Clemens aka Mark Twain who headed North, when the irregular unit he had joined was to be absorbed into General Lee's Army, who finished the war piloting a Union riverboat.  Adolf Hitler was a Jew, as well Jews had been in firm control of the Soviet Union since the sham Zionist inspired 1917 Revolution, they had similarly been running things in France, Great Britain and the rest of Europe since time immemorial.   They start wars to further Zionist control and to refinance their ops .. they are genocidals, they owned the arms factories then as they do now, they are beating the secession drum like they did in 1862.   They financed Napoleon, Oliver Cromwell, and Charlemagne they perpetrated the 911 attacks, and had sufficient clout in the United States and Japan to get away with the Pearl Harbor deception .. there were no Japanese planes at Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941.   Gettin' the drift ..   The same ones who plotted the Confederacy under cover of the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, where after it was brought to fruition in response to a vast Zionist funded propaganda campaign.  Hunted down and killed those true American patriots who had defended the Constitution in the first place, who went on saying they intended to live by rule of law!  If any in America had warlike intent it should be directed at the Jews who attacked the United States September 11, 2001, insisting on their just apprehension, legal trial and condign execution.

I wanted to be sympathetic until this was said. Lincoln's very moderate plans of admitting southern states and ex-confederates back into the fold of the Union was the one thing that could have helped stem all the hatred and racism that was so prevalent after the war. Yet some southern asshat had to kill the man.   That being said, don't tell me the south wasn't ""punished enough."" That's a horrible miscalculation of what reconstruction became without Lincoln at the helm.   Also, for all those that wish to make a Germany comparison, was Germany punished enough for WW1?

I think you, /u/jab1103 make a very valid point. Woodrow Wilson must have had the end of the ACW in mind, when he suggested a very modest ""punishment"" for Germany. That especially France was not willing to try such a course and the treaty of versailles as it came out was an important condition for the rise of national socialism. Punishing Germany alone and that harsh was fatally wrong.  The initial situation in Europe was a different one, though. All of the European monarchies were equally responsible for the disaster that was WW1. As far as I understand it, the secession happened because of the financial interest of the rich social elite in the southern states. Because their interests (that were built upon the fact, that a certain class of people should stay property of this elite!) wer not met in a democratic state. A democracy can not succeed if the loser of an argument has the option to just leave.  And until today I can not understand why anyone can see this ""cause"" as just.

The closest thing to making the cause ""just"" was that slavery in the American south was necessitated at the time due to the agrarian economy. The north, on the other hand, had industrialized, and could exist without slavery. I'm no Marxist, but it really was a conflict of two modes of production...  Edit: Slavery was viewed at the time by many in the south as a necessity. In hindsight we all know that there were alternatives, but ideas such as gradual emancipation did not have enough lobbyists to have it instituted. The issue of slavery rapidly turned from an issue of economic necessity to a moral battleground in the decades prior to the war. Thus two very polarized views were created, one yelling about state's rights and pride (let's be honest-the enslavement of other human beings) and the other for abolition. Honestly, the only moderate viewpoint seems to be the necessity of maintaining a union."

Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. Texas: Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? South Carolina: The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. Georgia: The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.   The cause of the American Civil War was secession. The cause of secession was slavery."

I mean look at the conflicts we're having now.  You could see the current push to eliminate Confederate symbols as an extension of what happened in reconstruction, and that as an extension of what happened during the war.  I see people on both sides of the argument reciting lines which are amazingly similar to the lyrics of battle songs of their respective sides.  The fact is it WASN'T that long ago, and the war ushered in an era which was fundamentally different from what preceded it.    I'm not talking about slavery.  The North and South in the US have fundamental differences extending beyond 1607, even.  The groups are remarkably different, and for early US history, that was just accepted, the United States was referred to as a plural, not a single entity, and the Federal government was not particularly centralized.  Was there animosity between North and South?  I'm not actually sure, because the idea was that it was a voluntary federation.    In 1861, that changed.  By 1865, it was fundamentally different.  No longer was it a voluntary federation, but an occupying force in a conquered nation.  Divorce wasn't an option, though the differences between the two groups had never been greater - and the hostility never stronger.  And the hostility has never ceased from either side, expressed in a number of ways.    That IS fundamentally different situation from the past.  In fact it's interesting to compare the South's story to that of other separatist movements worldwide.  But this fundamentally different situation carries with it a legacy of the War."

USCivilWar,38ljy4,Ed-Dee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:49:51 2015 UTC,"In the larger context of American history, the American Revolution never really ended. The Civil War was the deciding point that would realign the nation to it's original ideal, the idea of human equality and natural rights.  If you look at Lincoln's Gettysburg Address he makes reference to the ideas of the Declaration of Independence and that the purpose of the United States is to make manifest the goals embodied there.  Those who struggled and died in that great contest would not have died in vain because they were struggling for that high-object. The Civil War put our nation back on that mission and in many ways, we are still struggling to fulfill that goal.  So in essence, the quest to create a society based on those ideals is the ongoing purpose of the United States. You can see this throughout American history with the movement to extend voting rights and social equality to women, workers, blacks, other minorities, and now LGBTAQ citizens.  That will be the great legacy of our nation, and if we fail in that task it will be through defeating ourselves.  Just as Lincoln said back before the war...  ""When shall we expect the approach of danger? Will some transAtlantic giant crush us at a blow?... Never. If destruction be our  lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide."""

Northerners were Americans. Southerners were Americans. And neither magically forgot what America was when they went to war.  The Civil War was most definitely a powerful moment in defining the concept of the United States and the values upon which it was supposed to stand, but the only way one can claim that the Civil War somehow restored the nation to some original, noble purpose is to completely ignore American history before or after 1861-1865.  Beyond ambiguous agreed-upon terms like ""liberty,"" ""freedom,"" and so on, American values have always been hotly contested because people interpret those lofty words in radically different ways. Confederates, in fact, generally believed it was they who were defending the proper ideals of the Declaration of Independence and upholding the legacy of the American Revolution. Does anyone really believe it's because none of them bothered to check the encyclopedia and read the official, canon definition of American ideals? Or was it because America is and always has been a fluid concept, from which different Americans can forge informed and legitimate interpretations that differ and are so powerful that people are willing to die for them?"

In 1885 the state appropriated funds for each of its units which fought at the battle of Gettysburg to erect a monument there. The survivors of Clark’s Battery chose to erect their monument near the Peach Orchard, where they fired the astonishing number of 1,342 rounds of ammunition, a record for any one unit during a single day’s combat in the war.

This is purely symbolic, of course, but South Jersey gets pretty redneck.  George McClellan was from Jersey and he was certainly an outspoken racist who preferred the company of southerners.  He may well have been typical.   Having been born in Jersey and lived there for a substantial amount of time, I can tell you that everybody talks about the Revolutionary War and World War I and never, ever about the Civil War.  There were slaves in NJ -- there was a slave graveyard just down the hill from my house -- and just because slavery ended earlier there does not mean the white people were that much more enlightened.  New York City was also notably insensitive to the plight of the slave, including occasionally killing them all (like in 1750). The Irish, recent immigrants with problems of their own, were particularly resistant to the idea of fighting to free anyone else.  I wish I knew more; I intend to find out."
USCivilWar,33chkq,rocketmarket,2,Tue Apr 21 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the slaves in New Jersey were in the North near New York City. You can use this site to map them over time:  http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/newlong.php  South Jersey was agricultural, but most slaves in the North did not work on farms. They worked in factories or as domestic help. For instance, Henry Rutgers, for whom our state university is named, owned a few slaves who worked at his brewery.

Battle Cry of Freedom does a good job covering the social issues you mention that resulted in many new migrants (Irish among the most prominent) who weren't particularly onside with abolishing slavery, if only because they didn't want a flood of new competition in the cheap labour market. Another book I've picked up is ""Gotham: A History of New York to 1898"" which I've only had a quick skim of thus far but seems very interesting on the many migration waves."

I've done family research into ancestors from New Jersey so I've run into several state-specific topics.  The New Jersey delegates to the Republican convention didn't really want Lincoln but, as I recall, they had to be persuaded once it was clear their choice(s) would not win. I believe I read somewhere that Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and New Jersey met in David Wilmot's rooms (took me a while to find this: http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-state-by-state/abraham-lincoln-and-new-jersey/) to work out their voting block.  In the general election, south Jersey went Republican while north Jersey went Democrat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860#/media/File:PresidentialCounty1860Colorbrewer.gif) so the sentiment in the state was split. New Jersey, like many states, has an winner-take-all for electoral votes so the Lincoln got their votes. That doesn't mean the liked him, however.  Not sure if this answers your question."
USCivilWar,33chkq,md724,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this and especially the links - along with other responses it's helping cement in my mind that New Jersey is/was further South both culturally and geographically than I assumed from my foreign perspective of the US (I talked in another response about my handful of visits to New Jersey and tendency to mentally lump it in as ""north east - next to New York City"" without any further nuance).  I was aware of the voting stats (partially why I asked the question as most of the North at this point seems pretty solidly in one camp or the other - I'm post Fort Sumter pre-actual war at the moment so the indecisive states seem to be the 'Northern South' states - I may do better to think of NJ as more closely related to those states in outlook.

USCivilWar,33chkq,LedZepp284,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:25:02 2015 UTC,"Something else to consider is that many states, especially along the border, had men serving both sides. They didn't always raise whole regiments but individual sentiments went both ways. While slavery was definitely one trigger in this conflict, states' rights was also huge in the mind of many.   Also, I don't remember where I saw the statement but I've read it several times over the years (by different authors); specifically: before the war people referred to ""these united states"" while during and after the war you see more references to ""the united states"". The plural suggesting the states were united by common consent but it was the states consenting. The singular suggesting the states are just a part of the whole, but the whole is more important.   New Jersey residents would have gone through that same transformation. The grouping of NJ, PA, OH, IL, and IN during the 1860 GOP convention suggests, at least to me, that these states felt they had a common bond and shared interests in the election outcome. But notice that New York, for example, was not part of that group."

New Jersey passed gradual emancipation in 1804 but there were still a handful of slaves left in the state when the 13th Amendment passed abolishing slavery.    Here are some quotes and articles for further reading:   ""The infamous July 1863 New York draft riots actually spilled over into Jersey City, with a mob surrounding a Congregationalist church “tabernacle” where escaped slaves were rumored to be hiding.

However, there are plenty of absurd occurrences from the War that at least fall under the shake of the head/gallows humor portion. Take the spectators who showed up to watch the First Bull Run whilst picnicking for instance. If the image of a bunch of well to do spectators realizing what a foolish blunder they've made isn't funny then I don't know what is.   The griping of the soldiers is also a fountain of pretty funny material. The old ""couldn't pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel"" line is classic."

All of the civil war is interesting, so I'm game for anything you can write on that you can also make funny.  That being said, you should do the attack on the salient at Spotsylvania.

Could easily do that drive in a week.  I haven't been to all those sites so not take some other people's experience over my own but I would probably try to hit:  Appomatax   Fredricksburg, Maybe Richmond (there is a stonewall Jackson shrine somewhere around there if you are a fan of him)  Bull Run  Spend a day in DC (get a hotel elsewhere its expensive), visit as many museums as you can, all free and are fantastic.  Hightly recommend Air and Space even though it has nothing to do with the war.  While in DC see Arlington cemetery, one of the most profound things you will see IMO, lots of statues and memorials there to Civil War and others, also Lee's house.  (If you go dress up a bit no t shirt please)  Antietam   Then Gettysburg.  That is also a great stretch for hitting things that aren't Civil War based and can have some gorgeous roads if you plan the route right and don't mind some detours.  Or if you want to spend less time on the road and 95 will probably be your best bet.  Tons of cops in the VA part so watch out.   I use to live outside DC so if you go that way hit me up if you need any help or suggestions for things to see/do/eat.

It would be cool to do a chronological tour and that would give you a good central location, while giving you the opportunity to check out some of the really cool museums and stuff in DC. From the district itself I would say it is roughly:  2 hrs to Harpers Ferry  45 min to Mananas   1 hr 30 min to Antietam   1hr 30 min to Fredricksburg/  Chancellorsville/ Wilderness/ Spotsylvania (I think theyre all within 2 or 3 counties in N central VA. Spoiler: I was kind of disappointed in Fredricksburg, which is really only Marye's Heights in the middle of town)  2 hrs 45 min Gettysburg  3 hrs Richmond/ Petersburg   people from the region call me out if my times are wrong  If you end up staying for 2 weeks I really recommend Charlottesville, va too. UVA is pretty cool and there are 3 presidential houses (jefferson, madison, monroe) within a few miles and its just an awesome little town in general. The main drag through downtown has lots of little boutiques and restaurants and bars etc. You should also drive down the Shenandoah Valley, which I bet is beautiful and bright green this time of year... I also recommend the inner harbor of Baltimore, which has a good bit of history too.  Have fun! Sorry to hear about your dad :("

It's a scary lesson for all of us who are so sure of ourselves.  I agree that the war would have happened with or without him and his participation led to a remarkably less painful result.  I wonder whether he, who could not see the plain fact that he was abandoning fellow humans to slavery for all time, could see that his wholehearted participation in a ridiculously unjust war would save lives.

More practically, just wear the North down.  Lincoln was scared to death that he was going to lose the 1864 elections, and he very well might have if it weren't for several important Union victories.  Had those victories been denied (the special orders found by McClellan come to mind), Lincoln would have lost hard, because the North simply did not want to fight.  Bragg at one point could have crushed the Union forces in his theater (Tennessee, I believe?), except that he, being Bragg, absolutely refused to follow up on his victory.  A Southern victory would rely on an incredibly stubborn defense and even more extensive use of guerilla warfare.  Much as I respect Lee, moving into Union territory was a severe mistake.  Imagine if the Confederate failures in Union territory were replaced with the Union experience Chancellorsville after Chancellorsville."

""Sherman didn't take any responsibility for it, but he also knew the potential of that happening,"" said Knapp.  Eventually, Sherman and his generals issued orders that the soldiers fight the fire, but on a windy night in February, it was too late.   -- The Burning of Columbia: ""They have brought it on themselves""  Moreover in the era of lesser scholarship, especially in the South, the idea was an easy one to espouse, especially since Sherman wasn't above burning down a major Southern city (Atlanta).  Moreover, using the term ""neoconfederate"" is a needless perjorative, since the Times didn't bother to reference one single ""neoconfederate"" website that makes this claim, nor does it even bother to quote one single neoconfederate writer.

I don't know about the author but there seems to me to be a book type for our time.  I don't see it around, or only see parts of here and there.    Suppose it is a book about Antietam.  It should have maps that are in full color and that move-- that is, can be animated-- and where you can fly through the cornfield, seeing where the units are, and maybe backing up to see where the units are on the other side.  This book should have the names in color, where you can right click to get a biography, and maybe a biographical timeline and a tooltip of a quote from their memoirs about this moment.  You should be able to do the same for units, or for towns.  There could be audio (?Didn't the Confederates make up Oh Maryland, My Maryland to the tune of `O Tannenbaum' as they were crossing into the state  and it is still the state song?),  or video of what it looks like today.    There could be a discussion that you could explore, if you wanted to you could click on the link, of the political situation at this time.  For Antietam that would obviously include Lincoln and emancipation,  but I also find interesting that somes oldiers in Lee's army would not fight up north and stayed behind, and I'd enjoy being able to click to read more.  I particularly enjoy reading about controversies, about how people's views of what happened has changed (what exactly did happen at the bridge?).

They seem to be doing the opposite of what you describe.   Last summer I actually read a book about Gettysburg written by a certain professor who shall remain nameless here.  I couldn't help but notice that Mr. BigShot didn't seem to understand the topography there at all, and his description of the fighting around Devil's Den was darn near cryptic, even muddled.  Of course, at the end of the book he admits to not having been to this battlefield before attempting to write with authority on the subject.

And it doesn't look nearly that thin.  Are there any bolt holes on the bottom? That could indicate a brass or lead sabot was bolted on like some of the Brooke and Parrott rifle projectiles.  Can you get a close up picture of the plug?  The closest diameter I can find is a 24 pounder at 5.68"". Is the object closer to 5-11/16"" diameter on your ruler?  The 24 pounder is a very common caliber for the Civil War era, but I've never seen that shape with a plug. Some solid, armor piercing Brooke projectiles did look vaguely similar to yours, but they were longer.  The plug (if that's what it is) says to me that it would have been a shell filled with powder and I don't know of any shells that were that stubby. One major problem though is that the plug is always found on the tip of the projectile because otherwise they tended to explode.

His attempts at reconciliation (much like Lee) were viewed in this light further leading southerners to feel like he betrayed them. Add to this his pivotal roles in battles that many in the south as winnable by Lee but lost by his lieutenants. He really didn't bash Lee as much as tell then truth against the legend of Lee.

If you don't mind I'd like to answer your original question: I feel that Longstreet was probably the best Corps Commander the Army of Northern Virginia had. To me Jackson's poor (and that might be too light of a word) performance on the Peninsula in '62 ruined the South's best chance at victory. There's a reason that Longstreet was second in command of the ANV not Jackson and that's it. For all his victories Jackson's worse than nonexistent presence on the Peninsula muddied Lee's plans and allowed McClellan to absorb blows and pull back. But that's delving into theoretical territory and I don't want to do that for this. Jackson was a superb commander but his failures in the Peninsula Campaign seem more damaging to me than Longstreet's failures at Gettysburg. Unfortunately Jackson will never be able to defend his position there.  To me Longstreet's slowness and caution came from an understanding that warfare had changed. He didn't believe in the old Napoleonic style of attack and showed at Antietam and Fredericksburg that the defensive was a viable and superior option. Lee didn't acknowledge these lessons and at Gettysburg allowed his army to attack an enemy entrenched on good ground and paid the price. Longstreet was critical of Lee because Longstreet recognized Gettysburg was not a winnable fight but Lee would not face the music. Something people seem to forget is that if you want to question Longstreet you have to question Lee, because Lee trusted Longstreet explicitly and, as far as I'm aware, never voiced displeasure with Longstreet's performances.  Even though he was defensive minded he could still launch every effective attacks. At Second Manassas he crushed Pope, Gettysburg he recognized the action that needed to be taken (the flanking action) but still launched a furious attack that it took everything the Union had to turn them back. At Chickamauga he smashed the Union line, due in part to Rosecrans leaving a gap but whatever, and helped turn them back. In The Wilderness he recognized they couldn't fight in lines of battle so he had his lead divisions advance in heavy skirmish lines to allow them to put a lot of fire against Hancock's boys while not exposing his troops as much, then utilized the railroad cut to devastate Hancock's flank (after the war he remarked ""You rolled me up like a wet blanket"") and many believe Longstreet's wounding was the only thing that kept that attack from rolling up the Union army but that's again theory.  Of course Longstreet's failure in the Knoxville campaign has been a strong knock against him. Personally I don't think the Knoxville campaign, in the capacity it was undertaken in, ever really had a chance and the fact that it went on as long as it did is a testament to Longstreet's stubbornness.   Longstreet's greatest mistake was admitting that the war was lost. He rekindled his friendship with Grant, converted to Republicanism, and most egregiously spoke ill of Marse Robert. In the end though I think he was the best corps commander Lee had and arguably one of the best commanders on either side. Had he died in The Wilderness he would be in the Southern Pantheon with Lee, Jackson, and Stuart. But to me he is in that Pantheon.  Boy that dragged out far longer than I thought. Sorry..."
USCivilWar,2ukygg,Antiquus,3,Sun Mar 29 23:10:11 2015 UTC,"That was outstanding. We share many of the same views on The Old War Horse. There is no doubt that he understood that warfare was changing. Sometimes I think that Lee did not understand the fact and possibly Longstreet kept him in check with his defensive mind. This could lead some to believe that his patronage for the cause was lacking. Jackson was in my opinion much better suited for independent command. During The Seven Days battle, his Brunside-esque slows and misunderstanding of the terrain, and just plain befuddlement in movements made it clear that he would be an unbroken horse to Lee. Longstreet was the best and most suitable second-in-command I think. Just some thoughts."
USCivilWar,2ukygg,the_letter_6,4,Mon Mar 30 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"Post war he did the unforgivable thing of becoming a Republican, pretty scandalous behavior in the opinion of white southern society.

USCivilWar,2ukygg,EmergencyPizza,2,Tue Feb 3 10:17:14 2015 UTC,I guess friendship to him was more important than his Southern heritage.

USCivilWar,2ukygg,EmergencyPizza,2,Tue Feb 3 18:23:24 2015 UTC,Very good way of putting it. I started to see that at the end of his memoirs. I need to read some more of his post-war material.

USCivilWar,2ukygg,topesrule,4,Tue Feb 3 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"Longstreet was very capable in his role. I don't think he was aggressive enough to be a good Army commander in most theaters, though I like to wonder how he might have done had he taken command of the forces opposing Sherman in 1864-65.  As Virginians came to dominate the memory of the war, they chose Longstreet as a scapegoat for the Army of Northern Virginia's failures because they needed to blame someone and weren't going to blame one of their own.  I'm not sure if this is the kind of answer you were looking for. I am from the South, but I'm an academic historian and my sympathies do lie with the Union."

So I recently asked my friend, a big fan of the civil war what he suggest and he told me to Watch the Ken Burns ""The Civil War"". Its GREAT.. I binged watched the whole thing on Netflix in about 3 days. I am now going through a phase of obsession with the war. I Highly recommend this documentary.

Yeah, it just occurred to me that George Turner (the graduate who got killed at random in Harper's Ferry) was probably the only guy in that whole city who had even been to college, much less West Point.

I have my own huge problems with Lincoln (as if my flair didn't give that away), but the man, to his eternal credit, had an incredibly sane and fair plan for post-war.  What I don't agree with is the blame being laid on Johnson, who leaned more towards Lincoln's leniency.  I would blame the Radical Republicans, who were insanely vindictive and heaped abuse and humiliation on an already-defeated South.  Like I said, I disagree strongly with most of Lincoln's wartime actions (including the war itself), but the man was mostly honest and well-intentioned.  The Radicals were vindictive, spiteful, and corrupt to no end, and with Lincoln dead there was nobody with the clout to keep them in line."

After the southern states were allowed back into the union and some of the confederate leaders were pardoned, there was no real long term plan to rebuild the south from an infrastructure standpoint. With the recession of the 1870's, the Republicans, with liberal economic policies and an already industrialized north quickly became contented with allowing the south to struggle with their own rebuilding."

Shiloh is a fantastic place to visit.  My favorite battlefield (and favorite battle long before I ever visited).  Very pristine.  If you can, walk/hike at least some of it.  Get off the beaten path and feel what it must have been like.  All the artillery are from the time period (they have 200+) and they have them everywhere.

USCivilWar,2r92nm,saxonjf,7,Sun Jan 4 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"The command structure for the North was different than the South. Before the Civil War the highest rank ever obtained was Lt. General and that was Washington. Out of reverence to Washington no one was made as high a rank as him. So the antebellum army had always been commanded by a Major General.  When the war started the North kept this command structure. The commanding officer of an army, say the Army of the Potomac, was always a Major General. This was a major benefit for Lincoln, because it allowed him to easily move generals in and out of command as he wished.  When Grant became a Lt. General in '64 it was sort of a brand new position. He was made the commanding general of all Union Armies, which had been done by others, but not so much by a field commander. Grant took the position and served in the field and stayed with the Army of the Potomac. Being a Lt General put him above everyone and ensured he had total control.  This brings us to the Confederacy. The Confederates, probably because there were so many West Pointers and professional soldiers in charge, had a more rigid command structure. This meant that the commander of the army would be a full General, the corps commander would be a Lt. General, the division commander a Major General, and the brigade commander a Brigadier General.  The structure made clear who was in charge for the most part, but meant that once someone was promoted they couldn't go back in command. For example, once P.G.T. Beauregard became a full General the only commands suitable for him were either an army or a department, and not a corps.  In the end, though, the Union had a volunteer army based around a well established regular army while the Confederacy had a Provisional Army where brevets weren't needed because almost no one had a regular army rank."

USCivilWar,2r92nm,mikeygaw,1 point,Sun Jan 4 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the goal for the military in the first century of the country was to remain small, and to avoid becoming too top heavy with officers. Therefore, the common promotion was the brevet promotion during conflict, since it establish quick hierarchy and was only temporary.  One quick example that comes to mind is Custer, who may have reached as high as major general during the war, but was demoted back to captain in peacetime.   Specifically with generals, I do believe this, along with the earlier stated deference to General Washington, were the main factors."

I just looked it up, and the 6th too incredible casualties at Shiloh, so unfortunately, your ancestor might not have been detailed due to the massive numbers.  The surgeon for the regiment probably did not keep any decent records after the battle either.  They only had a few minutes with each patient after something like that, and it sounds like Herrin(g) was likely walking wounded anyway, so he would have been low on the priority list.   I've heard that the National Parks Service at Shiloh has pretty decent casualty list (at one time they passed researchers on to the Daughters of the Confederacy but they likely have their own copy by now).    One place that you might look at are newspapers from his hometown.  If he was wounded and returned home (it might be a few months from the battle before he actually arrived, so I'd cover into 1863 papers at least), it is pretty likely that the editor of the local paper might include some information about the battle and the local soldiers that were involved.    Another place you might check, and this one is a longshot, is the Confederate Veteran Magazine.  Probably unlikely that your ancestor is mentioned, but you might get some info from one of the surrounding units at Shiloh to help you piece together the story a bit. http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=confedvet ---scroll down to the bottom of the page for the index search tool.    Some of the records are just unclear like this unfortunately.  I have an ancestor that died up in Virginia, and his service record states that he died ""presumably of disease.""  To be fair, medical knowledge was pretty bad in that period, so the surgeon probably knew he was sick, but had no idea exactly what was wrong with him."

The 47th Ohio charged across the river-front taking advantage of a section of beach exposed by the low tide.  That is the object of the photographer's lens here.

I have found nothing to like about Early, and the fact that he was allowed to command as long as he did is a travesty, because he did nothing of merit."

BUT I agree with you on Buckner. He was a solid guy. A soldiers soldier. I had never heard about Lee asking him, that is pretty interesting. What a difference that could have made in the east.

I can't say with much certainty what the letters above and below the rifles may stand for. I'm going to guess, however, that the insignia probably dates to about the Spanish-American War and was perhaps issued to state volunteer troops rather than US regulars.

USCivilWar,2h2xuf,ryan_holiday,1 point,Mon Sep 22 00:28:42 2014 UTC,"Curious what you guys thought too. Here is the passage   ""Doubtless the founders of our government, the majority of them at least, regarded the confederation of the colonies as an experiment. Each colony considered itself a separate government; that the confederation was for mutual protection against a foreign foe, and the prevention of strife and war among themselves. If there had been a desire on the part of any single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while the number of States was limited to the original thirteen, I do not suppose there would have been any to contest the right, no matter how much the determination might have been regretted. The problem changed on the ratification of the Constitution by all the colonies; it changed still more when amendments were added; and if the right of any one State to withdraw continued to exist at all after the ratification of the Constitution, it certainly ceased on the formation of new States, at least so far as the new States themselves were concerned. It was never possessed at all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi, all of which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation. Texas and the territory brought into the Union in consequence of annexation, were purchased with both blood and treasure; and Texas, with a domain greater than that of any European state except Russia, was permitted to retain as state property all the public lands within its borders. It would have been ingratitude and injustice of the most flagrant sort for this State to withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and done to introduce her; yet, if separation had actually occurred, Texas must necessarily have gone with the South, both on account of her institutions and her geographical position. Secession was illogical as well as impracticable; it was revolution.  Now, the right of revolution is an inherent one. When people are oppressed by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of the oppression, if they are strong enough, either by withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and substituting a government more acceptable. But any people or part of a people who resort to this remedy, stake their lives, their property, and every claim for protection given by citizenship--on the issue. Victory, or the conditions imposed by the conqueror--must be the result."""

Personally, I don't find his argument about Texas to be particularly persuasive as it is essentially asserting the right of the conqueror.  It certainly may have been 'ungrateful' for Texas to secede from the Union which had sacrificed for its statehood, but I would argue (especially from the perspective of Grant's contemporaries) that the right to self-government and self-determination trumps any notion of debt to the nation which purchased or conquered the land on which one lives."

The proposed new state constitution was certainly no equal rights thing, but it was a step in the right direction.  Accepting it would have shown the rest of the South that moving in the right direction, and accepting the US Constitution would be welcomed by Washington. Banks was pretty much a disaster of a field officer, but he at least managed the military governorship of New Orleans relatively well.  He appeared to have the best interest of the city in mind. Lincoln might have had a stronger effect in the activity of Reconstruction.  He had strong support among standard Republicans and War Democrats, so his influence among even the Radicals would have been pretty strong.  Andrew Johnson was no Lincoln, so his attempt to continue Lincoln's policies as he saw it had no chance in the face of the huge majorities of the Radicals in Congress.

He makes a junior officers frock that would be appropriate. At least to give you an idea of what your relative's particular coat looked like. He also makes a great sword belt and shoulder boards. Guys like Chris Daley and Dan Wambaugh make great stuff and can point you toward sources for correct fabrics. Check out Robert Land and Missouri Boot and Shoe for good boots or shoes. Don Smith, from D.F. Smith Repros is great and is reachable via Facebook. Hopefully that's a good start. Let me know how things go. I love to see a good impression come together.

USCivilWar,2e1r2n,merryprankster2,1 point,Wed Aug 20 16:13:54 2014 UTC,"Honestly I can mostly tell because I've seen hundreds of images like this and am very familiar with how coat styles hang. It was much more common for officers I wear frocks or sack coats than shell jackets, but it is not impossible, so wear the style that you like the most. I also noticed the apparent pleat, but it is highly unlikely that it is actually a pleat for a couple reasons, but basically, pleated coats at the time were rare so unless you have another image of him in a pleated coat, it is safer to assume that it is not pleated."

Grant's genius was out West, but don't get the wrong idea, it was genius.  He fought when others gave up, he maneuvered when others backed up, and he advanced when others would hold and wait for reinforcements.  Grant succeeded because he knew how to bring the fight to his enemy, and there was too much fight in the Union forces for even Lee to withstand.

I knew that he was a hard slaver, and defended his right to slaves as long as he had them.  I knew of his consternation at Reconstruction policies (he had undoubtedly hoped for Lincoln's more forgiving terms, rather than the Radicals' harsh policies).  I was aware of the likelihood that Lee shared in the fault of the Gettyburg loss (he even admitted that the loss on the third day was entirely his fault).  In spite of this, I believe that Lee has admiral traits as a general (he probably extended the war by a year alone), and as a human being.

On a Sunday morning he went to Episcopal service, as usual. When it was time for Communion service, a freedman went forward and knelt down at the altar railing waiting. Everybody else froze. None of the whites got up to kneel with him. And then Gen. Lee got up, walked forward & knelt beside him to receive Communion with him. Everyone else followed Gen. Lee."

McLellan, could have overwhelmed the city of Richmond during the peninsula campaign, but he let his paranoia take hold and considered all the battles as losses.  Lee was a great general, but the generals below him are what made him so idolized.  Stonewall was a much better tactician and if Lee would have taken Longstreet's advice at Gettysburg then we would be talking about a completely different topic.

They remained his slaves through his own life, and most through the life of his wife.  Beyond that, treason only applies to citizens or people in the US.  Lee asserted his citizenship with another country (the confederacy), and the belligerency of the confederacy was confirmed before he fought on US soil.    It would take mental gymnastics to charge Lee for treason, especially since so many former Confederate soldiers/citizens were treated as POWs during the Civil War.  The private toting a musket was just as much a traitor as Lee (either all the way, or not at all), and they were treated as proper belligerents.  Again, Washington, Adams, and Jefferson would have been tried for treason and hanged had they been captured.  But we don't treat them as such.  And I am frankly offended at the notion you offer in the website:  This is nonsense:   Madam, do not train up your children in hostility to the government of the United States. Remember, we are all one country now. Dismiss from your mind all sectional feeling, and bring them up to be Americans.   Southerners have fought bravely in the US Army in all a subsequent wars since the end of the Civil War.  They were not in opposition to fighting under the US flag, and they were willing to follow the flag, and wear them on their uniforms.  Being a proud US citizen is not mutually exclusive with remembering relatives who fought and died in the Confederate Cause.  Only a very small minority of those who fly the flag are interested in a new Confederacy.  I know the names of some of those groups, but even most southerners don't.  I don't have a Battle Flag: I have no use for one.  I have no ancestors who fought for the South (or the North, that I can find), but the Confederacy was not a group of 19th century Nazis.  They were wrong on slavery, but they fought bravely and nobly, and deserve the respect as soldiers.  Those who want to honor their ancestors by displaying the Battle Flag should not be harassed.

Lincoln's long-term view of the war was always a reconciliation.  It was one nation, and always had been.  Setting the bar of return to the Union low showed good faith towards Union-leaning southerners that this was always Lincoln's goal.    Moreover, not setting a ridiculously high bar for an oath of return meant that competent leaders could take the oath, be placed in good graces of the US government, and effectively lead Southern states' return to Union.  The Ironclad Oath meant that southern leaders would be effectively de-citizened for the rest of their lives, and that was never the point.  Lincoln was not going to give up on the abolition of slavery.  The US Senate had already approved what would become the 13th Amendment, and the House would do so next year (partly due to the influence of Lincoln himself).   Lincoln was dedicated to making sure that slavery was forever finished, but he could potentially also shorten the war by showing the rebels that a peaceful and prosperous return was better than than the increasingly destitute position both the South and the Confederate Armies were experiencing.  I knew most of the details of this story, but the light that the NYT puts Lincoln in by not agreeing to the Wade-Davis Bill, even though they knew he had plans of his own, that they might have put into law, is a mark of shame on the Old Grey (out of touch) Lady."

USCivilWar,29n3z1,Dude_man79,5,Wed Jul 2 19:08:23 2014 UTC,"I would like to say this:  Having actually visited the battlefield (knowing in advance the historical commentary on the subject), it is not entirely obvious that the cemetery hill - little round top line was obviously a better choice than the Devil's Den - Wheatfield - Peach Orchard choice.    Without the benefit of hindsight, an educated person could see how Gen. Sickles might have felt the latter choice to be a better position, especially considering his experience at Chancellorsville.  Further, it's entirely possible that Gen. Hood's troops might have rolled up the 3rd Corps' left flank at little round top and created a totally different outcome had they not unexpectedly encountered Sickles' troops ""out of line.""  Anyways, thanks for the post OP."

That would have been a disaster for both nations.  Although the civil war might have been lost, large tracts of Canada would have been taken. The US's navy might not have been as large as the Kingdom's, but they had a jump on ironclads, which would stand up to several British ships of the line. If Canada ever became independent, it would be a shell of its modern self, as it's greater cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver would have been taken, and the future Great Reproachment would never have occurred."

USCivilWar,28f8nb,stgilesbuzzman,2,Wed Jun 18 18:40:03 2014 UTC,"""Chapter XII: Feigned Diseases"" is a pretty disturbing read. It reveals how little the doctors of that day were aware of what we'd today call PTSD. While I'm sure many soldiers faked illnesses just to get out combat (or the military altogether), a lot of these supposedly false symptoms could also be signs of deep trauma that were written off as ""malingering."""
USCivilWar,28d8jo,caswain01,1 point,Tue Jun 17 13:38:54 2014 UTC,I did not know this happened. What was the final upshot?
USCivilWar,28d8jo,DragonflyRider,2,Tue Jun 17 18:06:22 2014 UTC,"I plan to present the story, in parts, in line with the 150th anniversaries of the events.  In this case - the short version:  Federals respond by placing fifty Confederate officers on Morris Island (in a stockade next to the Federal garrison there).  Within a few weeks, a prisoner exchange took place - fifty for fifty.  Fair deal.  Then the Confederates decided that if that swap worked, they would up the numbers.  Six hundred Federals were placed in Charleston with the same demand to stop the bombardment.  Federals respond by putting 600 Confederates on Morris Island.  That last part of the story is well documented... and I think a little misunderstood."
USCivilWar,28d8jo,DragonflyRider,1 point,Wed Jun 18 03:13:22 2014 UTC,"That's hysterical! I knew old Abe was a vigourous proponent of doing whatever works, but not that he would go this far!  Too bad we couldn't have turned it into a full scale prisoner exhange point. It would have saved Charleston a bombardment and a lot of men's lives...  How would you interpret it? To me it looks like the Union had both the military and moral high ground, and the Confederacy threw the dice in an attempt to use the fear of condemnation in the papers to strong arm the Union, and lost."

Darth was a highly respected member of the total war community, and obviously he learned a lot modding the old total war games.  I haven't played too much, but compared to the last total war game, this one is a 12/10."

USCivilWar,289lmq,TheHIV123,1 point,Mon Jun 16 13:11:09 2014 UTC,"Years ago I got sucked into Take Command: 2nd Manassas and spent way too much time playing it and making mod OOBs and scenarios. You're right, it was a great game. At the same time, there's also something to be said for simplicity. Too much realism in a historical war simulation raises all sorts of fun questions I won't get into here, but then again, I might just be neurotic. This one also looks like it's easy to play; like your man said in the video, it's reminiscent of Sid Meier's Gettysburg. I don't have much free time these days, for 10 bucks it looks well worth it for the occasional fling with surreal interactive speculative history. Long as I don't get hooked."

USCivilWar,281ip6,Greasygrassriver,2,Fri Jun 13 13:16:33 2014 UTC,"That's the East. But check out the Atlanta campaign. I really liked ""War like a Thunderbolt"".  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1594161275?pc_redir=1402405303&robot_redir=1  People really get fixated on events in the east, and for good reason. But battles in the west influenced the the Civil War. And 1864 was a big year:  Atlanta, Sherman's march to the sea, and the battles of Franklin and Nashville.   BTW, for the most part, the ""west"" in the civil war was for the most part anything west of the Appalachian Mountains. But that doesn't necessarily include places like California. Our population out there comparably small and battles were very small."
USCivilWar,281ip6,Antiquus,2,Fri Jun 13 14:45:35 2014 UTC,"Well there was the Overland Campaign and Catton is a terrific writer, maybe the best ever. He grew up talking to Civil War vets.  Noted that campaign ended with the Army of the Potomac escaping across the James river on a pontoon bridge a mile long, investing Petersburg with a line of trenches miles long, and sitting there for the next year. The final charge at Cold Harbor just before their escape was the last bloody gasp of Napoleonic tactics in an age of increased accurate firepower.  Then Sherman's Strategic Bombing campaign without the bombers, but the intent was the same.   And if you want to understand Dwight Eisenhower in WWII, read Grant and Sherman."
USCivilWar,27x6iu,Anastik,2,Wed Jun 11 23:51:34 2014 UTC,I managed to win as the Confederates early on the second day on normal difficulty by being unrelenting and managing to (just barely) take Cemetery Hill/Ridge on the first day. The Union launched an attack on the morning of day two which I fought off and that was that.    Right now I'm struggling through day one as the Union on a harder setting.  Brilliant game...can't believe it's only an early access!
USCivilWar,27x6iu,Quimbymouse,1 point,Thu Jun 12 03:59:27 2014 UTC,"Ultimate General: Gettysburg shaping up to be quite a great game indeed.  My only hope is that it sells enough to warrant future battles/campaigns to be created by Darthmod and his team. I've been waiting for a great Civil War game since the late 90s, and it seems like we finally have it."
USCivilWar,27x6iu,speakingcraniums,2,Thu Jun 12 22:08:50 2014 UTC,"In my final day battle, little big top was supremely tough to crack, I eventually succeeded by pushing their flank down, away from the hill, then bringing in reserves and forming a nearly full half circle around it and shooting it for with all my my cannon and then a huge massed charge.  Even then the hill alternated between then two of us for some time, with each of us taking, and then losing the hill.   Eventually I was able to push them off and then rebuffed attack after attack.  It was really cool.  Probably won me the battle."
USCivilWar,27x6iu,genchris,3,Fri Jun 13 15:49:57 2014 UTC,"Having played it for an hour or so, I can say that the AI is unrelenting.  It's fun.

USCivilWar,27roe2,Taphophile,2,Tue Jun 10 17:53:23 2014 UTC,"Definitely. I'm as wary of typhoid and dysentery as the next guy, but our modern sanitation system wastes enormous quantities of useful bio-derived fertilizers and other resources. It's kind of bizarre to see how nonchalantly our not-so-distant ancestors treated human and animal waste, and to what extent they could process it to yield useful resources. (Did you see how many times the author suggests tasting the saltpeter directly off the, err, growing medium to determine its purity? Man.)"

USCivilWar,26b4w6,expostfacto-saurus,1 point,Fri May 23 16:37:18 2014 UTC,"Was it dated at all?    Many of the West Pointers at that time had a passing knowledge of French (Napoleonic tactics were huge and for some reason the administration at West Point thought the cadets should be able to speak the language as well).   I think that the photograph is after his time at West Point.  The cadet uniforms were different that those.  He graduated in 1838, and the uniforms didn't look like that at the time.  He did spend some time back at West Point in 1861, but I do not know what faculty uniforms looked like (although I suspect they were regular army uniforms).    Beauregard spoke French.  It would be insanely awesome if that was his writing on the back and he gave that to someone as a gift.  You might post it over in /r/french (I'm sure there's such a subreddit) and see if they can make it out."
USCivilWar,26b4w6,saxonjf,1 point,Fri May 23 23:50:29 2014 UTC,"That is pretty manifestly a Union officer's uniform: he's wearing officer's shoulder boards. A West Point cadet's uniform would have large inverted chevrons on the shoulders, as well.  Beauregard was a Louisiana French Creole, and probably spoke some dialect of French fluently, and understood proper French better than most officers at the time.  Nice find."
USCivilWar,26b4w6,expostfacto-saurus,1 point,Sat May 24 00:50:11 2014 UTC,In 1861 Beauregard was assigned to the Point.  I'm guessing he was faculty although I'm not sure exactly.

That's what it is, and nothing can change that."
USCivilWar,26b4w6,saxonjf,1 point,Sat May 24 05:25:14 2014 UTC,Okay thank you so it's a Union officer's uniform and if the date is correct it would have been very soon before he joined the Confederacy.
USCivilWar,26b4w6,TTeun,1 point,Sat May 24 16:00:21 2014 UTC,"I'm not certain about the date of the portrait itself.  The photo you provided looks to be about right with the era, but it could be from the 1850s.  But he's clearly in an us army officer's uniform, and nothing on the uniform would indicate what he was doing, as it would in modern times. Unit insignia was a civil war innovation."

A Union guard returned the apron to him at his house some time later and when Turnbull returned to his office, it had been ransacked - but only superficially: blank pages were torn out of empty record books and ink had been dumped over them - but the original courthouse records had been untouched.   http://www.timesdispatch.com/entertainment-life/civil-war-civility-spares-history-in-brunswick/article_5d67b101-5886-5dfa-b5a6-f52b53b900d0.html"
