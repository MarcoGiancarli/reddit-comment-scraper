motorcitykitties,3e407x,MShasta,7,Wed Jul 22 01:56:42 2015 UTC,Probably just to reconcile the rumors that have been floating around so morale doesn't take a hit.

motorcitykitties,3e407x,sollord,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:26:52 2015 UTC,Managing is about as good as it is gonna get given the pitching situation. We need an entirety new pitching staff first not a new manager

motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,mwgris,4,Tue Jul 21 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"It seems to me at least that DD hasn't explicitly said, ""Well seasons over lets move the free agents"", he more has just claimed that the chances of the Tigers winning a pennant this year as it stands are low, because of this he will listen to offers but I doubt he gives away a guy like Price or Cespedes unless they get a return that will help them in the near future. I mean hey, if the Tigers win the next few games (sweep the Mariners?) that should put them right back in the wild card race. Yes I'm aware of how bad the Tigers starters are as well as the bullpen but sometimes things just begin to click and teams start rolling. Should I remind all of you of the Royals record last year at this time? I'm not trying to be naive and claim that the Tigers are going to get hot soon and end up winning the WS, nor am I claiming that they should raise the white flag and give up on the season. I think that DD is exploring both options seeing what he could get for the impending free agents as well as how much he'd have to give up to make this team better. I mean the offense has been very good even without Miggy (though inconsistent), they are 4th in the league in runs scored and lead the league in BA. It's really just the pitching that needs to step up. And I'm hoping it happens.   edit:phrasing"
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,arenyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"If they Tigers are going to be sellers it isn't going to be for prospects (unless its a tie in to the package) My Illitich want to win before he dies, and Dombrowski sure as hell wants to keep his job next year so look for this to be a good deal for the Tigers. I really don't want to see the team sell but I honestly think this team wouldn't be successful in the post-season in its current state. But we have a great opportunity to win big in the trade market and still possibly sign Price in the offseason."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,deadlytitanfart,2,Wed Jul 22 00:12:39 2015 UTC,the tigers shouldn't sell guys who will walk anyway because they still have some chance of wildcard   Nah.
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,the_oskie_woskie,-2,Tue Jul 21 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"I've said this before in threads on this sub, but no way does any GM in baseball give up on their team when they're only a few games out of the playoff picture. I think it will be much more clear what they should do in 10 days but if it were today I would say you roll the dice and go for the wild card spot. We have as good of a chance as anybody else in the running."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,dylanwalshdrums,10,Tue Jul 21 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"What are the next 10 games going to tell you that the last 50 haven't? We are not a playoff team. The pitching staff is horrendous outside of Price, Sanchez, and Soria.   So our only choice is to become buyers and add pitching? We have the worst farm system in baseball. We have nothing to give in order to add pitching depth.  Price, Cespedes, Soria, Avila, Davis, and Simon are all free agents that we could use to add a little something to our farm system. Dombrowski will also have $50 million to spend at the end of the year."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,KAW42089,3,Tue Jul 21 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying any of that. Our pitching staff hasn't been good, but our offense is one of the best in the league. I just look at teams in the past who we're in similar situations. Like the Royals last year for example. While their bullpen was dominant, their starting staff was worse than ours after 81 games, and after 100 games they were 50-50. Their offense also was a heck of a lot worse than ours is this year, and at the end of the 2014 season they were one win away from a title. I also feel like a lot of people over estimate what half a year of Price and Cespedes will net us in a trade. I would be shocked if anyone is willing to give up a top 10 prospect for a half a year of Price and Cespedes."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,dylanwalshdrums,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:24 2015 UTC,KC finished the year with a top 10 offense and pitching. KC finished 9th in team runs last year and 4th in team ERA. We are one dimensional this year and one dimensional teams don't make the playoffs.   Edit: Any prospects are better than no prospects when we aren't making the playoffs this year anyways.
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,KAW42089,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"The numbers I was quoting were from the first half to show how similar their situation was to ours this year. And I'm assuming you only looked at their numbers compared to the AL, because they finished 14th in team runs and 12th in team ERA when you look at the whole MLB. Neither their offense or their pitching was top ten, and after just half a season neither was even close to top ten. We have a top 5 offense right now, and while we have been one dimentional, you could also say the same thing about the other 5 teams that are fighting for a wildcard spot too. Looking at the Twins, Orioles, and Blue Jays rosters, none of them scream ""playoff team"" to me any more than our roster."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,dylanwalshdrums,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"Well we are only playing for an AL playoff spot, so the whole league is kind of irrelevant. That still puts them in the top half of the entire league for both."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,KAW42089,2,Tue Jul 21 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"So, hypothetically, if the Tigers win the next 10 games, that changes nothing for you and you sell all of these players?"
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,SodiumThoride,6,Tue Jul 21 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I want to watch a competent team for the next five years.   Oh, and the Tigers should fire Jeff Jones."

I'm pretty sure if Gibby can't broadcast due to his illness he can't manage either. Plus Arizona was a dumpster fire under him."
motorcitykitties,3e4b3b,tellymundo,2,Wed Jul 22 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"What are you even expecting to get for Simon and Avila?  Let alone Price, Cespedes and Davis...  We're going to get maybe one player that useful out of that whereas all of these guys can help us this year.  we're not even what, 5 games back of the wild card?  This season is far from over..."
motorcitykitties,3e5f49,dryhoppedjosh,3,Wed Jul 22 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to defend DD and say: Price is amazing, Anibal has underperformed when no one expected, Greene has WILDLY underperformed given his breakout last season and very promising peripherals, Simon has been meh as expected, but JV had the injury and sucked. It wasn't going to be as good, but I'm not blaming DD entirely for the staff sucking.   I can 100% blame him for bullpen sucking and Ausmus for being a dumb shit."

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,Joeleo_,20,Tue Jul 21 12:51:15 2015 UTC,finally a smart decision
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,eoswald,11,Tue Jul 21 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"I'd rather we keep Price and try to extend him. If he walks, we at least get a pick for him. I don't think 2 months of Price will net us something that is ridiculously more valuable than the draft pick, but maybe some team is desperate.  I am okay with trading Cespedes, as re-signing him would be too expensive for his worth and we get no pick. I would also be completely fine with keeping Cespy and making a push for the wild card though. Obviously the pitching has been horrible as of late, but Price is great, and Sanchez has been fine since the start of June. Trading for a 3rd starter is doable. This still requires one of JV, Simon, Greene, etc to step up and be useful, and a second to literally be a body every 5th day."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,honar,10,Tue Jul 21 14:48:56 2015 UTC,Last year we got Christian Stewart with the pick we got for Scherzer I think we can get more than that if we trade price
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,meStrangerDanger,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:58 2015 UTC,The talent in this year's draft was also not that great.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, all the reports I've been seeing is that this year's draftees are doing quite well right now.

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,kgriffin44,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:07 2015 UTC,Lots of reports said that this year was a shallow. A lot of the draftees don't have the same ceiling as the previous years drafts.   Only a few are projected to become superstars and a lot of the pitchers have been predicted to be middle of the rotation.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,Rbaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see, you're talking the whole draft, not who the Tigers drafted in particular."

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,FakeyFaked,0,Tue Jul 21 18:14:49 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure. I would assume that they're hired by the GM/President which in our case is DD.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,Rbaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:56 2015 UTC,Just looked through the front office roster - one name immediately popped out.  Jim Devellano works for the Tigers now?  I'd have never guessed.  (He used to be in the Red Wings front office)  Also - David Chadd - Special VP to the GM and in charge of scouting.  Let's delve into his history.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/David_Chadd

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,threemadness,14,Tue Jul 21 17:23:16 2015 UTC,Bye Cespy :(
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,nomadic_River,0,Tue Jul 21 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, maybe trading Cespedes opens up a spot for Stephen Moya or Tyler Collins"
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,koepkejj,13,Tue Jul 21 14:13:19 2015 UTC,That honestly doesn't sound bright at all. Neither Collins nor Moya really excite me.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,nomadic_River,6,Tue Jul 21 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"It would be the addition of a left-handed bat in either case, and Collins was somewhat productive in his time with the team earlier this year. Both are 25 or under, which could give the team some youthful power, as well as keep them to the league minimum for years. Honestly, having a guy with power potential at the league minimum makes me very exicted"
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,koepkejj,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a good placeholder for now, but I don't see him being around long term."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,nomadic_River,0,Tue Jul 21 15:13:18 2015 UTC,I think either of them are our best option in the outfield for a while. There aren't many good outfielders to be had on the cheap right now.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,koepkejj,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing Moya up here in the big leagues for a bit if he can reduce his strikeout rate and have more productive ABs.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,ChurroTigerTime,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'm worried that Moya is Castellanos 2.0. So much hype, but can't get past the strikeout/swinging strike issue. Moya obviously has 40+ HR potential, but he's really struggled in AAA this year."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,dbenoos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"That's true about Moya, but Collins seems to be major league ready, at least given what he did previously this year with the team"

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,CareBearDontCare,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:35 2015 UTC,No. Yea...
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,koepkejj,12,Tue Jul 21 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"Might as well start mentally preparing ourselves for complete reconstruction, because with every passing day, that seems to be what we're headed for.  Bye Astro :("
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,ChurroTigerTime,18,Tue Jul 21 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"DD stated its not a complete rebuild just a ""regrouping"" meaning that Price and Cespedes are likely going to get dealt but he's not completely breaking the team down. The hope is those two guys (as well as possibly Avila, Davis and Soria) will net a good price that either helps retool their farm system or helps them prepare to contend starting in 2016. I'll miss Price a lot he's a great pitcher and a fantastic locker room present along with Astro. Yo too, he gets along really well here with all the Latin guys which is one reason I think he's playing so good. But sometimes you gotta do what's best for the franchise. Unless something drastically changes in the next 10 games (meaning they win at least 7 or 8 of them) the tigers probably aren't going to make a run. Yes their offense has still been potent but their pitching has been terrible."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,arenyk,11,Tue Jul 21 14:25:02 2015 UTC,"Seeing how they need to completely overhaul their pitching, I don't see how DD is going to be able to do that in just a year or two. And with an aging core and barren farm, this very could be the beginning of a complete reconstruction.   I hate to say it, but it's looking like the Tigers squandered their WS chance."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,-Pasha-,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I have to wonder how differently things would have played out if DD actually build us a bullpen in any of the past 8 or 9 years."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,qwerty-snowman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:03 2015 UTC,Things would have been a lot different if Joel Zumaya hadn't blown out his arm.

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,qwerty-snowman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"He did at least try to build it. Nathan was excellent the year before we got him and he spent a lot to get him. Soria was doing great when we got him, but sucked last year once we did. Rondon was supposed to be a major piece but he couldn't stay healthy. DD did try, but his decisions just didn't work."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,ruiner8850,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"No way. Remember that whatever we get for price, theoretically could be used to get a similar level player in a trade. By selling now, DD can have ammo to make a run next year. He doesn't develop prospects, he trades them. There's nothing there right now to even bother trying to buy at the deadline.   Trade the free agent five, (two of which are essentially backups) and we still field a core that can compete in 2016. The prospects we get can be flipped next year for major league talent to fill holes.   In a perfect world..."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,bigdubsy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:30 2015 UTC,"Price is exactly the kind of player that the Tigers need right now. Unless DD trades Price for another stud pitcher, it's not really going to help the Tigers in the near future."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,-Pasha-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"We have five guys to trade. And some money to spend in the off season. The amount of prospects we can get for these guys, I believe would allow us to get an ace in a trade. It's rinse wash repeat. If we keep price on this team that wont win anything, we wont have any prospects to trade next year ( when maybe we will be a contender) and will be stuck again."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,bigdubsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think that even if we do win out next 6 games, we're still going to be in sell mode just because DD has to start thinking of possible trades, which may take a couple days if he wants to get the most bang for his buck for dealing Cespy or Price. I can't imagine he'd be able to piece a deal together in one day if the Tigers decide to shit the bed the next couple of days."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,ChurroTigerTime,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"I say everyone but Miggy, Iglesias, and JD should be on the table at the deadline."

It seems like selling rarely works out that well.   EDIT: I do believe it's probably for the best to trade Cespedes/Price, but a full rebuild in baseball seems so risky. KC seemed to do it though."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,GraemeTaylor,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:33 2015 UTC,Bummed. Dombrowski ignoring the bullpen for so many years finally caught up to us.
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,20,Tue Jul 21 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"I want to pop in to say that Dombrowski did not ignore the bullpen.  A couple off-seasons ago he signed Joe Nathan, who was one of the best closers all-time to that point.  Last year when Nathan struggled, Dombrowski went out and got Joakim Soria, a guy who was having a superb season in a hitter's park.  He promptly came to Detroit and got injured.  You can criticize his decisions, but it is incorrect to say Dombrowski has completely ignored the pen."

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,GraemeTaylor,16,Tue Jul 21 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"He didn't ignore it, he just failed in trying to build it. It wasn't like he said ""nah fuck all that shit, bullpens are for bitches."" Plus, blame the starting rotation for our woes, not the bullpen. Honestly, it seems to be moving in the right direction with guys like Wilson and Hardy."

motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,GraemeTaylor,4,Tue Jul 21 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't that he ignored it. The issue is that by building a team through trades and free agency you end up decimating your farm system. Instead of having young quality arms come up through your system you package them in deals for established vets. It is essentially impossible to build a top tier bullpen through anything other than the farm system. By the time a player establishes themselves in the bigs as a great guy out of the pen their price is prohibitively high to acquire them in trades and when they hit free agency they almost always will go to a team willing to try them out in the rotation. Look at the top pens: St. Louis and KC, what do they have in common? Incredible farm systems."
motorcitykitties,3e2e6a,AlmostStainless,0,Tue Jul 21 16:35:54 2015 UTC,Might as well just sell all the up coming free agents not just Price and Cespy doubt it will help much if we actually do about the shit pitching coach staff we have.

motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Baloo148,5,Tue Jul 21 14:17:49 2015 UTC,"So based on the above, I'm firmly in the ""Short-term rebuild"" camp.  Therefore I'm happy to see that the FO is now considering testing the market for Price and Cespedes.  Here's my take on our pending free agents:  Price: Very conflicted on whether to try and trade or re-sign.  Obviously re-signing would be extremely expensive, and put us at risk of another Verlander-type situation, but something about Price's demeanor leads me to believe that he would be the type of guy that could gracefully transition to a finesse-type pitcher should the velocity start to go.  I think he is the type to constantly be trying to improve, whereas Verlander can seem a bit too stubborn to admit that he needs to change.  Obviously this is all complete speculation, as I don't really know either of these guys, but that's my gut feel.  I'd be curious to see what we could get on the trade market, but I also think we'll desperately need an Ace for the next 2 seasons, and Price could definitely be that, even if things start to go south further down the line.    Cespedes: I see no reason not to trade him now.  Not entirely sure what his worth would be for only half a season, but maybe at least a reliable pen arm that would be controlled for a couple seasons? I also wouldn't be against trying to re-sign him in the offseason, and I think it's fairly likely, considering how highly the Tiger's FO felt about Cespedes even before he entered the league.  My only concern is that he is having a fantastic contract year, so he may be overvalued in the offseason.    Avila: Trade him if you can.  Probably not worth much more than a fringy prospect, but McCann is the future, IMO.  This is obviously up for debate, a lot of people like Avila.  I still respect his game-calling and OBP, but I think it's time to move on to McCann.  Holaday remains around for a decent back-up.    Soria: Re-sign.  Maybe not as dominant as he once was, but still probably the best closer we've had in years, and I don't see why he couldn't continue being that for another couple years.    Simon:  Let him walk.  I think there will be better SP on the free agent market that we can replace him with.  If we could actually get anything worthwhile in a trade, go for it, but I don't see that happening.   Davis:  I really like Rajai as a 4th outfielder/Platoon partner w/ Gose.  Re-sign if his price is reasonable.  If we keep Rajai, I could see giving Moya a shot starting in LF.  This would cover our entire infield and outfield, leaving all of our remaining trade chips/FA money available to devote to pitching.    Not related, but I'm also extremely for sacking Jeff Jones."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,VanDelay_Industry,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"I just don't think resigning Price is an option, unless we massively overpay for the guy - I haven't heard one report that says we have a chance at resigning him."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,bigdubsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree.  That was more of what I'd like to see rather than what I think could happen.  Like I said, even if we could re-sign him, I'm not entirely convinced it would be worth it.  Would love having him for the next 2-4 years, but I also don't wanna be spending $90 Million on just Verlander, Price, and Cabrera in 2020.  That would almost definitely be a disaster.  If we could get a major league bullpen arm or maybe a mid-tier SP prospect that could be a reasonable back of the rotation guy in the near future, I wouldn't mind a trade, but I may be massively overvaluing a half-season of an ace."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,nrab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"I like this and agree, except I think ""getting a bullpen arm"" has let this team down too many times. We need arms. I feel like plenty of teams have built their fantastic bullpens with converted starters. KC and Baltimore come to mind, but I haven't researched anything.   Just get starters. They are more durable and have more to work with. Relievers it seems give us a good year and then fall off.   Thats my somewhat outside the box opinion."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,dbenoos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a mediocre starter absolutely can turn into a top-tier reliever.  The problem is starters are much more expensive.  I'd be more inclined to sign a couple more relievers than you actually need, in case a couple bust.  You'd still probably be spending less than if you went out and bought a starter just to throw him in the bullpen.  That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to seeing Ryan, Lobstein, Farmer, and/or Greene in the bullpen if we can actually pull in enough starting pitching so that they aren't needed in the rotation."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,qwerty-snowman,5,Tue Jul 21 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"the core offensively is fine. miggy, vmart, JD should continue to rake for a few years. Iggy is fine of course. Gose/McCann/Casty will probably get a bit better as the older guys decline.  the concern here is the pitching as it has been this entire season. That ""core"" we have locked up is pretty brutal. If JV can be useful it's an entirely different story, but if he continues to hit the zito trajectory then we need 2-3 more starters to be competitive unless you believe in one of kyle ryan/buck farmer to be a #2 or #3 type. I love Anibal but he's like a #1b type at best. I'm not sure he can be the true #1 guy going into the future. to be clear I don't think locking price up long term is a possibility  As for the bullpen, I don't think Wilson will ever pitch this well ever again unless he can get a consistent strikeout pitch. Blaine Hardy's peripherals this year are promising. AlAl is on a 3 year drop in K rate and a 4 year drop in contact% (58.5% contact in '11, 73.1% this year). Rondon certainly has potential and he definitely isn't as bad as he's shown so far this year, but the fact that he's getting almost no soft contact (12%) is concerning. Krol to me looks like Schlereth 2.0. Yeah he's young but he needs to cut that walk rate in half, at least. Not to mention the dingers."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,jtheil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree. I'm certainly being a bit (a lot?) optimistic about the pitching staff, but I think having the offense shored up means we will have the money to go out and buy a couple of starters in a stacked FA market.    I agree about AlAl and Krol.  Even when AlAl was great, for some reason I still never felt entirely comfortable with him on the mound, he seemed like a wild-card.  I also have little-to-no faith in Krol.  But, I don't think a BP core of Soria, Feliz, Rondon, Hardy, Wilson is too bad, if we could re-sign Soria and add 1 or 2 more guys through selling this year or in the offseason.    I certainly don't expect to have an elite pitching staff like we have come to enjoy in recent years (Starting-wise, obviously not bullpen).  But if the offense can remain at around the same level as it has been this season, I think we could still be competitive with even an average pitching staff."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,iStayLifted,7,Tue Jul 21 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think DD needs to do at this deadline, if he's going to sell:  Sell everything possible.. Package Price and Soria together, get 2 SP prospects and a OF prospect in return. Trade Cespedes for another pitching prospect and/or young MLB-ready role player at any position. Trade Rajai, Simon, Avila for whatever we can get.  Play McCann, Castellanos, Gose, Collins/Moya/Fields, Machado, etc. as much as possible the rest of the season to see what they can do.  Give Farmer/Ryan/Lobstein/any other acquired prospects the rest of the season to compete for two rotation spots (maybe three).  Move JV to the bullpen. I know it sounds crappy, but he's killing us as a starter. He could be a kick ass closer, or lockdown 2-inning guy with his velocity and arsenal of pitches. It seems like he always has 2-3 good innings to start a game and falls apart as he goes on, so why not use his strength to our advantage."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,iStayLifted,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think that'd be a good plan for a long-term rebuild, just not sure I'm ready to concede the next couple of seasons yet.  Also, as for JV, maybe I'm being a blind optimist, but I feel he can still be an effective starter.  Obviously not Ace, but at least back of the rotation, with an outside shot of improving to a #3ish guy.  Looking at his 6 starts this season, it isn't quite as bad as I thought. Three of them obviously have been atrocious, but the others have been at least respectable (2ER over 5 innings, 2ER over 6 innings, and 1ER over 7.2 innings(!)), especially considering how recently he is coming off of injury."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,3,Tue Jul 21 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of Verlander at closer. Most pitchers gain 2-4 mph moving from the rotation to the bullpen, which would put him at about 95-97 on his fastball. He'd also be able to work multiple innings, which would take a load off the rest of the pen. And even if it doesn't work, it's not as if he's dominating in the rotation anyways. The only problem is that Buck Farmer/Kyle Ryan won't be much better as a starter unless they improve drastically and Buck learns how to throw strikes."

motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"I urge you to read this comment.  Ausmus is probably not a top-tier manager, but I don't think our losses have anything to do with him either.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Jeff Jones could be a major detriment to the team, however.  That is who needs to go."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,MShasta,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Well I'm going to go ahead and disagree that Ausmus has been doing ""great"" with this ""shit pitching staff"" he's been given. He was just as bad last year when we had much better starters. I don't see how any tiger fan could be confident in the state of our team/management/front office right now."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"Offense doesn't win games anymore. The Tigers have been a top 3-5 offense for years, probably will be in the top 10 next year too, but will still be just spinning wheels. As long the bullpen is a liability, a team cannot win, or rather, it can only go so far. The defense has been shored up a little, Soria has been a pleasant surprise, but he will (should) be dealt. The Tigers will score some runs in 2016, but what are the bullpen pieces, who is the closer, who is the ace next year, what is available to spend? The thing Tigers fans aren't used to is the front office corporate lip service, it's a ""rebuild"" it's a ""regroup,"" please tell me you guys aren't so dense to believe that. The window has closed, the money is drying up."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,MShasta,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, the top teams do, in general, tend to be the ones with elite pitching.  But that doesn't necessarily mean it's the only way to win games.  Toronto, Houston, NY (AL), Minnesota,  are all above .500 and at least still in the running for a playoff spot, despite average-ish pitching staffs (basing this off of total team ERs on the year, not perfect, but reasonable).  I'm not saying the Tigers will be the best team in baseball, I'm saying they can compete, and have a reasonable shot at a playoff opportunity.    If I were starting a team from scratch, I would certainly look to start with an elite pitching staff, but we're not starting from scratch.  We have a great offense, and we just need to bring the pitching staff up to a competitive level, which I believe is very possible via trades and free agent signings.    In the end, I just want to clear away a bit of the cynicism and pessimism surrounding the near future of the team.  This season could mark the beginning of the decline, but it could also very well be a minor setback leading to a resurgence. Despite the negatives, there are a lot of reasons to be excited about the Tigers right now."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Those teams are winning because the entire pitching staff is, at the very, very least, average. That isn't true for the Tigers, they have Price, arguably the best pitcher in at least the American League, and then 4 guys behind him who are well below average. Of those teams you mentioned, I think only Houston has any real shot of making any noise in the playoffs, and even they will likely be exposed. If you think the team's brass is happy with them simply making the playoffs and getting smoked every year, then yes, by all means, you should have every reason to be upbeat about this team, but if you are looking for a World Series contender now or any time in the next 5 seasons or so, forget it, not here, maybe KC, maybe Cleveland, but not the Tigers. It isn't cynicism, it isn't vapid negativity, it's simply a thing that is true. Having a couple good hitters and zero pitching is nothing to be excited about."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,MShasta,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"arguably the best pitcher in at least the American League, and then 4 guys behind him who are well below average.   Sanchez is not well below average."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Right, but you're talking about the 2015 Tigers, which I agree aren't going to do much of anything.  My argument is that since we don't have to worry too much about our offense (and defense), we will likely be able to put together a competent pitching staff via trades/free agent signings for the 2016 season.    To look at it a different way, when a team wants to improve an area (pitching, offense, defense, whatever) they typically have to give something up in a different category i.e. we gave up pitching in Porcello (future results notwithstanding, he was a pretty key piece of our rotation at the time) for Offense/Defense of Cespedes.  I think the Tigers are in an interesting position right now, such that their biggest weakness looks like it should be abundant in the free agency market this offseason, so as long as they have the money and are willing to spend it they can significantly improve a weakness without compromising their already above-average offense and defense. Whether it would be enough to contend is certainly not guaranteed, I simply think it's plausible enough to go for it.    As far as being a playoff team vs. a champion team, I'm in the camp that believes they are the same thing.  Obviously just guessing, but I'd say playoff success is 60+% luck/which team is hot.  Last year I wouldn't have considered the Giants or the Royals world series contenders compared to the rest of the field, but they fought it out during the season for a wild card spot, and got hot at the right time to make it to the championship.  There's no reason the Tigers couldn't do the same, we just haven't gotten hot/lucky at the right times the past few seasons."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,MShasta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"This would be a fair set of points if the Tigers needed only 1 starter, they don't, they need 3  and that's IF Verlander and Sanchez both are serviceable next year. What is the honest to God likelihood that they both bounce back? And as far as the Tigers landing an ace type this offseason, forget it, they aren't in a position to outbid anyone, and furthermore, let's say they do land one, you are seeing that having an ace is not a guarantee to win.   And again, this doesn't touch the bullpen, including closer, or the left fielder."
motorcitykitties,3e2nuw,Throwaway9999vzjd,0,Tue Jul 21 22:18:00 2015 UTC,"Bullpen pieces? Alex Wilson, Blaine Hardy, Al Al, Bruce Rondon, possibly Nate Feliz. Not to mention FA pickups. We have the tools to fire up the bullpen which, despite our shortcomings this year, has been better. Is that set in stone? No. Is there hope? Asbolutely.   Honestly, I really don't know what your point in all of this is. It is clear you aren't a Tigers fan. It is fine to have the viewpoint you have, but usually when talking to a fan, it is from the point of view of what do we do now? What would you do differently? You seem to be set on convincing everyone here that our team sucks and we should be ready to watch shitty baseball for the foreseeable future. It is also really bizarre and weird because you make these long winded responses to so many different people. If so, I don't know what you get out of it, but you should probably stop taking it all so seriously.   My bet? You are a fan from the KC or Indians subreddit and don't want your main account banned from here or there, so you made this throwaway to come shit on the team. That's fine, but I would advise anyone reading this to not feed the troll. He doesn't want to discuss, he just wants to tell you why you are wrong."

motorcitykitties,3e0spz,Robot_Satan,6,Tue Jul 21 08:08:06 2015 UTC,I agree with that sentiment. I feel like we could have gotten someone like Leake or Latos with what we gave up.
motorcitykitties,3e0spz,Rbaner,4,Tue Jul 21 08:20:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Leake, Latos, and Simon have been just about equal so far.  All worth about 1fWAR, Latos because of his injuries (which were a concern before the season) and Leake and Simon because they are pitching to about the same FIP.  Leake and Simon have about the same K/BB% as well (Leake's is about .5% higher), but Leake has given up homers at a slightly higher rate and has a higher LOB% and BABip .040 lower, despite them having almost the same career numbers in those areas.  ROS I would think that Latos>Simon=Leake, more or less, and we probably could have sent less to get Simon, but I don't think it was an awful trade."
motorcitykitties,3e0spz,Robot_Satan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:13:33 2015 UTC,I would say that Leake is a tad bit better than Simon because he has been pitching in Great American Ballpark.

motorcitykitties,3e2nvr,MShasta,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:59:53 2015 UTC,A $30 mil a year deal for Price and probably +$15 mil a year for Cespedes. Add that to the cash dedicated to the payroll already for next year. It's all but impossible to sign both. Signing one doesn't even seem reasonable.

Everything we know about Illitch is he is willing to spend big to make it big. Maybe he won't sign both, but saying it's unlikely he would sign 1 because of the contract total is just talking out of your ass."
motorcitykitties,3e2nvr,MShasta,0,Tue Jul 21 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ha! Dude, the tigers have $105 million next year owed to Cabrera, Verlander, VMart, Kinsler and Sanchez alone. Oh yeah, let's just keep adding $20 mil a year players. That's genius."
motorcitykitties,3e2nvr,MShasta,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"Nothing in my comment was saying whether it was prudent re-sign either, I was talking about our ability to do so. You seem to think management won't take the payroll any higher. I'd argue that if we have heard anything, it is to the contrary to that. Illitch wants a WS before he dies. I expect him to flash the wallet."
motorcitykitties,3e2nvr,meStrangerDanger,0,Tue Jul 21 16:44:42 2015 UTC,I read a story earlier today that his son has taken more control of the front office and that our payroll is expected to decrease going forward. How much I don't know. I think it was on mlive where I read it.

Yeah they won the World Series and all those veterans had career years, but they've been in last place the two years since and those contracts became a burden when they didn't play up to what they were the year prior."

motorcitykitties,3e0se6,kyle1913,8,Tue Jul 21 02:57:54 2015 UTC,Why not improve the farm now instead of fucking over the payroll for years to come for what would be a long shot next year?

motorcitykitties,3e0se6,bkn6136,12,Tue Jul 21 05:32:00 2015 UTC,Sell off the rest and keep Price. He is a great pitcher and locker room gold.
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,dylanwalshdrums,8,Tue Jul 21 04:21:07 2015 UTC,I don't think you know how this works...
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,TheRevMerril,6,Tue Jul 21 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"I think it will be more obvious what they should do when the trade deadline comes, but if it were today I can't imagine any GM in baseball selling when they're just 4 games out of the wild card. I just don't see half a year of Price and Cespedes netting us a return worth giving up on those chances. Look at the Royals last year. At one point they were 50-50 and ended up one win away from a World Series."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,bkn6136,6,Tue Jul 21 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Royals had the 27th worst ERA as a team with 2 legitimate starters. According to the Pythagorean record calculations, the Tigers are the fifth worst AL team and eight games out of the second wild card."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,dylanwalshdrums,7,Tue Jul 21 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Pythag loved the Tigers going into the Playoffs last year..."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,SenorHatorade,3,Tue Jul 21 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. I don't even know what you mean, pythag just measures an expected win percent based on runs allowed vs. prevented. It doesn't work as a postseason predictor (nothing does, the playoffs are a crapshoot!)"
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,SHITTINwhileTHINKIN,3,Tue Jul 21 10:48:05 2015 UTC,They really didn't have a great starting staff last year (dat bullpen tho). Over the full season their entire staff was 11th in ERA but in the first half their starters were 24th in the league and their entire staff was 18th so its not like they were great or even top 50% for that matter. Their offense also wasn't even close to as good as ours is this year. I just don't think you should give up while you still have a decent chance.
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,bkn6136,13,Tue Jul 21 03:10:29 2015 UTC,If we can somehow tie Verlander to Price...
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,cab4656,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:50 2015 UTC,That's exactly how you get zero return for Price. Terrible idea
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,dougiefresh00,7,Tue Jul 21 05:12:05 2015 UTC,"I'd send Price + Verlander for nothing, absolutely. Getting out of JV's contract would be a huge return on it's own."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,ZombieHitchens2012,8,Tue Jul 21 10:44:56 2015 UTC,Send Price + Verlander for nothing. Use savings to sign Price in the offseason.   It'll never happen though.
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,teflondre,2,Tue Jul 21 13:07:21 2015 UTC,Yeah no team wants to be handcuffed by JV's contract. especially since Price would be gone after the season anyway. Basically just a trade for verlander. we can dream though!
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,WreckingWall,5,Tue Jul 21 13:56:47 2015 UTC,You need to at least see what you can get for them.
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,ShakeItTilItPees,5,Tue Jul 21 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Sell this year and give you a chance in the next years going forward, or sacrifice any chance at competitiveness beyond this year to go all in on a 1 game playoff, and if you do manage to win you probably don't have a chance at a Division Series win because the pitching staff is garbage.  This choice should be pretty easy."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,appzb,4,Tue Jul 21 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"If we sell Soria, Valverde will return and close out the 9th."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,TTTTTTTtttimmmmm,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"Sick dance moves, even sicker bombs hit off his splitter."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,larrykins,7,Tue Jul 21 13:14:45 2015 UTC,"Best news I've heard all day. This team has talent but is flawed. If they deal the soon-to-be FA's like Price, Simon, Yo, Soria, Avila,  and Davis they can retool quickly. I'd rather they be good for 10 more years with a decent shot at making the playoffs for most of those seasons than hoping that they somehow turn it around towards September like they did in 2012, which was a MUCH better team than this year's, and hope to win the WS as a wild card. Their pitching flat out sucks and there's no reason to think it'll turn around. Their hitting is inconsistent. Add it all up and you probably have a 75-85 win team, not bad, but not sufficient for the large payroll and certainly not better than other top teams in the AL. More and more this season reminds me of 2008."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,Niccalo,5,Tue Jul 21 04:00:57 2015 UTC,I feel like getting rid of one of our more solid starting pitchers when we're having pitching issues isn't the best idea
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,-Pasha-,7,Tue Jul 21 05:54:31 2015 UTC,"The whole point is to throw in the towel this year, trade away valuable pending free agents and start retooling for next year."

motorcitykitties,3e0se6,fropek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"I'd rather keep Cespedes. Can't imagine we'd get anything crazy for him, he's pretty solid on the field, and he fits really well here. Price is great and all but we need to get rid of someone good."
motorcitykitties,3e0se6,xjustinx22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:58 2015 UTC,I would like to see price get traded but hopefully Cespedes stays. Price is going to max Scherzer money this off season and as we have seen with the Verlander contract it is not smart to give a SP that much money for such a long time.

motorcitykitties,3dz0p1,pm_ur_wifes_nudes,5,Mon Jul 20 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Whether you are right now or not, it's ludricous to suggest that Verlander would or (almost assuredly) will ever be traded. Trading him is like the ultimate catch-22; when he was good enough for other teams to want him and his salary, he was still the face of the franchise along with Miggy in the brightest period of Tigers baseball in the last 25-30 yrs so he wouldn't have ever have been traded. Now that he's not playing well, nobody wants his contract because he is ridiculously overpaid for his production.   But I agree that we should've signed Scherzer. Unfortunately the Tigers have too much money locked up elsewhere to be able to have signed him to as long of a deal as the Nats gave him"

motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,4,Tue Jul 21 02:03:11 2015 UTC,YASSSSS
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:05 2015 UTC,Little scare on that foul but ok good job boys
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheRealBigMula,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:57 2015 UTC,Swing & a miss!  The best kind of last out for the save.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:57 2015 UTC,"I think my lungs might have just inverted with that heavy sigh of relief.  That was too close of a call, Justin, no more trying to jinx us for your damned post game show."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:53 2015 UTC,Woo hoo!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Wingnut00,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:40 2015 UTC,I can't believe I've never thought of posting that before  You are lots of clever and I like that.   TIGERS WIN  http://youtu.be/-YCN-a0NsNk
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:34 2015 UTC,TIGERS WIN!!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:28 2015 UTC,It would be Nelson Cruz at the plate right now.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,3,Tue Jul 21 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"You got it Soria, cmon"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheRealBigMula,4,Tue Jul 21 02:01:06 2015 UTC,OH GOD WHY JUSTIN WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO JINX US
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:18 2015 UTC,I've already come to terms with what is about to happen. That's where I'm at with this season.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,PapaNathande,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:44 2015 UTC,"There was a game not too long ago where every time I switched over Ian was hitting a dinger or a clutch double and he's hit two in the game I'm watching tonight.   Meanwhile, that scrub JD out in right field hasn't hit one tonight so you should probably just trade him to us."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,gotsnow,6,Tue Jul 21 01:58:16 2015 UTC,NO.  A hundred times NO.  But nice try.   Again.  ;)
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,6,Tue Jul 21 01:59:55 2015 UTC,Were you the card bro that was over here telling us about a rule where we could only have Martinez on a team at a time and we had to give one to you? Cause whatever cardbro that was I am still laughing about it.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:27 2015 UTC,Too bad the Cards already have Carlos Martinez.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:08 2015 UTC,"I told you, we changed his name to Carlos Smith."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,gotsnow,3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but remember, she already has a Martinez on her team.  :D"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:06 2015 UTC,I do remember that no worries. ;)
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was me. Still waiting on you to make a decision."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,gotsnow,5,Tue Jul 21 02:01:11 2015 UTC,We'll give you Francisco Martinez.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:14 2015 UTC,Victor Martinez and you've got yourself a deal.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,gotsnow,3,Tue Jul 21 02:01:32 2015 UTC,NO.  A hunnert times NO.  Just no.  no no no no no no no!  We love and cherish our Marts.    YOU CANNOT HAVE OUR MARTS.    ^(Thank you for playing.)
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:11 2015 UTC,Pls throw a strike Soria
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheBulgarSlayer,4,Tue Jul 21 01:57:44 2015 UTC,Joakim pls don't fuck us.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,4,Tue Jul 21 01:57:10 2015 UTC,Holy shit. The royals might actually lose too.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:15 2015 UTC,KINS
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:45 2015 UTC,ATTABOY IAN
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheBulgarSlayer,9,Tue Jul 21 01:55:32 2015 UTC,You know what would've made that better? Rod Allen.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,ArttVandelay,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"He does bring such an enthusiasm for the game and to the broadcast, doesn't he?"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,6,Tue Jul 21 01:57:04 2015 UTC,I think that Gibby has done a great job tonight.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:40 2015 UTC,Lets all bow our heads and pray to the closer gods that Soria doesn't fuck this one up.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"Please, oh baseball Gods, relieve us of the Curse of Papa Grande and allow Soria to do what we know he can do"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,6,Tue Jul 21 01:55:22 2015 UTC,Kinsler should get kicked out of more games...
motorcitykitties,3dzita,allyallmfersneed___,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:09 2015 UTC,My coaches in high school always told us we hit better when pissed off lol
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,4,Tue Jul 21 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"We needed something huge to re-ignite our offense, I hope this is the starting point!"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:07 2015 UTC,Ian Kinsler!!!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,jimbo_hawkins,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:58 2015 UTC,IAN!

motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:24 2015 UTC,KINSLER HERO OF THE GAME
motorcitykitties,3dzita,bluemar00n,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:22 2015 UTC,I SEE YA IAN
motorcitykitties,3dzita,dirty_drunk,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:22 2015 UTC,KINSLER WITHH HIS SECOND HOME RUN OF THE NIGHT!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Novh,5,Tue Jul 21 01:53:02 2015 UTC,::headsnap::  wha?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:56 2015 UTC,holy shit Kinsler!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:49 2015 UTC,THATS GONE!!!!!!!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Novh,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"IAN!!! Have a night, woooo!"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:42 2015 UTC,OMG!!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheRealBigMula,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:35 2015 UTC,Come on Kinsler...
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:25 2015 UTC,Here we go Kinsler
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheRealBigMula,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, Kris Medlen is back from his second TJ surgery, and pitching right now in relief for the Royals.  Edit: Aaaannnd gives up a two-run HR to Travis Ishikawa."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"Pinch hitting the .192 Avila for McCann who has gone 2 for 2 with 2 RBIs. I understand the left-right matchup, but come on."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,CaveDweller1108,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:38 2015 UTC,and then not pinch hitting Gose for Raj....
motorcitykitties,3dzita,dirty_drunk,3,Tue Jul 21 01:49:23 2015 UTC,Avila also has a crazy good OBP...
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:09 2015 UTC,LETS GO
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Novh,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:45 2015 UTC,Almost a homer!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:42 2015 UTC,I'm completely baffled as to why he would of swing at that.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"And man on man, my u-verse is so delayed I just realized while talking to my father on the phone in the middle of the game, I'm about a minute back from his charter broadcast :("
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:31 2015 UTC,It was 3-0. Why would you swing?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:33 2015 UTC,"5-1 Buccos top of the 4th in KC :)  Thank you, Mr. McCutchen!"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,3,Tue Jul 21 01:28:03 2015 UTC,Let's hope that Pirates - Cards - Astros can calm those royals down a bit.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:12 2015 UTC,A Twins implosion would also be pretty convenient about now as well.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,3,Tue Jul 21 01:47:09 2015 UTC,Let's pray lol.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:09 2015 UTC,Pray? We're past praying. Let's start sacrificing beings to the beisebol gods. Maybe we'll get a couple games winning streak for every player we immolate who used PED's.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:06 2015 UTC,They're going to face some pretty good pitching over the next little while. Gerrit Cole starts tomorrow for the Buccos!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"Oh that should be a good game.  I can't help it though, Burnett is my favorite pirates pitcher..."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I love A.J., saw him pitch vs the Cardinals a few years ago at PNC Park :)"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"He's awesome, and I'm glad he's finally having a killer year he deserves."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:08 2015 UTC,THUNK  Again? Dang. He's having a rough night back there.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Wingnut00,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:45 2015 UTC,I'm confused. What did JV do? I missed it.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,6,Tue Jul 21 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"Answered the bullpen phone, but then /u/cliffhanger1983 came in and called him a scrub."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,4,Tue Jul 21 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"Nice play, Nicky!  Edit: And, while I'm complimenting Tigers, great inning, Hardy! :D"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,4,Tue Jul 21 01:18:30 2015 UTC,I'm suspecting this w-l-w-l-w-l thing that the Mariners fans kept talking about is a real thing.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:21 2015 UTC,moot
motorcitykitties,3dzita,wiseprogressivethink,7,Tue Jul 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"""Does anyone else think we should move Verlander to the bullpen phone?"" - cliffhanger"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Novh,4,Tue Jul 21 01:07:47 2015 UTC,I wonder what JV did to him... Maybe JV fucked his mother or something.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:02 2015 UTC,And it was the best lay she's ever had. #DatJVSmile
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,7,Tue Jul 21 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"No, no, he's a scrub for answering the phone, and for playing, and for existing probably."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:34 2015 UTC,he looks good in his Lamborghini.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,DetroitBreakdown,4,Tue Jul 21 01:20:22 2015 UTC,"Simon, you piece of shit."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,GraemeTaylor,4,Tue Jul 21 01:04:32 2015 UTC,Seriously the guy has a .158 average with 100 + strikeouts and 17 walks but of course he's 2 for 2 with a walk against us. What the flying fuck.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,ttcamryrider,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:12 2015 UTC,Not sure what to say exactly without being overly snarky. At least there was no booing? But hopefully he can build upon this start.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:52 2015 UTC,He didn't get boo'd because no one expects anything out of him.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:06:43 2015 UTC,Zunino is the worst catcher in the league. How the hell do you manage to do this shit Simon?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:23 2015 UTC,Haha dude in blue just snatched the hell out of that one.  edit: Aaaand the pasta has boiled over. 93 pitches in 5 innings. Sounds like a winner to me.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,5,Tue Jul 21 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Hello, hello, baby you called, I can't hear a thing..."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,bronwynsings,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:59 2015 UTC,LETS GET IT
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Novh,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:02 2015 UTC,Aw yiss. Action Jax... oh wait. He doesn't play for us anymore. Drat. :(
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Wingnut00,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"Man, is no one watching tonight?  It's quite here."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"I'm just feeling too tired to participate today, but the game is on my teevee."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"Even with a bummed heart, go Tigers."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:08 2015 UTC,I CAN'T STOP CARING! :p
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:09 2015 UTC,Tigers got me like....  http://www.horsecollaborative.com/wp-content/uploads/I-wish-I-knew-how-to-quit-you-1.gif
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:18 2015 UTC,Watcha doin' behind that coat?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,sniffles11,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:26 2015 UTC,Feeling emotions.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,3,Tue Jul 21 02:14:23 2015 UTC,Fair enough!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:39 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with it being a Monday and the fact that the team hasn't been doing well.  :/
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:19 2015 UTC,To twist a Blue Cheer track: Ain't no cure for the summertime Monday baseball blues :(
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 01:33:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is why my dad texted me and said he wouldn't come down for the game we were planning on going to tomorrow night.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"My Pop's on the same page, man."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"You would think he would like worry for his only daughter or take pity on me, but nope.  The tigers suck too much for him right now."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:18 2015 UTC,Try bribing him with a promise of coneys from Lafayette!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,AliceCoopersLiver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"I have three games on right now: Two on MLB.TV (Tigers - M's radio, Royals - Bucs video muted), one on cable (Nats - Mets).   Agree though that our GDT is more quiet than normal tonight."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:06 2015 UTC,Are you also cheering for the buccos?    I've been checking over on the score but I am an ashamed fan with no MLB.TV
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course, they're one of my NL teams :)   A.J. just pulled a Houdini bottom of the 2nd! Royals loaded bases with two singles, HBP with no outs, and then he retired the side in order by K, Jung-ho Kang leaping catch at SS, and flyout to CF."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 00:59:24 2015 UTC,Awesome.   I have grown rather fond of the Pirates in recent years.   Thanks for the catch up!  I cheer for the pirates when they're playing anyone but the Tigers and the Mets  (Terry Collins is my mom's close friends older brother so...)  haha.   If I remember correctly are you one of the other females in this sub or was that someone else with a harry potter related name that I am thinking of? (There seem to be a lot of them!)
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"I like the Mets too :) I didn't get a chance to talk to Terry, but I was very close to someone who asked him a question during Spring Training a few years ago LOL.  Yes, I am female, and, yes, I do have a Harry Potter-related user name. :)"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"Were you in St. Lucie for spring training?  The only spring training I've seen is the Tigers in the early 90s when I was a kid.  (Growing up as a female only child and a girl was convenient cause dad took me to all the games) I still have Cecil Feilders autograph that I got from that trip! haha.   Terry is a great guy, he's from Michigan, he gave me some tickets when he was coaching in Japan and I was living over there."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"No, they were playing the Astros in Kissimmee, and won that game IIRC. I got Altuve's autograph beforehand :)  Yay, another lady Tigers fan! There's dozens of us, dozens!"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:49 2015 UTC,I haven't been able to but it doesn't look like I'm missing much.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Tue Jul 21 00:49:30 2015 UTC,True haha.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:47 2015 UTC,Alfredo pls
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well, he has been on a HR-hitting tear as of late.   I'm just glad that no one was on base at the time."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:12 2015 UTC,THUNK!  That's one way to get back at a bad call.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Wingnut00,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:11 2015 UTC,DP....  -__-
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Naturalpipes,0,Tue Jul 21 00:29:10 2015 UTC,I would love to see Sam Bernstein on a motorcycle!
motorcitykitties,3dzita,cliffhanger1983,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:02 2015 UTC,Richard would be more fun.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,fantasyfest,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:35 2015 UTC,Have you slipped or fallen?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,DetroitBreakdown,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:09 2015 UTC,Walked the 8 9 batters.... Christ Simon you fucking suck. Why we gave up Suarez for you ill be forever salty about.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Naturalpipes,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:41 2015 UTC,Why we traded for him specifically will remain a mystery to me.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:20 2015 UTC,Reds wouldnt deal anyone else..... We fucking settled. I hate to settle. Shows we were desperate.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Naturalpipes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"Throw in more people and get Latos, at least he has potential"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,TheBulgarSlayer,4,Tue Jul 21 00:35:48 2015 UTC,Simon can't throw strikes to save his life right now.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,5,Tue Jul 21 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"jesus christ, can Simon ever make this easy on himself?"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,SilentStryk09,3,Tue Jul 21 00:18:09 2015 UTC,I believe in you.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:51 2015 UTC,I thank you and your green-and-gold baseball team for your good work against the Twins this past weekend :) I liked the part where the A's kept hitting home runs off Twins pitching LOL.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"I felt bad because we don't hate the Twins (I don't think we hated them even when they were in the West), but dat scoreboard doe."
motorcitykitties,3dzita,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the Twins (must be the only Tigers fan who doesn't lol), but I lost sympathy after they beat us up before the break. Like their fanbase, team is a huge pain in the butt.  :P  Good luck to you guys on the rest of your season! I went to my first A's game at O.co earlier this month, and, despite the bad rep, liked your ballpark. Atmosphere was really lively, hopefully fans come out to support their team :)"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,accio7,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:09 2015 UTC,Could you guys imagine what would happen if we didn't get Price this last year?   edit: I made a mistake
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:16 2015 UTC,Three center fielders?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:58 2015 UTC,Would have been more aggressive with Scherzer I imagine.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Naturalpipes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, and what has Scherzer done this year?   /s"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,DetroitBreakdown,2,Tue Jul 21 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"What's up with all the line drives right into gloves? There's been what, four already? I don't think we've seen that many in the last four games lol"
motorcitykitties,3dzita,NedryOS,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:48 2015 UTC,We infused both the balls and gloves with neodymium after the last game.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Wingnut00,3,Tue Jul 21 00:11:50 2015 UTC,How are we doing with that double play record again?
motorcitykitties,3dzita,threemadness,4,Mon Jul 20 23:56:08 2015 UTC,Did McCann think there was two outs or something? That was a weird double play.
motorcitykitties,3dzita,Outofthewild,3,Mon Jul 20 23:55:23 2015 UTC,Probably thought it was shallower than it was. Definitely a misplay.

motorcitykitties,3e293r,GraemeTaylor,9,Tue Jul 21 12:00:25 2015 UTC,This move makes no sense for Cincinatti or Detroit quite honestly.
motorcitykitties,3e293r,josh1123,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe for Cincinnati as I don't know them as well, but for Detroit it makes sense: Soria is a FA and Nathan is 40 and had season ending surgery. We need a closer and a better bullpen and Chapman is one of the best out there."
motorcitykitties,3e293r,YouVersusTheSea,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:03 2015 UTC,and Chapman is one of the best out there.   famous last words
motorcitykitties,3e293r,josh1123,0,Tue Jul 21 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"Ha, really. That fastball!"
motorcitykitties,3e293r,flexfulton,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"This is Cespedes' contract year tho, and Chapman does have one more year on his contract, there's no way Cinci would want to acquire him for the rest of the year and lose the most sought after reliever at the deadline this year. Also the move doesn't really make sense from the Tigers' standpoint as well because if we're already giving up on this year I'm sure they'd want someone who has a little bit more control for their rentals, as opposed to taking a chance on how good we will be next year.  Regardless no way Cinci would want a half year or even a one and a half year rental for their best reliever ."
motorcitykitties,3e293r,wishesgrantd,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:20 2015 UTC,Why? Cinnci is in worse shape than Detroit for making the playoffs this year? Why would they make this move and then loose Cespedes at year end with no compensation pick? Chapman is still arbitration eligible and in theory should and likely will bring more back via trade than Cespedes would get.   They would have absolutely no reason to do this deal with us.  I would bet money they wouldn't even take Cespedes AND Price for Chapman.  Would make zero sense for them especially since they are trying to unload guys not pick up a few month rental for a non existent playoff run.

He always had good years though.  He later became a Republican Senator from Kentucky but the less said about that, the better.  Jay was the first Little League player to advance to the major leagues.  He was also the first ""bonus baby"" players in the major leagues.  In 1961, Jay won 21 games (the first Red to win 20 since Ewell Blackwell in 1947), tied for the league lead in wins and shutouts, as the Reds surged to their first National League pennant since 1940. However, the Reds faced a powerful New York Yankees that won 109 games and featured Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, as the Reds lost in five game. However, the lone Reds' win occurred in Game 2, a 6-2 victory as Jay threw a complete-game four-hitter at Yankee Stadium."

Of course that would still leave left field, the rest of the bullpen and an upgrade at third still needed. After that, you would have to cross your fingers that Victor can remain healthy, hope Gose doesn't regress too much and plead to the Lord that Miggy, injured 3 years in a row now, stays healthy and puts up yet another MVP type season, and finally, light a candle that Kinsler is just having an off year. But no, you're right, if you all those things happen, they may have a shot."

motorcitykitties,3dutig,SodiumThoride,-7,Sun Jul 19 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but would you sacrifice some defense for some more offense? It just drives me crazy that we have automatic outs like Krauss and Avila in the lineup just because they are our best DEFENSIVE options."
motorcitykitties,3dutig,SodiumThoride,19,Sun Jul 19 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Avila's OBP is currently the same as Davis and V-Mart (.333), and is higher than Cespedes, Gose, McCann, and Castellanos. Avila is far from an automatic out.  Look it up yourself"
motorcitykitties,3dutig,Robot_Satan,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, we have a decent bat sitting on the bench with some speed. Why not DH Davis and put Vmart at 1st? I know Ausmus said he wasn't going to put Vmart there due to risk of injury, but we need to dig deep if we are still seriously considering the postseason."

motorcitykitties,3dutig,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:02 2015 UTC,Well I'm still puzzled as to why he hasn't had more playing time. Casty has not looked the best why not switch them for games? He's had 1 fucking start.
motorcitykitties,3dutig,Naturalpipes,3,Sun Jul 19 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"Castellanos has been hot as hell since Marte came up.  No reason to play him over Casty, who hasn't needed a day off because of the AS break.  Ausmus has decided to play Avila/Krauss more at first because of their defense/experience which makes sense because our issue of late has been limiting runs, not scoring them."
motorcitykitties,3dutig,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"Our issue of late is starting pitching and bullpen it has been since the implosion of Greene. His (Casty) defense is atrocious. I'm only saying since we clearly haven't been winning, why not try something new? Like switching between Rajai and Anthony? It was a good tactic used by Ausmus in the beginning of the season. When we were Hot. It's always nice to see what new can bring you and if it fails switch it back. It's as simple as that."
motorcitykitties,3dutig,Naturalpipes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"Because trying something new for the sake of being new doesn't make sense.  Castellanos has been a below average 3B this year (not nearly as bad as last year), and Marte doesn't grade out as a significantly better fielder, and a significantly worse bat. As far as Gose/Davis goes, Davis is not a good CF.  We keep Gose there because he is a much, much better defender, and it helps that he has had a hot bat.  Putting in worse players for the sake of change doesn't exactly sound like something that will help us win"
motorcitykitties,3dutig,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ha its not just for something new it's to see if something sparks how blatant of you to presume I meant just for the sake of something new. If Marte sparks which he has a very good chance of, ( via scouting reports). Why not give it a shot instead of dig a bigger hole. Jesus how hard is it to try it for one fucking game. As for the Davis being bad in Center. That's a shit statement he's had some incredible plays for us in the past. Now before you say something blatant I understand why Gose is there he's  young a better defender by a large margin but that doesn't make Davis bad in any way. You give players chances and see how they play on the chances we give them if they perform well switch them out regularly. It's better than shutting one completely off and never giving them a chance. Marte deserves some fucking playing time and if you disagree with that you're an idiot."

motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Telodzrum,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:42 2015 UTC,I literally laughed out loud at this...loudly
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Mattrix013,11,Sun Jul 19 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Don't blame Ausmus for this. 25 times now this season teams have scored 7 or more runs against the Tigers. 6 or more 31 times, 5 or more 42 times, 4 or more 55 times. What's Ausmus supposed to do when no one on the pitching staff can get an out?  The offense is fine (3rd or higher in the league in most categories). Defense is fine (Top 10 in fielding percentage and fewest errors). Pitching is 27th, dead last if you exclude Price and Wilson I believe.  Ausmus is in a catch-22 with the pitchers. Can't leave the starter in cause he's sucking, can't take him out because the bullpen is shit.  Jeff Jones needs to go. Every pitcher we get seems to regress under him. I fully believe he is a major issue right now.  When opposing teams are scoring 7 or more runs over a 4th of the time and 4 or more runs over half the time against us it's a miracle that we're only a game under .500. Ausmus is doing a fine job with an unbelievably shitty situation with the pitching staff."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,6,Mon Jul 20 03:18:43 2015 UTC,How we doing guys?  Same as always  That bad huh?

motorcitykitties,3dvdub,appzb,3,Sun Jul 19 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"Well, we all knew this was coming eventually...I just hope the team makes smart decisions and not desperate ones."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,SoCalWingFan,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:00 2015 UTC,Is it time to move on from Ausmus?
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,ShotRodner,7,Mon Jul 20 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's time to move on from Ausmus. It's absolutely time to move on from Jeff Jones and our Bullpen coach. When the pitching is this bad what is a manager supposed to do? It's a catch-22. Can't take the starter out because the bullpen sucks but can't leave the starter in because he's sucking.   I mentioned this in another thread. The Tigers have had 7 or more runs scored on them 25 times now this season. That's over a fourth of their games.  We have one of the best offenses in the league right now. 3rd in runs scored, 2nd in OPS, 1st in OBP, 1st in hits, 3rd in RBIs. But when the pitching staff as a whole is 27th in the league (I believe we're last if we exclude Price and Wilson) what exactly is Ausmus supposed to do here?  Honestly...looking at the fact that we're just one game under .500 when we have had a 4th of our games at 7 or more runs against us is a miracle. (55 games of 4 or more runs against by the way. Over half). I think Ausmus is doing a hell of a job for the pitching staff he's been given. I also think Jeff Jones has done a consistently terrible job with the pitchers he's been given. Why is it that every pitcher we get seems to regress under him? At first it just seemed coincidental but it's almost epidemic now.  TL;DR: Ausmus is fine. Jeff Jones/Pitching coaches need to go NOW."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"Jeff Jones has been the one consistent with our pitching problems (fielding in 2006 anyone?  Ricky's slow development? Young bullpen guys seemingly getting worse?).  I don't know of a replacement for him though, and that's the only issue.  Also brings up the question of WHO WOULD REPLACE AUSMUS???  How many ML ready (in your eyes) managers are out there?  Brad needs to be able to grow with the team.  Look at how Yost did with the Brewers when they had a shit sandwich for a team, and look at him now.  People want to blame the manager because they cannot fathom blaming their infallible players."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,tellymundo,5,Mon Jul 20 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know how Jeff Jones has kept his job for this long. The pitchers that have pitched well for us have done so simply because they're highly skilled or have had other pitching coaches coach them. Verlander is really the lone pitcher that Jeff Jones developed and as soon as he fell off a bit Jones has had no idea how to fix it.  The bullpen - Every time we get a new pitcher that pitched well before gets worse here. At first I thought it was kind of a coincidence but it has become an epidemic. Joe Nathan was never as bad as he is now. Soria has regressed. Al-Al was AWESOME his first season and has gone downhill quickly. Fernando Rodney was great, then started to suck, and then was immediately better when he went to Tampa. Valverde was awesome and then blew up.  The starters - As I said Verlander is really the lone pitchers Jones developed. Porcello took an incredibly long time to develop and now look at him in Boston. Smyly was looking solid but still seemed to be progressing slowly. Price is his own animal, Jones won't ruin that. Scherzer, Fister, and Sanchez all had their own game figured out before coming to Detroit as well.   People want to blame the manager because they cannot fathom blaming their infallible players.   I really don't want to blame the players. Consider how good our offense and relatively solid our defense is there is no good reason that we should be 45-46. The thing that has consistently derailed our seasons since 2006 is our pitching and, as you said, Jones has been the one constant there.  I think Ausmus is doing a great job for what he's been given in the pitching staff. Jeff Jones needs to go."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"We may not agree on choice of college football programs to root for, but you speak exactly how I feel about the Detroit Tigers.  I love this team to death, I have seen more losses in a row than a human should have to suffer (between 2003 and 2004 I attended 11 games and all were losses before I saw a win).  This team needs a shakeup, and not at the managerial level.  That will just spiral us into becoming the mediocrity that was the Cubs for so long, or Pittsburgh, or any other team that kept changing managers.  Keeping someone around and letting them build (DD still leads all personnel decisions, although I assume Ausmus has had some hand in our focus on speed).  #JonesOut"
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,tellymundo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:37 2015 UTC,Damn right.  #JonesOut
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,6,Mon Jul 20 14:14:47 2015 UTC,How do you people expect new managers to get good if you fire them in their second year?  Where he won the division in his first year?  Give him a break.  Trying to pin a the problems on him isn't fair.
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Nfrizzle,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"Let me start out by just saying I don't blame all the problems on him, but from the get go I don't think he was the best choice to take over this team, especially beginning last year. This team is very heavily invested in win now mode, last year more so with Scherzer still with us. Hiring a guy who has to learn as he goes was a terrible decision, this team isn't setup for Ausmus to learn on the fly, we needed someone who could come in and win now, and Ausmus wasn't the best choice IMO."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,josh1123,2,Mon Jul 20 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that Ausmus wasn't the best choice last year. But, as we are entering a rebuild, think he's earned the stay to see how well he handles it."

motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Mon Jul 20 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"I called for that all of last year when guys who seemed like they should at least be decent in the pen were terrible, and it seemed like all anybody wanted to do was deflect the blame from him."
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,SilentStryk09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:13 2015 UTC,People like to blame the manager or the players. No one in between. Our offense would go cold in the playoffs or for very long stretches during the seasons under Leyland and it was Leyland's fault or the players fault. No one blamed McClendon.  Our pitchers have consistently regressed or progressed incredibly slowly (Porcello) under Jones' tutelage since 2006 he absolutely deserves a LOT of blame.
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"The one i saw more often was everybody trying to deflect onto the bullpen coach, like there's a coaching wall between the starters and bullpen.   edit: also for the record, he's only been our pitching coach since 2011.  He was BP coach 2007-11"
motorcitykitties,3dvdub,SilentStryk09,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:01 2015 UTC,I forgot he was just our bullpen coach from 2007-11. I think that actually proves it even more...

motorcitykitties,3du42y,Squabstermobster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"Which is fair, but we are acting like he is the only problem.   Honestly outside of Price, and sometimes Sanchez, our pitching sucks.  Hell, last night we couldn't even get the bats up against a pitcher with a 5.40 ERA.  There is very clearly something missing, and yes, JV is a mess too.  But there is a lot of big problems and it feels like a lot of Tigers fans just want to rag on JV for everything, probably because of how long he's been here, how great he was.  But it totally not the dude's fault how bad we are, hell hasn't he only started like 6 games?"
motorcitykitties,3du42y,threemadness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"His problem is that when he chokes he chokes hard. He's still a good pitcher, just needs to learn how to save the game from himself when he starts making mistakes."
motorcitykitties,3du42y,grandmoffcory,3,Sun Jul 19 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"He hasn't changed his approach to pitching. He still likes to ramp up, but it's only a 97 MPH mediocre fastball. He needs to realize that he can't overpower batters when he's stuck in a jam.   Rondon is having the same issue. In AAA, he could blow a 101 mph fastball against the batters. In the MLB, batters are used to hitting balls coming in at that speed.   If Verlander wants to get better, he needs to rely on his breaking stuff and he needs to put more effort into control rather than velocity."
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Rbaner,3,Sun Jul 19 19:00:50 2015 UTC,We have so much money invested in Verlander. What are we going to do with him? He isn't capable of winning anymore.
motorcitykitties,3du42y,cliffhanger1983,3,Sun Jul 19 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"You're being down voted for no reason I mean the evidence is right in front of us. The fact is he hasn't performed well except for ONE fucking start and we blew that game. He's well over paid  and hasn't even looked like an average mlb starter out there. That's a FACT. Fuck, this sub holds on for way too long. We're stuck with him."
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Naturalpipes,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:57 2015 UTC,/u/cliffhanger1983 makes posts like this every time JV starts and everyone is annoyed by it at this point.
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Rbaner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"Verlander was not nearly as bad as people make out last year (3 fWAR while missing a lot of his off season due to core muscle surgery which is notorious for taking a long time to recover from), and had made 6 starts this year while coming off of injury to his throwing arm.  Give him time  Also cliffhanger is a well known troll/moron"
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:50 2015 UTC,He's even stated the reason he had such a long time with that core injury was shitty prep in the offseason before hand. He's a premadonna and hasn't performed to his mark of the bill we pay him. When he loses his confidence we lose the game and that's what we've seen.
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Naturalpipes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"The shitty prep from the offseason was because of the surgery (i.e. you can't exactly follow your workout regimen when you have just had major surgery).  He hasn't performed well this season but last season he was fine (not worth the money but still an above-average starter), and he is coming off of an injury to his throwing arm.  You need more than 6 starts to judge him."
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"I only judge him on how he loses his confidence he loses his ability to command the mound. That's a huge weakness of his and I've always judged him for it. He can perform I know this we've all seen it with the Twins start, but the way he just loses himself is next to pathetic. It's not the recovery of his injuries I'm worried about. I'm worried about his mental stability."

motorcitykitties,3du42y,Robot_Satan,2,Sun Jul 19 19:06:03 2015 UTC,2013 he didn't suck. He just wasn't as good as he was the previous two years.  He's signed through 2019.

motorcitykitties,3du42y,TheBulgarSlayer,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:10 2015 UTC,If he had a terrible angle then why the fuck would he  challenge it.
motorcitykitties,3du42y,Robot_Satan,4,Sun Jul 19 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Because he has people who look at the video.  That's not his job.   If they tell him Krauss is safe and he should challenge, then he challenges"
motorcitykitties,3du42y,honar,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:54 2015 UTC,Because the people looking at the actual video replay told him to. That's the point.

motorcitykitties,3due4z,purpleclouds,10,Sun Jul 19 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"This is a good question.   IMO, once you consider our bullpen, it has to be the weak starting rotation.

motorcitykitties,3due4z,tellymundo,8,Sun Jul 19 19:12:43 2015 UTC,It's the pitching staff. Hands down. And when I say pitching staff I mean bullpen and starters.
motorcitykitties,3due4z,ZombieHitchens2012,5,Sun Jul 19 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"Pitching, no doubt about it."
motorcitykitties,3due4z,1Aldo1Raine1,5,Sun Jul 19 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say pitching. We had such a great pitching staff the past few years, and now it's a shadow of its former self"
motorcitykitties,3due4z,kyle1913,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"It's pitching, and it's an organizational issue more than a performance issue. Name a great starting pitcher the Tigers developed over the last 10 years. Verlander (for 4-5 years), and maybe Smyly? but who after that? Scherzer, Fister, Price, Sanchez, etc. were all great or starting to become great when we got them.  Think of all the guys who could have been great if our pitching development was even half of what the Cardinals seem to be capable of: Bonderman, Maroth, Sleeth, Jurrjens, Porcello, Turner, Oliver, Casey Crosby, Robbie Ray, Greene, etc. (probably too soon to add Farmer or Ryan to this list, but may not be far off).  But seriously, for those of you who have been fans of this team since the early 2000s, how much hype have we had around big time pitching prospects?? and Verlander was the only one who really panned out. It's a total organizational struggle when it comes to drafting and developing pitching, and I know it can be a crap shoot. It just seems like we are getting lapped by the historically great organizations when it comes to developing middle-of-the-rotation and quality bullpen arms."
motorcitykitties,3due4z,dbenoos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:31 2015 UTC,Fister isn't doing so hot this year but at the same time I wouldn't mind if the tiger tried to pick him up this off season. Though you're right out side of Verlander our development isn't that good which I think is one of the factors in how shitty the bull pen always turns out and might even be part of why Verlander is struggling.   We seem to be okay at helping to develop very good pitchers into great pitchers but if they stumble or struggle we don't seem to be able to rebuild them at all. I still wish we replaced most of the pitching staff or at least anyone who works with the bull pen after last year...
motorcitykitties,3due4z,sollord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:18:30 2015 UTC,You're definitely right but to be fair the past few years the tigers just trade away prospects like its nobody's business. I'd also say they definitely helped develop Scherzer he struck a lot of guys out but certainly was a way better pitcher when he left compared to when he came. Porcello also had a great year last year and there's no reason to think if he didn't get dealt he'd continue that into this season. Idk what the problem with the Red Sox are.
motorcitykitties,3due4z,arenyk,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:50 2015 UTC,I think the biggest weakness is not being able to put it all together in one game. Either we are hitting without being able to pitch or pitching without being able to hit. I feel like it's been that way for years
motorcitykitties,3due4z,fropek,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:57 2015 UTC,At least since 2010. Brad needs some of the Fairie dust Jim used to use on the squad.
motorcitykitties,3due4z,tellymundo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"I saw a stat on this sub recently that claimed the Tigers have had one of (if not the) best offense in the last month. JD has been blazing, Victor and Yo have played well Casty got hot as well. Yes it's inconsistent but if the pitching (aside from Price of course) weren't so shitty the Tigers definitely would be way closer to the Royals than 10 games behind. Im talking about the pitching in general btw. Some nights the starters can't get it done by the bullpen doesn't make it worse and sometimes the starter keeps the team in the game but the bullpen ruins it, not fun to watch at all."

motorcitykitties,3dsfc9,ArchAngelN7,2,Sun Jul 19 12:55:24 2015 UTC,"The blackout rules are insane. Period. They should just come up with a profit sharing method so that whatever stream you watch, that broadcast entity that owns the rights get a percentage. Kinda like how Spotify or Netflix does it.... Either that or FSD needs to start streaming.... No reason they can't validate that you have a subscription based on your cable account login...... Just like all the other streaming services. I truly do not understand the feet dragging that goes on with that technology.... Especially for something like sports where most people will watch it love so you have add revenues as well as the streaming revenues."

While this is slightly frustrating, you can install the hola extension for chrome to get around location tracking. I have heard people on reddit say it is a slight security risk, so you may want to read into it more if you're worried about that kind of thing. But for me it's the best free VPN service (and best way to watch blacked out games).. there are other, more secure VPNs out there on the web for a small fee. Psyche, JK.. don't do this it's a major security risk. Just pay a small fee for a safe VPN.  I also heard recently that MLB is looking into doing away with blackouts altogether, but that's a big contractual thing they'll need to workout with a number of TV providers. Maybe a few years away.  At this point the best bet is probably MASN and TWC working out their legal battle, but it seems like we may still be blacked out of Orioles/Nats games for a little while.  EDIT: TIL why you shouldn't use Hola."
motorcitykitties,3dsfc9,cole1114,7,Sun Jul 19 03:45:43 2015 UTC,Hola is more than a slight security risk.  Installing it is a bad idea.  There are inexpensive pay services that will bypass blackouts and you don't have to do much googling to find them.

motorcitykitties,3drz1h,adb2009,12,Sat Jul 18 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be extended.. there's no reason to believe Ilitch is unhappy with his performance (who would be with 4 straight division titles and 2 WS appearances). They may wait until the end of the season though, mostly to let DD focus on GM duties during the stretch run."
motorcitykitties,3drz1h,dbenoos,2,Sat Jul 18 22:13:08 2015 UTC,Billy Simonson of the Huge show says that he has a source that says the Ilitch family is extremely irate with how this team has struggled this year and considering all the money they have put in with no pay off. Take that for what you will they may get rid of everyone if this team keeps struggling.
motorcitykitties,3drz1h,meStrangerDanger,9,Sat Jul 18 23:09:47 2015 UTC,Lol HUGE is a moron who's still bent that Leyland wouldn't do his show. I doubt he knows anything.

motorcitykitties,3drz1h,TheSalsaShark,4,Sun Jul 19 05:44:09 2015 UTC,You forgot Ryan Raburn. No way a Leyland team doesn't have Ryan Raburn.
motorcitykitties,3drz1h,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Mon Jul 20 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"You've got me there. Maybe start Raburn, and use DKB as the bench coach? Inge could coach third base, too."
motorcitykitties,3drz1h,TheSalsaShark,6,Mon Jul 20 04:16:17 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be gone after this season and I think if Mike still has a say in who gets hired (as opposed to Christopher, who is pretty much running the show now), Al Avila will be next up.      He has a ton of ties to the Latin America hotbeds. His father, Ralph, is basically responsible for bringing Dominican Republic players to the MLB, so Al's connections and experience to that region are quite valuable. Just imagine what the MLB would look like today without guys like Abreyu, Albuquerque, Aybar, Bautista, Beltre, Melky, Cano, Castro, Colon, Cruz, Encarnacion, Feliz, Peralta, Pujols, Ramirez, Ortiz, Taveras, Uribe, etc. Al Avila's father was one of the first scouts to set up a baseball camp there when he started scouting for the Dodgers... but he's originally from Cuba, which is where people are speculating the ""next DR"" is.      Granted, that's all Al Avila's father, but it seems like Al learned quite a bit from him and has formed solid relationships with local clubs in those regions, just from name and exposure. After all, he was the scouting director for Florida when they decided to sign that Miguel Cabrera guy. He also started going hard after Cespedes in like, 2011. Apparently, they almost signed him to his entry level deal but then V-Mart got hurt and they were concerned that a rookie would need some time to get used to the big leagues so they re-tooled and signed Fielder. Without a doubt, the Porcello-Cespedes trade had to have been an idea from Avila's mind.       Everybody knows he's groomed to be a GM. He's been interviewed for the GM position in the past by several clubs -- Mariners, Reds, Orioles, Diamondbacks. The Mets wanted to interview him in 2010 (his contract with the Tigers was up in 2011) and Ilitch would not grant them permission to talk to Avila... Much like how he refused to let other teams interview Jeff Blashill two seasons ago. He evidently gave him a nice chunk of change to keep him in Detroit, even if only an assistant, in 2011. He was linked to talks re: the Diamondbacks and Padres last year, and if Ilitch doesn't want to lose him, he will have to be the choice if Dombrowski goes. Otherwise, he's going to end up in Anaheim and win them a World Series."

motorcitykitties,3drz1h,DeuceWallaces,3,Sun Jul 19 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DD has been pretty good throughout his entire contract. I dont think he is going anywhere. This team underperforming isnt solely on him."

motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Sat Jul 18 00:50:18 2015 UTC,Very true. Unemployment isnt quite as great as employment from what I hear.
motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,purpleclouds,2,Sat Jul 18 00:52:17 2015 UTC,I can vouch for that.  Employment is MUCH better.

motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,CyReN_,3,Sat Jul 18 01:01:18 2015 UTC,I'm torn between an Iggy or a JD shirt. Apparently they know this and are really putting on a show for my attention.

motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,TheRealBigMula,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:41:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. Unfortunately not all fan bases are quite like that. I think it was one of the guys from the reds sub who came over and was saying how he never goes over to the twins sub because theyre pretty mean to the other teams fans.
motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,purpleclouds,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:48:12 2015 UTC,Really? Not a fan base I would expect to hear that about.

motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,purpleclouds,2,Sat Jul 18 00:59:24 2015 UTC,While it's still a little sticky out it's a really nice night for a game.   Winning helps make it a good night too!
motorcitykitties,3dnvj3,mmccullen,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:36 2015 UTC,Can you imagine if Iggy and Manny were both on the same team? I'm not sure if anything would get through the infield. Really cool to see them both in the All-Star game at the same time.

It starts and ends with the individual players performing to their capabilities. The fans have exactly nothing to do with it.   If the Tigers fortunes swung on the optimism of the fanbase at the All-Star break, 2011 and 2012 would have been fucking disasters."

motorcitykitties,3dmwps,Kwolek2005,14,Mon Jul 20 18:13:39 2015 UTC,What I don't think people realize is that being 3 1/2 games out in the wildcard is much different than being 3 1/2 games out of the division. You have to jump more teams and you don't get to play them as often as division opponents so you have no control over their record. People keep saying we are only X games back of the wildcard first off that number seems to me to just be getting bigger second what happens if we do get a wildcard we aren't winning the thing. Just my two cents or three.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,RyanFuller003,10,Fri Jul 17 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"I might have read it wrong, but if we get the wildcard we absolutely have a chance to win it. It's baseball. Weird things happen. And it's not like the team sucks."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,Dwychwder,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"In 21 years since the wildcard became a thing, a wildcard has won the World Series six times.  That's not bad, all things considered."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,meStrangerDanger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"We have to jump two teams to win the division, one to win the wild card."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,SilentStryk09,2,Sat Jul 18 10:07:06 2015 UTC,You are 100% correct but we do have 3 teams within a game back of us our spot definitely is not secure.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,meStrangerDanger,0,Sat Jul 18 15:26:11 2015 UTC,did you watch the world series last year?
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,SilentStryk09,0,Fri Jul 17 21:29:15 2015 UTC,Yeah each of those teams had fantastic pitching
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,fantasyfest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and royals had an ATROCIOUS offense all season."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,plerberderr,3,Fri Jul 17 23:10:24 2015 UTC,We don't need loyalty and stick to it anything. the Tigers will succeed without the fair weather fans.  They can watch Honey boo bo or the Duck callers.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,lospolloshermanos,3,Sat Jul 18 01:21:16 2015 UTC,We were actually in 3rd place at the all star break in 2012 (I made a post about it last week). We ended up winning the AL pennant that year. I'm not giving up. I want 5 AL Central titles in a row. Eat em up Tigers!
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,DikFistinHotPockets,10,Sat Jul 18 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the pieces are not there for this team to be a serious contender.  Our window for a World Series closed when Max walked.  I would argue it closed when we traded Fister but neither here nor there.  Our bottom half of the rotation is complete garbage.  Sanchez has been inconsistent for the first half and are we really going to expect JV to return to his MVP self in the second half?  I could see him going .500 the rest of the way.    Our lineup is halfway decent.  However, we would need Miggy to return and be himself immediately for us to have any chance at a playoff spot.  We're getting on base, hence the amount of double plays, but those need to be converted to runs, obviously.    Now the real question to the fanbase is are we cool with getting knocked out in the first round of the playoffs cause our rotation outside of DP and the bullpen are garbage?  Or do we start planning for the future and try to get some building pieces for DP and Yoenis.  We've been buyers for almost a decade.  It was a great run.  We got to two World Series, and won one game.  It's time to sell."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,CookedPeaches,3,Fri Jul 17 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I feel like the ""level headed"" response to what we've seen from this team is to sell off all of our most valuable assets at the trading deadline, and go for a rebuild that will take at least a year, maybe two. Unfortunately, Mr. I might not have much time left for rebuilds, and may not want to do what's in the best interest of the future of the team, because for him, the future is a single day at a time.  Even if everything goes our way. Even if MVP Verlander comes back for the 2nd half, and triple crown Miggy shows up, I still don't think we've got what it takes to win. Our starting rotation is just horrible outside of Price, and our bullpen is still paper thin.   We can definitely make the playoffs, but we wont make it very far with the current team, and are we seriously going to mortgage even more of our future at the trade deadline? Next year we could be one of, if not the, worst team in the division. That's not hyperbole. Imagine this team, sans Price, Yoenis, and Davis, with all of our vets a year older. The future is not looking good."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,-9,Fri Jul 17 20:35:14 2015 UTC,I couldn't disagree more.  http://i.imgur.com/pdZFiYm.gifv
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,RyanFuller003,3,Fri Jul 17 18:58:34 2015 UTC,You're wrong.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,RyanFuller003,0,Fri Jul 17 21:49:26 2015 UTC,Matter of opinion.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,c_bra,2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:03 2015 UTC,I think it's just because we've been so consistently good for so long that we aren't used to being so mediocre. Probably people think we might have missed our window too
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,kander77,2,Fri Jul 17 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"Bottom line is that they're going to have to win at least 88 games to make a wildcard bid, more likely 90.  We have 74 games left and would need to win 46 to get up to 90 wins--which is .622, a freaking 101-win pace.  Probably not happening.  Not impossible, but very unlikely.  Just being realistic about things is all."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,WAAAAAAAAAALT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:28 2015 UTC,How did you possibly come to that conclusion?
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,cliffhanger1983,4,Fri Jul 17 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"Which one?  The 88 games is just based on looking back over the last few years at the records of teams that have earned wildcard bids, and 88 was the minimum with most teams reaching at least 90, so that's why I went with that.  So unless the division leaders just beat up on the rest of baseball and the wildcard contendsers wind up doing significantly more poorly than they have in recent years, 90 is kind of the magic number.  The rest is just math.  88 games played means 74 to go, we need 46 wins to get to 90, (46/76) = .622, .622 * 162 = ~101."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,CanoeIt,3,Fri Jul 17 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your optimism but I'm just not seeing it. Barring the great 2 weeks start to this season, this team has been under .500. The hot start was partly fueled by strong starting pitching by Greene and Simon. It's pretty hard for me to anticipate those guys getting back on track with how they they have played lately. So unless I am supposed to just go by blind faith, there isn't really many signs that point in this team trending in the right direction."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,FakeyFaked,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"Rough patch? You take out the 11-2 start and they are 33-42. That's a 44% win percentage, bested by only Miami (42.7%) Philly (31.9%) and Milwaukee (42.2%).   How don't get me wrong, I love my Tigers too, but we probably just don't have the pieces this year to make it happen. Way too many injuries and sub par players. Almost the entire starting rotation is a joke, and the bullpen is a nightmare still. Has been for years."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,Kwolek2005,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"""If you take out all those games they won, they'll have a bad record.""  Duh. Remove eleven wins from almost any team in the majors and they'll have a losing record. I could use the same logic and say if we didn't have that eight game losing streak, we'd be leading the division."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,CanoeIt,-5,Sat Jul 18 02:11:36 2015 UTC,The year has been a disaster we need to sell. Stop the bleeding
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,sollord,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"I will just reply to cliffhanger since there are a few people all jumping in at the same time. The people downvoting this comment and telling /u/cliffhanger1983 to go post elsewhere and stop being so negative.... keep in mind this isn't /r/circlejerk  people are going to have different opinions. I personally think we need to sell before the deadline as well. I'm not saying a Wild card run is out of the question, I am saying that our farm system is so depleted that this is the best time to try asd bolster it. We have been a threat to win the World Series for 10 straight years. That is insane. Now is a great time to sell off some pieces that aren't in the pans for the next few years and get some young talent. We can go right back to competing for a title next year like we didn't miss a beat. This team is not performing the way a championship team does. That is why you have some people saying ""Hey let's good some young talent""  More important than everything else I have posted, everyone relax a bit. This a a Tigers sub, and I love it. We have optimists, pessimists, fair weather fans, and die hards. If all we do is agree with each other, what is the point of this place besides high fiving each other? Discussion is a good thing, and sometimes the jumping off point for discussion is quite blunt. Let's not tell people to ""find another community."" jeez."

motorcitykitties,3dmwps,MShasta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:17 2015 UTC,Teams that sell rarely go back to being a good team immediately. When you say sell you're basically are saying you're ok with big bad for 3 to 5 years cause you think 4 games is too big a mountain to climb.   How long were the royals rebuilding? Or the Twins? Or indians?  They have been trying to reach where we've been for 5 years or more each. People don't realize what they're asking for when they say sell. They're the same people that will complain about how garbage the team is and how we have no talent anymore if we do it.
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,WAAAAAAAAAALT,2,Fri Jul 17 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with your premise, i just think there is a slight difference in what we mean by sell. I do NOT mean a fire sale, get rid of anyone with any value. Like I said I just think that Dave always has a 5 year plan (along with a 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 year plan).  If he doesn't foresee someone being with us next year or the year after that, why not try to move them now? I don;t want everyone gone, but I am sure we have some pieces & parts that we could do without.  End of the day, in Dave we trust. If he says now is not the time to sell, now is not the time to sell."
motorcitykitties,3dmwps,FakeyFaked,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:10 2015 UTC,I doubt Dave has any say in it now if we sell or not its all up to the owners now and if they have any hopes for a ring before he dies

motorcitykitties,3dmg2k,TyPiper93,9,Fri Jul 17 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Both World Series teams last year were wild card teams. It doesn't matter how you get to the playoffs. It matters how hot you are once you're there. Obviously I would rather win the division, but I would much rather we make a push for a wild card spot than write the season off."
motorcitykitties,3dmg2k,honar,5,Fri Jul 17 15:03:32 2015 UTC,Thank you. Your optimism is what I look for as opposed to the hate I see too much on any social media outlet. Even Reddit... :/
motorcitykitties,3dmg2k,Outofthewild,5,Fri Jul 17 15:07:11 2015 UTC,I was honestly thinking of this exact scenario yesterday. Maybe having a wild card spot will ignite some fire under our ass. Winning the division so many years in a row clearly hasn't done us any favors in the postseason.   I'm still really nervous about Greene and Simon though. If those guys can't get it together we stand no chance in the post season.
motorcitykitties,3dmg2k,FakeyFaked,5,Fri Jul 17 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, there's always something to be apprehensive about - I was just getting pretty irritated by the hate I've seen on this sub lately."
motorcitykitties,3dmg2k,meStrangerDanger,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:05 2015 UTC,You'll only need to be nervous about one of them.  Almighty DD will get us a starter.  And Simon will go to the pen and be a beast.

motorcitykitties,3dhymk,RyanFuller003,13,Thu Jul 16 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"not op, but my guess may be that the Red Wings <3 Swedish players and he picked up other Detroit teams along with them."
motorcitykitties,3dhymk,woopwopper,6,Thu Jul 16 19:33:03 2015 UTC,Certainly doesn't hurt when the best non-North American hockey player ever to lace 'em up happened to be Swedish and happened to play for the Red Wings for over 20 years.  And also five of the players on the 2006 Olympic team that won the Gold Medal.

So I started to watch them a bit more and little by little I turned into a Tigers fan :)   It's a bit hard to follow the weekday games since they're played in the middle of the night here but I still keep myself updated as much as I can.

Currently live in Colorado. I hired one of the guys on my team cause he said Go Blue, and is ballsy enough to wear a Wings jersey in Avalanche country. Couple of us actually pitch in for MLB.tv to watch the Tigers, disappointing when they have a series with the Rockies and they don't play Coors field! Denver natives only like the Broncos and that's about it, true story. The only reason Coors has the attendance that it has, is due to all the fucking transplants that come here and have NL teams that play here. If I could find a decent IT job in michigan that paid over 90k I'd go back no questions asked."
motorcitykitties,3dhymk,AnonusUtilis,5,Thu Jul 16 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. Except when they attain some period of national relevance (like the Nuggets did when Melo was playing for them and of course when the Avs were a Cup-caliber team), Denver doesn't care about the non-Broncos pro teams."

Born and raised in the Detroit suburbs.  Lucky for me, Orlando has no real sports fan base whatsoever. Most people that live here aren't from here. You get a wide range of fans , including some Detroit people I meet up with for Tigers/Lions/Wings/Pistons games.  Unlucky for me I would say that the most dominant fan bases in orlando are Yankees, Red Sox, and Pittsburgh Steelers. Talk about a group of loud, obnoxious, self involved a-holes. I'm sure that there are some good ones, but they're too quiet to be noticed. Steelers fans make me want to claw my own face off when in public. They do things like demand that EVERY TV at a sports bar on NFL Sunday be turned to their steelers game, and bitch incessantly when the bar rightfully refuses. they seriously will start loud ass ""let's go steelers"" chants in a bar to protest the bars logical solution. wtf Pittsburgh?"

I get back and catch a lot of games since my mother contracts to a lot of law offices and she has the hook up on free seats (direct flight from DSM to DTW helps). Love my Tigers and I rarely miss a game.

My mom is from Detroit and growing up I would go there a lot to visit all my family living there (specifically my Grandma who has now since passed away). Whenever I would go in the summer I would always go to Tigers games, it was like a family tradition to get everyone out there together. so because of this I was always kind of a Tigers fan. Yet I also liked the A's a lot since they were my home town team. In 2006 when the A's and Tigers played in the ALCS I was rooting for the A's and my mom was rooting for the Tigers. (She got pretty pissed at me btw.) So basically after they got swept and Magglio's walk off I found myself leaning more towards the Tigers. The magic of the moment really got me.

I grew up in Columbus until I was about 10 or 11, and I moved to.. Kansas City.  My sports loyalties are ridiculous. Tigers, Buckeyes, New Orleans Saints, Blue Jackets, Cavs. Fortunately my dad is a huge baseball fan. I was named after Ty Cobb and grew up hearing all the stories about the 68 Tigers. I'd trade championships by all of my other sports teams for a Tigers trophy in my lifetime, especially if my dad is still alive to see it.  To make it all a little more strange, I now live in Denmark. I never get any recognition of the Tigers items I wear all over the place. Weirdly, I have seen a number of maize and blue Michigan hats in strange places, but never when I could say something to them. One day it will happen while I'm wearing my Buckeyes hat and I'll get the most unlikely picture of my life.  I'll add that I do have a very strong connection to the Lions and Pistons and Red Wings and I root for them when they aren't in the way of my other teams. I just never connected with them the way I have with the Tigers."

motorcitykitties,3di68w,vingt_et_un,4,Thu Jul 16 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the advanced stats much so maybe someone can enlighten me on these quotes:  ""Yoenis Cespedes ranks as the 4th best defender and J.D. Martinez ranks as the 7th best in all of baseball in the unweighted statistic UZR.  Another statistic, DEF, includes an adjustment for the fact that some positions are more difficult to play. In terms of the best defender by position in the American League, the Tigers have the best 2B, best LF, best RF and 5th best SS.""  By all accounts I didn't think JD was that great defensively? How does that work? And Iglesias is only the 5th-rated SS? That is surprising to me."
motorcitykitties,3di68w,tonavin,2,Fri Jul 17 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"Let's start with some quick definitions, as well as these 4 players and their (rankings compared to the rest of the ~750 active MLB players):   UZR: Ultimate Zone Rating, how well a player is at capitalizing on opportunities he's presented with. ""Easy"" positions like RF, LF, 1B generally do well in this rating because they're presented with more forgiving plays. The Tigers rank: Cespedes (4), JD (7), Kinsler (31) and Iglesias (44). Iglesias ranks relatively low in this because he misses many plays as a short stop; It's easy to miss some plays in that position.   DEF: Defense, an adjusted measure of UZR, accounts for how difficult a position is; more difficult positions are forgiven for missing more opportunities. The Tigers Rank almost the exact opposite: Iglesias (24), Kinsler (30), Cespedes (31) and JD (47)   We noticed two incredible numbers in these: JD and Cespedes are league leading in UZR, but that's in a pretty forgiving statistic because of the position they play.   It's more impressive, in our mind, to say that Kinsler leads the league at his position than it is to say he is 30th among all fielders.   Unfortunately for Iglesias, he plays a position which is the most difficult in the game. He's a great athlete, but so are the other short stops in the league. It's unfortunate he ins't ranked higher, but the competition is fierce."

And before people bring up the Royals, the Royals of last year (aside form being a better team) didn't have the combination of your only reliable starter and 3rd best bat being free agents likely to leave at season's end, and absolutely nothing to replace them in the pipeline.   Going all in for a 1 game Wild Card which likely means facing those dangerous Houston bats in Minute Maid Park should not be a goal."

motorcitykitties,3di68w,MaizeRage48,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"Well they probably were thinking ""Holy crap we might actually make it to the playoffs this year"" which considering they hadn't made it to the postseason since the 80s was a big accomplishment. It probably wasn't until they actually clinched the playoffs that anyone there started thinking about the world series. Similarly, before the 2006 Team of Destiny, the Tigers hadn't made the playoffs since the 80's either. In 2003 the Tigers were two losses away from being the worst team in history. The ""World Series or bust"" mantra didn't start until after 2006. It's all about perspective, the Tigers have won their division the last 4 years, some fanbases would kill for that.   That being said I highly doubt the Tigers will make it to the World Series this year, let alone win."

motorcitykitties,3die9r,bastard_of_young,5,Thu Jul 16 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"Tigers are sitting right at .500 at the break. There are a lot of games they should have won and could have won but didn't. A lot of people will want to blame Ausmus for more of these than he deserves also. There's just no energy on this team, there's no fight in this team. How do you fix that as a manager? We saw a lot of teams with no fight in them under Leyland as well.  The batting is there, but where are the clutch hits when down in the 7th or later?  The pitching is such a huge issue and I don't think any trades will help fix it. We have the talent I think they're just being coached poorly. I have to forgive Soria for the blown 5 run lead in the 9th because he's been about as stable as we can hope for in the bullpen normally.  I think, 100%, that our pitching coaches need to go. Jeff Jones has been here for a long time and players continue to regress under him. Cleveland has 51 runs against us in 12 games...CLEVELAND!  Overall teams have scored 4 or more runs against the tigers 54 times this season. 5 or more runs 41 times. 6 or more runs 30 times. 7 or more runs 24 times.  Think about that...88 games have been played and just over 1/4th of them the Tigers have seen 7 or more runs come across home plate against them. That is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable.  Sure, a couple of those bad run games you can blame on Ausmus leaving a pitcher in too long but in that sense hindsight is 20-20 a lot of the time. We should be able to rely on our bullpen in some way, shape, or form but we can't. Hell, we can barely rely on our starting pitchers right now. We have only one starting pitcher with a sub-4 ERA that has started at least 10 games and that's David Price.   Honestly, I look at our pitching and think it's a miracle that we're at .500. What're you supposed to do as a manager in this situation when most of our starting pitchers collapse incredibly hard and then our bullpen collapses just as hard behind them? Ausmus is stuck in a bit of a catch 22 right now. Can't take the starting pitcher out because the bullpen sucks but can't leave the starting pitcher in because he's sucking. Hell, let's just let Cespedes pitch at this point, he's got a cannon for an arm.  TL;DR: The pitching coaches need to go. How long have we been seeing pitchers regress under Jeff Jones and his staff?"
motorcitykitties,3die9r,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Thu Jul 16 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think your argument has merit but keep in mind that the pitching has only REALLY faltered in the past month. Before this last month or so the tigers were in the top half of the league statwise and this sub was melting down about the offensive output not supporting good pitching. I think this team is poised to break out if given the right catalyst. Although I agree with you. I think Jones has become stale and his staff has failed to show consistency that trends in the right direction. I think Jones has real talent when it comes to starters, but the bullpen has always been a little shaky. There is no denying that."

But I know DD won't sell and has said as such. Likely the Tigers will just flame out until JV and miggy's contracts are up near 2020. Not being dramatic, I just don't know if pizza money can save us now. But who knows, lots of guys are playing way under their potential right now, always good to get into the playoffs."

motorcitykitties,3de20e,ssjviscacha,3,Wed Jul 15 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"Just putting this here to incite conversation.  Don't really see why we would do a trade with the Mariners if were trying to find another 4 or 5 starter. The potential targets in Seattle are:  J.A. Happ: 4-5, 4.14  Taijuan Walker: 7-7, 4.84  Mike Montgomery: 4-3, 2.29  Both Walker and Montgomery are just beginning their careers, so IMO that makes no sense that Seattle would shop them unless they're getting something good in return.  In terms of Happ, he's a veteran lefty, but he's never been that effective except for the beginning of his career."
motorcitykitties,3de20e,jguacmann1,3,Sun Jul 19 21:43:53 2015 UTC,What about Iwakuma?
motorcitykitties,3de20e,jguacmann1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"See, initially I was thinking that the Mariners wouldn't let go of Iwakuma for Avila just because he's a solid pitcher in the past and he's been off of late due to injury. If we were to get Iwakuma, I felt like we'd have to give up more than Avila."

motorcitykitties,3de20e,dirty_drunk,6,Thu Jul 16 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that Ausmus could work with McCann considering how good of a pitch framer he was in his playing days. People were saying not to trust Iglesias's offense either, but look where we are now. Both are fortunately in positions that don't require as much offense to be productive, and if McCann improves his defense he'' stick around for a while."
motorcitykitties,3de20e,eatemuptigs,4,Wed Jul 15 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"His offense has been nice, especially because he's had some power, but the sample size isn't big enough for me to be ready to call him a real major league everyday player.  Otherwise we'd have gone all-in on Brennan Boesch after a few months into his rookie year, or Andy Dirks after 2012, or even Alex Avila after his 2011.  I'm cool with keeping both and going with a platoon, really."

motorcitykitties,3dc9bf,Batman_Manbat,11,Wed Jul 15 12:10:06 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone being such a bummer this season? Sure we're struggling, there is still a ton of baseball left. Last year the Royals looked like they were in our position too. They were down 5 or 6 games come allstar break, then they went off and made it to the world series. Why is that impossible for the tigers to do? If our offense keeps up, plus Miggy coming back, and we potentially pick up a starting pitcher and our bullpen stops shitting the bed, it's not unrealistic that we will make it to the world series. Have some faith."
motorcitykitties,3dc9bf,Curtiscactus,3,Wed Jul 15 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"The Royals had great starting pitching and one of the best bullpens in recent memory last season, and where chasing the Tigers who weren't nearly as good as KC is this year.  Sure the Tigers have a great offense, but outside of Price the rotation is complete garbage, as is the bullpen.  And how are they going to get a great starter with the farm system the Tigers have?"

Alan Trammell was my favorite player, that impossible run against the Blue Jays at the end of the season felt absolutely unreal.   I remember writing the commissioner arguing that Mark McGwire wasn't a rookie since he already had a baseball card (I sent a Mark McGwire rookie card in the mail as proof). I knew Matt Nokes could never win against such competition, but HOW COULD YOU BE A ROOKIE IF YOU HAVE A CARD ALREADY?!?!?!?  Ernie Harwell made that year magical, Al Kaline and George Kell felt like family.

Miggy was putting up near-triple crown-like numbers prior to his injury, and hopefully he'll be back at 100% next month. V-Mart has been solid since returning from injury. Price is an ace. Sanchez is usually good for a solid 6+ innings. Verlander was sharp his last start. Soria has been mostly dependable as a closer. McCann has been a nice surprise. Iglesias has been hitting really well. I have some faith in Alex Wilson and Blaine Hardy coming out of the bullpen. The entire AL (except for KC) has basically been mediocre this season, so we still have a solid shot at a Wild Card, and once a team is in the postseason, anything can happen.  :)"

Nothing i'd like more to come out of the all star break and win 10 in a row and take control of the wild card and hold it down till Miggy gets back.  But I don't see it happening.    For what it's worth I have been wishing we moved Miggy down the lineup for a while now.  Batting him 3rd when the team is in a funk didn't make much sense to me.  He would come up in the 1st inning with 2 outs the majority of the time.  Even if he gets a walk or a base hit, it's unlikely to produce anything, and it usually ends with him knowing that and swinging at garbage.  Hit him 4th and either he comes up with people on base, or he is leading off the rush in the 2nd inning which is much more ideal."

motorcitykitties,3d26i0,irlkg,14,Sun Jul 12 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"SELLING  The only point of selling, the one and ONLY point of selling, is if we can quickly re-build. This team, with JD Martinez, Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez, Anibal Sanchez, JV, etc are not in position for a 4-5 year re-build. This would be looking to re-build quickly and efficiently.   So, we'd have to see what we could get. And to do that, we'd have to look at previous trades that are similar.   Start with David Price: half year of elite pitcher. Look at similar trades in history with a half year starter being traded, namely CC Sabathia and Zack Greinke.   Sabathia trade netted the Indians Matt Laporta, Michael Brantley, and two other basically throw ins. Let's remember tho Laporta was the big name - a top 30 prospect by baseball america. Brantley wasn't highly regarded, though he turned into the stud of the trade. So that trade was a top 30 prospect and other organizational pieces, none too significant though.   The Greinke trade netted the Brewers Jean Segura, a top 60 prospect by baseball america, and 2 AA pitchers, one of whom was Angels top 5 organizational player but not an overall top 100 player.   Our own Anibal Sanchez, who along with Omar Infante, netted the Marlins a top 30 prospect in Jacob Turner.  So what does that mean? David Price would net us a top 50 prospect probably at the minimum, plus some organizational filler. Teams value their prospects a bit more these days, so maybe less, but it's the deadline.   Unfortunately, I can't really think of what Cespedes would get. There aren't many examples of a hitter being traded with only half a year left, and I'm not using Hunter Pence as an example because Philly are fucking idiots.   Now, what could Cespedes and Price together net? Maybe a top 30, top 20 prospect. The problem would be finding a team willing to let go of a top level prospect to go all in for 2015.   Who are prospects in this are from winning teams that might trade? Severino from Yankees. Hunter Harvey from O's. Appel from the Astros? Honestly, I don't see these types of prospects being moved.   So ask yourself this: is trading really worth it if you might not get anyone worthwhile? If yes, then alright be my guest. If not, then you see why DD doesn't want to sell being 4.5 back even."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,AnAmericanParadox,2,Sun Jul 12 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're a buyer, and I think you buy Cole Hamels.   I'm not crazy. I think the only issue with the team has been pitching, pen and rotation, but now that JV is back, and he's not even into top form yet, the only issue ends up being the pen. Neftali Feliz could be a set up man for Soria solidifying the pen somewhat, and Hamels could help set up your rotation for a few years, especially with Price coming off the books (I don't think he'll resign with Cubs, Red Sox, Dodgers, Yankees all looking for a front line guy). Then in late August/early September, Miggy comes back, maybe in time for the series @KC (9/1-9/3), you roll up a hot September and into the playoffs. That's probably what Dave is thinking, which fucking terrifies me."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,irlkg,2,Mon Jul 13 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm on the side of buying, my whole post was saying the type of player we'd get in a trade is even unlikely to be available so there's no point in selling.

But I still feel like the team will buy even if we're 10+ out of the division race if there's still a shred of hope we could nab a wildcard spot (which is still very possible). Would I like to see them sell? Yes, simply because I feel in my heart they don't have the talent or heart to win it all and don't have the trade chips to significantly fix their holes, but I understand the mindset of buying still.  I'll just be angry if they stand pat. Worst possible decision unless the team goes crazy and doesn't lose a game."

There's no way of knowing a comp pick could pan out well enough to be a top 50 prospect let a lone a good player."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,6,Mon Jul 13 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"I want us to sell... We have too many valuable pieces to waste on an opportunity at MAYBE a wildcard spot. I don't see this team making any runs with how many holes they have. The bullpen is still a shit fire, and the rotation is one of the worst in baseball. There are too many holes to fix for just one trade deadline, and the hitting can't carry us forever (we can't predict whether or when they will go on another drought like they had in May and June).  Kinsler, Price, and Cesp can get us ENORMOUS returns in terms of high end prospects for teams who are looking to buy. I think rebuilding (not gutting even more) the farm and looking to reload for a more sustainable and better outlook in a few years is the best move. However, with Illitch only getting older and more impatient, there is no way we look to sell. And more than likely, we will gut the farm even more and buy a starter and reliever come deadline time.  I kept hearing it, but I never wanted to believe the fact that our window was closing.  Now I believe we are witnessing it firsthand. And my concern is that we end up like the A's who are shitting the bed right now (and in total rebuilding mode) or an even worse case, the Phillies who waited entirely to late to sell."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,5,Mon Jul 13 01:47:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how we could buy.

I want to see if Feliz can bounce back, if Rondon can stop screwing the pooch every fourth game, and if JV and Simon can string a couple of decent starts together. If all those things break our way, we may have enough pieces to make a run this year if we add another starter at the deadline. If they don't, we would probably need a couple starters and at least one quality reliever, which would be too much to add without giving away too much young talent."

motorcitykitties,3d26i0,irlkg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"I'd like to talk about prospects for a second. Who would we be wiling to give up? Moya? Farmer? Greiner? Ziomek and Kubitza? I can't see us dumping off Derek Hill. And further more, what would that get us? Moya has high power potential but I think strikes out so much so that it may scare teams off. Any potential trade buys?"
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,LadsActionNewsSteen,3,Mon Jul 13 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"We'd be willing to trade everyone. Everyone.   None of these guys are Kris Bryant's who are almost guaranteed studs. The closest is Moya, but by ""stud"" I mean Chris Carter minus the walks. Aka not good.   What we could get with these guys are buy-low rentals. Mat Latos, Mike Leake, etc. Guys who have shown flashes this season, have certain good splits, but overall numbers suck. I'd personally love Latos, he's been very good in June and July and his ERA away from the Marlins stadium I think is below 3, so I'd be willing to give up our shit prospects for him."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,irlkg,3,Tue Jul 14 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'd quite honestly trade Moya in a heartbeat. The only one I'd even think twice about is Hill just because I'd like to see him get at least some chances in center with Rajai possibly out after this year. I thought we were going to get Latos instead of Simon in the offseason to be honest. I'd be happy with going out and getting him."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,LadsActionNewsSteen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:19 2015 UTC,"I doubt Hill would be called up, he's only 19 and was struggling in A ball.

What would it take from us, according to the reddit GM hive mind, to get him? Controllable pitching? Close to MLB ready prospects? We've got Niese who has a decent contract and is pitching better than at least 50% of your starters (sorry). Thoughts? Musings?"
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,dpasheek,0,Tue Jul 14 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"I hope the Tigers stand pat and maybe even try to make a move for second tier starting pitching. They won't make the playoffs, Price will walk, Victor continues diminishing from age and injury, Miggy is another year older and remains doughy, the pitching staff is nothing, the bullpen is nothing and the farm system is arguably the most barren in baseball, inarguably among the 3 worst.   If the Tigers sell, they stand to reload the farm system, Price, Soria, Cespedes, those guys could net the motherlode from a contender. I don't think they will sell, and they will spend the next 5-7 seasons hanging around 80 wins while eating the ridiculous money owed to Verlander and Martinez, while watching Miggy regress more rapidly than a more finely tuned athlete.  Least you guys have JD Mart"
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Throwaway9999vzjd,3,Tue Jul 14 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'll buy everything you mentioned, but I don't buy Miggy's regression. Yes, I think he begins some point soon, but he is hitting .340 this season coming off of two seasons in which he was injured and still performed like one of the best hitters in the game. His power numbers are down, but I don't think we will see much of a regression in his contact hitting for a while because of how insanely good of a pure hitter he is."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Soup_Campbells,-8,Tue Jul 14 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"Miggy has aged well for how fat he has remained, but that won't continue. A fat 27 year old is far different than fat 33 year old, especially when he basically has to play defense every day with Victor unable to at all. It's a really bad situation that Tigers fans simply can't come to terms with, which is understandable since they've been cheering for a winning team for so long.   Let me put it like this- the reality of being without Miggy for a month and half, Victor being an injury time bomb, Verlander being 2 years removed from the last time he was an elite option, the Tigers probably don't have enough to make the playoffs, but they certainly don't have enough to do anything in the playoffs, so it makes no sense to sit on Price and Soria and guys like that. The future of the team is dire, even if Miggy had 5 good years left in the tank, and he doesn't, neither does Verlander and there is zero help in the farm system.   The Tigers should sell because in spite of only being 5 games back, they are not in contention."
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Throwaway9999vzjd,4,Mon Jul 13 00:12:13 2015 UTC,You're speaking about a triple crown winner. The guy will hit and be productive until he retires.
motorcitykitties,3d26i0,Soup_Campbells,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"I mean... That isn't true. That's hardly true of any player, and no doubt Miguel Cabrera is a special one, but he isn't built for a 20 year career. You can certainly choose not believe that, but it's true nonetheless. The problem the Tigers are facing is just that- Miguel Cabrera is 32, and on the back end of his prime, if the Tigers sell, he probably won't play long enough to see the prospects come to fruition, but if the Tigers don't sell, the team will be fighting for third or fourth place years after Miggy calls it a career, it's really a rock and a hard place for the Tigers. The very real situation could be that in 2016, you open the year with no closer, The 4.15 ERA version of Verlander as the ace with those poor bit players behind him, 3 more years of Victor Martinez (age 37), not to mention who knows who is going to play left next year or what you're ever going to get from Rondon, etc. The Tigers are bottoming out, they have had some bad luck, but shipping off Price and Soria, guys like that, will lessen the number of painful seasons, and during those painful seasons, you guys have Miggy as the ornament of the team. It could be worse. You could be Knicks fans."
motorcitykitties,3d1uvb,YouVersusTheSea,9,Sun Jul 12 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry to buzzkill everyone's individual buy/sell posts but with how many of them have been posted, I figured we needed a dose of reality around here. The guy who calls the shots doesn't sound like he's in the mood for a fire sale quite yet: ""We're trying to win this year right now."" ""So for me, I think we just continue the way we are. We try to get better."" ""... if we play to our capabilities in the second half, we have a chance to win still.""

motorcitykitties,3d1uvb,ruiner8850,6,Sun Jul 12 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"The issue is that they haven't shown is any reason to believe that they will get better. Their pitching has been terrible and Cabrera is out for awhile. Since their hot start they have been one of the worst teams in baseball.   Selling would potentially allow them to reload instead of taking years to slowly decline. If they had a decent minor league system it would be one thing, but they don't. If they aren't prepared to offer Price $200 million we should at least get something for him.   They still have some time to make these decisions, but if they don't get significantly better immediately after the All-Star break then I think they should look to sell."
motorcitykitties,3d1uvb,Musicalmoses,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with you on selling but I feel like potentially are other factors in play besides just baseball. I feel dirty typing it but here goes...       To be honest here, at the end of the day, I think this decision is going to boil down to what Chris Ilitch plans on doing with the team once the big man leaves us for that pizza pie in the sky. If Chris is going to keep the team, stocking up prospects makes sense for longer term future success. If he's going to sell the team off, trying to squeeze a couple extra postseason games out of this team even if they aren't legitimate championship contenders, will probably be the more attractive option. Mostly because people in this town like playoff streaks and surely will tune in, bumping up ratings (again), and giving a new potential owner quite a bit of power when it comes to negotiating a lucrative new broadcasting rights deal in the next couple of seasons. Additionally, who knows the state of Mr. I's health? He has missed a lot of events over the past year and, as much as I'd love decent prospects over getting nothing for Price, that man deserves at least one more ride on the postseason rollercoaster, if he so desires. (Though, I have read recent statements from Dombrowski that seem to indicate they're very interested in keeping David in The D.)       Also, Dombrowski's contract is up after this season, so he might want to pull one of those magic Deadline Dave tricks out his hat if he thinks it'll get them at least one round deeper. There has definitely been some payroll cuts the past few seasons and coupled with the fact that he hasn't won a WS with a wide open wallet yet, he might be moving on... and the press is typically kinder to some ""how the Hell did he pull that off?!"" trade than a fire sale, so long as they get at least a sliver better in the 2nd half, ya know?"

motorcitykitties,3d1uvb,jpguerriero,7,Mon Jul 13 02:41:02 2015 UTC,I said since their great start they've been one of the worst teams in baseball. They've been 8 games below .500 since May 27th when they were 28-20. Since May 27th only Philadelphia has a lower winning percentage (.244) than Detroit (.410) in all of baseball.  Edit: I thought I'd add that since May 27th Milwaukee is 22-19 (.537) which is good enough for 3rd in the NL and 8th best overall.

You get people saying that if you sell Price/Soria/Cespedes/Avila you're gonna be stocked up for the next few years but realistically you won't.  You might get a couple good prospects, maybe you get a good one from the Dodgers for Price depending how desperate they are, maybe something for Cespedes, but Soria and Avila have very little worth on the trade market, and Soria's is lower than ever now.   You're not going to get a ton, and this team is very much still in the hunt.  It doesn't make sense to sell at this moment.  Now if they lose 10 more before the deadline, that's a different story"
motorcitykitties,3d1vni,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"But they are going to be free agents, so for the Tigers to have them next year, they need to sign them anyway. You might as well ""loan"" them to other teams to get even possible prospects to build up something and then try to sign some free agents. Are you going to get Top 10 prospects? No, but the Tigers aren't even cracking the top 100 list right now for prospects.  Another option is to buy, and that means further depletion of talent for the future - and honestly it is still a shot in hell to go all the way this year.  Another option is to not do any trades, lose some players to free agency, and start with less options in the offseason then selling now.   One benefit of selling and getting some fresh players is that the process of building up 'the team' synergy or whatever can start this year instead of spring training.  Never underestimate how much other desperate teams will trade for our free agents at the deadline."
motorcitykitties,3d1vni,midnite8177,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that trading those guys for fringe prospects is not something Mr I wants to do I'm sure.  We're not at the point right now where throwing away a season is worth it and he isn't getting younger.  What you might see is a rental for rental type trade; something like Cespedes+ for a year and a half of a pitcher (think the opposite of the Lester trade last year), as that way we don't lose any of our farm.

Multiple all stars and arguably the best offense in the league (when miggy is healthy) should yield a much better first half than we've had. The bullpen SHOULD be better than it has been and we should be at the very least only a few games back of KC. That's what's frustrating most of us is the expectations vs what we're seeing.

motorcitykitties,3cxder,LeaderSNOW,10,Sat Jul 11 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this bullpen is so bad that even if we do come back from 8 games out, we will lose in the ALDS. There are two courses of action. Buy or sell. We have Price and Cespedes for another couple of months. We can't really afford to resign either or both. I see nothing wrong with moving them for pieces for next year. Hell. Some of what we get could help us this year. The down swing is looming. Why not move some assets to have a little contract control on younger guys that can help us for the next few years rather than when we have basically no farm to pull from. I am not counting them out, I'm just looking at it logically. I will still go to games. I will still watch them. But a wrong move in the next year or two and we are the Phillies except we never actually won a title."
motorcitykitties,3cxder,itsallnipply,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you have little evidence to support most of your suppositions.  The bullpen is bad and has been bad.  Doesn't matter if you look at 2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015.  Bullpen performance in the regular season is a poor predictor of post-season performance.  Sure it would be nice to have a knockout bullpen but plenty of teams that did well in the playoffs often had middle of the road bullpens and teams that had very good bullpens weren't guaranteed a long post season run.    You are gonna have limited interest in Price or Cespedes.  They are rentals and expensive ones at that and although you will find a place to move them relatively easily if we do become sellers, one has to wonder what would be received.  To think we would get killer return for them is foolish.  And we should seriously consider trying to retain at least Price.  If you wanted something good in return you would get rid of Kinsler, Castellanos, McCann, or Victor Martinez.  They are sought after and have time under team control.  Would you wanna do that?    As for not being able to afford them?  What makes you say that?  What evidence towards support of that do you have?  The Tigers roster spending has risen in relative lock-step with the top spenders in the league.  No major jumps like the Dodgers or Cubs.  Nothing special, just the increased spending necessary to attract big time FAs (you have to stay relevant, not everyone gets to be like Houston or KC).  Plus there is no Salary Cap so how do we know how much Illitch is willing to spend?    As for this idea that we are on a razor's edge with what we do? That the downswing is looming?  No we aren't  No it isn't.  Dombrowski has a history that shows his ability to pull-off the improbable and minimize lost time.  Have people forgotten the Price trade, the Fielder Trade, the Miguel Cabrera trade, etc.?  People seem so willing to say we DEFINITELY will make the playoffs or DEFINITELY won't because they wanna say ""Oh I told you, I know baseball really well"".  The team has gotten considerably younger and we have some very exciting talent that has shown promise.  I know our farm system isn't the St. Louis Cardinals but we have mined some pretty good talent from there so I'm not sure I would shit too heavily on it.    Why don't you think we can catch KC or the Twins?  I mean it took KC 87 games to get 8 up on us.  Did you know that only a little more than a month ago we were just one game back on KC?  In 75 games you can't see the possibility of KC or the Twins faltering?  Of a Tigers resurgence?  I mean I read your opinion on a crappy bullpen and rotation but the stats don't really support it having a huge impact on the post season and our team era isn't even 1.00 higher than a year ago(even two years ago).  My issue is: this is a thread for talking about being positive and you comment saying basically "" this isn't the year, I am not gonna be positive, but I will still watch games, go to games, bitch and tell people the sky is falling and they shoulda listened?""  Ok...? I mean you came in to say ""I appreciate the sentiment but I know what's gonna happen and it isn't gonna be good?""  Cool?"

There are talented players, but massive deficiencies in important spots.  This is not a starting rotation that will win a wild card spot, much less a division title.  This is not a bullpen that can be relied upon to shorten games in the postseason.  This is not an offense that is healthy enough (no Miggy) to carry the team into October."

If he shows improvement, then he might be moved into more high leverage situations. It's at least worth taking a chance on him considering how good he could be for us if he figures it out.  If he doesn't figure it out, it's not like he'll be any worse than the guys we've had out there this year anyway."
motorcitykitties,3cxbv9,bigdubsy,3,Sat Jul 11 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah just look at xFIP and SIERA on a guy coming off Tommy John's a couple years ago... don't look at anything else like:  His BABIP that is pushing .350 this year, or his aLI(Average leverage index) of 2.18(higher than basically every other reliever in the majors).  Fastball has gone up almost 2mph between this year and last. And he's pitched a total of less than 300 innings in his entire pro career, majors and minors.(Price threw 20 innings less last year, than Feliz has in his entire MLB career). And he's only 27 years old for crying out loud.  I hear people bitching and moaning like we just signed Joe Nathan all over again."
motorcitykitties,3cxbv9,tiger94,4,Sat Jul 11 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Don't know where you're looking, but according to Fangraphs, his four seam fastball, which he throws ~52% of the time, is almost the exact same speed as last year (93.6/93.7 MPH); that same pitch is still down almost 3 MPH since he was effective pre-Tommy John. His second most thrown pitch, his slider, is down almost 2 MPH since last season (83.5/81.6 MPH).   And further, if you're looking at any type of pitch value metric, he's been much less effective with his four seam this year than ever before in his career, and his slider is less effective than last year. Plus, his walks are up and he's throwing less strikes.   Leverage index is just a measure of the intensity of situations in which a player was used, and not a measure of their performance. His WPA (Win Probability Added) is -1.18 this season. For reference, Gorzelanny's was 0.00 and Joba's was -1.15.  Sure, his BABIP is high, but even if it regresses to league average, he's just not pitching very well at this point. I hope you're right and he ends up being great for the Tigers. But quite frankly, I don't see it."
motorcitykitties,3cxbv9,burgetta,3,Sat Jul 11 18:01:12 2015 UTC,I got excited after seeing fs1 clocking his fastball 97-98. But it looks like this must've just been a hot gun. Enthusiasm tempered.
motorcitykitties,3cxbv9,Jonny_Qball,0,Sun Jul 12 04:54:32 2015 UTC,Here's where I got my info and according to this every pitch he currently throws is now thrown at least 1mph faster than it was last year  This also says he uses the fastball over 63% of the time in 2015  Edit: slider is actually a tad slower than last year.

motorcitykitties,3cxf04,Mattrix013,0,Sat Jul 11 23:06:41 2015 UTC,He's not gonna want to let him go into the All-Star breaking without pitching. If he does it will be almost 20 days since Feliz's last appearance  This is why we have an ineffective bullpen. Today was the first time in 3 days that Alex Wilson pitched.
motorcitykitties,3cxf04,tiger94,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:59:57 2015 UTC,The last time Wilson pitched he threw 50 pitches remember.  That's why we brought Farmer up was because Wilson was out of commission for a few days

motorcitykitties,3cxf04,tiger94,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:53:49 2015 UTC,Also for a bit of perspective I went back and looked at the SP through 86 games. (Back when Coke was the 5th starter.) The FSD graphic inspired me.  JV was 11-3 vs rest of SP 23-25.  Team in JV starts 12-6 vs. 33-35.  JV had a 2.32 ERA vs. rest of SP 4.78

motorcitykitties,3cvlb7,FakeyFaked,6,Sat Jul 11 03:43:41 2015 UTC,It still is.  Soria and Rondon won't be like that every game.  It's a small hiccup.  We'll take the next two in Minnesota and go into the break feeling good again.

motorcitykitties,3cvlb7,SoCalWingFan,4,Sat Jul 11 04:54:16 2015 UTC,"The reality is that by this point in the season, it's not a hiccup; it's what this team is.  We're not bad, but we aren't great either.  They're good, but probably not good enough to make the playoffs, and if they grab a wildcard spot, we'll probably just see more of what we've seen in the last few postseasons.  I'll still watch because I like baseball and love the Tigers, but I just can't fool myself into thinking this team is something it's not."

Everybody seems to have all sorts of ideas after the game is over. I was out at the bar, and I actually heard more than one person shout that he should have put Joba in!

motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,MattyNiceGuy,5,Sat Jul 11 06:45:51 2015 UTC,Ausmus has no pitching. HOW THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT A TEAM TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN ITS A HALF ASS TEAM.
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,mithuun15,3,Sat Jul 11 06:07:48 2015 UTC,"Good post. I also stand by Ausmus.  If they did fire Ausmus, there's a good chance whoever replaces him would be the same or worse.  And I think he is better than Leyland. But I didn't get to see a lot of games last year, for what it's worth.  Also, in the back of my head, I can't help but think there's a chance Ausmus put Joba and (especially) Gorzellany in games frequently knowing that they'd be so bad and the front office would have no choice but to release them and get someone else."
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,cab4656,9,Sat Jul 11 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"I always defend ausmus, but he is not better than Leyland. That is not a knock on Ausmus, but a praise of Jim. Very few managers are as good as Leyland."
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,purpleclouds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:00:15 2015 UTC,I agree. Brad put in our two strongest relievers. They shit the bed. Hard.

motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,Ultimetalhead,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:18:49 2015 UTC,I agree!  Whether or not Ausmus is going to be a good manager is yet to be seen.  And pinning losses where professional athletes aren't performing is not on him.
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,Nfrizzle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:23:38 2015 UTC,I see your point. But at some point something has to be Ausmus' fault.
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,Dwychwder,6,Sat Jul 11 05:24:40 2015 UTC,I'd say a lot has been but not the game last night
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,runalex123,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:51:30 2015 UTC,I would say that last night was not his fault. But the season as a whole is a reflection on him. His job as a manager to to win games. Plain and simple. And we need to hold DD feet to the fire a little bit more here for his dismantling of our pitching staff.
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,ZombieHitchens2012,0,Sat Jul 11 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"THIS IS ONE GAME OF 162.   I don't have a problem with Ausmus, but this line of thinking needs to stop.  People like you have been saying this for the last 2 and a half months.  Every game is a crucial game up until we clinch the division, not just 1 game out of 162 games."
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,larrykins,-7,Sat Jul 11 15:26:20 2015 UTC,but but I still think you leave JV in there....
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,glamorousglue,11,Sat Jul 11 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"He was at like 120 pitches. No, no you don't leave him in there. Rondon get a 1 pitch out to end the inning. It's not Ausmus' fault at all - what we all perceive to be 2 of our better pen guys shit the bed hard."
motorcitykitties,3cvqpo,irlkg,5,Sat Jul 11 12:11:20 2015 UTC,"Why? You trust your bullpen to finish when a starter is worn out. They did not protect a 6 run lead. That is not Ausmus's fault. That is Rondon, and Soria's faults. they are supposed to get some outs.Like Morris said, throw it up there and 70 percent of the time, the batter will get himself out.  Walks and hit batters does not do the job.  This has the feel of a very important loss. taking the first 2 would have been huge. we could have passed up the Twits and only had KC to chase. Now we are back in a battle. Winning the next 2 does not give us second place ."

YOU BETTER GET EXCITED  As bad of a year as he's having(4.58 ERA 4.15FIP in 19.2 innings) I think he's only going to get better. His BABIP this year is almost .400, and his Average Leverage Index is over 2.00, that's the highest it's ever been in his career.   Not to mention he's only 27 and even though he's had Tommy John's(in 2012) his average fastball this year is still a touch over 95mph, which is up almost a full 2 mph higher than last year. Before TJS his avg fastball was 97mph, so I wouldn't be surprised if he regains it all.   Between the start of his minor league career in 2006 and today, he's thrown less than 300 innings. So the risk of him having lots of wear and tear on his arm and shoulder is minimal.  Injuries aside the only downside to this guy is his walk rate of 3.5BB/9, and the occasional blown save(93/107 saves during his career). I think all he needs to find success again is a change of scenery."

The bullpen is not a crutch, they are there for the following reasons: 1) starter gets injured, or, 2) starter fails at a CG, or, 3) snag homerun balls that just clear the fence.  Maybe next time he'll step it up.  For real though, I was watching the game on mlb.tv off my Tivo and right after the one out in the 9th it crashed and rebooted. I decided not to put it back on figuring there is a 1 in 1058 chance of a comeback.   It saved me from a lot of cursing, but when I saw the final score, I was amazed at how NOT shocked I was.

Yes, he is a shitty manager, no one is debating that, but he did what EVERYONE was clamoring for him to do in this game: let the starter go deep, and then used our ""best relievers."" They still lost. That is not on the manager, that is on the pitchers and the GM that supplied the roster with a bunch of pitchers that shouldn't even be in MLB to begin with."

He plays hard, he plays right, he's skilled and just as dependable at second as Iggy is at SS. That being said, I think he's overlooked a lot, and possibly under appreciated. I don't see him smile much, and his interactions with the other Tigers sometimes seem cold. That scares me. He's a rare talent at second base, possibly the best second basemen we've had since the 80's, and one we cannot afford to lose. It scares me because of what went down with him and Texas. He doesn't seem to be afraid to throw a team under the bus, and if he's unhappy in Detroit, I fear what he would do. Just my opinion."

Throw in the garbage a great start by Verlander.  I'm really not sure why I'm not supposed to want this team to be a seller at the deadline.

motorcitykitties,3cpf9p,swearbear3,0,Fri Jul 10 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, though, sign JD long term and as much as it pains me to say it....trade Miggy. Some team out there would sell the farm for him. We should capitalize on that before we're stuck with an aging star and his huge contract (ie: Verlander)."
motorcitykitties,3crh74,AK613,6,Fri Jul 10 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"Eh the problem is that they're rentals. Price could fetch you a top 50 prospect, similarly to Cueto, but what's more worth it: a top 50 prospect or a chance for the WS since we're only 1.5 GB of the wild card?   Also think about this: jake Thompson who we traded for Soria is seen as a top 50 prospect by many places. Would you trade Price for a Thompson-like player and maybe another minor piece or two? The answer is probably no, not while we still have a chance.   We should focus on getting cheap rental IMO, guys like Latos, Leake, shark, etc. see maybe if you could get kazmir or gallardo. We can afford those guys potentially, so that's what we should be after. And all these guys are FA next year and we could re-sign them potentially."
motorcitykitties,3crh74,irlkg,4,Fri Jul 10 11:52:03 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss what we could get for some of these guys. Lester and Samardzija were both half year rentals last year and Lester went for a starting left fielder and Samardzija was traded for the #12 prospect in baseball. So it all comes down to what the market is like for these positions and what teams are willing to give up.
motorcitykitties,3crh74,Ballyhood,3,Fri Jul 10 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"Shark was not a half year rental. He had 1.5 years and was traded ALONG with Hammel who was doing amazing for Russell. The a's traded shark's final year this offseason. So the Cubs traded a total of 2 years for Russel.   Also, a half year of Lester landed a solid outfielder, but Cespy had decent but not great season last year.   If we traded a half year of Price for a prospect, you have to compare to similar trades, and half year of an ace for a prospect usually nets a top 50 - but not elite - prospect."
motorcitykitties,3crh74,irlkg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:24 2015 UTC,Putting qualifying offers on guys like Price and Soria can help the farm too.
motorcitykitties,3crh74,Rbaner,3,Fri Jul 10 13:19:59 2015 UTC,But what are we going to get for rentals like Price? And personally I want David here long term.  Dombrowski is a buyer. Pretty much always has been. If we are anywhere near a wildcard we'll be buyers
motorcitykitties,3crh74,flory1aw,2,Fri Jul 10 10:39:06 2015 UTC,"If this is like beating a dead horse, apologies."
motorcitykitties,3crh74,Sniper_Brosef,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:36:58 2015 UTC,Can we put a rule in place to stop posting articles about us selling?  With 3/4 or a sweep here against Minnesota we're in good shape going into the break to make a run in the second half.  It's a LONG season guys and all we really need is one of JV or Greene to figure out their shit.
motorcitykitties,3crh74,doc_oct,6,Fri Jul 10 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  I get that we could sneak into the playoffs.  But the goal should be to build a team that's much stronger than this one.  Our pitching is really weak (except Price and sometimes Sanchez).  I say we play the long term game, not just short term for a possible spot this year."
motorcitykitties,3crh74,MShasta,4,Fri Jul 10 13:18:55 2015 UTC,"You don't understand the situation. Our owner might not be alive next year. If we have a chance at a wild card spot, we will be playing for that wild card spot."

motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,threemadness,2,Fri Jul 10 03:11:26 2015 UTC,I believe so.
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,roses-are-green,5,Fri Jul 10 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"People who are complaining about Ausmus not pinch-running there have to realize that there is a difference between pinch-running in the 8th with your best batters coming up next inning & your starter still in, and pinch-running in the 9th with a spent bullpen and your worst hitters coming up next inning, right?"
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,Robot_Satan,4,Fri Jul 10 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"Yes (and I always back up Ausmus), but we are talking about Krauss here, not Miggy or Vmart. Romine is probably just as good with the bat and probably plays better defense. PRing for Krauss would have had very little downside with a lot of upside."
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,roses-are-green,3,Fri Jul 10 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"Krauss has pop and experience at first, and more importantly it means you spend Romine in a situation where you don't necessarily need to use him and he can't say pinch run for Casty in the 9th or 10th which is a situation where the runner being the go ahead run is more important"
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,Robot_Satan,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"Yes but I would bet that Casty is quite a bit faster than Krauss  Edit: and they still have Marte would could be used. Also the saving them argument could literally always be used. There is always a chance you could be better off having saved them for something, but you can't just sit around and wait for it."
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,roses-are-green,3,Fri Jul 10 02:39:46 2015 UTC,Marte is not a very good fielder or runner and has almost no experience at first (11 games).  Casty may be faster than Krauss but I'd rather have Romine available as a PR in the 9th if necessary than the 8th
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,Robot_Satan,2,Fri Jul 10 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"He ended up using Romine anyway, so now we know why he did it. He wanted to use Romine as a defensive replacement for Casty. I would still argue that with a guy on first with no outs, you opt for the fast guy over the slow guy, even if it means making your defense a little bit worse. Heck, he could've even used Davis to PR and then made the defense move."
motorcitykitties,3cq0r3,roses-are-green,2,Fri Jul 10 02:45:43 2015 UTC,I agree.

motorcitykitties,3copik,flexfulton,4,Thu Jul 9 15:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think they have started to show a lit of improvement this last month. Thats why I don't think they should become sellers. The pieces are all there, they just need to all be working at the same time. The only real area that I believe improvement is needed in is the starting rotation. Which is quite frankly, awful at the moment. If the tigers can nab a solid starter or 2 before the deadline, this team has the potential to be a world series contender. Theres a lot of baseball to be played yet, but not enough where they can afford to faulter too much."
motorcitykitties,3copik,purpleclouds,3,Thu Jul 9 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with selling or buying, though. Hell, this isn't even a good thing. These runs being counted are the total runs in each of those eighteen games, not the runs the Tigers have scored. We have been outscored through that stretch. It's also worth keeping in mind that Vegas odds and over/unders are built to make the bookies money, not to be an actual projection or benchmark.   This is just a quirk that some guy decided to write an article about, not a noteworthy event that can be analyzed to determine future performance."

motorcitykitties,3copik,dbenoos,0,Thu Jul 9 17:05:27 2015 UTC,THANK YOU. WE SHOULD NOT BE SELLERS.
motorcitykitties,3copik,fantasyfest,3,Thu Jul 9 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Statistician here. Considering how good Vegas is at handicapping lines like this.. A streak of 18 games like this is attributable mostly to random luck. It's like if you're flipping coins and you get 18 heads in a row. The odds of it happening are really low, but over a big enough sample size it's bound to happen every now and again.  TLDR - this has more to do with random luck than how well/poorly the teams are playing in these games."
motorcitykitties,3copik,dirty_drunk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:15 2015 UTC,"What logic. in Detrioit's case the run accumulation is bad, even though they have a winning record during that time.  We keep scoring like that and winning will happen."

motorcitykitties,3cres4,Krunklock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"Let's face it. In the bank of health/performance we are pretty much right where we've been all season.  Miggy is out, but Victor is playing like he's healthy, JD is killing it and Casty is on fire. Those weren't all the case a couple weeks back with Miggy. It sucks losing Miggy but with other returns we seem to be about at the same level as, say, a month ago."

motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,TyPiper93,10,Thu Jul 9 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"Your topic is a good topic to discuss but your way of going about is absolutely terrible, no offense. Don't go attacking people because they share a different view than you, they're allowed to have that view.  The Tigers essentially have three options here...   Buyers - This is really tough considering you buy with prospects and draft picks and extra players that you don't need but other teams do. Players we don't need could include Castellanos, Rajai davis or Anthony Gose, Avila or McCann. As far as our prospect pool goes we basically have nothing. Our farm system is absolutely awful and the entire league knows it. Also, with how much we've been buyers in the last few seasons the few good prospects we did have are gone. We would need starting pitching and bullpen help for this season in order to make a run and we just don't have the prospects or excess talent to get what we need.  Sellers for this season but buyers for next season/few seasons - We have a few players that some teams much more likely to make the world series than us would want as rentals. We'd get prospects/players for next season and seasons onward and replenish our farm system a bit as well so that if we were close to a World Series and we just needed that one piece to get over the hump we could be buyers for ONE season. Being buyers every season ends up hurting a lot in the long run. All of those prospects we had from the Tigers terrible years are gone now because of how much we've been buyers lately. Players like Cespedes and Price could fetch some pretty nice return and there could be the chance that they come back in free agency.  Sellers - Blow everything away. Start a rebuild. We get to start new with a majorly replenished prospect pool and a few rebuilding seasons where we can get some high draft picks. We're not under the horrible management we were before, Dave Dombrowski can be a wizard but sometimes teams just need a rebuild. It sounds like the worst thing in the world but if we do the rebuild right and don't Marlins it then we could be a very good team for years to come. Just look at how the Red Wings built a 24 season Dynasty because they draft well and develop prospects.  I mentioned this in another comment in this thread...Our prospect development seems to suck. Maybe it's just me but does anyone else see this too?"
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,Brady_Hokes_Headset,4,Thu Jul 9 17:40:29 2015 UTC,"Our prospect pool does suck. And in the other thread where you discuss getting good draft picks, well that was never a problem for the Wings. ;)"
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Thu Jul 9 17:54:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the Wings were, and still are, fantastic at it. The Tigers however, seemed to be absolutely atrocious at scouting and developing their prospects. The management of the Tigers is significantly better now but it seems that our scouting and development need a major overhaul right now."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,ShakeItTilItPees,13,Thu Jul 9 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the reasoning, here. Not a single person in the world thinks that trading Cespedes, Price and Soria will help us win a World Series this year. It CAN help us win a World Series next year if we get something in return, which will absolutely add more value to the team's success in the next few years than the one supplemental draft pick we stand to get when they probably sign elsewhere.   Also, implying that people you disagree with are bandwagoners is the lowest common denominator of sports discussion."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,Brady_Hokes_Headset,12,Thu Jul 9 17:07:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's extremely unlikely that we win the World Series this season so why not get the team younger and replenish our farm system for next season and years down the line.  I hate that the Tigers farm system is so bad...we were so bad for long enough that we really should have a solid farm system but it seems like our scouts/draft picks/development just didn't work out.  I look at the Red Wings. They went through the unspeakable years of the 80s and then got high draft picks which they built a team and farm system around. The Red Wings have been in the playoffs for 24 seasons straight and it's because they develop players from within their system.   Maybe this doesn't work as well in baseball but am I the only one that feels like our prospects don't get developed as well as they could?
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,SodiumThoride,5,Thu Jul 9 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"The Tigers have been a good team for nearly a decade. The talent drafted when they were bad would mostly be aged 30+ now. Almost everybody of value drafted since then has been traded away for proven MLB talent.  I do agree that they need to step up their scouting and drafting game, though. Most of the top prospects from the Tigers' system haven't panned out.  Edit: It could also be more of a player development issue than a drafting/scouting issue, but that's tough to say for sure. They draft power pitchers fairly heavily, and those guys tend to have huge trade value."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,flexfulton,3,Fri Jul 10 02:35:02 2015 UTC,Agree with both points.
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,jokah,4,Thu Jul 9 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"I never said disagreeing means you're a bandwagon fan, I simply said the Tigers are - historically - a bandwagon team. Something I hate admitting, but it's the truth. As for Price, I don't see him going to another team. If you watch closely his interactions and mannerism, I'd say he's very happy on this team and even said at the beginning of the year that he's very intent on working out a deal with the Tigers. As for Soria, this is the team that helped his ""redemption,"" I really feel we can make a deal with him. As for Cespedes, I really can't say much on that but Dombrowski is a mad genius so I have faith. And trading these guys away for the POSSIBILITY of good return, I'm sorry, isn't justifiable for these proven players."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,jokah,5,Thu Jul 9 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a bandwagon fan. From 1984. I watched a ton of games in the 90s/early 2000s so I figure that gives me a liftetime pass on the whole bandwagon thing.  The big thing about selling off pieces like Price and Cespedes is that they are already viewed as probably leaving the team at the end of the year. If a team in the playoff hunt is willing to hand us some nice pieces in return for those short-term rentals, it could be very tempting."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,flexfulton,3,Thu Jul 9 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"I don't see Price leaving though. He's stated at the beginning of the season that he's happy here and intent on working out a deal. As for 1984 bandwagon, yeah you're fine. Not a bandwagon fan after 30 years..."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,flexfulton,6,Thu Jul 9 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, don't all players say nice things as long as the season is still going on? He'll go to the highest bidder, like most free agents. Could wind up being Detroit, but I think they'll be outbid."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,flexfulton,6,Thu Jul 9 17:35:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. He doesn't owe Detroit anything. No home town discount either. Not like he has been with us forever through thick and thin.
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,AK613,2,Thu Jul 9 17:45:58 2015 UTC,Saying he wants to stay and being offered and signing a 200+ million dollar deal are two VERY different things.  Just cause he wants to stay doesn't mean the Tigers want to pay for him.
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,midnite8177,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, but that also doesn't necessarily deem that we won't pay him that."
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,kander77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:53:04 2015 UTC,Well only the Tigers front office knows what they want to do. They have to make a decision soon and it will be a gamble either way. If they seriously don't think they can sign him trading might be best option. Only they know that at this time. And just cause they WANT to sign him doesn't mean he will WANT to come here.  Maybe this is year one of a downward spiral and he would rather play on a team that is on the up and coming side of things instead. It will be the next 6 or 8 years of his career. Perhaps his view on us has changed since he stated he wanted to work out a deal with us.
motorcitykitties,3cp0vq,SodiumThoride,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:03 2015 UTC,If we give Price a $200 million+ deal we could very well be one of the dumbest teams in the Bigs. You're looking at over $600 mil locked up in three players for at least five years.
motorcitykitties,3cmo9t,2222lil,3,Thu Jul 9 02:30:42 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken more often than not if someone needs replacing they take guys from the final vote before anywhere else. So it would make sense for Yo to make it if Gordon doesn't play. Hopefully JD can get a start out of it too but I think that's Yost's decision to make.
motorcitykitties,3cmo9t,arenyk,3,Thu Jul 9 05:58:46 2015 UTC,Adam Jones is gonna get the start

motorcitykitties,3cmo9t,Savage9645,0,Thu Jul 9 18:07:22 2015 UTC,Cespedes would have to win the vote to have a chance.  There is likely a better chance that JD would get the start for Gordon.

Otherwise, a great game of patience at the plate and defense (looking at you, Romine)."

motorcitykitties,3cm1ya,irlkg,7,Wed Jul 8 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"The highlights of the article:    JD has the highest ISO to the opposite field this year - almost 100 points ahead of Bryce Harper who is second. Almost .100.  JD's opposite field wRC+ is better than his pull or center field wRC+, which is really unheard of.  Stephen Vogt leads all left handed hitters with an ISO of .554 to the pull side (aka right field). JD Martinez's ISO of .644 to the opposite field (aka right field) is 90 points higher. In other words, JD Martinez hits the ball to right field better than the best left handed pull hitter in the league.  JD hits grounders and liners more to his pull side, yet his fly balls and power are more to the opposite field JD's sweet spot is on the inner half of the plate. That's a testament to his skill of being able to take the inside pitch and hit it over the opposite field fence   TLDR; JD Martinez hits dingers like a lefty pull hitter from the right side"

motorcitykitties,3cl01z,doc_oct,26,Wed Jul 8 18:56:17 2015 UTC,I don't pretend to know more than the man who has had us on the brink of a World Series for a decade. Whatever Dombrowski and Mr. I choose to do is good by me.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,PopWhatMagnitude,3,Wed Jul 8 19:12:58 2015 UTC,best answer right here
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,runalex123,11,Thu Jul 9 02:35:13 2015 UTC,I lean this way as well. The team has too many holes to fix at the deadline. This could literally be a half a season reload. We could get some young talent at the trade deadline  and be ready to spend money this offseason.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,ZombieHitchens2012,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"""half season reload""... perfectly put encapsulation"
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,Naturalpipes,7,Wed Jul 8 19:12:17 2015 UTC,Okay can someone tell me what we could get for say our big name 1 year contracts. I want names god dammit not just the word prospects. I wanna know who.. I hear this term selling but if we can rebuild our farm then we are investing.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,dbenoos,2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest and say I don't know nearly enough.  But I'm sure there are good young players somewhere to be had for the right price.  To me the more difficult question is who to give up.     Cespedes because he'll be expensive and hasn't been SO amazing?  Price because he'll be expensive??  I really don't like giving up any of our decent pitchers (Price, Sanchez) Miggy or Iglesias.  I guess giving up something is always painful."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,kander77,2,Wed Jul 8 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"This is why I don't think we should sell. Who is gonna give up a top-level prospect for two/three months of Price and Cespedes? (AND not get the draft pick comp when they walk in FA). If we hold on to Price and he walks we get a first round pick, which IMO is better than any prospect we could get on the trade market.  We've also got young guys producing in McCann, Iglesias, and Gose, and Casty looks like he may be on an upswing. Throw Collins, Marte, Moya, and maybe Dixon Machado into that mix and I'm not sure we need to add too many position playing prospects.  I could certainly see DD trying to add pitching prospects at the deadline if we were to sell, but wouldn't that effectively mean giving up on guys like Greene and Farmer? Verlander and Sanchez are locked in for next year, and DD will probably go after a top arm like Greinke if we can't re-sign Price. With Lobstein/Greene/Ryan/Farmer hanging around, we'd have to send two/three of those guys to the pen if we add another pitching prospect. Which is fine, and probably a good problem to have, but I'm not sure it's worth giving up on this season to have a bullpen competition among mediocre twenty-something ex-prospects."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,kgriffin44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:12:10 2015 UTC,I don't see it as giving up on any player. In any given season every MLB team needs an average of 7-8 starters to get through the season. Also trading away players for prospects is better than getting picks back in terms of value returned. For the traded for prospects you usually have more information on the players you acquired than you do for traded ones. Plus if the player you keep signs with someone else you only get a pick sandwiched between the first and second rounds.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,runalex123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:45:19 2015 UTC,Good relievers are usually twenty-something ex-prospects
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,bronwynsings,6,Thu Jul 9 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"Or we could wait and see what happens? If we're losing a lot from now until the deadline, then obviously we need to sell. But if we are still very much in it, then no way. I want one more shot. I believe in this team."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,xproofx,2,Wed Jul 8 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"I still believe we should wait and see how the series with the Twins go. If we can pass them up and have a shot at KC, then we buy. If not, we sell. Either way, I'll understand the decision and won't be too mad no matter what happens."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,Poggystyle,6,Wed Jul 8 20:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it.  I think it.  Downvote if you like, but here's my reasoning: The Tigers have bought bought bought and have contended for basically a decade.  Kudos to Dombrowski.  But I think we'd all love a World Series Championship and at this point we're running on fumes, this truck has less and less fuel to drive it forward as we use up more and more and players get older and older.  THIS team isn't gonna win a World Series unless there's a MAJOR change, especially in pitching.    SO, maybe sacrifice this year and get some young guys, free up some space to make room for longer term success and building.  I'd see if there are trades that can sacrifice this year not in any way that totally screws us long term, but free up money and get guys that'll help over the next few years, at the expense of this year.   (Of course this is all contingent on finding someone desperate enough to make the right change).  Downvote away."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,allyallmfersneed___,0,Wed Jul 8 18:56:23 2015 UTC,Have an upvote.  I agree 100%.  There's no shame in admitting that this isn't the Tigers year.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,iamsuchasucker,-4,Wed Jul 8 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"With Miggy hurt and a depleted farm system, time to cut bait. Price isn't staying in Detroit. Not a fan of the city."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,FakeyFaked,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:29:55 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Our window is shut. Time to retool.
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,FakeyFaked,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:28 2015 UTC,"I will be extremely happy if we become sellers. Price, Soria, Cespedes, Simon, Rajai Davis and Alex Avila as free agents.  Then you could even throw in Kinsler and Sanchez on top of that, and if we find a taker and Victor keeps hitting I would even send him on his way as well. Al Al might even get us something back.  You stock the farm, and you get a free potential ready players for next year.  Lineup wise you begin to build around Miggy, Iggy, Casty, Gose, McCann and JD which is a very good start, and all cheap players around Miggy.  You only need to find a DH, 2nd baseman and left fielder to round it out.  Then obviously you have to go into FA spending spending spending on pitchers, while hopefully getting 2 that work out from all the trades that could be ready.  I feel like we'd still be fielding a good team and we'd get rid of a lot of salary and fill up our farm system.  Even if none of those guys work out, they are leaving anyway.  Only thing we're likely to get from them is a first round pick from Price if we keep them, would be a hard pill to swallow.  I would like to keep Cespedes on the team regardless but yeah those are my feelings."

motorcitykitties,3cl01z,cliffhanger1983,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"I think this is a particularly good year to sell too.

We could rebuild our farm system overnight."
motorcitykitties,3cl01z,FakeyFaked,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"This is a particular good year not to sell because there is NO powerhouse in the AL.  KC is on pace to win 96 games, but I don't think they're scary good.  Every other team in contention in the AL has as many holes as the Tigers.  The playoffs are often called a crapshoot, but this year it's really going to be an open tournament won by the hottest team. Tigers get in there and they can win a game and then two series pretty easily.    Furthermore, 3 months of guys like Price, Cespedes, Davis, and Soria aren't gong to bring a haul back."

motorcitykitties,3cjrdr,marshman18,3,Wed Jul 8 13:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's recorded anywhere as an official stat, but in Ian's case yesterday since he tried to get to 2nd base it's recorded as caught stealing.  You could compare his stolen bases to his caught stealing. In 2015 for instance the ratio is not good, 4 times caught stealing and 6 stolen bases.  Now at least one of those was a pick-off (from last night), so his genuine steal attempts are a better picture than that.  We had a couple guys get frozen at first last night. I've never seen that guy pitch before, but he's got what looks like a really fast pick-off move."
motorcitykitties,3cjrdr,notharley,3,Wed Jul 8 14:00:27 2015 UTC,I read that was his 4th time getting picked off 1st on twitter. A few reputable beat writers were throwing that number around.  Kinsler is having a bad year.

Get 2 or 3 high quality prospects and 2 or 3 meh prospects out of it. Have $50+ million to spend next season. Dombrowski needs to start a short term re-build this year."

Dude, our roster is still more talented than Minnesota and KC and you think that because we lost ONE MAJOR PLAYER that the whole season is fucked? We weren't playing well with Cabrera and we have played better lately without but it is still time for a fire sale? Let's get real for a second. Prospects are highly valued in the league right now but you can't deny the importance of proven talent, which we have in spades. We literally have one of the youngest teams in baseball with a large amount of rookies getting real reps for the first time and you wanna scrap what proven talent we do have? Look at the teams who win World Series. They have an undeniable ace on their squad. They have a good bullpen. And they play well against important teams.  You wanna trade our best pitcher, the guy with the 3rd most doubles in the league (not to mention a cannon for an arm, good speed, and oodles of power), a solid veteran catcher when we have a young catcher in dire need of tutelage and guidance, and the best closer we have had in at least 5 years when we have absolutely no one better, aaaaaaaand Davis. All that for some prospects and some picks? We are a 6 games back from KC with 80 games left dude!?!?! We are a game or two out of the WC. You wanna trash the team now for the possibility of rebuilding an already VERY young team by selling a majority of our very talented older vets who actually have post season experience because you feel that gives us a better chance at the post season? What colors are the skies in your world? Give this team some time, they have shown some promise over these last games. They have shown grit and determination to not be defined by Miggy and that is a powerful motivator. Or.... Fuck it! Sell everything so you can have all season to bitch about a horrible team next year. When your car makes a strange sound and doesn't run right you don't take it to the crusher and buy a brand new one."
motorcitykitties,3cipea,smellthatsmell,2,Wed Jul 8 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, the Tigers are playing much better right now, its not time to become sellers."
motorcitykitties,3cipea,purpleclouds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:36:51 2015 UTC,Paragraphs.  They are your friend.
motorcitykitties,3cipea,SilentStryk09,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"Let's be realistic here, this team isn't very good and this isn't our year. I know it sucks to admit after winning the Central 4 years in a row. The batting is pretty great (minus the whole Cabby out for 6 weeks thing) Our SP is mediocre at best. We basically have an ace and a solid #2. Drops off after that. Our bullpen is horrible outside of Soria. It needs to be completely re-built.We have the worst farm system in baseball. So here are the options:   Stand pat and don't make any moves. This will get us no where. We miss the playoffs and the players listed walk via free agency. You trade what we have left of our terrible farm system to get to the playoffs and probably get knocked out first round. We sell the above mentioned prospects and quickly re-build to compete next year. We would also still have the opportunity to retain them via free agency."
motorcitykitties,3cipea,KAW42089,4,Wed Jul 8 14:45:30 2015 UTC,"I think the team is underperforming, but has the potential to win big if they can get things together. That's a big ""if"", but I can't rule it out just yet.   That said, the offense has been hitting really well since Miggy's injury. Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe it was a wake up call.  The rotation should be better than it has been, and there's still opportunity for them to improve. Greene was an effective pitcher last year and even into early this year; it's reasonable to think he could do it again. JV has been injured for the past 2 years and is now in spring training mode. I need to see a few more starts before I can say he's lost it, but I'm encouraged by his velocity and the movement on his pitches. The team seems to have a good idea why Simon is struggling (overthrowing pitches) and Avila has been working with him on that.  The key pieces of the bullpen have been pitching pretty well lately for the most part. If the rotation straightens out, the struggling guys won't have as many opportunities to lose a game.  Sure, it's a lot of pieces that have to fall into place, but I still think there's a real chance that things could improve enough for a playoff run."
motorcitykitties,3cipea,SodiumThoride,2,Wed Jul 8 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a short term rebuild.    Price and Cespedes aren't going to get a ton because they'll be rentals.  You'll get some prospects, but everyone seems to think you'll get the next Max Scherzer out of them, you won't.  If the next big thing is in the farm system, they're not giving it up for a rental of an elite pitcher or an above average left fielder.    Selling Simon leaves yet another hole in SP.  That doesn't just get bandaged with prospects.    Soria, ok, you want Rondon to close?  Now who's in the 8th?  7th?  Etc?  If Farrell keeps up, sure, but his control does not look as good as he'd been doing in the minors.    Davis - he's too old for you to get anything worthwhile from him.    Avila - Every decent team is going to say no to Avila and ask for McCann.  Which you could actually get legit talent for.    But if you get rid of all of those pieces that is not a ""short-term rebuild.""  You've basically blown up 6 starters."

The front office isn't going to quit on the team, sell some of its stars, and have Comerica half filled for 2 months when there's a clear chance they could make the playoffs.   The team needs another starting pitcher. If they can find a number 2/3 type guy to add to Price/Sanchez, and they get something out of Verlander going forward they'll be in in contention at least for a wild card, if not to track down KC.  The bullpen has been decent most of the year and going forward with Hardy/Rondon/Soria as your top three is pretty solid."

motorcitykitties,3cf86r,i_crap_on_your_head,5,Tue Jul 7 16:38:31 2015 UTC,I agree if we buy.  Niese is a great option. You could argue that Niese would be as good as a strong No. 3 weak no. 2 on Detroit due to the better defense compared to the lackluster Mets. But if they do go into buy mode I think we should make a move on Zobrist.  He will add a ton of depth.
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,koepkejj,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:07 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we buy SP and as much as I hate to say it JV needs to go in the pen.
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,DetroitVPS,5,Tue Jul 7 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"Our offense is holding well enough, averaging over 6 runs a game in July. Our bullpen should be better with Joba the Hut and Gorzelanny gone, as well as addition of Rondon. JV looked very promising in his Las start. He was hitting the gun at above 95 more than once. In fact, he started at 90, then was able to dial it up to 96, like the good ole JV we were used to seeing. And his off speed pitches looked great, save the two he hung. But let him get another 2 or 3 starts in and he should be at a quality level. We really need another starter. Anyone who can pitch really. Because we would then have 4 good starters, which might be enough to advance in the playoffs.  Verdict: Buyers."
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,koepkejj,3,Tue Jul 7 14:46:01 2015 UTC,I think people are forgetting that JV's body may still be in spring training mode.  The next 3-4 starts should tells us how he will perform down the stretch as the rust wears off.  His quality has been overshadowed by the bad innings but I think he'll really put it together when it's all said and done (when we are in the ALCS).
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,Rbaner,2,Tue Jul 7 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He needs to get some innings under his belt, work all his pitches, and work to getting back to pitching shape. He's already shown vast improvement"
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,doc_oct,2,Tue Jul 7 18:59:06 2015 UTC,Too early to tell. We'll have a better idea closet to the deadline.
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,Kwolek2005,2,Tue Jul 7 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"I think the Tigers have let go a ton of good talent: see Prince Fielder this year after surgery, Fister, Scherzer, Peralta.  Dombrowski's style is so high-risk high-reward he's always going for home runs.  He's always trying to make a champion.  I doubt it's even worth talking about selling, I doubt he'd do it.    That said, I think there's a smart way to do it.  I think you look at contract sizes and try to do something smart with dumping the huge ones while getting something resonable in return.  Easier said than done, but maybe a nuanced approach rather than a full on 'buy' or 'sell'."
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,14bikes,5,Tue Jul 7 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"Prince is the ultimate hindsight is 20/20 criticism.  He looked like garbage then was out with a neck injury, which is probably the scariest body part to injure.  Fister is falling apart now, and losing velocity fast.  Robbie Ray is doing well, but sadly we traded him for someone else.  Scherzer I don't blame him for, if he had the budget we would have kept him.  And I'd rather have Iglesias than Peralta."
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,honar,2,Tue Jul 7 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"Starting Pitcher Buyers.  They'll need to bite the bullet on Verlander and realize that he is now a very expensive relief pitcher.  Hopefully next year he can pull it together and be a starter again, but he can't go deep into games and that isn't going to be coming back this year.  Here's what I said about Verlander a month ago, and got downvoted for it: link   He's a pitcher who has thrown thousands of baseballs over the course of the last 20 years, primarily as a starting pitcher. Coming back from core surgery. Coming back from arm injury. Guess what, his whole frame is a mess. He's going to struggle his way back up. But he's not going to survive many more 100 pitch performances. He was a starter, and a very good one. But his reign is over but he might still be able to be a beneficial part of the team. Putting him in a starter role is not a good move.   ... and this:    I hope they can turn him into a long reliever. I don't think we'll see 100 pitch JV anymore. Hopefully he can turn it up to a 2-inning clutch guy. Let the starter put it all out there, even if he's gassed at 90 pitches into the 6th, drop in JV to get through to the end or a closer without having to burn through the whole pen."
motorcitykitties,3cf86r,14bikes,2,Tue Jul 7 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"Even if we trade for a pitcher, the guy leaving the rotation will be Ryan. And even if we traded for 2 SP,  Simon has not done much better than JV lately. JV looked great through 4 yesterday. He may not be the JV of old, but he's probably going to give us a better chance to win than Ryan (or Lobstein or Farmer)."

motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,wishesgrantd,3,Tue Jul 7 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"That's about what I'm thinking. I'm still a little concerned that he'll suffer a drop off at some point. But each time I catch myself thinking that I realize he has been a top 15 batter in baseball for over a full season now.   I can imagine him having a season like your ceiling, but I see his long term ceiling at something like .290/.335/.520 with 30 homers per season."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,wishesgrantd,3,Tue Jul 7 16:14:06 2015 UTC,My definition of a ceiling is the highest point a batter could conceivably hit. I'm definitely not saying he's going to do that every year. I don't even think he'll ever have a year like that. I would agree that your estimate is a likely scenario.
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,MichiganMulletia,2,Tue Jul 7 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, we're on the same page. I just meant I can't see him putting up those numbers over 3-4 seasons even under best case scenarios."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,jBURRd,7,Tue Jul 7 16:38:00 2015 UTC,.400/.500/.750 with 100 HRs
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,MichiganMulletia,3,Wed Jul 8 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"That's his floor, right?  /sip"
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,GraemeTaylor,2,Wed Jul 8 06:09:24 2015 UTC,I've seen it done in video games... just a matter of time before real life catches up.
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,socoamaretto,4,Thu Jul 9 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"I think that he's doing his most to prove he's not a fluke. It appears he changed his swing, and if he can keep pitchers from learning how to pitch to him he'll be successful.  I'd say his floor is his projection, his ceiling is probably a bit lower than where he is playing right now (I can see him being a 40+ HR a year guy consistently, what I'm referring to as being above his ceiling is the whole 11 home runs in 13 games)."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,DeuceWallaces,4,Tue Jul 7 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"His recent power surge is simply unbelievable, and obviously completely unmaintanable. He works so hard with studying that I think pitchers will struggle to ever fully figure him out. I think he's benefiting from the fact that most people still aren't realizing he could be a legit #3 hitter in a lot of lineups."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,DeuceWallaces,6,Tue Jul 7 16:17:47 2015 UTC,His power is unreal. At this point I think he has more straight up power than Cabrera. The way he hits the ball to right field is crazy as well. I think he'll be a consistent .280 hitter with 30-40HR and 30+ doubles for the next 4-5 years at least.
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,Jonny_Qball,3,Tue Jul 7 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that be unreal? This lineup is overflowing with potential, which is one reason I'm far from losing hope on this season. We have the bats to reel off a 20-5 stretch easily, and I think our starting pitching is trending down past average. I think they are better than they have pitched recently, in other words. Not a ton better, but better."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,DeuceWallaces,5,Tue Jul 7 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"Uh...his ceiling is right now, his floor is when he got cut from Houston."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,firemage22,0,Tue Jul 7 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"So you're saying he's playing as well as he possibly could right now? No room for improvement?  Not being snarky, just making sure I understand. I think he could potentially improve his walk rate and cut back on K's a little. As far as power he certainly seems maxed out."
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,mmccullen,3,Tue Jul 7 16:48:10 2015 UTC,At 27 it's very unlikely; especially being mainly a power hitter.
motorcitykitties,3cf3n6,TheSheriman,3,Tue Jul 7 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"Jose Bautista didn't hit his breakout season until age 29. Not saying he's Joey Bats, I'm just saying it's been done before, and a shift in organization helped facilitate the change in both instances"

If he had JDs power, it'd be ok, but power comes with age. With his line drive rate I'm still thinking he could be a really complete hitter in the next few seasons"

motorcitykitties,3ceggp,throwaway-det,2,Tue Jul 7 07:25:39 2015 UTC,"Alexi Casilla isn't meant to be replacing anyone, he's not a good player (lifetime .247/.302/.331 in the Majors). He was just there as depth because we had to call up Josh Wilson and Toledo needed a roster spot. He's been in the majors before and struggled. He might be on a little bit of a hot streak, but he's not going to be up in the majors unless there's an injury. So no, no chance Kinsler or anyone else gets traded because of this guy.  This is a really good question. The answer is I don't know. I'm curious about this as well. Avila's dad is the assistant GM. That makes me think he'll still be here next year, but it's hard to tell. McCann has been fantastic, and he's been called the catcher of the future. If they re-sign Avila, McCann will be on the bench for most of the games and that's not good for his development.  Not likely at all. Unless we go on a disastrous 0-15 run before the deadline, I think we're in it to win it. That means no one will be getting traded. Soria is a free agent after the season, and will cost ~$10 million, but Rondon is still controllable through 2020 with arbitration in 2017 so he will be on the team for a long time. He is still getting paid the minimum MLB salary. No reason to get traded.    If you have any more questions, just ask."
motorcitykitties,3ceggp,wishesgrantd,2,Tue Jul 7 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. One more thing:  From what I've read, this sub seems to be sure that either Price, Sanchez or Simon will be traded, but everybody seems to think that Price will have to go.   Why does everyone think that Price will have to go, is it because by the time he reaches free agency, he'll be too expensive? And if he is traded, won't this mean that Detroit has to sign another top-notch starter to provide consistency for the team?"
motorcitykitties,3ceggp,wishesgrantd,3,Tue Jul 7 14:13:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone will be traded. Our current standings put us in a strange position. We're not far enough out of the playoffs to sell our pieces, but we still won't make the playoffs. This team is expected to make the playoffs and the team would face backlash from the fans and lose ticket sales if they become sellers.   Price is going to be expensive in free agency, Tigers most likely won't re-sign him. It would be smart to trade him, but like I said about the fan backlash, it won't happen. Ideally, the Tigers sign a big free agent pitcher, but I don't think this team is going to contend, so it would be a waste if they did sign one."
motorcitykitties,3ceggp,dbenoos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"In response to the Avila question, he hits FA for the first time after this season. Which makes this even more interesting. I think Avila is worth more on the open market (maybe 3 years/$25-30M) than he is to us, since we have McCann and Holaday. Personally I'd prefer to let Avila walk after this year, but due to his dad and being one of our longer tenured players, I could see extending him and possibly using McCann as a trade chip at the deadline or over the winter.  Any thoughts on this? I'm wondering what/who we might be able to get for a trade package centered around McCann."
motorcitykitties,3ceggp,wishesgrantd,2,Tue Jul 7 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I do think Avila could fetch the money you're suggesting. $8 million annually is my guess, but could go to the $10 million you said if there are a lot of interested parties. It's also hard to project his cost because of his history of concussions. I would also rather him walk than keep him, but you're correct about his father and being a long tenured Tiger. If we do re-sign him it will be after the season, so McCann wouldn't be traded at the deadline this year.   I don't like the idea of trading McCann. His value is unknown. He was never a top 100 prospect. He would only have one season under his belt, and maybe only played in 90-100 games. It's much harder to trade young guys without established track records. It would be tough to move him for anything more than a backup player or a bullpen arm and if you want more than that, you would have to center the trade around another player and have McCann as a supporting piece. He's worth more to us playing than as a trade chip."
motorcitykitties,3ceggp,uclabucsfan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"I would be pretty upset if we got rid of McCann honestly, I really enjoy watching him play so I hope that doesn't happen. I'd much rather let Avila go."

motorcitykitties,3cc8ak,twenty0ne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"How far away are they from a wild card spot? Because that's all it takes. It's not about building a ""World Series"" team, it's about building a team that can find its way in the playoffs and then get hot."

motorcitykitties,3cc8ak,GraemeTaylor,3,Mon Jul 6 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"Why?  This team only has 6 players left over from the '12 World Series team. In other words, DD has rebuilt the roster in two years and has kept it competitive. They have a very solid core of position players going forward in JD Martinez, Iglesias, McCann, Castellanos, and Cabrera.  VMart is good when he's healthy. Gose is a fine platoon player that still could develop at the plate more.   The big issue is the pitching. A lot depends on Verlander, how Greene develops, and if they can get one more in house guy to perform.  But you know DD will/can trade for or buy at least one or two more arms in the next off season.    I just don't see how a couple of expensive contracts kills the franchise when so many good pieces are young and cost controlled going forward. The only way the next few years will be difficult is if ownership stops spending."

motorcitykitties,3cc8ak,GraemeTaylor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Yep. We are basically in limbo and can't make a decision until the days leading to and the day of the deadline.

motorcitykitties,3caui5,el47000,8,Mon Jul 6 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it clears things up. Unless we see a resurgence very soon, the Tigers take this opportunity to sell off some parts and build for the future. Price, Soria, Cespedes and maybe Sanchez could all grab some decent prospects that we can build around/use as trade chips down the line."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,Dwychwder,8,Mon Jul 6 14:34:05 2015 UTC,Price and Cespedes are not going to get you as much as you think for a 2-3 month rental.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,FakeyFaked,9,Mon Jul 6 15:21:29 2015 UTC,They'll get you more than they would if you keep them through the season and let them walk in free agency.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Mon Jul 6 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"This. I don't think they let Sanchez go though. Price, Soria, Cespedes, Avila, Simon and R. Davis all need to be dealt for prospects/youth. They are all on their last year and we aren't going anywhere anytime soon.  If they can deal most of these guys. We could have a healthy group of prospects and 50+ million to spend this off-season.  Payroll"
motorcitykitties,3caui5,KAW42089,3,Mon Jul 6 14:57:15 2015 UTC,Sanchez's contract is not at all problematic. That makes him attractive as a trade commodity and also makes it easy to hold onto him if the right deal isn't there. I'm for selling. Price will be a rental but that still will be valuable. Same for Cespedes. Simon might be packaged with any one of them. The best return might come from Soria. Bullpen help is always in high demand and short supply at the deadline. Avila and Davis are replacement level players who could be added to a package.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,eye_patch_willy,4,Mon Jul 6 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"1 1/2 games out of the wild card and selling?  That's counterintuitive.    This is the worst possible time to sell.  Selling now begins a 4-5 year rebuilding process.  At the end of that, Illitch will probably be dead and there's a strong chance that the new owners won't open their wallets like the Pizza King did.    You don't sell when you're 1 1/2 games out of the playoffs at the midpoint of the season."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,FakeyFaked,5,Mon Jul 6 15:24:11 2015 UTC,How would selling impending free agents begin a multi-year rebuild? It isn't going to affect us more negatively than them leaving in the offseason.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,ShakeItTilItPees,-2,Mon Jul 6 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"Because selling isn't just getting rid of FA.  Legit selling is selling, which means Kinsler, Castellanos, and people with more value.  Halfway selling gets you halfway returns.  Better to make the postseason this year than to hope you got the right pieces for next year by making a limited attempt."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,FakeyFaked,3,Mon Jul 6 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"Nobody is saying sell players that we want to build around.  We can sell players who most likely will not be back with the club anyway (Price, Cespedes, Soria) and get something form them instead of going for it this year and (most likely) not winning the WS and then losing them for nothing."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,carpe228,2,Mon Jul 6 18:37:23 2015 UTC,I think that depends if you're trying to make the playoffs now or win a World Series a few years down the line. Taking a step back and selling off some assets would be a great idea if you don't think this team can compete for a World Series this year. And I don't think anyone really does.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,Dwychwder,2,Mon Jul 6 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"I agree selling now isn't smart, but this could legitimately be a 1 year re-build.  Say we fall far out in the next couple weeks, we can sell Soria/Cespedes/Price for some SP prospects and then go into this absolutely LOADED FA, sign a pitcher and an OF to replace Price and Cespy and come back next year potentially better"
motorcitykitties,3caui5,irlkg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:37:13 2015 UTC,Boston did it.
motorcitykitties,3caui5,DDCDT123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. While I can definitely see the merits of selling some pieces like Cespedes and Price to a contender, I would advocate waiting until the deadline to see what kind of position we are in, and what kind of return we could get. Unless the Mets offer Harvey or the Cubs offer Schwarber, I wouldn't pull the trigger until the deadline."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,qwerty-snowman,4,Mon Jul 6 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"Tigers were never going to trade Cespedes if they are going for it this year. You don't often trade key pieces with other teams, you give away prospects for guys who teams are trying to get rid of.   As far as the question of whether they are sellers or buyers this year, it all depends on the next few weeks. If they hang tough, remain close to one of the wild card spots, they're going to be buyers and hope Cabrera comes back and it all comes together.  No reason to be sellers if there's any chance of grabbing a playoff spot.   However, if they tank the next few weeks they may have no choice to pack it in.  They'd probably shop Price, Cespedes, Soria, and Simon.  The return on those guys won't be near what fans want it to be, but that's the reality of trading a rental.    What fans don't realize is the Tigers are never going to go in full on rebuild mode as long as the payroll remains high and DD is there.  DD has rebuilt the team over time like three times all while keeping them competitive. There's like only 6 players on the current roster from the '12 World Series team.  Right under our noses DD has a new core of cost controlled young guys who are either already good or have good potential in McCann, Iglesias, Gose, JD Martinez, and Castellanos.  Add in Cabrera and VMart with their contracts and the position players on this team are good and set up for another 3+ years.  The pitching will have to be figured out, but I bet that's one free agent signing, one trade, and one minor league guy panning out from being completely re-tooled as well. Their bullpen strategy will remain the same by trying to get their young and cheap guys to pan out and buying the free agent from time to time.    There is no big rebuild coming. Cabrera will remain one of the best hitters in the league for 3+ years, and DD has a very solid core of guys to surround him.  The Tigers may sell this year if things go down, but they're going to be all in again for '16 no matter what happens."

Sitting 1 game above .500 with an injured Cabrera at the just before the All Star break puts the post season almost completely out of touch.  We need to sell off the pieces, get some cash, and start over from the ground up."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,kay_bizzle,6,Mon Jul 6 14:45:49 2015 UTC,"There will be something around 45 games left to play when Miggy returns.  Unless the Tigers completely fall off the cliff, they'll still be well within striking distance of a playoff spot when he returns."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,jz68,3,Mon Jul 6 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"We are 1.5 games out of the wild card. If we stay afloat through July, there is no reason to sell."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,honar,4,Mon Jul 6 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the Royals don't have Cabrera, either. This lineup is potent enough to score, they just haven't been doing it for whatever reason. Just because they haven't been scoring doesn't mean they can't or won't.  Maybe losing Miggy will be the shot to the arm the offense needs to start scoring like they should be."

That is not true. Obviously, it's not a great situation to be in, but it's not exactly an awful one, either.  EDIT: Did you guys fucking forget about teams that in the last few years have faced MUCH worse odds and still managed to make the postseason? The addition of the second Wild Card has totally changed things. The Cardinals won the World Series and were 1.5 games back on the Brewers with an injured Pujols at almost this exact same time in 2011. And, not only that, things got a lot worse for them before they got better."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,FakePlasticAlex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Even if we somehow make it to the postseason(1.5 out of the wildcard), this team is not making a World Series run.

motorcitykitties,3caui5,deandiggity,0,Mon Jul 6 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"I do NOT like the idea of the Tigers selling at the deadline. The window isn't shut yet, in fact, this is probably the last year it will be open. Get the pitching under control and make a run. If it doesn't work, then we can sell and try again.  But I want to keep trying as long as Ilitch is around, because we will probably never have a better owner. I'm serious, and it will hobble the Tigers."
motorcitykitties,3caui5,GraemeTaylor,2,Mon Jul 6 18:51:06 2015 UTC,Why don't we sell this year (but not everything) and then build for next year if come the deadline it's not looking good.

motorcitykitties,3c72wd,MLBVideoConverterBot,4,Sun Jul 5 14:15:18 2015 UTC,Great catch. Does it annoy anyone else that a fan had his glove in the vicinity to try and catch it? Why not just get out of the way? You can clearly see Avila has a play on the ball.
motorcitykitties,3c72wd,Faaip_de_Oiad,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:35:50 2015 UTC,You can see that. The fan has his eye in the sky on the ball.  You would've done the same thing.
motorcitykitties,3c72wd,Kicker774,3,Sun Jul 5 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"Fans are dumb, look at the lady going full fetal position lol."
motorcitykitties,3c8re6,bagano1,6,Sun Jul 5 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Usually nothing during regular season.  During playoffs it ranges from $20-40.  They sometimes require you to show your players card (if you spend enough $$$, they will let you park for free, during the World Series, if you didn't spend $500 in the last 30 days, they won't let you even park even with a card)"
motorcitykitties,3c8re6,emtcj,3,Mon Jul 6 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"As previously mentioned, for big games (opening day/playoffs), you'll have to pay. But every regular season game parking is free.  On the other hand, MGM is always free. While Greektown was charging $40 to park on opening day, MGM was free. Lions Monday night opener, same thing. Greektown even charges for Lions regular season games ($30-40) and not a dime at MGM."
motorcitykitties,3c8re6,jBURRd,2,Mon Jul 6 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks to everyone for your helpful answers!  If you don't mind me asking then, how early do you have to get to Lions games to score an MGM spot then? Is it hard to find a spot there?"
motorcitykitties,3c8re6,jBURRd,2,Mon Jul 6 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"It's usually not too hard to find one. It almost seems as if not many people know about their parking. We arrived at the parking garage around 11:45-Noon and found one pretty quickly. It's maybe a 10 minute walk, but you can always hail an Uber if it's cold/rainy/snowy.   I usually go to about 15 tigers games (including opening day/playoffs), 5-10 wings games and at least one Lions game each season. I can't remember the last time I've paid for parking. Casinos FTW"
motorcitykitties,3c8re6,Moldeyawsome12,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Most regular season games are free. I remember having to pay for a weekend game last year, but I'm not sure if they're still doing that"

motorcitykitties,3c8re6,larrykins,2,Mon Jul 6 00:37:59 2015 UTC,There are lots that are closer to the park then greektown for $5-10. I have never had issues parking in them.

motorcitykitties,3c8re6,FakePlasticAlex,2,Mon Jul 6 16:51:34 2015 UTC,Important thing to keep in mind about Greektown parking being free: that only applies to the one right off of 375. The Greektown structure at Lafayette and Brush charges a pretty ridiculous amount.

The Jays are also a tough team. Overall, I'm not mad. 6/10.  Side note, he's be far my favorite player. He broke into the league when I was very young, so I was able to use him as a role model in little league and shit. I remember the newspaper comeing by to do a segment on the All-Stars in the town and everyone said Maggs or Cabrera were their favorite and I was the only one to say JV :("

motorcitykitties,3c8a45,MrGoodHabbits,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:01:37 2015 UTC,I am not feeling all that badly about him. i think he shows some promise. But time is running short this season.
motorcitykitties,3c8a45,fantasyfest,3,Mon Jul 6 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"They are at the halfway point and I feel so torn as a big Tiger fan. I look at this season and see the Tigers just treading water, but they just can't see to make ground on MIN and KC. I think I really hope things become pretty obvious in the next two weeks, as either being buyers or sellers.  The worst situation would be holding pat, or buying, and then the season continues as it did for the first half. The Tigers have a lot of players entering free agency after this season, and the farm system is depleted. I really feel Price is going to sign elsewhere - he wants to play on a winning team and he isn't getting that this season. Avila will be gone with the emergence of McCann. Cespedes will be gone too I think because there is Moya and Collins waiting - and he will be expensive.  I just don't want to see what little farm system the Tigers have, get traded away to get yet another part-season loaner.  I know Illitch is getting old and Miggy, Victor, and JV are running low on time - but I'm not feeling this season as being ""the one"". I think I would like to see DaveD have a quick trigger, should another slide happen, and trade for next year. That way they can start building up that team cohesiveness this season for next. That way Miggy doesn't have to rush back and can heal well. That way JV can treat this season as a rehab season and build up control and finesse. Maybe even get a good draft pick.  It sucks to watch the second half of a season on a team that sold, but, it would be great to build hope for next year and try to avoid a treading-water team for a few seasons to come.  Of course, if they could play the last half of the season as they did the first third...well :)  For what it is worth, I want to be eating these words come end of season."

It's absurd to think that the only reason he's on the team or would still be here is because of his dad, but I have to believe that it does play at least a small part in both sides wanting to keep things as they are."

motorcitykitties,3c73gm,ZombieHitchens2012,5,Sun Jul 5 18:36:00 2015 UTC,This game went downhill fast and hard.
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,LadsActionNewsSteen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"Whats the thinking behind playing the infield back with 2nd & 3rd and no out, but the infield in with 3rd and 1 out?"
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,dirty_drunk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"The cost of the infield in is much higher with runners on 2nd & 3rd with 0 out.  First, because there's a runner on 2nd it becomes more costly to allow a single so that makes it more dangerous to bring the infield in, as the infield in allows more singles.  Second, because there's 0 outs that means you'll need to keep the infield in twice if you want to prevent that run from scoring. This just increases the risk of more singles.  Compared to a runner on 3rd with 1 out where the benefit of holding the runner is greater (this out is his last chance to score on a grounder so let's make sure he doesn't) and the cost of allowing a single is less (there's no other runner on who would score and the batter-runner is less likely to eventually score when there's 1 out compared to when theres' no outs).  Also maybe there was a matchup thing... e.g. this guy usually hits soft grounders down the line."
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me.  Infield in makes base hits more likely (easier to get a grounder past the infield), but allows outs at the plate on grounders.  With runners on both 2nd and 3rd, a hit often scores two, so you play to limit hits.  Statistically the runner on 3rd will score roughly 83.7% of the time anyways."

motorcitykitties,3c73gm,fantasyfest,2,Sun Jul 5 18:21:06 2015 UTC,McCann is a catcher. He knows to backup and when he does he usually jogs because his job is to be close enough to prevent the advance to 2nd.

motorcitykitties,3c73gm,purpleclouds,7,Sun Jul 5 17:40:43 2015 UTC,2 strikeouts and a 1-2-3 inning? More of that JV.

motorcitykitties,3c73gm,MShasta,2,Sun Jul 5 17:35:34 2015 UTC,If he can keep them off their toes for a couple more innings then do some classic JV and rev it up to 98 or maybe 97... Ooo baby. One can only hope
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,WheresCarlisle,3,Sun Jul 5 17:40:56 2015 UTC,Very superstitious poppin up the ball
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,rbur70x7,10,Sun Jul 5 17:42:46 2015 UTC,1 run allowed because the defense had a brain fart. Everyone needs to calm down. Save your pitchforks for an actual blown up inning.
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,MShasta,6,Sun Jul 5 17:24:16 2015 UTC,"How about now? Can we get the pitchforks now, he's done."
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,Mattrix013,3,Sun Jul 5 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"You can definitely whip them out, but he did have three innings where he flashed some stuff I'm very excited about. I think he will end the season on a high note."
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,MShasta,3,Sun Jul 5 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"It's been tough to get excited about a Verlander start since before last season, maybe they can put him in the bullpen, he'd fit right in. Good thing he isn't get that much to suck, oh wait....."
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,Mattrix013,3,Sun Jul 5 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Glad to see someone knows. Holy shit, people are idiots. Sloppy throw to 2nd that otherwise would have got the runner. Thus, no run.  Learn your shit people"
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,WheresCarlisle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:47:54 2015 UTC,I just tuned in. Did they misplay the Reyes double or the Donaldson single?
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,honar,2,Sun Jul 5 17:22:11 2015 UTC,Both. Donaldson single was a bad pick off attempt and Reyes 2B was a sloppy throw from Iglesias

motorcitykitties,3c73gm,Sniper_Brosef,9,Sun Jul 5 16:37:10 2015 UTC,All star break is going to eat up about a weeks worth of miggy's recovery.  That's a good thing.  Really makes it closer to a month that he's going to miss and that's it.  we'll have him right in time for that push for September.  Just have to stay close to KC.
motorcitykitties,3c73gm,purpleclouds,3,Sun Jul 5 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"EAT EM UP TIGERS, EAT EM UP!"
motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,doc_oct,7,Sun Jul 5 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"So, I can't help but worry about our starting pitching... that's not new but what can we do about it?  Price is great.  Maybe Sanchez is getting it back together.  Most others are performing about to expectation with the glaring issue that Verlander is burning a huge hole in the Tigers' wallets without giving a proportional performance.  And that's not new.  (I won't go on about Scherzer.)     He's got an ace mentality and confidence which is great in a way, but I wonder if it's also blinding him to changes in his style he might make that could help him improve now that his stuff isn't quite as powerful as it used to be.     What if he never gets it together and continues to just cost the heck out of this team moneywise?    TLDR: Verlander's getting paid like the dude and isn't performing like it the last 2 years.  In the context of generally insufficient starting pitching, what can be done?"
motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,BackFatGary,7,Sun Jul 5 12:21:01 2015 UTC,By the way is it total blasphemy to hope the Tigers can somehow dump him if he doesn't come around soon?  I love the guy for what he's done but he's killing our flexibility.
motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,allyallmfersneed___,9,Sun Jul 5 12:22:24 2015 UTC,"No, it's not blasphemy. I'd love for him to turn it around, but there's very little evidence power pitchers his age all of a sudden being good again.   I have no idea how they'd get rid of him though. No one would pay him that kind of money to be a 4/5 starter. Not even Ruben Amaro."
motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Sun Jul 5 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. For everyone thinking that he's going to make some great turn around, he's following the exact trajectory of decline that pitchers do.    I remember reading an article awhile back interviewing both Max and VM and talking about how much time Max spends studying hitters and VM laughed it off saying he just blows it by them. Those days are gone..."
motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,fantasyfest,3,Sun Jul 5 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"very little evidence power pitchers his age all of a sudden being good again.   I mean, it happens. Like everything baseball it requires adjustment is all."

motorcitykitties,3c6v8d,GraemeTaylor,2,Mon Jul 6 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"He has a no trade clause, so it seems unlikely. He's been dealing with an ab issue for two years and finally got the surgery for it this season. Lets give him till the end of the year to make a final judgment. Remember now, he hasn't pitched in a few months. He's gonna need time to get it back together, if the ab issue was as bad as it appeared to make him in previous years"

motorcitykitties,3c4vd9,purpleclouds,7,Sun Jul 5 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"The reason I say this (and might think otherwise in another scenario) is because Kinsler went up to the mound when Farnsworth gave up the homer and helped him laugh it off.

motorcitykitties,3c4vd9,bronwynsings,2,Sun Jul 5 03:12:32 2015 UTC,It was just so weird that Ian went from helping out Ferrell to whatever that was with Iggy so fast.

motorcitykitties,3c4vd9,twenty0ne,2,Sun Jul 5 07:26:03 2015 UTC,No way. Iggy looked completely startled that Ian reacted how he did - he physically recoiled.

motorcitykitties,3c4vd9,flickbean,2,Sat Jul 4 20:33:51 2015 UTC,I don't remember the inning (6 or 7) but Cespedes and Kinsler were on base as V-Mart grounded out to end the inning and Yo tossed his helmet from 2nd towards the dugout and Kinsler didn't seem to appreciate him treating his helmet this way and said a few words along with a stare down.   I kept an eye on them and Ian said something to Yo as the game ended as well. Maybe he'sjust the angry old guy on the team.
motorcitykitties,3c4vd9,purpleclouds,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:09:30 2015 UTC,"Wow... I really don't like this. I love Ian, but if he is causing a problem in the locker room, this could be an issue."

We have the lineup that can still produce runs, and our SP is not awful. And we're a whole 1 game out of the wild card. If Miggy can come back late in the season, it doesn't matter how we get the postseason, as long as we get there. Of course we could crash and burn, but we could just as easily stay afloat and make the playoffs."

That said, improvement could happen from a few of our current guys, and if we stay in striking distance of the wild card adding a legit starter (doesn't have to be an Ace, just a good pitcher) at the deadline would be a good thing to do.  We're not out of it yet."

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Rbaner,3,Sat Jul 4 20:09:38 2015 UTC,I THINK WE DRAFTED HIM!
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Redemption_Unleashed,3,Sat Jul 4 20:12:30 2015 UTC,LET'S GO FARRELL'S DEBUT!
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,FakeyFaked,2,Sat Jul 4 20:13:55 2015 UTC,Anybody else think it would be better to have McCann play first and have Avila catch? I think Avila would be more likely to call a better game than McCann would and it can't be too difficult for McCann to learn how to play first.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Insirium,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:26 2015 UTC,Avila takes a serious beating at catcher. He just stops pitches with his face and picks them up and throws them back. He was eventually moving to first. So this gives him a jump start.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,fantasyfest,2,Sat Jul 4 20:09:05 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they want Avila to play first more often just avoid more wear and tear on his body. But I do prefer Avila behind the plate at this moment. McCann is doing well to convince me otherwise though.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,honar,2,Sat Jul 4 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"Yes absolutely, McCann is definitely holding his own. I'm happy either way really they are both great catchers"
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Insirium,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:35:23 2015 UTC,Yes.

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,threemadness,3,Sat Jul 4 20:05:15 2015 UTC,Nice catch! HAHA
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,cliffhanger1983,4,Sat Jul 4 20:01:18 2015 UTC,Yeah ye. 6-1. Passed ball. Wild pitch? WHO CARES!

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Redemption_Unleashed,3,Sat Jul 4 19:57:55 2015 UTC,I guess Wilson just attracts pitches?

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,el_gumbo,2,Sat Jul 4 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"Price hasn't seemed to be as dominant lately. I get the results, but 7 hits over 6 innings is usually going to let up more than 1 run...."
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,TheBulgarSlayer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:54:56 2015 UTC,The Jays have a really good offense.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Rbaner,7,Sat Jul 4 19:31:33 2015 UTC,7 hits over 6 innings is not usually going to give up more than one run. I'm not sure what is making you think that.  Even the greatest pitchers have a whip right around one. Price for this game has 1.17 That's damn good.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,flory1aw,4,Sat Jul 4 19:24:59 2015 UTC,He's 7th in the AL in WHIP. You're almost always going to have a WHIP of at least 1.

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,ZombieHitchens2012,5,Sat Jul 4 18:38:00 2015 UTC,I would think any pitcher's version of hell would be an eternity of pitching to Victor Martinez.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,gotsnow,3,Sat Jul 4 18:41:53 2015 UTC,I'm no professional pitcher but the thought of that scares me very much.
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Redemption_Unleashed,3,Sat Jul 4 18:53:01 2015 UTC,I can't imagine the frustration. 10 fouls followed by a screamer into the corner.

motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,MrRunnerDude,6,Sat Jul 4 18:27:15 2015 UTC,What a fucking catch!  Those people probably thought they were going to catch a foul ball and instead they caught a player
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,gotsnow,3,Sat Jul 4 18:22:02 2015 UTC,Unfortunately they don't get to keep him as a souvenir
motorcitykitties,3c3s0q,Robot_Satan,3,Sat Jul 4 18:31:50 2015 UTC,But does it say that on the ticket? I'm pretty sure it's fair game if it leaves the field of play.

motorcitykitties,3c3obn,sniffles11,5,Sat Jul 4 15:41:10 2015 UTC,This could be something that lights a fire under everyone's ass...no one will expect them to do much now...and they would probably want to prove that there is more to this team than Miggy.
motorcitykitties,3c3obn,Krunklock,4,Sat Jul 4 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"Which is great motivation and all, but he really was our best player... At some point talent matters, and we were a .500 team with the best hitter in baseball. Without him now? Gah..."

On a side note, I don't know why they didn't pull Sanchez after the first or second hit. It was pretty clear at that point the Jays had gotten on his timing."

motorcitykitties,3c29yz,ParisPaul,2,Sat Jul 4 12:44:18 2015 UTC,Yeah he stepped off just a hair and Donaldson kept the tag on.  It was really hard to see - I was watching the jays broadcast and they didn't show an appropriate replay angle until the next inning.

He's owed $4.13M this year, and has only one year of control left via arb. When he's not been on the DL this year, he's been shaky at best, so he'll be a project, even though his velocity has come back quite a bit.   Either the Rangers think they can't get anything for him on the market, or they think he'll pass through waivers. Otherwise they wouldn't just give him up, unless he was of no value.  Edit: According to this site, it sounds like he will be traded."

The last thing we need is another situation like last year when he clearly still needed to recover. I guess it's a good thing we can ease him back into the lineup by DH-ing him before trying him in the field. Get well soon Miggy.

motorcitykitties,3bzzet,MiggyTripleCrown,8,Fri Jul 3 15:03:39 2015 UTC,We should trade Fister for a couple of guys who aren't on the roster a few months later.   Oh....wait.
motorcitykitties,3bzzet,pmWolf,0,Fri Jul 3 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Even worse, we did that in the off season"
motorcitykitties,3bzzet,themountiansecho,5,Fri Jul 3 18:45:24 2015 UTC,I'd be absolutely shocked if we were sellers.  My guess is we somehow pick up another starter and make another push.  Mr. I isn't letting the pedal off of the gas.
motorcitykitties,3bzzet,jayesanctus,6,Fri Jul 3 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"We might know more in the next couple weeks now that JV, Victor, and Rondon are back. That's a significant part of the team that's been missing most of the year. It's hard for me to believe that the Tigers are going to have a fire sale especially during the season. My guess is that we'll stick with the majority of the roster with some minor tweaks."
motorcitykitties,3bzzet,MrRunnerDude,5,Fri Jul 3 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"I think, now that Verlander and V-Mart are back, Dombrowski is going to let our sample size with them get a couple weeks longer before he makes his decision.   If he decides to buy then we will clearly need a starter, but we aren't in a position where we can afford another rental and I don't know if we have the pieces for a reliable, more cost-controlled arm.  There's a good chance we would have to give up a young Major Leaguer it we want the type of arm that will not only make us competitive this year, but not leave us in the offseason with less than we came in with. That's a sticky situation which leads me to say we should be sellers. If we go on a run between now and the deadline then that might change.   I should also add that fire sales just aren't what Dombrowski does, and regardless of what happens this season he may be content to just stand pat, take a couple draft picks this offseason from Price and Cespedes, make a salary move or two and fill holes with the deep free agent class. That seems more likely to me than the Tigers being sellers. I still would like to see us get more for the future if this season ends up tanking on us, though."
motorcitykitties,3bzzet,ShakeItTilItPees,3,Fri Jul 3 15:32:00 2015 UTC,Cespedes doesnt get us draft picks I think. Its in his contract.

motorcitykitties,3bzzet,ShakeItTilItPees,3,Fri Jul 3 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"A cheap number 3 starter that can go deep into games like a Mark Buehrle type would be nice.  A softer throwing pitcher that will keep the ball in the park and allow the tigers offense to win the game.  I think it is a bad year for pitchers at the trade deadline.  So many pitching free agents this off season.  So I believe we should stay away form SPs.  I would prefer to see a bullpen arm like Boxberger.  I like Will Harris in Houston as well, but I don't think they will trade him.   Looking at the numbers it seems one of the biggest weaknesses this team has is hitting runs in.  Last week we were 21st in the MLB at RBIs and 1st in Team Batting average and OBP.  It will get better now that V-Mart is doing his thing (RBI Ranking now is 12th), but a player like Zobrist would help a lot and add to the much needed depth this team needs.  He is a well rounded player that can be plugged anywhere in the line up and hit for power and contact and play both infield (3B, 2B, SS) and outfield.  Castellanos would be a good trading piece for he rebuilding A's.  The Tigers rein of the central is closing fast and at this point offense and luck are needed to win the prize.  This is if we are buyers.  I think the Tigers should start rebuilding and be proud of the accomplishments.  We should sell the pitching such as Price and obtain bats that are more likely to be reliable in the near future do to the huge number of available pitchers this offseason."

motorcitykitties,3c11fy,MiggyTripleCrown,5,Fri Jul 3 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"While it is a possibility, I think he's more valuable in the bullpen.

motorcitykitties,3c11fy,wishesgrantd,2,Fri Jul 3 20:02:01 2015 UTC,"I also like him in the bullpen, but I feel like that's been a fairly strong point this year. My hope is that Rondon can shape up, and take over that 8th inning/high pressure role.   My opinion is that giving him a shot at a couple starts may be most valuable to the team, but I do agree that if he remains in the pen, high pressure situations should be his, he's earned it."
motorcitykitties,3c11fy,wishesgrantd,2,Fri Jul 3 20:08:24 2015 UTC,You also need to stretch him out. It's hard to do mid-season without sending him down to the minors. He's not used to throwing 100 pitches.
motorcitykitties,3c11fy,Rbaner,6,Fri Jul 3 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"It's not a move you would want to make in the middle of the season. The 50+ pitches he threw against the Pirates were a career high. I think he could work towards becoming a starter, but that would have to happen during the offseason."
motorcitykitties,3c11fy,ShakeItTilItPees,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"This is a good point that I definitely overlooked. He'd probably need to start a AAA game, and then be limited to 5 innings in his first few MLB games. Already on a short clock, that might hurt the sample size. Thanks for bringing that to light."
motorcitykitties,3c11fy,FakeyFaked,2,Fri Jul 3 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"It isn't a bad idea, but there are a couple problems with it at this point in the season.   One, he's been effective in both long relief and late relief. That's a lot of value added to a bullpen. I don't know who would replace it, and acquiring a reliable reliever this year isn't going to be all that much cheaper than a 3-4 starter. Simon could be effective, but that's making two question marks (Wilson in the rotation, Simon in the bullpen) out of one (Simon in the rotation).   Two, if we're doing this with the intention of avoiding a deadline move, we'll be left with a large degree of uncertainly after the deadline passes. Pitchers' performances after moving into a new role can be very deceptive. It would basically be an experiment with only a few weeks worth of sample size to draw a conclusion from when the deadline comes, and if he falters after that then we're left without a backup plan. We would have to be very lucky to have a guy who hasn't started a game since AA come in and add significant value to the rotation for the rest of the season. He might do it, sure, but he also might get exposed by scouting reports or hitters seeing him multiple times in a game, which they haven't done at all this year. He might not be able to adapt to a higher pitch count, putting more strain on the bullpen in the long run. There's typically a longer conversation process and most pitchers don't do well without it.   The problem we currently have is that we're in a position where we either need an obvious improvement at the deadline or we need to give up and be sellers. Wilson is an in-between option and that potentially puts us at huge risk."

We used to have great starters who could mitigate how bad the bullpen was. Now we don't have a real 5th starter, Simon is probably regressing to his norm, and Verlander either needs more time or is past his prime. Sanchez is improving but is still clearly pitching far from his best. Price is our only shining light right now. I don't blame the batters when we are consistently down by 2, 3, or 4 runs by the second inning. Night after night they are not being put in a position to win.

I've always loved the Tigers, and always followed them, but I've never followed them closer than this season. It's such a roller coaster, to think that just a few days ago I was praying we'd win so we could be 40 - 36. Now we're headed for 39 - 39. Of all seasons for me to start following at my most intense, it sucks it has to be the one where everything came apart :/  Oh well, let's win tomorrow and stay above .500!"

I was rewarded in 2006 and 2012! I'll still follow them just as closely.  It's just disappointing because I wish I had been this invested for the four years of winning the division. Sure, I watched and followed (especially Cabrera during 2012/2013 when he was having his best) and watched the playoffs, but not on the level I follow them now. I guess it's just too bad that I couldn't come around just a bit earlier.  Oh well, even if the team is struggling, I'm such a Cabrera lover that I can derive joy just from him. :)"

motorcitykitties,3btptz,Outofthewild,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:04:24 2015 UTC,I agree. We knew it was an experiment. He was either going to perform or he wasn't. At this point in the season we can't afford to have him cost us any more games. It's time to pull the plug.
motorcitykitties,3btptz,Decapitat3d,0,Thu Jul 2 18:31:37 2015 UTC,I just think Ausmus makes too many pitching changes too early. Albuquerque could have played at least a few more outs before being pulled.
motorcitykitties,3btptz,honar,9,Thu Jul 2 02:02:42 2015 UTC,AlAl had already thrown 26 pitches and threw 23 pitches the day before. Seems like the right time to remove him.
motorcitykitties,3btptz,MrGoodHabbits,-3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:22 2015 UTC,100% agreed. I hate it when he does that
motorcitykitties,3btptz,Evref,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"Some reason this team hates paying someone, then cutting their losses.  Even with relative peanuts like they're giving Joba."
motorcitykitties,3btptz,purpleclouds,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:25:46 2015 UTC,Really? Do you remember Prince Fielder at all?
motorcitykitties,3btptz,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,0,Thu Jul 2 22:15:24 2015 UTC,God everyone thought this guy was going to be huge. The Yankees really screwed him up
motorcitykitties,3btptz,belinck,2,Thu Jul 2 13:15:58 2015 UTC,Or maybe he was just way over hyped?
motorcitykitties,3btptz,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:26:49 2015 UTC,Could be but I don't think Joba rules helped
motorcitykitties,3btptz,belinck,3,Thu Jul 2 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, but that was almost 10 years ago!  If he was really as good as he was hyped, you would think he would have put it together by now."
motorcitykitties,3btptz,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Shit that was 10 years ago? Wow
motorcitykitties,3btptz,belinck,3,Thu Jul 2 15:19:33 2015 UTC,Almost!  I believe he started coming up in '06 or '07...
motorcitykitties,3btptz,SpartanLB50,2,Thu Jul 2 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think I remember that he started out as a starter and got moved to the bullpen (like Joel Zoom-Zoom?) and it was about the same time."
motorcitykitties,3btptz,belinck,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"He was a starter in the minors, and projected to be one when he came up, but Yanks needed bullpen help in front of Mo in 06 or 07 (can't remember which) and so they pulled him into that role.  He was pretty good there for a bit as mainly a fireballer.  Then the next season, they tried to get him to start and the wheels just fell off the bus.  I think there was TJ in there and then he broke his leg on his kids' trampoline and he never made it back to the rotation."

motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,Decapitat3d,10,Thu Jul 2 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, I can see an argument for Cespedes being overrated, but he's definitely a good player."

motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,Rbaner,0,Thu Jul 2 00:31:14 2015 UTC,I was just going to say this. I thought he was overrated.
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,14,Wed Jul 1 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"over rated by who? he was a solid 4th pitcher for years.  He may have gotten too big a contract, but he performed in Detroit."
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,fantasyfest,4,Wed Jul 1 23:48:15 2015 UTC,A lot of people said he was a potential ace but I never got that. He's was alright here but he I don't think he ever lived up to what people thought he would be
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,7,Wed Jul 1 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"I certainly think the consensus was that he is a really solid, middle-of-the-rotation guy that is gonna post a decent ERA and give you a chance to win on most nights. A few times a year he'll shut them down and a few times a year he'll get beat around. Not much more you can ask for from a 3rd or 4th starter. He did win 10+ games each year in Detroit IIRC."
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,ninjafbstalker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Because he was/is. With the tigers it was an issue with one or two ""porcello innings."" He'd go a solid 6-7 innings and give up 4 runs in one of them. He has the potential if he could figure out how to make the solid innings more often, and i still really think he will because he's so damn young. I think he has a ceiling of a #1-2 guy but he needs to fix his issues to become more consistent"
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,themountiansecho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:37:52 2015 UTC,I mean I thought he would be good too but this is his 7th year in the league. At what point does his potential become unrealized and his ceiling gets lowered
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"It took max until his age 28 season to go from ""meh"" to great. I think Ricks issue is that he was called up too early"
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,themountiansecho,-11,Thu Jul 2 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"LMAO! Remember when everyone was freaking out about Rick frickin Porcello, their ""future Cy Young contender""? Everyone saying ""All we got was overrated Yoenis? But his WAR is terrible!""  Meanwhile, if you ever watched a game of baseball, you would have seen that Cespedes was a premium talent, and Rick was an overachieving pitcher with his 90-MPH duckfarts. You can't have sustained greatness as a SP in the MLB today without being able to strike batters out. He never reached 1 K/IP. Not to mention that Hitters are almost always more valuable than pitchers.   But yeah, Dombrowski is an idiot right?"

motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,randyhutton,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"No he's not going to Cooperstown, but he's good. Your implication was that if you don't throw fireballs and strike out a ton of people you can't be good which is just not true. Not at all. There's plenty of pitchers in the MLB who pitch to contact and are successful and there's a ton who have a high K rate and are below average (Danny Salazar anyone?).   Edit: also, Dallas Keuchel has a K/9 of less than 7 and I don't think I need to tell you what kind of year he's having."
motorcitykitties,3bs3xi,iNeedScissorsSixty1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:36:51 2015 UTC,I said great. People were talking about Porcello like he was on the verge of contending for the Cy Young for the foreseeable future.  You can only get by on smoke and mirrors for so long.

Oh and if Ausmus ever uses Joba in high leverage situation on a team that has Rondon and Wilson and Al-Al and heck, even Hardy, as possible 8th inning guy, then I'm 100000000% fucking done with him.   I never want to see Joba in an important situation again unless we are up by 10. He is the new Phil Coke, and fucking I hope DD and co. realize this sooner rather than later."

motorcitykitties,3btw8r,fantasyfest,2,Thu Jul 2 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"Think we should move Simon to the pen. It's an area of need and he appears to be losing it as a starter.

Yes, the defense let him down at times last night, but he has been terrible for three starts now, and it happens to coincide with when he started pitching terribly last season as well.  If he could be a plus pitcher out of the pen, and we can get Greene back and somewhat serviceable, then I say move him.  Or if we can swing a trade for another starting pitcher."

It was gorgeous, with shopping on the lower level with offices and apartments up top. The best part? The development didn't actually go onto the site- on the interior of the building the original land was preserved, with a redeveloped diamond and seating for the police league thing they have planned now.  It was awesome, and by far the best development proposal I had seen for the site. Wish I had gotten pictures."

However, Ausmus confirmed surgery has not been considered.  ""From all the reports and MRIs, it doesn't look surgical at all,"" Ausmus said. ""That's not to say it's never happened where it doesn't look surgical and then they have to go in. I don't think that's even on the radar.""   Lobstein is currently receiving daily treatment in Lakeland, Fla. He received a cortisone shot June 13, but the soreness has not subsided, according to Ausmus.  ""He's still just getting treatment and doing rehab,"" Ausmus said. ""The cortisone shot was a while ago. But it obviously didn't knock it out."""

motorcitykitties,3bo6ht,HelpIThinkImASoup,2,Wed Jul 1 02:25:00 2015 UTC,Awesome! How's the quality of the print? Is it that thicker decal paint or more dyed into the fabric? Thinking about getting one but it's a bit steep for my college student budget so I want to make sure I'll really want to wear it.
motorcitykitties,3bo6ht,megamike888,2,Wed Jul 1 02:20:43 2015 UTC,Its a really nice shirt in my opinion. The print is great and the shirt fits well and is super soft.

motorcitykitties,3bo6ht,megamike888,2,Wed Jul 1 11:46:33 2015 UTC,It's actually better than I thought. It's not dyed into the fabric and the shirt is American Apparel brand so that may be the reason for the cost. If you need sizing go to the American Apparel site. I have the same student budget issue so I wanted to make sure it fit.

In fact, he was alright. Especially against the Bucks. I'm impressed but a little let down by 5 walks.   However, my opinion on cheese boy (Gorzelanny) are the same and that is FUCK GOREZELANNY and gorgonzola"
motorcitykitties,3bpw8x,WheresCarlisle,2,Wed Jul 1 08:26:34 2015 UTC,He had a bad first few innings. Somehow got out of an inning where he gave up a hit and 3 walks. After that he settled down.

motorcitykitties,3bpw8x,TheBulgarSlayer,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"Joba has given up 27 hits in 20.1 innings pitched. Gorzellany has given up 33 hits in 23.1 innings pitched. Combined record is 1-4, both with sub par ERA's. There is no way that we couldn't find somebody at least marginally better than either of these two."

motorcitykitties,3bo800,DetroitVPS,7,Wed Jul 1 01:58:10 2015 UTC,At what point do we question Ausmus' judgement in sticking Joba on the mound in high leverage situations? Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?

motorcitykitties,3bo800,LadsActionNewsSteen,5,Tue Jun 30 23:24:31 2015 UTC,Way to keep ol pitch count under 30 JV!

motorcitykitties,3bo800,Rbaner,5,Wed Jul 1 00:52:51 2015 UTC,Missed the replay. Was it definitely a HR if the fan doesn't touch it?
motorcitykitties,3bo800,Kodyak77,3,Wed Jul 1 00:56:31 2015 UTC,It was very barely bellow the line after the fan touched it.  Almost certainly a homer
motorcitykitties,3bo800,Robot_Satan,3,Wed Jul 1 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"So, what did ya'll think of JV performance tonight? Only caught a bit on the radio and now I'm watching. Sounded like he struggled a bit earlier but started to show some mojo?"
motorcitykitties,3bo800,AliceCoopersLiver,5,Wed Jul 1 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"Struggled with command in the beginning, but settled in after that."
motorcitykitties,3bo800,Rbaner,5,Wed Jul 1 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"I thought he did really good. You cant expext anybody to be perfect after the beginning of the season he has had  the first inning was rough, but he didnt let the rest of the game get away from him agter that. Im satisfied."
motorcitykitties,3bo800,purpleclouds,4,Wed Jul 1 01:23:13 2015 UTC,Definitely promising.  Struggled with control early but looked closer to what you'd expect of JV in the last 3 innings.  Not bad for 3rd start off the DL and after having back pain
motorcitykitties,3bo800,Robot_Satan,4,Wed Jul 1 01:27:45 2015 UTC,Man... That arm.

motorcitykitties,3bo800,Rbaner,5,Wed Jul 1 02:32:11 2015 UTC,There must be.  I guess you have to just stop watching whenever they are down from now on.

motorcitykitties,3bojx9,honar,3,Tue Jun 30 21:47:25 2015 UTC,I didnt realize he was team controlled. I just started thinking of it because of the fake trade rumors that came out for him.
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,WheresCarlisle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the cost, but my guess is he's wanting out of the O. Co fast. He has more potential elsewhere."

motorcitykitties,3bojx9,bkn6136,4,Wed Jul 1 18:45:55 2015 UTC,I don't think Nick has very much trade value right now.
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,jguacmann1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"I think teams could still be intrigued by his potential. His trade value is obviously at the lowest it's ever been, but he's been a proven hitter at every level so far and is still very young."
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,rbur70x7,4,Wed Jul 1 02:11:40 2015 UTC,Let's get Stanton too
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,rbur70x7,7,Wed Jul 1 05:03:53 2015 UTC,Castellanos for Kershaw?
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,kyle1913,2,Wed Jul 1 05:05:15 2015 UTC,A LOT. He's proved he can pitch at a high level and is under control for a long time. We would most likely have to give up Moya or Nick C. In the deal. Might need another team to do a 3 team trade because we don't have many good prospects
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,wishesgrantd,6,Wed Jul 1 00:54:07 2015 UTC,Moya or Nick? More like Moya and Nick and our next three best prospects.
motorcitykitties,3bojx9,bkn6136,5,Wed Jul 1 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the A's would care about either of those guys.  Nick hasn't proven he's a capable MLB 3rd baseman, and Moya has fallen off big time this year.  JD Martinez is the guy who would be coveted, and that's just the start."

motorcitykitties,3bn2vk,jokah,4,Tue Jun 30 17:26:12 2015 UTC,I considered Guillen but decided Inge would be a bigger upgrade for the current team. But I suppose Guillen or Iglesias could play 2B....
motorcitykitties,3bn2vk,qwerty-snowman,5,Tue Jun 30 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'd put Guillen at third over Castellanos or Inge, and keep Iglesias at short."
motorcitykitties,3bn2vk,Brady_Hokes_Headset,6,Tue Jun 30 19:54:22 2015 UTC,Even without the offensive side Inge's 3rd base defense would be an incredible upgrade over Castellanos.

motorcitykitties,3bn2vk,jokah,8,Tue Jun 30 21:50:23 2015 UTC,I think the harder question would be who do you sign if you have to accept their current model stats and age. Granderson?

He started the season on the DL and then had to sit again after a few starts,  you cant expect anybody to come out and be perfect after that. The fact that he was able to gain composure and keep the game under control was very impressive. Not to mention the fact that he went 7 innings after a first woth 29 pitches or something like that. Verlanders future is debatable, but he still shows promise. Between the fact that he has had one of the best careers of any current starting pitcher, and the fact that we have a huge contract for him, it would be stupid to get rid of him until we see it through."

A lot of media personnel will say things like ""the yankees being good is good for baseball"" or anything similar after a big market team starts to take off again after a down year or two. I disagree, those teams will always have their market. Teams that dont typically have a huge fan base or have been historically bad like the Astros and Royals is what is really good for baseball. New fan bases start to develop, and teams with a small budgets start to see an increase in revenue. So what if they are bringing ""band wagoners"" for every 5 bandwagon fans, at least one of them is likely to become a lifelong fan."

motorcitykitties,3bjxs4,FakeyFaked,17,Mon Jun 29 21:52:27 2015 UTC,I doubt that's why they made this trade. This should just be for depth. They aren't going to make a trade specifically geared towards sending Castellanos down right after he just had like four good games. Any sign of life from Nick is going to lengthen his leash a bit.
motorcitykitties,3bjxs4,ShakeItTilItPees,-8,Mon Jun 29 22:10:10 2015 UTC,You are incorrect. That's exactly why they made this trade. Nick will be sent to AAA within the next 2-3 weeks.

Sometimes a depth deal is just a depth deal."
motorcitykitties,3bjxs4,ShakeItTilItPees,0,Tue Jun 30 12:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. Castellanos down, Machado up to play SS with Romine at 3B. Castilla takes over at short for AAA. They made this move because Toledo had no other shortstop besides Machado."
motorcitykitties,3bjxs4,ShakeItTilItPees,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"Why would Machado play shortstop? They've been playing him at third in Toledo because of Iglesias. He might get a few starts at short if he was called up but as long as he plays well he's going to get more starts at third than Romine.   My overall point is that Nick has been hitting well for the past several games. They brought in Casilla because they need a shortstop at AAA, since Machado is playing third in case he's called up to replace Nick. He wasn't acquired because a move is imminent, he was acquired because if that move does ever need to happen they will have a hole in AAA. That's the definition of a depth move. As long as Castellanos is swinging the bat well he's going to be in Detroit. Nick might spend the entire week hitless and then yeah, they'll probably send him down. That has to happen first, though. They aren't planning on sending him down right when he might be starting to actually hit, they're going to wait until they see evidence that he isn't."

It was brought to my attention by a loyal Tiger poster that in the last 15 starts that Price had, he sat on the bench in uniform after coming out. Sunday he was no where to be seen. Miggy was giving JD an ear full in the dugout last week after he hit 3 homers. Something is going on inside the Tiger Den and I wish the Detroit media would dig into it. Looks like July could be an interesting, bumpy ride.  JD got an ear full of grief. Verlander is seen walking up behind Miggy leaned in, and looked like he said something like “let it go” or “that’s enough”. Next camera view in the dugout showed Vmart with a hand on JD arm speaking to him. The body language seemed to show an attempt to soften the blow he just got from Miggy. It was just after JD came in from his 3rd homer of the night. He had a “deer in headlights” look about him like he just sucker punched verbally.   I didn't see this."

Miggy's numbers pale in comparison to Ruth, who also happened to be a very, very good pitcher.  Sorry, Miggy is a generational talent, but he's not going to even come close to GOAT.

motorcitykitties,3bibq0,Spear994,7,Mon Jun 29 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"Hilarious. You can't compare one era to another era that was NEARLY 100 YEARS AGO.  In general, you can't compare eras that are even 20 years apart from each other. By then, younger players watching pro players from the 60s learn things from them for the 80s. And 2000s youngsters learn things from the 80s players that help them succeed in the 00s and so forth. Still, pundits and analysts across many walks of baseball unironically call Miguel the best right-handed hitter in the HISTORY of the game. On the one hand, yeah, those guys have to sell the game. I understand this. They still obviously have a case.  To me, the thing Miggy has to do to be the goat is play at this level for 5-6 more years. He has the comparisons to Hank Aaron's numbers, he's on pace for about 600 homeruns and right now has a career OPS over 1. If you want wOBA, note that wOBA is about 20 points lower today than it was during Babe's time.  People like stuff that's no longer around because of nostalgia - plain and simple. ""Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders."" The same can be applied to people who say ""Man, Magic Johnson was the greatest,"" ""Beckenbauer was the greatest,"" ""Orr was the greatest."" Because they're gone, your fondness of them increases by that much. It doesn't mean they weren't elite and aren't worth remembering, it just means that you're not impressed by the current goats that we watch today and won't be until it's been 10 years after their retirement.  Drink it in. We're watching one of the Top 10 players in the history of the game. Every bit of his existence is magnificent."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,PAVAL_DATSACK,5,Mon Jun 29 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of baseball, you actually can compare eras.  Why do you think baseball writers are so pissed off about the steroid era and that effect on all time records?  Granted, it's not apples to oranges, and I completely agree that Babe Ruth today would not be the Babe Ruth of the 20s, but what you can do is look at how much more dominant than the rest of the field he was.  Go look at his stats on baseball reference, the guy was on another level, only Bonds compares favorably, and that's ONLY his offense.  Also, I would love to see a reference to anyone calling Miguel the best right-handed hitter in the history of the game.  I've seen top 10 regularly, and top 5 some times, but that's it.  There's an argument that Pujols, in just this era, is better.  Miggy compares well with Henry Aaron, but what made Hank so great was his production into his late 30s.  We'll have to see with Miggy.  I'm not selling Miggy short.  He's a generationally great player.  We will all be telling our grandkids about him.  But I'm going to be deeply disturbed if this subreddit is full of people who actually think he's on any sort of track to be the greatest baseball player of all time."

motorcitykitties,3bibq0,jburgs9,6,Mon Jun 29 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"So did other baseball players in history. Do you think Carl Yastremski has claim for the best player in history? Cabrera is my favorite player of all time, and I am of the opinion he is the best player of his era. But not of all time."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,GraemeTaylor,6,Mon Jun 29 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he won the triple crown in an area where everyone is stronger faster and better. Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, and Hank Aaron were catalysts for the game's growth, but Miggy is doing it in a superior league. I wish we had numbers on guys fastballs back then. Was anybody throwing 95 consistently?"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,CHEinthecity,6,Mon Jun 29 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Really what we should be asking is what exactly does G.O.A.T. mean? To me, it means who was the best player of their respective era. Because you can't IMO compare them on an absolute scale."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,TFail342,2,Mon Jun 29 15:02:27 2015 UTC,Greatest of all time.  If it was greatest of respective Era it would be GORE
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,CHEinthecity,3,Mon Jun 29 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"I think GOAT has to be GORE. Professional sports leagues evolve, rules change, nutrition and coaching improves, interest in the sport changes, the world population increases. There are too many variables to accurately compare players of different eras."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,bkn6136,3,Mon Jun 29 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"Walter Johnson threw 98-100, and there were certainly other pitchers who could throw as hard as guys do today.  But, overall, the average fastball speed was likely lower than it is today.  Remember, pitchers were expected to pace themselves so that they could throw complete games.  However, you don't think Babe Ruth would take advantage of all the advances in modern athletics, nutrition and technology if he were dropped in the modern era and still be dominant?  The Babe was the most dominant athlete in his sport, in his era, of all time.  The only comparisons are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan/Bill Russell, and I think Babe eclipses even them.  Miggy is nowhere near that level of great, and yet is still a great baseball player.  Top 10 all time right handed batter, for sure.  Possibly top 5 depending on how the rest of his career pans out."

motorcitykitties,3bibq0,bkn6136,5,Mon Jun 29 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Ruth's playing weight hovered around 215, less than Miggy. He was overweight at the end, but he wasn't a fatass most of his career."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,veejaycee,2,Mon Jun 29 16:27:38 2015 UTC,....almost twice
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,lunk,2,Mon Jun 29 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"Generally, I'd just say you were being a dick, and go about my business, but I did some research, and you are right.   http://fueledbysports.com/miguel-cabrera-vs-babe-ruth-comparison/  That said, Miggy is WAY closer than your post might indicate.  There seems to be no one who is close to Ruth for GOAT, but Miggy's got to be discussed behind Ruth I think.    He's got some numbers that are better than Ruth, and a lot that are interestingly close, at least."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,bkn6136,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"Not being a dick, it's just not close.  That isn't shitting on Miggy, that's just realizing how amazing other players were.  Also, your fueled by sports link lists Ruth with 516 home runs.  You may want to use another source for any sort of stats.  Try baseball reference."

motorcitykitties,3bibq0,slickeddie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"You can't compare eras like that though. Pitchers used to pitch the entire game sometimes throwing over 200 pitches an outing. If Miggy faced a pitcher from the 1920's he'd probably hit over 500 with close to 100 HRs a season. The more pitches thrown means more mistakes. Miggy LOVES to crush mistakes.  During the offseason the players focus on baseball now. Back then they'd have another job.  Those guys were all great hitters at the time, but any modern day hitter would annihilate their numbers if they played back then. The speed, strength and coordination are all better now. Not to mention the players now are highly specialized."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,packy11,0,Mon Jun 29 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"If you're considering Ruth to be the GOAT, I'm not sure if we're making the right comparison. I'd argue Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Ty Cobb, Pete Rose, Ted Williams, Derek Jeter, etc. all could be up there. Ruth played in a time when a single TEAM wouldn't hit 30 homeruns in a season, not to mention a player. And yes he was a great pitcher, but NEVER in the MLB. In fact, that is why he switched to RF because his bat would be in the lineup every game instead of 1 every 4 or 5. So with the reasoning that his talent as a batter outweighed his impact as a pitcher, I would say that's not relevant. Miggy is just as qualified to be listed with these others, because like you said baseball has been around a long time, and I think it's impossible to say who is truly the GOAT"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,bkn6136,6,Mon Jun 29 16:10:13 2015 UTC,Ruth pitched in the World Series...
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,packy11,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"Ok so I stand (sit) corrected regarding never being a great pitcher in the MLB. Regardless, I wouldn't say that adds to him being the greatest of all time. Although he was very talented, the decision was still made to move him to an everyday player which tells me he was more important as a hitter. But it is impressive to think he could've excelled at both"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,JimmyD2,4,Mon Jun 29 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"Ruth went 94-46 in 147 career starts as a pitcher in the majors. He led the American League in ERA and shutouts in 1916, going 23-12. He was a very good pitcher, even for the era he pitched in"

motorcitykitties,3bibq0,ndevito1,7,Mon Jun 29 15:53:27 2015 UTC,There's a very very good chance Miggy doesn't even end up with a better career than Albert Pujols so lets pump the breaks on the GOAT talk.  Edit: Seriously...there is literally another right-handed hitting first baseman currently in baseball who has had a better career than Miggy...this thread is ridiculous.
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,Rbaner,3,Mon Jun 29 17:31:56 2015 UTC,Coming into a thread full of Tigers fans and saying stuff like that about Miggy isn't a smart idea...
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,irlkg,3,Mon Jun 29 20:52:58 2015 UTC,Pujols is three years older than Cabrera. If Cabrera plays well until he is 40 he will pass Pujols.
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,GraemeTaylor,3,Mon Jun 29 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"That's a huge if though. Also, Miggy's career has been about 12 seasons and Pujols' has been about 14-14.5 season. Aka Pujols has played about 2.5 seasons more than Miggy, yet has 140 more home runs.   I'm a Tigers fan that loves Miggy and watches him every day - but Pujols has been the better generational talent easily. Miggy has time, but he has to defeat all mighty dreaded aging curve which hurts even the greatest of the great."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,irlkg,0,Tue Jun 30 01:17:15 2015 UTC,"Pujols may have had more Home Run production, but I think Cabrera will probably pass him in hits and RBI (already has a higher lifetime BA).   Pujols has 1,650 RBI and Cabrera has 1,422. Pujols has 2,592 hits, Cabrera has 2,278.   Assuming Pujols plays for 5 more years and gets a strong 100 RBI a year, he'll end at 2,150 RBI. Assuming he also amasses an above average 125 hits a season, he'll end at 3,217.   Assuming Cabrera plays for 9 more years and gets a low average of 90 RBI a year, he'll end at 2,232 RBI. Assuming he also amasses a low average of 90 hits a season, he'll end with 3,088.   So, assuming Pujols keeps his numbers at a steady rate (may or may not happen) and assuming that Cabrera has a total collapse and his production is cut in half, Cabrera will end up close in hits and with more RBI.   Pujols average hits per year: 192. Cabrera average hits per year: 195.  Pujols average RBI per year: 122. Cabrera average RBI per year: 122."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,GraemeTaylor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, RBI aren't a great stat. If miggy ends up with more than him that's great, but career RBI isn't even close to enough to be considered better"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,irlkg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, RBI signifies that you can not only get hits but get them when your team needs them. Sure, there are more stats to look at, but RBI will always be important in my view."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,GraemeTaylor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"But it's very indicative of team performance.   You want to see when someone gets hits? Check AVG. RBIs are 100% a product of the rest of the team. I'd rather take someone w. a .320 avg and 75 RBIs than a .290 AVG and 100 RBIs, because the latter most likely bats behind much better players."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,irlkg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, in that case I'll cite Cabrera's lifetime average of .321, which is the highest of any active player."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,Nfrizzle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"And AVG isn't the only thing.   I'm not saying Miggy is crazy off, but Pujols through this point in their careers has been better and Miggy has to continue to play really well to pass him for their careers. Pujols has a higher OBP, SLG, ISO, wRC+, and has struck out less in his career if you want to just throw stats out there.   Miggy is definitely top 5 this generation (depending on how far you are looking back) and depending on your view of Arod and steroids, I'd put Miggy 2nd only to Pujols but not by much. That can change, but Pujols is still good, Miggy just has to continue to be better, continue to bat over .300, and hit 25+ homers and he will eventually pass Pujols for their careers."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,GraemeTaylor,2,Tue Jun 30 23:05:39 2015 UTC,Well yeah that is defiantly possible.  It's also possible Cabrera plays another 8 years of hitting over .300 and more than 25 HRs.
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,jimbo_hawkins,0,Mon Jun 29 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"But, but Cabrera has the better lifetime BA! That's all I care about…"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,Smalls951,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"One thing I like to look at during these debates is how much better the player was than all the other players they played against. Ruth was significantly better than his contemporaries. He changed how the game was played. He made the Home Run a thing. Miggy is definitely one of the best players of this generation, but I would have a hard time saying he is significantly better than all of the competition. Trout, Kershaw, Pujols, Verlander, Bonds, Scherzer, Griffey, Stanton, Harper,etc. There are some amazing players playing today."
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,mrsmall53,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:53:47 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why everybody is assuming I am saying he is the best in the league right now. Pujols obviously has the better career as of now. But if Miguel plays like this for another 7 years he passes Albert easily.
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,PenCap_Anthem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Not to be a hater, but I don't think Miggy is even close to such a title. The lack of stellar defense (not that he's nearly as bad as his critics like to say!) doesn't help, nor does the fact that hitters like Pujols had better numbers up to the point that Miggy's at right now."

Im not sure how I feel about the WS because as much as us Tigers fans want to see it happen and see miggy do it in the old english D, I'm not convinced it will matter because baseball is such a team sport. Although a couple WS in his back pocket will definitely help his cause. Barring no scandal comes up (Steroids, betting, etc.) he will most definitely be a first ballot HoF"
motorcitykitties,3bibq0,Thndrcougarfalcnbird,2,Mon Jun 29 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think WS is really a valid stat.  There are way more teams now (30, as opposed to 16 back then), so it's much much harder to win, or even get to, the WS than it was back then."

motorcitykitties,3bfmez,kay_bizzle,5,Sun Jun 28 20:20:37 2015 UTC,WHY DID I STOP WATCHING THE GAME AFTER THE SEVENTH INNING? THIS WILL TEACH ME TO STOP BEING SO PESSIMISTIC.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,hoorayforsports,4,Sun Jun 28 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"The hillbillies next to me left after the end of the 8th.  ""Well, they tied it up, I rekon i seent some good fundamentals, time to pack 'er on it fer the day."""
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,hoorayforsports,4,Mon Jun 29 03:57:58 2015 UTC,We need to keep this momentum going and gain some games on the royals!
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,RockosBos,5,Sun Jun 28 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"Really, they need to start faltering though! Seems like they and the Twins always have the easiest schedules."
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,hoorayforsports,7,Sun Jun 28 20:30:06 2015 UTC,Right? Seems like they just play the Phillies over and over but the team wears different jerseys while we play the AL Allstar team.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,MIdopeguy,6,Sun Jun 28 20:32:27 2015 UTC,We do play the royals a lot.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,dr_kingschultz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:30:06 2015 UTC,Ah touché.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,shadyultima,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:51:06 2015 UTC,Yeah not to mention that both the royals and twins have like 4 or 5 games that got rained out.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,accio7,5,Mon Jun 29 03:32:06 2015 UTC,In town from Mississippi and caught the game! Hell yeah Tigs!
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,883iron,6,Sun Jun 28 20:41:58 2015 UTC,Could I have picked a better first game to go to? McCann is my hero today!
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,Redemption_Unleashed,4,Sun Jun 28 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Tigers win!! What an 8th inning, WHAT a walk-off! James McCann, yay!!"
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,Redemption_Unleashed,4,Sun Jun 28 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"McCann nails some Sock trying to steal, then Gets the first hit of the bottom of the 8th, then Scores the first run of the game for the Tigers, then Hits the walkoff home run.   McCann can."
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,jdm0,3,Sun Jun 28 21:22:13 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why they tossed dirt at mcann as he hit home? I dont know if I have seen that before
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,BIGDIRTYDADDY27,2,Sun Jun 28 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Tigers tradition, I think…once saw it happen to Cabrera."
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,TremendousTiger,5,Sun Jun 28 20:25:54 2015 UTC,I am so sad I missed one of the best games of the season.  :(  Guys...  I always miss the best games.  Shit.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,accio7,13,Sun Jun 28 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Trust me, innings 1 - 7 were hell."
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,Jonny_Qball,2,Sun Jun 28 20:29:45 2015 UTC,How so?
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,accio7,7,Sun Jun 28 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Look at the box score. Samardzija was punching out everyone, Tigers couldn't get anything going. Price looked alright and didn't give up a lot of hits, but the hits he did give up were smoked (out of 6 hits there was a double, triple, and homer).  The last two innings were very exciting but the rest of the game before that was not a fun one to watch as a Tigers fan."
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,indiebass,2,Sun Jun 28 20:59:31 2015 UTC,Really boring we had like 2 hits. Almost painful to watch.
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,themountiansecho,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:49:02 2015 UTC,Ausmus better not start Avila when he comes back
motorcitykitties,3bfmez,SodiumThoride,8,Sun Jun 28 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Avila is still a great catcher with good leadership qualities. I'd like to see split time."
motorcitykitties,3bjuqy,timg1229,3,Mon Jun 29 20:30:49 2015 UTC,Send us a modmail message just explaining your site and stuff just so we can clear it :-)
motorcitykitties,3bjuqy,EricNick09,2,Tue Jun 30 01:58:10 2015 UTC,This seems super sketchy
motorcitykitties,3bjuqy,SpartanLB50,0,Tue Jun 30 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"It's a sincere opportunity, Eric. Nothing sketchy about it. I don't post details because I don't want to make it a site promotion thread. E-mail me and I'll tell you everything about it and answer any and all questions you have."
motorcitykitties,3bjuqy,GraemeTaylor,2,Tue Jun 30 01:09:02 2015 UTC,Uncompensated Sports Journalism where I can cover any team in any sport. Does it rhyme with SanFided?
motorcitykitties,3bguc3,michaelconfoy,2,Mon Jun 29 02:40:34 2015 UTC,All I see with old pictures of Ty Cobb.
motorcitykitties,3bguc3,FakeyFaked,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:25 2015 UTC,Read a book on him once. Can't remember the title but he was all kinds of mean. Used to use sharpened cleats to injure the opposing team members when he slid into bases.
motorcitykitties,3bguc3,agamemnomnom,5,Mon Jun 29 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"Actually the latest book that came out on him said that was a myth and while he played hard, and he wasn't the friendliest guy around, most of what was said about him was overblown if not just made up."
motorcitykitties,3bguc3,FakeyFaked,2,Mon Jun 29 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"Never know who to believe.  The new book is by a guy who is a big time fan of Cobb, while the old stuff was primarily from a dude who didn't like him."
motorcitykitties,3bguc3,cliffhanger1983,-1,Tue Jun 30 01:41:21 2015 UTC,he was a racist !
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,the_seed,16,Mon Jun 29 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"How is any of this on Ausmus? He never told Price he was done, Price assumed he was done and went and got undressed.  It is all on Price for not communicating with Ausmus on what is going on."
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,dan-o07,12,Mon Jun 29 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"Why are people in here criticising Ausmus for this?  It sounds like this is all on Price, why would you go into the clubhouse and change before your manager says you're done?"
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,Robot_Satan,5,Mon Jun 29 13:02:43 2015 UTC,After the game Price took full responsibility for it as well.
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,purpleclouds,12,Mon Jun 29 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"Jeez, calm down. I have been constantly questioning Ausmus in the last couple weeks and months, but this isn't a sign of poor managing. Human beings are not perfect, mistakes happen, it's not big deal. Get over it.  On the plus-side, Wilson got some great reps in today and showed that he is reliable in a pinch. Two great pieces of news."
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,PAVAL_DATSACK,-11,Mon Jun 29 03:44:51 2015 UTC,"Price of course handled it like a gentleman 'a miscommunication' but I can, with 99% certainty, guess this has never happened to him at any level - let alone the Bigs.  I'm embarrassed for Ausmus."
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,purpleclouds,8,Mon Jun 29 01:35:53 2015 UTC,Im embarassed for you.
motorcitykitties,3bgn62,bkn6136,-12,Mon Jun 29 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"Really questioning hiring an inexperienced guy like Ausmus to learn on the fly with a team this talented. He has made quite a few truly mind boggling errors in two seasons, and that's not counting the typical questionable in game decisions all managers make.   If you were a free agent like Price, would stupid stuff like this make you feel good about resigning with this team?"

motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,TheSheriman,5,Sun Jun 28 20:34:38 2015 UTC,perhaps an incorrect Starbucks order or something
motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,MShasta,3,Sun Jun 28 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"i was just watching that clip in the game thread because I also missed it.   Was Price just like yo I'm done pitching? I just got 2 runs scored on me in the 6th, I am at 99 pitches. I'll probably get scored on in the 7th too?  It kind of worked out either way bullpen threw 7-9 scoreless."
motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,Chouzard,8,Sun Jun 28 23:49:00 2015 UTC,Damn Victor looked good running on that double. Definitely good signs to his long term health this season.

motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,TheRealBigMula,3,Sun Jun 28 20:29:29 2015 UTC,I didn't see any of it. All I saw was an ESPN update on my phone.  You're lucky you got to see it!
motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,seabassspeaks,3,Sun Jun 28 20:31:55 2015 UTC,The first and most likely the last game I got to see live!
motorcitykitties,3bfo5h,shookmaster311,5,Sun Jun 28 20:50:27 2015 UTC,awesome hearing the radio call on the way home from work!

motorcitykitties,3beiiu,TigersBot,18,Sun Jun 28 14:10:33 2015 UTC,Hope you don't mind a Cardinals fan sitting in with you guys. Our game isn't until 7:00 on Sunday Night Baseball and I need my baseball fix before then.

motorcitykitties,3beiiu,LadsActionNewsSteen,3,Sun Jun 28 19:50:04 2015 UTC,It's true. How the fuck did they leave him in? It was like watching the Pedro Martinez game all over again.
motorcitykitties,3beiiu,GraemeTaylor,2,Sun Jun 28 19:59:06 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if Ventura weren't gone at the end of the season.
motorcitykitties,3beiiu,LadsActionNewsSteen,2,Sun Jun 28 20:00:26 2015 UTC,Same.

motorcitykitties,3beiiu,Crispycrusader,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:59:58 2015 UTC,4 runs and a zillion pitches. Tigers refuse to hit today. Time for the 75th shutout against them this year.

motorcitykitties,3beiiu,Rbaner,5,Sun Jun 28 19:49:37 2015 UTC,They said earlier at his first AB he was hitting .392 since he came from the DL.

motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Mich-igan,3,Sat Jun 27 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"Sure we could try and trade for some bullpen help but I don't think we should.  For one, whenever we get a bullpen pitcher from somewhere else they always seem to start to struggle here. Exception being Soria right now.  Two, this team has the capability to be very good. The offense is there, the defense is there, the pitching is there. It's just all inconsistent right now.   A lot of the issues I'm seeing this season are issues I saw when Leyland was manager as well. Teams struggling to put all the pieces together at once. We have good pitching but no hitting, good hitting but no pitching.   I think we'll get there. I don't think a trade would really help us though."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,6,Sat Jun 27 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't agree the pitching is there. David Price is the only consistent starter we have on the roster. Sanchez has looked better, but still doesn't look back to form. Simon has been trending downward which is concerning. Verlander is a mystery, and I am hoping for the best. The 5th starter spot isn't terrible, but it is the worst it has been in a few years. All in all, the starting pitching as is needs to be  a lot better."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,MShasta,2,Sat Jun 27 15:17:01 2015 UTC,My point is that it's inconsistent. The pitchers we have have the capability to be good. Just like the offense has the capability to be good. The issue is when one seems to be on the other seems to be off.
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Sat Jun 27 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"You say inconsistent, I say concerning."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,MShasta,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:48:17 2015 UTC,It can be both. Inconsistency is definitely concerning.
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Sat Jun 27 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"I agree we don't need one yet, we have all of July to try and shorten that 6 GB. But if JV is injured/inconsistent and rooks can't hold it down, a trade for a starter could be in our future."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,irlkg,-2,Sat Jun 27 14:11:36 2015 UTC,A trade for a starter is about all I can see happening.  As much as I love what Cespedes has brought to the team I'm almost wondering if trading Porcello was a bigger loss than Cespedes was a gain. It's not like our offense was really an issue last season.
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,6,Sat Jun 27 14:13:23 2015 UTC,".....what  Cespedes is batting over .300 playing great defense and has a 2.7 fWAR on pace for BY FAR his best season in the majors while Porcello has a 5.54 ERA and a 0.6 fWAR and his peripherals aren't pretty either, his FIP and xFIP are also over 4.   We would easily be a worse team if we hadn't made that trade. Plus no Alex Wilson in the rotation could've led to an even worse bullpen."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,irlkg,2,Sat Jun 27 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"This is true, I actually forgot that Alex Wilson was included in that trade which is my fault."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:22:38 2015 UTC,"lol np. There is a possibility Porcello doesn't suck as a Tiger, but boy am I glad we made this trade and didn't extend him after being such an advocate of extending him before."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,irlkg,-1,Sat Jun 27 14:23:31 2015 UTC,This is tough for me to even say but could Verlander be on the trading block as long as it's for another starting pitcher?
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,7,Sat Jun 27 14:25:48 2015 UTC,"Nope. No one would trade for him. Unfortunately, he's basically Ryan Howard at this moment in terms of tradability."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,irlkg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"I guess at this point I'll just hope he gets back into a least decent form and get get down to his 3.5 ERA with a 1.3 WHIP. Would also be nice if he could stay healthy.  I feel like the trainers need to work with him and say, ""Justin, I know you are a creature of habit but, whatever you're doing...it's not working for you right now""."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Sat Jun 27 14:39:01 2015 UTC,"I actually thought this before the season started. Obviously I want them to figure it out and contend, but if they lose any more ground between now and the deadline, it could be a blessing in disguise that they have so many good players in the last year of their contracts. They could reload their farm system in a BIG way with Price, Cespedes, and Soria."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,Joeleo_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:53:32 2015 UTC,No way we get rid of Price or Soria unless they ask for an outrageous deal. Soria though I can maybe see going elsewhere.
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,WheresCarlisle,2,Sat Jun 27 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Depending on what happens in the next month, yes, absolutely. If we're at .500 at the All-Star break then I think DD will start taking phone calls, and if we stay that way a week or so before the deadline then he's going to be considering offers. We have more contracts ending this year than we have before in my lifetime. I would rather we sell off our short contracts to a contender and get ourselves in a better position for the next few seasons than drain our farm more for an outside shot at a playoff appearance. We'll all hate giving up some of our Major League players but we'll get over it. Not winning the division this year doesn't have to be the end of the world. It will be worse if we don't win it AND watch five or six players walk away in the offseason.   Now, if we're still fairly competitive this won't happen. Let's hope we can win the division this year with the talent we have. If that isn't feasible, though, imagine what we would get for a package including Soria, Price, Davis or Cespedes. Two or three of them are enough to tip any close division race."
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,ShakeItTilItPees,2,Sun Jun 28 04:46:22 2015 UTC,Yep. It could be a one year re-build. If we lose a lot of ground in the standings then selling for prospects/young players and then going strong in the offseason w. available cap space we could turn this around.
motorcitykitties,3bar9a,irlkg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:58:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The free agent market this offseason is loaded, especially for starting pitching. And if we traded Price and Cespedes away they wouldn't be eligible for qualifying offers in case we decided to sign them again."

motorcitykitties,3b9jcn,tiger94,5,Sat Jun 27 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"Kind of surprising that it was only his third career three-double game. Seems like someone like him would be good for a game like that once a season or so. Before today, he had the same amount of career three-double games as three-homer games.  Then again he's probably had a few 1 HR, 2 double games or whatever, and obviously that's better than three doubles, but maybe not quite as memorable."
motorcitykitties,3b9jcn,cab4656,6,Sat Jun 27 03:59:31 2015 UTC,JD 10 homers in last 16 games. that is raking. He hits big ones too.
motorcitykitties,3b9jcn,fantasyfest,5,Sat Jun 27 05:04:52 2015 UTC,V Mart seeing the ball well and looking like he can rotate to be a tougher out with those long at bats. Bodes well for the dog days

Quintana taking the mound tonight for The South Side's Finest and he's a handful up there. He's a lot better than that record shows. Excellent game management. A ton of heart. He's the kind of guy you're proud takes the bump every five days.   The bats are starting to come alive and a full scale South Side revival is on. With our rotation and our talent were making a serious run at this division. You guys caught us at the wrong time.   Sox-7 Tigers-3  Should be a lot of fun tonight. Enjoy the game.

motorcitykitties,3b46ww,purpleclouds,5,Thu Jun 25 20:47:15 2015 UTC,Ausmus needs to stop trusting Joba in meaningful situations.
motorcitykitties,3b46ww,douchey_mcbaggins,4,Fri Jun 26 01:45:32 2015 UTC,He walked a guy. then maybe skinned another batter.  The next was a grounder to short for the third out. But Iglesias had trouble with it and bases were loaded for the next batter who doubled. Joba ois not getting any breaks.
motorcitykitties,3b46ww,fantasyfest,2,Fri Jun 26 02:49:22 2015 UTC,"He's not giving himself the breaks.  He barely hit the guy, but luckily it wasn't an inch higher to destroy the guy's elbow. But he still handed over the first two baserunners then got the bad break when Iglesias couldn't come up with it.  If he gets two ground balls instead of a walk and HBP, there is a good chance that inning is over long before there is a chance for it to go bad.  Anyone can blow a game, and it's really easy to pick on the pitcher that takes the loss, but if he doesn't start making some worthwhile adjustments to his pitching, nobody is going to trust him if Tigers make it to post season.  A few blown games during the season usually aren't a big deal, but the Tigers need a clutch bullpen for many reasons."
motorcitykitties,3b46ww,14bikes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:20:59 2015 UTC,Garcia didn't even try to get out of the way of the pitch.  I really wish guys would start getting called for not moving.  Tabata even fucking leaned into the one that hit him to ruin Scherzer's perfect game.
motorcitykitties,3b46ww,jimmy_three_shoes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't have to get out of the way and most still don't want to get hit, but if you hold your ground and get HBP you should get first base.  If in the ump's discretion it would not have made contact with the player (and maybe up for manager challenge) and they intentionally tried to get hit call it a ball."
motorcitykitties,3b46ww,14bikes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"But that's not the rule.  The rule specifically says the batter must try to avoid the pitch.   The batter becomes a runner and is entitled to first base without liability to be put out (provided he advances to and touches first base) when -- (a) Four balls have been called by the umpire; Rule 6.08(a) Comment: A batter who is entitled to first base because of a base on balls must go to first base and touch the base before other base runners are forced to advance. This applies when bases are full and applies when a substitute runner is put into the game. If, in advancing, the base runner thinks there is a play and he slides past the base before or after touching it he may be put out by the fielder tagging him. If he fails to touch the base to which he is entitled and attempts to advance beyond that base he may be put out by tagging him or the base he missed. (b) He is touched by a pitched ball which he is not attempting to hit unless (1) The ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, or (2) The batter makes no attempt to avoid being touched by the ball; If the ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, it shall be called a strike, whether or not the batter tries to avoid the ball. If the ball is outside the strike zone when it touches the batter, it shall be called a ball if he makes no attempt to avoid being touched.   Emphasis mine."

motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,clizzark,2,Thu Jun 25 21:37:03 2015 UTC,Why do you think it was the right decision?
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,300001,9,Thu Jun 25 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"Posted this in the other thread but here are the reasons : A) you need the winning run ASAP because you only have 3 pitchers in the bullpen B) Vmart would have only scored on a home run from Cespedes, who doubles as often as anybody in the league  C) you can't ever know for certain that Wilson would come up in that situation, D) You have no way of knowing that Vmart would do any better than Wilson would do there."
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,Robot_Satan,4,Thu Jun 25 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"It's the bottom of the ninth. We have a guy on base with a great hitter coming up. Let's put someone faster as a pinch runner... Essentially going all in. We can't trust our pen to be clutch... Let's try to win it in the ninth with Cespy up. It was a risk, and I thought it was a good one."
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,clizzark,4,Thu Jun 25 21:53:37 2015 UTC,Really? 2 out runner on 1st. Tied game. Not liking it
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,runalex123,4,Thu Jun 25 21:54:28 2015 UTC,Cespedes hits as many doubles as anybody in the AL and Victor would have never scored if he had hit one.  If you don't PR for him you are relying on Vmart/Cespy/JD getting back-to-back-to-back hits which while not impossible is certainly not likely
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,Robot_Satan,2,Thu Jun 25 21:36:53 2015 UTC,I didn't see the game. I was working. Victor was on first with two outs when he was pinch hit for?
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Thu Jun 25 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, first base with Cespedes up"
motorcitykitties,3b4aqa,Robot_Satan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"Well its a matter of opinion I guess. But even though he's a good doubles hitter, I just think you're risking too much bringing V-Mart out. Because if  Cespedes doesn't hit a double (which percentage wise is very likely), you have NO protection behind Miggy going into extra innings. That's a big deal. And we all got to see just how big today."

motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,iamsuchasucker,5,Sat Jun 27 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"He brings a lot more knowledge than Rod. Rod doesn't have much MLB experience to rely on, and he's stuck in the 80's as far as what stats he uses for his analysis.  Add in his tired Rod-isms and I'm ready for a change. Jack definitely comes from a pitcher's perspective, but he doesn't annoy me and lets Mario do his thing without chirping in at the wrong time.  I'll probably listen to the radio guys less and the TV crew more if Rod is replaced."

motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,wjg10,7,Thu Jun 25 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"He played 13 years in the majors and minors, and another 3 seasons in the Japanese professional baseball league. He has more than enough experience as a player to talk informatively about the game.  Besides, being a broadcaster and being a good baseball player are two different skillsets. The sports landscape is littered with great players who were crappy broadcasters (Joe Montana, anyone?).   Same goes for coaches. The Jim Leylands and Sparky Andersons of the world usually make better coaches precisely because they know what it means to struggle. It's been said that Ted Williams was a bad manager because he could never get why some of his players couldn't hit well.  This somewhat translates to the broadcast booth. Morris can second-guess the pitch selection of pitchers all he wants, but it doesn't make for great broadcasting or entertaining television. Meanwhile, Rod takes a broader approach to what's going on in a game.  Give me Rod any day. I love what Jack did for us on the field, but it doesn't translate particularly well to the broadcast booth.  (And as much as I like Mario, he's no Vin Scully. I'd prefer a separate play by play man and color commentator.)"
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,mayor_of_awesometown,0,Fri Jun 26 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"But typically the ex-player color guy uses, ""when I went up against a guy like this...."", ""when I was in a bad slump...."", or ""when my team was in a playoff push late in the year...."", etc.  Scant time over 3 years in MLB doesn't allow him that, his minor league time and Japanese league experience isn't going to fly either. And Rod is no numbers-analyst. In fact he's terrible with numbers as he so often draws conclusions and makes predictions on comically small sample sizes.  He doesn't like to saber stats at all, which would be fine if he brought the MLB experience angle to the table. Instead all we get painfully obvious analysis of baseball 101, him praising ""Cabby"" and other Tigers, and his Rod-isms (I see you!) which are the same ones since he started the gig 12 years ago.    I honestly don't believe he brings anything to the call. Not experience. Not nuanced analysis. Not a humorous or interesting personality.    I agree with a lot of the criticism of Jack, but at this point his experience and heavy pitching perspective is great relief from Rod."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,wjg10,5,Fri Jun 26 02:16:09 2015 UTC,No. He's better.
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,bkn6136,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:25:40 2015 UTC,There was some thing posted when the season started showing the splits between the color commentators. With Gibby no longer commentating the majority of the games are with Rod. So you can relax and get through a few series. Listen to Jim and Dan if you really want that's what I do a lot of the time. They're awesome.
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,arenyk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm growing to dislike Rod. He's too much of a homer and an apologist. Also, every time he says ""Good block by the youngster McCann"" with no one on base it annoys the fuck out of me. At least Jim Price will say outright when something was terrible.  I can't explain it. But on the note of Morris, he came off really arrogant today, but I don't think he's particularly terrible. Not the best choice though."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,rbur70x7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, people actually think Jack is better?  Contrary hipsters? Nitpickers? I don't get it, Jack clearly blows."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,irishcreamdreamteam,2,Fri Jun 26 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"I think I'll just have to mute it. I can't stand Jim Price, so the radio isn't an option."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,Telodzrum,2,Thu Jun 25 20:52:17 2015 UTC,I second this. Just makes me happy Dan gets all of the calls.
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,Naturalpipes,-14,Fri Jun 26 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Rod, but I can live with Morris.  Yesterday I had the unfortunate situation of only being able to listen to the radio, and Morris is still way better than those guys."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,cab4656,24,Thu Jun 25 19:22:44 2015 UTC,Dan Dickerson and Jim Price are my favorite. I actually sometimes prefer listening to the game on the radio rather than watching it.
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,DJBrockman,4,Thu Jun 25 19:28:38 2015 UTC,LOLWHUT
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,runalex123,5,Thu Jun 25 21:07:23 2015 UTC,I can understand being indifferent toward Jim (even though he's great) but how can anyone seriously hate Dan Dickerson? He's top notch.
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,thewolfmansbrotha,2,Thu Jun 25 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Dan. But yesterday he just kind of sounded, um, agitated I guess in his tone a lot of the time. Kind of hard to describe and maybe a little silly. But I hadn't listened to a radio broadcast in several years. I would still say he's an above average announcer. It's a minor annoyance.  I won't say what I don't like about Price because I don't feel like more downvotes. But I will say I think he brings the whole broadcast down (and it seems worse than in the past) and Dan no longer seems quite good enough to offset that. Just my opinion and preference though."
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,cab4656,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"Upvoted because it makes no sense you are getting downvoted for sharing a perfectly rational opinion.  I really like both the tv and the radio guys, and I think everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. As long as they're calling Tigers' wins!"
motorcitykitties,3b3tvv,thesidestepkids,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"Wow I was thinking the exact opposite of this. Sure Morris talks about pitching a lot, but at least he says things that haven't been said on repeat for years. He's very knowledgable and does a good job going back and forth with Mario.  Rod is ok for a game or two at a time, but he has said the same things over and over for YEARS (google 'Rod Allen Drinking Game', there are years of iterations) and I've been tired of it for awhile. On top of that a lot of what he says is fluff or ""you get em Miggy"" kind of things instead of actually commenting on what's going on. If they give Morris more of the split I won't mind listening to Rod so much, but I'm relieved every time I see that Jack is doing the telecast."

It's still plenty early in the season and there is lots of good baseball yet to be played.

It's been a rough year for the South Sides finest, but I'm looking forward to the game anyway. I'm relatively new to Reddit and I like checking in on the other fans to check out the mood around the league. Today should be a real fun game. This early start has me all out of sorts, but it should be a good time.   Enjoy watching Rodon this afternoon. Easily the best arm I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. Right now I consider him a lock for ROY and another potential ace at the top of our rotation with Sale. Should be a great pitching match up.   My prediction:  Sox-6 Tigers-2  The Sox are just about ready to explode offensively and I see this series as good a time as any. I have a feeling you're catching us at the wrong time. Enjoy the game.

motorcitykitties,3b2p4l,purpleclouds,2,Thu Jun 25 18:51:04 2015 UTC,I think he has gotten considerably better since the beginning of the season. But I do like Rod better in the booth.

motorcitykitties,3b2p4l,jokah,2,Thu Jun 25 20:23:49 2015 UTC,I kind of figure the bullpen will be lucky to make it out of the 10th alive so basically it's all-in for winning it in the bottom of the 9th or 10th.

motorcitykitties,3b7p04,GTuck,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:23:49 2015 UTC,What's the difference in saying that and 28 million for a shitty 5th starter?
motorcitykitties,3b7p04,iamsuchasucker,7,Sat Jun 27 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, lets have 2 of Lobstein, Ryan and Farmer be in our rotation!   JV may not be the JV of old, but he's going to give us better quality than two AAA guys in our rotation this season."
motorcitykitties,3b7p04,honar,5,Fri Jun 26 17:34:50 2015 UTC,This isn't a new or fresh idea. It isn't going to happen. We have too much invested in him to not give him every chance to return to the starting lineup.
motorcitykitties,3b7p04,MShasta,3,Fri Jun 26 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"Until we have 5 better starters, he will be a starting pitcher."
motorcitykitties,3b7p04,GraemeTaylor,4,Fri Jun 26 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Screw the bullpen! I say we hire him as a janitor! Since he hasn't been cy young worthy, I say we mash up his bones and make bread out of them? That'll surely return the value of his 28 million a year contract!!! Honestly, dude isn't going to the bullpen this year. Not happening."

A serviceable third or fourth starter has more value than even the best of relievers.  I still feel like he'll be better than that."
motorcitykitties,3b7p04,bkn6136,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:51:25 2015 UTC,How about we up his juice dosage back to previous levels?
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,dryhoppedjosh,4,Thu Jun 25 20:47:06 2015 UTC,This one hurt
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,runalex123,7,Thu Jun 25 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Let's be real, Ausmus had a role in this too. Some guy in the GDT was trying to say Ausmus managed a good game. To him I say, no. He managed a terrible game. You don't pinch run for Victor until he gets to second. You don't bring in Joba (or at least take him out when he loads the bases!) you don't try to sac bunt Kinsler in the sixth. He just got out managed today. Which is saying something cuz Robin Ventura sucks too.  Edit: Also, we did get pretty unlucky with all those double plays we hit into. Those were hard hit balls that could easily have gone for singles on most other days. And GG Casty, for the first time in a while."
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,dbenoos,8,Thu Jun 25 21:09:36 2015 UTC,"Pinch running for Victor is a good move because Cespedes hits a lot of doubles, Vmart never would have scored on one and we need that run ASAP because the bullpen had 3 pitchers left in it (and one of them is Joba who you seem to think should never be used). Pinch running for Victor only once he gets to second makes no sense because the entire reason to run for him is so that he can score from first so that we don't have to rely on getting 3 back-to-back-to-back hits.  Joba has been a lot better than most people here seem to think (high WHIP is caused by a super high BABip against, he has a low FIP and rarely walks batters) and you can't pull him A) after he gets a groundball off the previous batter that should have gotten them out of the inning, the Sox got lucky it was hit where it was and B) with 2 pitchers left in the pen in extra innings.  The sac bunt (if it was called for by Ausmus, we don't know) is a good move because then worst case scenario (if the bunt gets down, which you'd assume that Kinsler can handle) you have bases loaded for Victor and all it does is remove the bat from Kinsler's hands, and it's not like he has been swinging a hot bat this year.  The blame for this game is not on Ausmus, it's on the hitters who could never come up with a hit with RISP (and to a lesser extent Simon and Rajai who let 3 runs score on a ball a competent CF could have caught)"
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,Robot_Satan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:33:24 2015 UTC,Yes cespedes hits a lot of doubles but with two outs and not being in scoring position its not a good move.
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,DetroitVPS,9,Thu Jun 25 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Two outs and on first is the exact time to make that move.  It means that Wilson could move up more easily on a passed ball/wild pitch, or score on an XBH, or beat a throw to second in the case of a ground ball to the left side, so that you're not relying on back-to-back-to-back hits to score the run and you need a run ASAP because we have 3 pitchers in the bullpen and one of them is Gorzo who ain't exactly inspiring confidence these days"
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,Robot_Satan,4,Thu Jun 25 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on PR for VMart, but that's the only big mistake he made.  He's gotta run with Joba and at that point had very little options. None better.  Why not sac bunt Kinsler there?  That's on Kinsler to get it down.  It's on Rajai to not fuck up two catchable balls in CF. It's on a bunch of different guys."
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,wjg10,4,Thu Jun 25 21:23:00 2015 UTC,I mentioned that in the GDT and got downvoted but I'm holding by it. Especially with 2 out.

motorcitykitties,3b46w6,runalex123,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:27:46 2015 UTC,i just kinda assumed they would pinch run for Vmart but i guess its not the best idea with 2 outs?

motorcitykitties,3b46w6,runalex123,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like pinch running for Victor with him on 1st and 2 outs.  There's power behind him in Cespedes and JD, so it's not like your asking Victor to get around the bags on a couple of singles most likely.  When he took out Victor, he took out Miggy."
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,wjg10,0,Thu Jun 25 21:26:59 2015 UTC,It takes balls to sit there and watch a guy throw a game away and not do anything about it and know you could ave stopped it
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,WheresCarlisle,-9,Fri Jun 26 00:21:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect anything less. He's is frankly one of the worst pitchers in the game.
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,GraemeTaylor,2,Thu Jun 25 20:50:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you don't watch much baseball if you think Joba is one of the worst pitchers...
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,Rbaner,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of baseball, haha. Can you make a case for him being even mildly average? As a Tigers fan, you know how often he blows it or comes close. But yes, statistically he probably isn't the worst. Just feels like it :/"
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,GraemeTaylor,2,Thu Jun 25 21:13:28 2015 UTC,"Low 3 FIP as a tiger, rarely walks anybody (that was his 4th this year) overinflated BABip against (you can't seriously tell me that golf swing ground ball was his fault) leads to the high WHIP.  He's been fine for us"
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,Robot_Satan,3,Thu Jun 25 21:21:17 2015 UTC,"Rarely? How about a 2.67 strikeout to walk ratio as a Tiger  There have only been 2 years in Joba's career where his BABIP was under .310, and that's not all on bad defense or luck.   In 82 innings with the Tigers he has surrendered 81 hits, 27 Walks and 35 Runs, with a 1.317 WHIP and a .267 BAA. Keep in mind this is our quote on quote ""setup man"" or ""8th inning guy,"" whatever you want to call him, so he should be held to those same standards.  His WPA(Win Probability added) is 0.1 yet his aLI(Average Leverage index, <1 means higher leverage situation) is 1.45 and RE24 is 0.6(Base out runs saved).  Joba is bottom of the barrel when it comes to late game relievers, his numbers aren't awful, but when you compare him to other setup men around the league, he doesn't even come close. Fact of the matter is Joba would be a decent middle reliever on any team, but for the Tigers to name him as setup man, and not give anyone else a shot the last two years is an absolute joke. (Joba was 7th inning guy after we traded for Soria)  This may not be a popular opinion and I may receive downvotes for it, but if we want to win baseball games and even have a chance at a World Series, we cannot have Joba Chamberlain pitching with the game on the line."

motorcitykitties,3b46w6,ShakeItTilItPees,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yes Joba sucks. Yes he should be off the team. No he should not have come into a high pressure situation.  Honestly, I've begun feeling more pitiful of Joba versus angry.  It's not his fault he sucks, he just does.  The real culprit behind our late game collapses is Ausmus. Yes it is only one game but he has specifically said that he made a lot of mistakes last year and that he would improve on them.  I don't see any improvement. Seriously.  I will have his head."
motorcitykitties,3b46w6,DetroitVPS,0,Thu Jun 25 21:56:17 2015 UTC,Ausmus is an amateur at best.  He seems to not care. I've never seen him show any passion for coaching.
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,abeers83,8,Thu Jun 25 06:42:53 2015 UTC,Probably the best thing Gonzalez ever did for the Tigers.
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,eatemuptigs,5,Thu Jun 25 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just crazy to look back at how massive of a bullet this was. Makes me think the run in 2006 would have never happened."
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,Dwychwder,7,Thu Jun 25 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"If you read this article, it's not about him turning down the $140 mil, it's about him rejecting a trade to the Yankees because he didn't want to sign a one-year deal. Of course, he ended up in Cleveland the next year on a one-year deal. This guy basically actively tried to fuck the Tigers. He just pouted his way through the season, and then rejected a trade that would have sent him to the eventual World Series champions, meaning the Tigers had nothing to show for his shitty season that they traded away their top prospects for. What an asshole Juan Gonzalez was."
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,sturg1dj,3,Thu Jun 25 12:45:24 2015 UTC,Yeah this was the best article i could find on this dated from 2000. I figured it had enough whining in it to still remind us of the distaste fans had for him.
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,the_seed,3,Thu Jun 25 17:00:33 2015 UTC,In hindsight i do not blame him. The team was such a mess at that point.
motorcitykitties,3b1oyt,jguacmann1,3,Thu Jun 25 11:40:51 2015 UTC,This is the best thing that could have possibly happened. Would have set us back 4-5 years.

motorcitykitties,3azpif,GraemeTaylor,5,Wed Jun 24 20:18:51 2015 UTC,Cueto for sure. Our starting lineup is a shell of what it was two years ago. Bonus points for an awesome name.
motorcitykitties,3azpif,MShasta,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"That's the other side of the coin for me (I am leaning towards Chapman but as you'll see I'm not sold), as we have fallen so much in our lineup. Losing Scherzer/essentially losing Verlander was an incredible blow to us. If we didn't have Price, we'd be very fucked. I think Cueto is amazing and would thrive here."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,themountiansecho,-3,Wed Jun 24 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"If we get cueto, we can possibly put verlander in the pen. He'd be a huge bullpen anchor probably."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,honar,2,Wed Jun 24 22:39:49 2015 UTC,If we get Cueto we could put whatever AAA starter is our 5th starter in the pen or back down in AAA.
motorcitykitties,3azpif,themountiansecho,-1,Thu Jun 25 02:23:47 2015 UTC,i kinda trust kyle ryan in the regular season over JV right now. I think a bullpen assignment is what he needs.
motorcitykitties,3azpif,eatemuptigs,2,Thu Jun 25 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"Dude Verlander is still recovering from injury, putting him in the bullpen as 'punishment' isnt going to help."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,themountiansecho,0,Thu Jun 25 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"It isnt a punishment. Its a chance to help him figure out his issues in a lower pressure situation against major league hitters. If hes still recovering imo he shouldnt risk hurting himself starting anyhow, give him a bit less innings in the bullpen and let kyle ryan take the slack for a little bit."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,Robard12,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"People have been saying JV should go to the bullpen everytime he has a bad stretch. He's the golden boy though, he'll never get put there."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,FantasticFinn,6,Thu Jun 25 08:59:07 2015 UTC,Cueto
motorcitykitties,3azpif,tiger94,9,Wed Jun 24 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Chapman.  Cueto is a half-season rental, no way we can afford him and Price, and I choose Price every time over Cueto, as far as who we should extend. Cueto would be really amazing for us for the rest of the regular season and postseason, but you saw how having a loaded rotation does nothing when your bullpen isn't there to close the games out.  Chapman has an extra year of control. For those saying we don't need a closer, Chapman can fill any role out of the bullpen. And he'd be a solid lefty for 1.5 seasons, and we'd have a lot better shot extending him than we would Cueto."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,antesjosh,5,Wed Jun 24 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"You guys do realize that Chapman started the season a couple of years ago in the starting five for the Reds? It's not like it it's impossible for him to start a game. Likely? No, but it is a thought.  Anyways, Detroit is 5.5 games back right now. If there's any chance we are going after either of these guys or Todd Frazier, we're gonna have to start winning some games. There's no reason to go after guys if we aren't going to make the playoffs."

If possible I'd do it."

motorcitykitties,3azpif,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. At this point, our hitting isn't the problem. Sure, Kinsler is having an off year, but at the end of the day, when you reach the last guy in our order (Iglesias, a top 10 AL average hitter currently), you hit a batting order of:  Iglesias-Gose/Davis-Kinsler-Cabrera-VMart-Cespedes-JMart  That's 7 straight strong batters (again, looking at Kinsler's career for this one as this year he is doing average at batting).   We have an abundance of good hitters, it's why we go between 1st and 2nd place in the categories of hits per game/batting average as a team. What we're really struggling with is pitching."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,MShasta,4,Wed Jun 24 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"I like Chapman, because I have never been happy with our bullpen, and I think we put too much stress on having this 1-4 starter core.  Plus, Cueto would just be a rental.  I like where Kinsler is currently. I know he hasn't had the production, but he's already drawn more walks than he did all of last year.  If he can use his new found patience with some of the attack from previous in his career, it'll be something to see."

motorcitykitties,3azpif,SHITTINwhileTHINKIN,2,Thu Jun 25 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, except trading for pitching hasn't worked for the Tigers in the past. The playoffs are too much of a crapshoot to rely on a starter who pitches once maybe twice in a series and same thing with a closer. Hitters on the other hand can affect each game and have done so in the past (Young, Peralta)."
motorcitykitties,3azpif,purpleclouds,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. However, right now I think we need more help getting to the playoffs, we're simply not the team that easily wins the division each year."

motorcitykitties,3awqxp,jBURRd,8,Wed Jun 24 14:39:04 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely worried about all of Verlander's injuries at this point.
motorcitykitties,3awqxp,Brady_Hokes_Headset,7,Wed Jun 24 03:57:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like we keep rushing him back.  Just have him heal up and get his nasty stuff back. If it takes a year, fine. If it takes a few months in Toledo, fine. I just want JV back. I dont even care if we get the stupid good JV back. I just want 17 win 3.0 ERA JV back."
motorcitykitties,3awqxp,Spear994,8,Wed Jun 24 04:08:23 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure about that though. We didn't really rush him back from the core muscle injury. We didn't rush him back from the bicep problem this season. Just seems like every time he comes back there's something new that starts hurting.  I'm almost calling into question his off-season training/conditioning/rehab processes.
motorcitykitties,3awqxp,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Wed Jun 24 04:11:31 2015 UTC,Justin has always been a creature of habit though. He has the same offseason habits every year. His body may just be breaking down. He pitched a lot of innings his first few years.
motorcitykitties,3awqxp,awayshallfade,3,Wed Jun 24 13:22:58 2015 UTC,At the same point shouldn't he change those offseason habits if they're preventing him from playing though?
motorcitykitties,3awqxp,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Wed Jun 24 13:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, as his body ages, he won't be able to do the same things every offseason. But I'd be concerned if he changed it too much and it threw him off, as we've seen happen with Tiger Woods. I'd hate to see him be so competitive that he lost his stuff."

But best of all, we won!  I had a blast enjoying our win, but I also want to really give it up for Progressive Field. Great ballpark with friendly fans. I was wearing a Cabrera shirt, and given the fact that no one chirped me despite my wearing the Slayer of Cleveland on my back, I can tell you that the fans are respectful. Nice people, great place.

motorcitykitties,3avcjq,Brady_Hokes_Headset,4,Wed Jun 24 01:10:42 2015 UTC,There's no way that pitch to McCann was a strike.
motorcitykitties,3avcjq,SodiumThoride,4,Wed Jun 24 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Not in any way, shape, or form. It's been atrocious both ways all night. As Rod just said, ""We've heard Cooper's name too much tonight""."

motorcitykitties,3avcjq,SodiumThoride,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:57 2015 UTC,"It's the same for refs in any sport. They almost protect the refs too much. College Football and Basketball are painful to watch sometimes because there is just zero consistency. I understand keeping the coaches and players from complaining about reffing all the time but at some point refs DO need to be held accountable.  It happens, but probably not as much as it should."

If I show up to my job and start making bad decisions on a relatively consistent basis, you can bet someone's going to sit down with me and we'll have a chat. It's not even a bad thing. I don't want to screw up at work. If I'm making mistakes and don't realize it, I want someone to straighten me out.  It doesn't seem like anyone cares that umps keep making mistakes like this. The umps seem to have no desire to improve, and the league seems OK with that. Even the replay has gotten worse this year at getting the call right.  Edit: forgot 2nd paragraph."

motorcitykitties,3aui08,fropek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:23:54 2015 UTC,So I play beat the streak and stayed away from Cabrera as I have this feeling that the Indians will just walk him no matter what from this point forward. What he does to Indians pitching is just unbelievable
motorcitykitties,3auw65,GraemeTaylor,8,Tue Jun 23 18:25:03 2015 UTC,Make sure to exploit the ridiculous condiment station they have. I sat in the lower level right field a few years ago and they must have had at least 5 types of mustard. The Indians did right by me that day.
motorcitykitties,3auw65,stevewhitmer,6,Tue Jun 23 18:49:58 2015 UTC,a drum and bang it on the off beat of John Adams when he beats his stupid drum.

motorcitykitties,3asgb1,TheSavs,3,Tue Jun 23 03:46:37 2015 UTC,Win or lose they had fun and that's all that matters
motorcitykitties,3asgb1,joethehoe27,9,Tue Jun 23 13:57:39 2015 UTC,No.... that's what matters when you're 12... when you're paid millions winning is pretty much all that matters...
motorcitykitties,3asgb1,mh6446,6,Tue Jun 23 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're not being paid millions to have fun. They're being paid millions to do a job and the job is to win."

motorcitykitties,3asgb1,ProfessorElTigre,13,Tue Jun 23 13:41:13 2015 UTC,hmm great question.. these are the type of hard-hitting issues that we should truly judge Ausmus' performance on.
motorcitykitties,3asgb1,mjfish1992,5,Tue Jun 23 13:52:07 2015 UTC,Maybe the umps will allow him to bring a stool to the mound.

motorcitykitties,3armzy,imtoocoldforthisshit,27,Mon Jun 22 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to vote for Donaldson. I think a lot of Tigers fans would love to get support for Jose Iglesias rather than Miggy, though. Miguel seems like he's gonna win out on his own."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,MiggyTripleCrown,14,Tue Jun 23 02:04:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for that. And yeah I believe I voted Iglesias and Cabrera every time.
motorcitykitties,3armzy,thewolfmansbrotha,6,Tue Jun 23 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"Plus, begging for Miggy votes is an embarrassment. He's better in almost every single measurable way. And I actually like Hosmer, but c'mon...."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,bunkymutt,3,Tue Jun 23 13:58:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  If anything is going to demonstrate that the voting system needs some changes, it's having Miguel fucking Cabrera NOT starting at first base."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,jdm0,13,Tue Jun 23 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just voted for who I thought played the best, or at least who I had the most fun watching in the games I've seen. I think it's a little delusional to vote your entire team in every time. Donaldson and Miggy were both in there but I voted Kipnis instead of Altuve."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,z97_zak,10,Tue Jun 23 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just voted for the best players at each position and the only royal I could even consider was Perez. Donaldson and Altuve were already on my list, as well as Iglesias. I mean, who knows if iggy will be able to keep up this high BA in years to come so it would suck if he gets jipped by Escobar of all people."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,FakeyFaked,8,Tue Jun 23 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"I've already voted for Donaldson, lots."
motorcitykitties,3armzy,fantasyfest,13,Tue Jun 23 02:56:13 2015 UTC,No way. I want to see the announcers explain Infante and the rest of them.
motorcitykitties,3armzy,FakeyFaked,3,Tue Jun 23 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"I watched the Mariners announcers trying to explain it yesterday.  They actually tried to make a case for him being ""hot"" right now and a ""solid glove."""
motorcitykitties,3armzy,honar,8,Tue Jun 23 15:12:28 2015 UTC,One Royals guy made the argument that he was batting over .400 over the past 7 games. So hot right now.

motorcitykitties,3armzy,bubbatannous1,3,Tue Jun 23 06:30:39 2015 UTC,I've already voted for Donaldson from all 3 of my email accounts. He really deserve that starting spot.
motorcitykitties,3armzy,mseguin12,3,Tue Jun 23 17:28:16 2015 UTC,I already helped! Both Miggy and Donaldson deserve to be starting the all star game!
motorcitykitties,3armzy,JeremyD_19,4,Tue Jun 23 18:13:18 2015 UTC,Cabby already passed hosmer. Interesting plan though.
motorcitykitties,3armzy,muynahte,14,Mon Jun 22 23:23:56 2015 UTC,Lets keep him there. Still a close race.  Edit: Not as close as I thought. Bet we can get Iglesias and Cespedes into starting spots though.

motorcitykitties,3as63k,PopWhatMagnitude,2,Tue Jun 23 02:06:21 2015 UTC,I love how every time this is mentioned people say it's because they have a great fan base in KC. If I recall correctly KC couldn't even fill half the stadium before last year when we played them and when they did most of them were opposing team fans
motorcitykitties,3as63k,deadlytitanfart,3,Tue Jun 23 12:04:49 2015 UTC,Winning can make any city a great fan base. Except Miami. Nobody cares.
motorcitykitties,3as63k,mikeoley,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:40:40 2015 UTC,Those aren't fans. They're bandwagoners. Big difference.
motorcitykitties,3as63k,irishcreamdreamteam,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:33 2015 UTC,so do we keep voting for the Royals players or focus our votes on other positions now?

motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Cest_La_Vie21,5,Tue Jun 23 02:20:08 2015 UTC,Aye.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,bravo_delta,10,Tue Jun 23 02:40:02 2015 UTC,That's why we have insurance runs!
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,1859,7,Tue Jun 23 02:23:53 2015 UTC,We need a lefty reliever.  Fil Coak just declined a minor league deal from the Blue Jays to enter free agency.   You know you want to see it happen.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,7,Tue Jun 23 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"Just in terms of me liking a player, I always felt Coke was a real genuine guy. I hope he can figure something out."
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,AliceCoopersLiver,6,Tue Jun 23 00:29:26 2015 UTC,He's probably better than Krol and Gorzo.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Rbaner,4,Tue Jun 23 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Cheap upgrade that we have to give up nothing for, and you know Phil will show up in playoffs."
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,9,Tue Jun 23 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"87 mph fastball... And Kyle Ryan is doing his best Kenny Rogers impersonation.   Only less talented.    Get it together, sir."
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,9,Tue Jun 23 00:34:33 2015 UTC,Ugh. I just remembered that the Indians play that stupid Mario coin noise whenever they score.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Rbaner,9,Tue Jun 23 00:35:09 2015 UTC,Yessir
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Rbaner,5,Tue Jun 23 00:51:09 2015 UTC,Yes Sir!

motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,9,Tue Jun 23 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, Brad is not hesitating on this one.  Kipnis coming up, and Hardy the lefty coming in.  That's a bold move, Cotton, let's see how it works out."
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Rbaner,7,Tue Jun 23 01:08:54 2015 UTC,Brad seems to be taking out pitchers a lot quicker recently.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,4,Tue Jun 23 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Hardy is the right one to bring in."
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,iamadacheat,7,Tue Jun 23 01:15:33 2015 UTC,I LIKE KITTIES

motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Cest_La_Vie21,7,Tue Jun 23 00:39:30 2015 UTC,It's time for Bauer to hit the showers
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,sikeston,9,Tue Jun 23 00:41:59 2015 UTC,Just curious: is there any practical difference between a concave and convex tip of a bat?
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,ahmc84,8,Tue Jun 23 00:56:08 2015 UTC,I think it's mostly about weight vs. length.  The concave tip allows the bat to be a little longer without going overweight.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,ReturnOf_TheHack,6,Tue Jun 23 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"It effects how the weight of the bat balances, there's no real advantage to either way, but it does feel different in your hands and when you swing."

motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,YourGingerness7,7,Tue Jun 23 02:48:24 2015 UTC,Here's hoping that our Tribe killers continue to hit well coming into this series. Especially how encouraging it would be for VMart to have a great series. Cabrera just kinda needs to do Cabrera things and we should come out of this series with a series win.

motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,fantasyfest,6,Tue Jun 23 00:52:06 2015 UTC,Is Bauer always this damn slow? Glad Vmart drilled a double. Now they will put a pitcher in who isn't sleep walking.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,toastdispatch,5,Tue Jun 23 00:55:24 2015 UTC,That was a long half inning.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,ABonzaiBanshee,6,Tue Jun 23 00:55:28 2015 UTC,Anyone else think Iglesias looks a little bit like Marcus Mariota?
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,FakeyFaked,5,Tue Jun 23 01:03:31 2015 UTC,Having a big lead makes me feel better about Joba in the 8th.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,mobius160,6,Tue Jun 23 01:22:23 2015 UTC,I feel sorry for the royals fans. Their game just started. Fuck west coast games.
motorcitykitties,3aqyw3,Redemption_Unleashed,12,Tue Jun 23 02:13:05 2015 UTC,No. Never feel sorry for Royals fans.

motorcitykitties,3aru6h,Outofthewild,4,Tue Jun 23 01:27:39 2015 UTC,It's pathetic how long he was such a major piece of our bullpen and now he can't even keep a job.  Says a lot about how terrible our pen has been.
motorcitykitties,3aru6h,Rbaner,2,Tue Jun 23 02:06:41 2015 UTC,He wasn't awful last year.
motorcitykitties,3aru6h,ShakeItTilItPees,2,Tue Jun 23 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Oh sure HIS ERA isn't bad but everyone else's is crap cause of him. He led the league last year with 19 inherited runners allowed to score.  To me that isn't getting your job done and is pretty awful.

Listen, Joba needs to split time with someone else for the 8th.  There is just no doubt on that for me.  Have Hardy and Joba both have setup duties depending on the batter coming maybe?    He's benched Castellanos.  And I'm not even sure that's the right move.  I don't blame him for it, but it's not like he has an answer in Romine.  He might be the sub's new DKB, but let's be honest with ourselves for just a moment and acknowledge that DKB was not a great hitter.    I like that this is a team that runs now.  I don't hate his gameplanning.  But I'm a little doubtful on his ability to get the respect out of the players that Leyland was able to command.    What I do have faith in, is DD making a trade that will improve this team before the deadline.  And that is a reason to be hopeful."

Houston and Washington are both in pennant races, they likely aren't selling .300 hitters.  I'd bet it's more likely to get a utility IF with a lefty bat who is marginal at hitting.  (Tyler Collins or Moya for Cody Asche would work here?  What do you think?)  I don't think Cueto is out of the realm of possibility though.  Or he could always try to get a bullpen lefty, but that seems to be a lot harder to do for him lately."

He has absolutely made some mind boggling mistakes (ie bullpen usage in the playoffs) but overall I think he's done a pretty good job in his first 1.4ish seasons.

This guy can't manage worth a shit!""  And then Joba (or whoever) throws a clean inning and we all forget about it. If we win we don't go into the post-game threads and go ""Hey, props to Ausmus! Joba was clearly the man in that situation! Good management!""  We only remember the bad moves.

But has anyone looked at our record against the AL central this season under Brad (22-12, best in the div and we will be getting back into our divisional match-ups down the stretch)? We are a little further behind KC then even id like to see but I'm a little surprised by this reaction... Well actually no I'm not.  In the preseason prediction thread a few months back I said we'd hit a rough patch (happens literally every year) and folks would throw Ausmus under the bus. We wanted to fire Leyland too, remember? It is easy to understand the frustration but what the hell do you all want? DD to completely throw the stability and leadership hierarchy of the clubhouse out the window and say: ""well I'm just gonna regularly fire managers until one that I pick will do amazing for the entirety of the season and win the World Series within the first 1.5 years of his tenure.""?????? Ausmus won the central in his first year as manager and is, in his second year, managing a team with diminished talent in the rotation and on offense, and that doesn't even account for the injuries. We have one of the most difficult schedules in one of the most competitive divisions. If you think he is gonna get canned this year if the Tigers miss the playoffs, you're smoking drugs."
motorcitykitties,3ans6g,smellthatsmell,0,Mon Jun 22 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think Ausmus is a better than average manager, but he's not the guy for the Tigers. Ausmus needs to be at a young team like KC, LAD, or CHC. The Tigers need a veteran manager like Francona or Ron Washington. And yeah, I do think Ausmus gets the blame for how the team is going. He's had an average amount of injuries, and with the talent he has, his team should have a better record."
motorcitykitties,3ans6g,smellthatsmell,2,Mon Jun 22 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"True, they have had an average amount of injuries but the players that were injured hurt us. They were our big names. As for the young team thing, Detroit is, on average, younger than every team you mentioned, and is 7th youngest in the MLB. You want Francona whose team is dramatically underperforming in relation to the preseason hype and who is managing an ""older squad""????? Or Wash who had struggled mightily (worst season in history) with his young squad and then stepped down due to off-field transgressions? We lost more talent than we gained in the off-season and we have many new guys who are getting their first big league reps. Ausmus is learning and growing with them."

motorcitykitties,3an3tq,doc_oct,36,Sun Jun 21 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"Ausmus moved him up to second for a couple games but he did really poorly there and so he got moved back down to ninth. Of course his spot in the lineup probably has nothing to do with his production and two games is not a large enough sample size to draw any conclusions. So the real reason he's not batting second is because baseball players/managers are superstitious.   He has a high OBP but a poor slugging percentage so clearly he should be in a spot where he can be driven in, rather than driving other runners in. So if you are not going to bat him 1st or 2nd, then 9th is the next best place."

motorcitykitties,3an3tq,clown_pants,16,Mon Jun 22 00:44:15 2015 UTC,By the way seems like he'd better be an all star    You couldn't be more correct
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,ProfessorElTigre,6,Sun Jun 21 21:59:57 2015 UTC,I feel like part of the reason it could just be where he is comfortable batting and moving him up in the lineup could put too much stress on him.  Also it is a good move to have good hitters spread throughout the lineup and not just stockpile the front end.
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,dan-o07,2,Sun Jun 21 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"I don't tend to think that spreading good hitters is generally a good idea. Spreading players with high OBP + SLG not only increases the chances that that particular player will be left on base, but also makes it easier for opposing pitchers to intentionally walk one good player to leave a mediocre one behind him to pitch to.  I think the better rationale in this case is to have a good player to turn the order back to the top for them to be able to bring someone home without actually delaying the spot in the order for good base stealers such as Davis (so he can leadoff the game) or pushing players like MCabrera or VMartinez further down. This is also helped by what /u/seanmac2 pointed out elsewhere- he has a high OBP and low SLG so he should be placed somewhere other batters are more likely to help him along without relying on him driving home players from first."
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,IAmNateHello,4,Mon Jun 22 01:35:10 2015 UTC,A good guy at the bottom of the lineup that can turn things over to the top is very valuable. He is the perfect kinda guy for that job.
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,flexfulton,4,Sun Jun 21 23:54:54 2015 UTC,"Jose is comfortable in the nine hole and there's a lot of good reasons to hit a good hitter 9th. Average is also commonly reported because it's easy to understand, but if you dig a little deeper it really sucks as a stat. A Home run and a bloop single are both hits and aid a hitter's average, but they are completely different outcomes to a swing (great contact vs poor contact).   You're right when you say they interact with the top of the lineup. In a Sabremetric lineup the worst hitter is usually 8th. Although the Tigers' lineup is not necessarily 100% Sabermetricly balanced, it's still better for the overall health of the Tigers batting order. This is evidenced especially in NL baseball in which the Pitcher batting 8th is clearly advantageous over a pitcher batting 9th SOURCE. He also doesn't hit for much extra base power, so generally those players in non-saber lineups tend to hit lower.  Jose's comfort. He's hit 9th all year and hit well there. Baseball is a very mental game, and anything that could throw him out of his mindset is possibly a bad thing. BABIP. (Batting Average on Balls In Play). The best part about baseball over football IMHO is that sample sizes are large enough for us to make statistical analysis of a hitter and better predict on when they are going through ""hot"" and ""cold"" streaks. Iggy has a BABIP ca. .360 right now. Most ML hitters have a BABIP around .300. This tells us that Jose has hit a lot of balls that have blooped for a base hit or have been ""seeing eye singles."" That's not to say Jose doesn't have any skill with the stick, but rather he's been a bit lucky. Given enough PA's his BABIP will likely fall back to around .300 and thus his avg will drop.  Plate Discipline stats. Jose's contact% has been 10-11% better than league average (80% vs 91%). He is also SMASHING balls at a 98.2 % z-contact% (Inside contact%). If I were an opposing P, I would not throw anything over the plate on the inside third. Jose has not missed there pretty much all season. If/when Pitchers figure this out, and start showing him inside with the hard stuff but going away with soft stuff his average will likely decrease.  His contact rates are also likely not going to continue at that pace, but holy cow before I looked it up I had no idea he was owning the inner third so much.  Similar to his discipline is his LD% (Line-Drive %) or how many line drives he has hit. Generally, a line drive is a hard hit ball, even if its caught its indicative of great hitting and hitters hit over .680 average on them. Granted what is considered a ""Line-drive"" is sometimes subjective, but it gives us a decent idea, especially combined with BABIP. Jose's LD% is 25.0 % which is approximately 4-5% above league average. Combined with his high BABIP, it shows that his average is likely not sustainable.  Jose's career as a hitter hasn't been that good. His ML numbers are serviceable, but certainly not that of a .300 hitter.    I see Iggy certainly as an All-Star this year, and as much as I would love for him to hit as well as he has, I think a .270 or better average for Jose would be fantastic, and a great sign for the Tigers and our lovable SS.  Or this all could be bunk and Iggy could have a career 370 BABIP, and 30% LD%. I'd be okay with that. =)  I got the numbers from FanGraphs by the way. They have a better explanation on all of these stats on their website if you want a good read."
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,LuminousRaptor,3,Mon Jun 22 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"Not saying Cabrera is an average hitter, or even that they are similar hitters. But Cabrera has a BABIP of ~.375 and that seems to be about normal. I would say using league averages for a stat like BABIP isn't a good choice to judge luck. A better representation of the data would be his career BABIP compared to his BABIP this year."
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,YourGingerness7,2,Mon Jun 22 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"Normally, I'd agree with you, but the problem with comparing Jose to his career BABIP is that he really only has one major league season under his belt. His BABIP in the minors is around league average in most cases. .290 in Rookie league, .299 in AAA etc. (I took the two stints where he had the most PA's).   His MLB career BABIP is .336 in 675 PA. There is a chance that he just has a high career BABIP and it's not a fluke, but it's really high for it not to be. IIRC 690 PA's is about batting 5th every day for a year. So it's really only one full year of stats on him. Given that Cabby is 13th all time in BABIP, it's not likely that Iggy is that much of a standard divination away from the mean. .290-.310 BABIP, I'd argue, should be about where you'd sill see Iggy end up.    Cabrera on the other hand has got a high BABIP because he's Miggy and as we all know, He's a beast/freak of nature with lumber in his hands."
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,LuminousRaptor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:12:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys.  Definitely learned a lot.  Luminous Raptor's response was obviously particularly informative.  And I'll add one other thing, hopefully not too controversial.  LuminousRaptor said at one point that he likes baseball because the sample numbers are higher so you can get more legit stats... obviously true.  But my take is that baseball tends to be a bit less controllable than football.  It seems that proper decision making and execution in football have a higher likelihood of leading to a given outcome than in baseball.  Obviously there's the other team in your way, but in baseball even a nearly perfectly approached game/at bat has a somewhat low chance of working out (maybe except guys having insane periods of their careers like Kershaw the last few years, or Verlander a few years back).  For instance, even Miggy's batting average says he hits 1 in 3 balls (or SLIGHTLY more), and he's a GREAT hitter.  A bad QB in the NFL has a 50% completion rate, a good one hits on 2 in 3 passes.  Anyway, very different games, love 'em both (actually Tigers were my first love in 1984 as a little kid)."
motorcitykitties,3an3tq,fantasyfest,0,Mon Jun 22 22:41:47 2015 UTC,He was projected to be a good field/no hit player. His ave was predicted to be about 225. So they slotted him in that spot and he has hit very well. That is not an argument to move him when we had a couple speedsters hitting well at the top already.

Besides, there is very little chance that Cincy will get Cueto to resign, which means they'll use a lot of the resources to resign Chapman or at least use him as trade bait to get A LOT from offering teams, which we just don't have."
motorcitykitties,3alt5o,phineasxaver,3,Sun Jun 21 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"I think our lack of solid left handed relievers is a systemic issue. I mean, name a great bullpen guy the Tigers have developed in house. You can't. So on occasion, we buy a guy like Soria or Benoit, but the majority of our bullpen is awful because we can't develop pitchers. As a system, we're pretty terrible at developing pitchers. Whatever the Rays are doing with their relief pitching prospects, we need to do that. Sign a coach or an executive away from them.. that'll do a lot more than trading for one bullpen arm.  Plus, we don't really have much left on the farm to trade. I'd rather not give up Farmer or Collins for a bullpen arm.. we might actually need those guys next year if Cespedes and Price walk in free agency."

motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,DetroitBreakdown,10,Sat Jun 20 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Way to go Max!! Still got a no-no!! I don't care that he doesn't pitch for us anymore, he is still one of my favorite players and will always be. He earned every bit of this one!"
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,dbenoos,23,Sat Jun 20 23:24:29 2015 UTC,I'll be honest. I thought Max was going to drop back to being just a good pitcher after he got that massive contract. His career stats hadn't shown him to be deserving of that contract based on just one season.  I'm going to 1000% eat my words right now. Max is having an absolutely phenomenal season and absolutely earning the massive contract he received right now.
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,Brady_Hokes_Headset,15,Sat Jun 20 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"From 2012-2014, Max was 5th in the mlb in fWAR. He also lead the league in strike outs and was just a hair behind Kershaw in K-BB% for first. He was truly an elite pitcher. I'm not sure what this ""one great year"" nonsense is from."
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,Lucascabucas,5,Sun Jun 21 00:31:44 2015 UTC,"He'll be 37 by the end of the contract and he sure as hell hasn't earned $210 million yet.  If it was just a one year $30 million contract, the Tigers would have been happy to have him back."
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,EnigmaticHats,14,Sun Jun 21 06:49:15 2015 UTC,"Bush league by Tabata, intentionally getting hit while down 6-0.  He earned the real hit by pitch he's going to get tomorrow."
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,Zergei_Fedorov,8,Sat Jun 20 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"Fuck that guy. Max fan or not, you just don't do that.  I hope he gets plenty of shit from his own club for that classless move."

motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,DetroitBreakdown,7,Sat Jun 20 22:54:35 2015 UTC,Here's a Vine loop. He definitely could have avoided that pitch. I'd be pissed if Scherzer was still a Tiger and Tobata pulled that shit.

motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,clubchalupa,2,Sun Jun 21 00:38:08 2015 UTC,Thanks - it sure looks like he leaned into that.  Bush league.
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,DetroitBreakdown,-3,Sun Jun 21 00:20:28 2015 UTC,That's on Max.  Bitches should stop whining.
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,EnigmaticHats,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"It was an inside pitch, sure, but he blatantly lowered his elbow into it. I guess if a pitcher gets in ths situation again that they avoid anything inside."

We are pretty boned with all these huge contracts and no farm."
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,cliffhanger1983,-1,Sun Jun 21 06:08:14 2015 UTC,We should have kept him.
motorcitykitties,3ajvbl,SilentStryk09,3,Sat Jun 20 23:05:29 2015 UTC,Not at that price tag with all the other big contracts we already have. There's still a VERY good chance Max regresses just as JV did very soon.
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,Dwychwder,6,Sat Jun 20 23:12:47 2015 UTC,1 hit in two games. One.   Damn Walgreens.

motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,jbillzz33,5,Sun Jun 21 03:41:59 2015 UTC,Thank you! Max appreciates it.
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,bronwynsings,2,Sun Jun 21 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"I miss Max, no question. I also miss Austin Jackson and Torii Hunter. But undoubtedly, he's having a much better time playing for the Nats, batting and baserunning. He's batting ~220 for christ sake. I'm glad to see him so absolutely pumped to just be playing, every time he starts."
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,sha256,3,Sun Jun 21 00:14:04 2015 UTC,I don't miss Torii. He's an asshole.

motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,beautifulcock7,5,Sun Jun 21 00:34:24 2015 UTC,He also said he was taken out of context in that statement.
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,sha256,8,Sun Jun 21 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"I miss Max, too, but I think keeping him would have been a mistake. They had already committed to pay Verlander huge money at a time where he was still dominant. What if, in two years, Scherzer starts to struggle like JV has? What if JV is still struggling? Do you want $412 million worth of injured, ineffective pitching on your roster?  The Nats are going to be paying Scherzer until 2028. That's ridiculous. Is it worth it? I say no.  That said, I still think JV can come back and be effective again. Maybe not Cy Young + MVP dominant, but effective enough to be #1/#2 in the rotation. His velocity has been decent, and he's had some good bite on his breaking pitches. He's only had two starts after coming back from his first ever DL stint, and before that being injured for nearly two years. Give it a little time before you give up on him."
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,SodiumThoride,3,Sun Jun 21 00:44:35 2015 UTC,"that, plus $30mil of aging cabrera coming down the pipeline.  It'll be fucking awesome if he goes all ageless wonder on us, but i'm not banking on it."
motorcitykitties,3ajzxa,SilentStryk09,9,Sun Jun 21 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"Of all of them, I mind paying Cabrerra the least.  Talent like that, you pay for that.  And it tends to age better than a power pitcher."

motorcitykitties,3aj5qq,MichiganMulletia,4,Sat Jun 20 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yesss. YESSSS. This would fit nicely into my evil plans.   People forget that baseball is a marathon, not a sprint. My gramps, god rest his baseball obsessed soul, taught me to not even pay close attention to the standings until after all star break because it'll just drive you friken bonkers. SO when it's late July and we're still six games back, then I'll start worrying. Until then everyone needs to chill the fuck out and enjoy the fact that we're in baseball season and winter is half a year away and almost any time we want we can watch the sport we all love."
motorcitykitties,3akn43,wiseprogressivethink,3,Sun Jun 21 03:17:56 2015 UTC,And the one hit was a little bloop and the hbp was just Tabata BS. He's basically been perfect in his last 2 starts.

motorcitykitties,3ak05r,WheresCarlisle,4,Sat Jun 20 23:15:47 2015 UTC,I've listed a bunch of significant stuff that happened. If you need further explanation feel free to ask.    Miggy hit #400.  Bullpen sucks. Greene sucked (He's in Toledo now).  Casty looks bad. Iggy is still an amazing defensive SS. Kins is meh. Cespedes is pretty good. JD is good.  Royals = AL all stars.  Miggy is still awesome. Price is a good pitcher.  Lobstein on the DL.  Alex Wilson is actually Chris Pratt.
motorcitykitties,3ak05r,Rbaner,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"Hey I broke my arm playing baseball last season, more specifically my shoulder.. it basically sent my life into a tailspin. Almost a year later and I still have certain struggles with it but it's just about back to normal.   This season has been pretty rough. Its like they can score 2-3 runs, or 8+ runs, but nothing in between. Each game probably averages about 7 scoreless innings, almost all of them being 1-2-3's. They started off 11-2 which got everyone really excited for a great year but they've been painful to watch because:  ○  Lacklustre starting pitching with the exception of D. Price.    ○ Shit offence. It's sad to say it because this is a very capable team, but it has been so bad this year. Miggy is keeping the offence on life support. We were and probably still are #1 for double plays turned into. The bottom of the line up is mostly playing like trash.   ○ Breaking the wrong records. Shane Greene gave up 5 homers in less than 2 innings.. hasn't happened since 1900. Tigers had the longest losing streak in over a decade (9).   ○  They seem to play like they feel sorry for themselves. They look defeated before they already are. Right now they're losing 10-0 in bottom of the 4th.   ○  they keep it up and they'll miss the playoffs, guaranteed. It just looks like it's so easy to contain our offence and break through our pitching staff.  ○  The defence has been better than previous years, but our pitching has been worse."

They say Tex grounded into the fielders choice/error that resulted in the run, but are showing the video of A-Rod doing that.  This is weird.  IMHO MLB Gameday is usually way better than ESPN Gamecast.  But the fact that they have V-Mart walking when he actually popped out is concerning.  Almost everything from the bottom of the first and top of the second is incorrect, such as listing Csepedes as lining out and McCann getting a single."
motorcitykitties,3ajii8,7MOV7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:13:55 2015 UTC,"Also, the stats at the top of the thread are also wrong.  Looks like it's pulling the data from the incorrect MLB Gameday."

motorcitykitties,3ag80y,DozeNutz,2,Sat Jun 20 00:18:10 2015 UTC,I can't really give any more information on it without spoiling it. But yeah all the games have some sort of connection. Infinite doesn't quite catch up to 1 in story (but then again what could) But its gameplay is also amazeballs.   Also the 2 short dlc's really tie the end of infinite into an even tighter knot.

motorcitykitties,3agzow,TigersBot,14,Sat Jun 20 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"This should be a good team, but this is not a good team.  Don't come at me and say its a long season, and there is still plenty of baseball left.  You fools will be saying that till the last game of the season when we are 2 games out of the second wild card spot.  It's like you people think no game is really important until mid-late September.  Guess what, the first game of the season is just as important as every other game of the season up until you clinch your division.  This team is not good.  I pray I eat my words, but I don't believe I will."
motorcitykitties,3agzow,larrykins,5,Sat Jun 20 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"It's a long season...they have plenty of time to be farther than 2 games out from the second wild card.  My wife laughs at me because I have been turning the games off early. She says that they can always come back to win. But, I have my ""Tiger Rules"":   The Tigers will do most of their scoring (2 runs) in the first 2-3 innings. Beyond that it will be missed opportunities, usually heartbreaking. Situations such as bases-loaded with no outs and not being able to score,  a base running blunder, or the ever popular DP will occur. The Tigers will not mount any comeback once they get behind in the score. If it is before the 3rd inning they may tie it back up to see the lead lost permanently sometime around the 5th inning. The Tigers may tease you of a comeback, but the bullpen will blow it just as the offense gets the score close. They will blow it big too. Otherwise, the bullpen will be solid - but it doesn't matter because of the anemic offense or... When the starting pitching fails, it fails big - usually these are the games the offense is able to score more than 2 runs, but never enough to cover the scoring gap of the meatballs the starter is serving.   But I still tune in to every game. I'm a sucker. Each new game I just hope that ""this will be the one that starts the awesome winning streak"", or at least something better than .500 play.  My guess is that Wally Joyner gets the boot first. I'm not saying it is his fault, but, he is the easiest to point a finger at."
motorcitykitties,3agzow,midnite8177,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:18:38 2015 UTC,On paper we are good. But something isn't clicking. I don't want to point fingers at Brad but something isn't right with this team.
motorcitykitties,3agzow,TacticalDesire,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"We are a .500 team and I think we'll be a .500 team come the end of the year as well.  We have obvious holes in our game that teams continue to exploit.  Last year at least we could count on our starting pitching to make it competitive, but this year we don't even have that option.  Some of our guys are starting to play back to their historical levels (Kinsler) and others just are not developing (Casti)  Think there are some things that we need to come to terms with.   Our window is shut and even if we make it to the wildcard, us going deep into the playoffs is not going to happen.  We should think about retooling. Cy Young Verlander is no longer there and while he is still good, he is not going to dominate games like he used to.  He's following the same decline as other aging pitchers and combine that with him not being a guy that likes to study his opponents, he's going to have a rough time. Casti has no right being an every day third baseman with the way he is playing and he is not developing.  Either give him a stint in Toledo to work on his game or start rotating him in. We need to shake things up, if that's with the players, coaches, whatever but the team is lacking a sense of urgency and needs a wake up. DD has to take some of the heat from this.  I know he's done amazing things to make trades, but two years in a row we have had a weak bullpen and there haven't been nearly enough attention from him to strengthen it. The fact that Miggy continues to hit .345 and beat teams is in no small part a miracle and we should be thankful that we get to watch him perform magic every night. Even though I think we don't have a prayer of making the playoffs, I'll be there....every night....cheering on this team...."
motorcitykitties,3agzow,allyallmfersneed___,0,Sat Jun 20 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing.  We are a good team, we should be a good team.

I like Brad I think he can be and is a good manager, but him or someone else needs to figure something out"

motorcitykitties,3afubf,AliceCoopersLiver,2,Sat Jun 20 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"Mostly sharp, but gave up two home runs on two meatballs.   Has mostly stayed ahead in the count, but either hasn't ratcheted up his velocity or just can't yet."

I think we should get Avila back and looking good, and then move him for a piece or two before the deadline. Holaday is a solid backup. McCann has proven himself both at the plate and behind it."

motorcitykitties,3afubf,dirty_drunk,0,Sat Jun 20 01:32:59 2015 UTC,Left him in for 117 pitches in his second start back.... And its not just tonight....He cant handle the pitchers...(Price in Anaheim 2 weeks ago comes instantly to mind)

motorcitykitties,3afubf,dirty_drunk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:40:59 2015 UTC,A) pitcher-batter matchups are rarely if ever statistically sound as they are always small sample sizes and B) first you say that he left Verlander in too long and now not long enough?  Make up your mind
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,0,Sat Jun 20 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yes he left him in too long...but since he left him in, he may as well let him face Tex.  So is your position that Ausmus is a good manager? or are you just arguing he's not  a bad manager?"
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense.  If 117 pitches is too many for Verlander, you don't know how many Texeira will take.  He averaged 4 per batter, so let's say 4 more pitches.  So if your argument is that leaving Verlander in that long is unsafe because it is his second start back, how is leaving him in 4 pitches longer a good idea at all?  Not to mention that Tex bats worse as a righty which is a much more significant data set than a matchup against a pitcher he has faced 8 times."
motorcitykitties,3afubf,GraemeTaylor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:01:02 2015 UTC,"Verlander is a work horse, asked Brad to leave him in, got the ground ball that should have gotten him out of the inning save for a bad bounce, and has mostly looked OK (in an actual stadium he would have given up 0 HRs).  Not to mention that two days ago, you used your entire bullpen save Gorzo, and they all threw at least 14 pitches, so you need your starter to go deep.  As far as the Price game in Anaheim goes, I'll remind you that a) Price was out of that inning if not for an error and B) Joba gave up the actual tie breaking hit.  So both of those were the correct decisions"
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,0,Sat Jun 20 01:47:19 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's a flyout in any other stadium
motorcitykitties,3afubf,ZombieHitchens2012,-1,Sat Jun 20 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"Please don't shower me with down votes, but between this and the other start I am almost certain Verlander is done for."
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,4,Sat Jun 20 01:48:23 2015 UTC,If you think tonight is an indicator of a problem with Verlander then you weren't watching the game
motorcitykitties,3afubf,ZombieHitchens2012,0,Sat Jun 20 01:49:52 2015 UTC,He gave up three home runs dude. Lol.
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,4,Sat Jun 20 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"In Yankee stadium, all of which were to super shallow right/right-center field.  Those would all have been fly outs in CoPa"
motorcitykitties,3afubf,ZombieHitchens2012,2,Sat Jun 20 02:02:39 2015 UTC,Ah I'm sorry. I'll just discount those home runs that put up 4 runs on the board.
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,0,Sat Jun 20 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they don't count as runs, but if you're calling Verlander done because he gave up 3 HRs that would be flyouts in literally any other ballpark then you are a fool"
motorcitykitties,3afubf,ZombieHitchens2012,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:09:25 2015 UTC,I'm not calling him done. I'm just being objective and saying he was part of the reason we lost.
motorcitykitties,3afubf,Robot_Satan,0,Sat Jun 20 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"Sure he's part of the reason we lost, but the bigger issue this game was the lack of offense.  Verlander, all things considered, looked good. Still needs that swing and miss stuff but going deep in the game and staying ahead in the count are good signs.  That, and he needs to not deflect ground balls"
motorcitykitties,3afubf,cliffhanger1983,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:15:28 2015 UTC,I thought he left some pitches over the middle of the plate for those home runs. I'm not ready to write him off but I think we should not have high expectations.
