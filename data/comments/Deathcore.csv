Deathcore,3e49v1,averylowe,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:53 2015 UTC,He was the bassist?! Everyone has been posting pictures of the vocalist...  Edit: never mind he was the vocalist of apparitions. Sorry for your loss buddy
Deathcore,3e49v1,deathcannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I remember when he was in The Blood Countess right before they all joined KOTA. My buddy Nick Florence, the guitarist of Knights, was there when Griffin died."

Deathcore,3e3ut5,MeBeEric,3,Tue Jul 21 19:20:47 2015 UTC,FUCK............YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!  I'm ready for a new album.  This was goddamn brutal.  Definitely one of my favorite bands ever.
Deathcore,3e2rm7,Imatomat,7,Tue Jul 21 14:47:44 2015 UTC,Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
Deathcore,3e2rm7,GhostyMcGee,6,Tue Jul 21 14:55:51 2015 UTC,Alex knows how to kill it live. He's definitely one of my favorite vocalists due to his live performances.
Deathcore,3e2rm7,darkb1999,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"His stage presence, especially with Black Tongue is absolutely insane. He's one of those vocalists that just has the crowd completely under his control. When they were opening in London for Suicide Silence a year or so ago, during Coma near the breakdown he beckoned into the mic ""Everyone is a target"" which led to 2 or so minutes of utter pit brutality. Still one of my absolute favourite gig experiences to date."

Deathcore,3e2rm7,Sidthesloth63,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:26 2015 UTC,You'd think by now they would have a better way for the drummer to do his vocals than him leaning back and twisting his neck like that.
Deathcore,3e2rm7,CarnitasWhey,2,Tue Jul 21 23:32:34 2015 UTC,I don't get how people DISLIKE the new CG album. This song is awesome and has a my damnation (album) feel. Smh
Deathcore,3e2rm7,nintendonate64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously!! When I listen to this song I think that even if this was the only purely brutal song on the album, which it wasn't,  people still couldn't say Chelsea grin isn't ""heavy"" anymore."
Deathcore,3e2rm7,ElijWill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a lot of statements along the lines of ""they aren't heavy"" but more so of ""they sold out"" or just vague ""it's shit"".

There are a couple questions I have, though:   What gave this guy the nickname ""dad""/""father""? What made him so influential, so that everyone is posting about it on social media?   Regardless, he'll be missed.  RIP."

Deathcore,3dyozc,jumpeduppantrygirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:46 2015 UTC,Cool. Is stage diving or crowd surfing allowed? I'm assuming not.
Deathcore,3dyozc,cg001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:51 2015 UTC,Saw both. It's really small venue though so keep that in mind that even if you do crowd surf your looking at 10 feet

Honestly I'd pretty much only go for Lorna Shore, and while I've already seen Black Tongue, I suppose I'd love to see their new stuff live.  On the other hand, I've heard the Carnifex is one of the best live deathcore bands out there. I'm not a huge fan of them specifically, but I feel like I would owe it to the genre itself to behold them live."

Then they follow that up with the song 'Bring a gun to school' that goes beyond poor taste and into 'you're just trying to stir shit up'.

Deathcore,3ds02o,danny_fiasco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:12:34 2015 UTC,It is also my favorite song of this album. It just crushes.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,AncientCycle,8,Sat Jul 18 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"They're pretty cookie cutter deathcore to me. Ascendants was really good but most of their songs are very generic. Blast Beats -> Breakdown, rinse and repeat. They're fucking sick live though."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,ParaTC,8,Sat Jul 18 20:07:12 2015 UTC,Whatever you rate them +1 for Adam  Warren. That or he'll smash your skull in.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,NickIsTheMan,7,Sat Jul 18 19:11:05 2015 UTC,3/5
Deathcore,3dr9n7,-Micah-,10,Sat Jul 18 21:57:22 2015 UTC,They're pretty good. Check out black tongue and whitechapel
Deathcore,3dr9n7,Spicypickels,12,Sat Jul 18 18:50:35 2015 UTC,They dont really stand out to me
Deathcore,3dr9n7,keepitcutthroat,3,Sat Jul 18 19:22:25 2015 UTC,I'd say a 6/10. Early shit was 9.5/10 though.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,wageslaver,5,Sun Jul 19 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"I liked all of their albums, even Incisions, I don't think they are generic at all, they have a recognizable sound to me, really fun band and their singer is pretty good."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,YourFaceIsARapeScene,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:19:20 2015 UTC,OCEANO was one of the first bands that got me into way heavier metal. I don't listen to them much anymore but they still seem to be doing well.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,JoesGonnaKillYou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"Ascendants was the first album I enjoyed by them (and I enjoy it quite a lot). But the rest of their discography doesn't do much for me. They're very popular, but I just think they chug too much and overall I think deathcore has a lot more to offer than what they do."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,trilogique,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:29 2015 UTC,I loved oceano since depths. But yea check out black tongue and white chapels first 3 cd's
Deathcore,3dr9n7,normcollison,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"I still listen to Depths from time to time. I didn't care much for Contagion, so I never bothered to keep up with any of their newer material."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,Lunacy869,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"Depths and the demos before that are really sick, the rest is eh (imo)"
Deathcore,3dr9n7,BloodOfTheMoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"one of my favorites, Incisions wasn't that amazing, but Ascendants makes up for it for sure, also contagion was amazing and i never really listened through depths enough to have an opinion on it."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,octopusbeak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:48:49 2015 UTC,I love the ridiculous chugs and that's why I love listening to Oceano. As far as deathcore goes Oceano is my go to shit along with I Declare War.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,mike90t09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"Very good. I listen to alot of their albums. Blast them on the road, but feel a little silly when nobody, not even me can understand a single word they're saying."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,MS2point0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"The new stuff is what makes me enjoy the band, other than that i dont have a real opinion on depths or contagion, Incisions is not even worth mentioning."
Deathcore,3dr9n7,ZHiiFt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:08 2015 UTC,Adam Warren is a monster but the music is generic chugcore
Deathcore,3dr9n7,breedofepicness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy Oceano. Kinda just got into them after seeing them live. They were really good. I get what people say about them being generic, however I don't care because they're like deathcore done right, even if generic. Also Adan Warren is a beast!!"
Deathcore,3dr9n7,HD_fight_club_Ryan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:22:15 2015 UTC,I rate them a 10.  They have a ridiculous brutality about them that I highly enjoy.  Ascendants is going to be on of my albums of the year.
Deathcore,3dr9n7,dspang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:18:07 2015 UTC,You might like Whitechapel or Thy Art Is Murder
Deathcore,3dr9n7,TomatoPasteContainer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:19 2015 UTC,After seeing them live i give them a 9/10. They have a serious stage presence
Deathcore,3dr9n7,HankHell23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:52 2015 UTC,"Love Oceano, and it really due to Warren's vocals."
Deathcore,3drdr4,JoesGonnaKillYou,3,Sat Jul 18 18:49:13 2015 UTC,These guys really don't get enough credit
Deathcore,3drdr4,pinned_down_and_fist,2,Sun Jul 19 01:26:49 2015 UTC,Cool. I got a new band I can obsess over for the next week and a half
Deathcore,3drdr4,woizard,2,Sat Jul 18 21:47:35 2015 UTC,My band is opening for these guys next Friday. Can't wait!
Deathcore,3drdr4,megustcizer,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:06 2015 UTC,This is a different Bermuda. These guy are Australian and have been broken up for years.

Deathcore,3drdr4,megustcizer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"yeah, Bermuda :D Tyrant is a cool EP"
Deathcore,3drdo9,JoesGonnaKillYou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:48:33 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuck yesssss I love this song.
Deathcore,3drdo9,LazerdongFacemelter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:26 2015 UTC,Shits so ca$h! Really I love this cd
Deathcore,3drnfd,ParaTC,0,Sat Jul 18 20:12:28 2015 UTC,It would appear the vocalist is a fan of Storm Strope. Haha
