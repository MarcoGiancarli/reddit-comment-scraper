If a large hunting cat saw prey in an open field pacing back and forth slowly,  the cat will likely assume it's lame or injured and strike as soon as it's back is turned.   Incidentally.  Never turn your back on a wild animal or one that is not happy with your existence."

We frequently joke about throwing the cat up (the stairs) until he gets tired out because otherwise he's just sooo hyper and wants to play.  More playing?  Why have you stopped playing?  Human..... Huuuuuuuuuuman.  Play?  You should play.  It's cute for a little while, he'll bring the toy closer.  And then closer to you.  And if you still haven't thrown it he'll bring it eeeven closer, making sure it clatters on the floor so you hear it.  (You couldn't possibly be ignoring him.)  Then he picks it up and puts it on your leg, helped by his paws and just a little bit of claw.  You can't really get mad at him, it's frikken adorable, but seriously cat, calm down. -.-"

My allergies used to include itchy and swelling eyes, constant sneezing, and as you might guess, a river of snot. I decided I really wanted a cat about 2 yrs ago so I got one. The first couple months were awful but my allergies did get better, and now they're gone with the help of Zyrtec and Mucinex Allergy. Now I have two kitties who sleep with me and the SO every night :)  All that said, I would ask your doctor about it first just in case."

AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,FlyingButtresses,468,Tue Jul 21 18:16:49 2015 UTC,Its more the unconditional love that doesnt randomly turn into unrelenting claws that i like in dogs.
AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,Aalnius,125,Tue Jul 21 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue people have with cats is expecting them to be dogs. We've bred dogs to be companion animals and as a byproduct, they are very good at understanding human signals and vice versa. Everyone knows what a wagging tail means, the dog gets excited if you say its name or babytalk it, etc- it's all very straightforward.   Cats are less facially expressive and have different reactions to body language. You can tell the cat is not liking you if it's hissing and its tail is fluffed up of course, but many of their moods/mannerisms are more subtle than the threat response. Many cats feel threatened by a stranger approaching it- which kind of makes sense. If someone you didn't know was going up to you and trying to pet you, you might be a bit weirded out. Cats are also not fans of eye contact from unfamiliar persons- they instinctively assume that interest = predator. The best thing you can do when meeting a new cat that is not being playful with you is ignore it, most of the time. They will often come check you out just out of curiosity. I've heard many stories where the guy who is ""not a cat person"" will do their best to ignore the cat, only to have it come up to them and start sniffing around. Also, if you do make eye contact with a cat and it's staring back at you, you can blink slowly and look away. Cats blink slowly at their owners/friends to show trust- it's saying ""I feel safe around you and I don't need to watch you."" Cats showing their belly is also a sign of trust: it's their most vulnerable part, so they are showing that they are very relaxed and comfortable. But it is not necessarily an invitation for belly pets, and many of them will reflexively ""rabbit kick"" to defend themselves (though my cat loves belly rubs- it is very much an individual temperament thing) If you're just petting a cat normally and you're unfamiliar with it, just stick with rubbing its head- cats rub faces together and groom each others' heads to show affection. Don't pick up an unfamiliar cat. When petting the cat, watch its body language. If it is laying down, eyes closed, purring- you're good. If it's tense, if the tail is twitching, or if it's making eye contact without blinking, it doesn't like what you're doing. Depending on individual temperament, some cats just get ""overly stimulated"" by too much / random petting across their body- stick to the head rubs!   There's really no ""randomness"" in cat-human behavior, the body language is just a little unintuitive. Once you learn to watch for the signs you will be fine with just about any cat*  *Note: I make no guarantees for how lions, tigers, jaguars etc will react to this body language guide"
AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,EdenBlade47,8,Tue Jul 21 15:19:04 2015 UTC,"This was very well written and laid out. I knew most of these at various times from all the research I did before I got my kittens, but it's nice to see a complete post that has all of it in one place. You obviously know your stuff."
AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,VenomC,4,Tue Jul 21 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"When I moved into my current apartment last August, there were four cats here. I had to learn quick if I wanted to be able to tolerate them. Now we're all friends, and I liked having cats around so much that I adopted my own :) Was definitely not a fan of them before this, mostly because I didn't know anyone with a cat and hadn't spent any extended time around one or met a friendly one."
AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,EdenBlade47,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:05 2015 UTC,That's the biggest thing. If you don't spend time around cats you only know the stereotypes. I can't tell you how many people say my cat is the exception to them not liking cats. It's not just mine... if they were to be around other well adjusted cats I'm sure they'd love them too. It's good to know their body language and little cues. Social skills are learned throughout our lives to create good relationships with people. You need good social skills with a cat to have a good relationship with them too. It's just with cats we need to do some research before we can understand them.
AnimalsBeingBros,3e28qi,VenomC,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:55 2015 UTC,Great post friend! I learned so much right now and as a long time dog owner/person I feel like playing with cats now.  There's a bobcat outside. Brb gonna not make eye contact and touch its face.

When I'm sitting on a lawn chair with my hand dangling, a couple of them would put their heads under my hand and start petting themselves with my hand."

Besides, if you want a dog get a dog, don't get a cat and expect it to behave like a dog. Enjoy feline companionship for what makes it special, their silly antics, their purring, their chirping, their skittishness, their cuddles, how they are intuitively attuned to your feelings and even though some of them might be d-bags to you at other times, they will always find the right way to comfort you when you need it."

This is the feel good chemical your brain releases when hugging or giving/receiving affection to someone / something.

AnimalsBeingBros,3dvgq5,VoraciousVegan,24,Mon Jul 20 12:35:14 2015 UTC,"To further this point, we had a boss of a cat when I was a kid. He was a tiny master in the house, always looking over things and looking after people.  When I would invariably annoy him, he'd simply, climb up on a perch, leave the room or go outside. If I persisted, he would grumble at me. If I was being particularly mischievous he would swat at me with claws retracted to tell me I need to back off. And the few times I didn't heed the warnings, i'd get a single swat with just enough claw to let me know who is king; he would then leave. I realise this now, but the most remarkable thing he'd do is he would always come back to me later and 'make up'. Smartest cat I've ever known."

AnimalsBeingBros,3dvgq5,hayadoin,53,Mon Jul 20 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think if the cat was prone to aggressive behavior the parents probably wouldn't let it around the baby in the first place. The cats body language suggests that it's comfortable with the baby and the home. My guess is that the cat was around while the mother was pregnant and had an idea of what was going on so when the baby came home the cat was like ""awh hairless kitten.""   Idk some animals just get that kids are tiny dumb humans and treat them accordingly. My sister and her family spent a week with me and while they were there I found a stray male cat. He was freaking huge. We brought him inside and gave him a baby wipe bath. My 3 year old niece loves animals and was constantly all over the cat loving on him and he just laid there and let her do whatever. He almost bit her once when she grabbed him too hard but he stopped himself halfway and licked her hand instead. My dog is not a fan of toddlers so I just don't take him around them"

Most animals are aware enough to know that tiny new humans are special and delicate just like kittens and puppies.  There is a slight risk of unintended smothering if the animal is allowed to sleep with the baby without someone watching over.  Fortunately these cute videos and pictures mean that supervision is in place, so all is well.  :-)"

He'd reach over pet her and she'd be like okay tiny person thingie, then one day he rolled over and tried to bite her! The cat was like wtf! He didn't have any teeth, so it just surprised her. After that she was very aware of him. The first time he crawled it was to get to her and she ran away like nope."

A sane, healthy and happy cat/dog doesn't go berserk for no reason.  I thank my parents for allowing me to bond with my pets, that's a treasure trove of knowledge no church or school teaches. Not to mention I would rather entrust my son 100x to my pets than to any apparently well-behaved human."
AnimalsBeingBros,3dvgq5,greatsircat,4,Mon Jul 20 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"No he's not. ""sane, healthy, and happy"" cats have most definitely injured babies. I personally know the parents of a child who had a very sweet, very affectionate cat that jumped into the babies crib one naptime and smothered the baby in less than a minute. Cats can harmlessly be attracted to the heat of a babies head and the warmth of their breath, especially in winter."

When I was a baby, he had a Doberman named Kitty(said the guy he got him from thought it was funny)  Kitty would stay by my crib and watch me, if he saw me start moving around at night, he'd go over to my dad's bed and place his paw on the bed, and press down on it to get it shaking(they had a waterbed) until my dad woke up, and went to check up on me. He'd tell kitty that I was okay, and Kitty would settle back down for the night.  Kitty was a good dog, when my dad couldn't keep him. He gave him to a friend that owned a ranch where he could spend the rest of his life."

You definitely are correct on the latter part of your comment: People should not give cats or kittens balls of foil to play with. (I think the bigger issue is that parts will break off and the cat is likely to ingest the pieces.) But the good news is that in searching for a source to support the claim that foil does not make a good cat toy, I found someone talking about a sturdy mylar ball made specifically for cats that's shiny and crinkly just like foil but much safer. So I shall pretend that that's what this cat and owner are playing with."

But Sailor had the cutest blue eyes that were kind of crossed like Lucy Lu's.  Sailor preferred paper and tin foil balls. She wouldn't play with actual balls or toys being tossed it was weird.

I found a bump on my 16 year old cat's chest and once the vet cleaned and shaved it there was a 1 inch swollen wound under it.  My younger cat must have caught a claw on his chest when they were wrestling.  I blame myself partially for being lazy about trimming their claws.
AnimalsBeingBros,3di5z1,kmcg103,2,Thu Jul 16 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"You can't blame yourself. I've had plenty of cats in my life and I've never kept their claws short. I've also never had this happen.

AnimalsBeingBros,3di5mu,Accountthree,25,Thu Jul 16 22:28:34 2015 UTC,They told you this so you wouldn't mess with fawns who are just hanging out until their mom comes back.
AnimalsBeingBros,3di5mu,Kellyscomments,15,Thu Jul 16 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"A deer will leave their young to sit in a field to hide in the grass or bushes or whatever for hours on end as they go graze and forage for food. The fawn will wait there for hours on end until the mother returns. If the mother can see or smell a person nearby, they will not return to their baby. However, they will not abandon it. They will simply wait until they can no longer sense danger, and then come back to retrieve it.   People started that rumour to prevent people from approaching deer fawn and spending time with them taking pictures and petting them. Often people think that the fawn has been abandoned after just watching it for 20 minutes, and abduct it thinking they are saving it when likely they are actually killing it.   What people should actually do is lightly pinch their skin into a tent, and see how quickly it returns to normal.  0.5 - 1 seconds it is probably perfectly fine. Come back after 24 hours to see if it's still there, probably won't be because the mother returned for it.  1 - 2 seconds bring it some water and make sure it drinks, come back after 24 hours. It may still be there, might not. If it is you can probably bring it into some sort of vet / wildlife rehab clinic where they can either rehydrate it and rehab it, or they may have to euthanize it which is still more humane then leaving it in the bush to starve.   2+ seconds and its pretty dehydrated and most likely actually abandoned. Likely won't make it so bring it somewhere as previously mentioned. Likely will be euthanized."

AnimalsBeingBros,3dae08,misterandon,14,Wed Jul 15 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"My malamute mix is just over 11 months, and goddamn is he stubborn.  He figured out around 7 months that if he didn't want to leave the park or if he felt kind of tired, he could just stop walking and there wasn't much I could do about it (other than carrying him home).  It's been 4 months of working on it-- predictable treats, unpredictable treats, rewards/lures/ignoring his behaviour, alternate routes, distractions, changing speed, waiting him out, whatever-- and sometimes he'll still just randomly decide ""NOPE, not today, woman. I'd rather stand still and stare at you or roll on the pavement than get any kind of treat or toy or praise.""  He's also discovered his voice-- he's always been talkative, but now he likes to bark and grumble at me as though telling me exactly what he wants, but not showing me, so it's a fun game of CYCLE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE THING SILLY DOG BABY MIGHT WANT, BECAUSE THIS AIN'T STOPPING UNTIL YOU SOLVE THE MYSTERY.  We're working on it.  It took me a while to figure out that ""ignoring it"" doesn't make northern breeds stop vocalizing, though.  Such a pain in the butt, but also the funniest, goofiest, most sociable, selectively smart dog in the world and I wouldn't trade that sass for just about anything."

AnimalsBeingBros,3dae08,misterandon,5,Wed Jul 15 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"They're high maintenance in terms of training and exercise, which is doggy, but I find their dispositions to be so cat-like.  Like, huskies and malamutes are some of the least eager to please breeds-- they can seem standoffish, stubborn, independent, and are probably not going to protect you from a burglar.  Pretty cat-like to me.  Which is also why I love them.  My mal mix is a pain in the ass and I (mostly) get a kick out of it."

She was also VERY protective, in a couple of ways -- when a guy tried to force his way into my sister's house she (the dog) went full on barking, showing fangs, growling, etc; but she also does things like change what side of the sidewalk she's on to stand between my sister and an approaching stranger, etc.  Stuff that's protective but not aggressive."

AnimalsBeingBros,3d13k2,TrustMeImSingle,-4,Mon Jul 13 15:40:42 2015 UTC,But a wood bat can't give way like a carcass can
AnimalsBeingBros,3d13k2,jdm0,35,Sun Jul 12 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"A wooden bat has a lot more give and bend than you think. That's why it can have 95+ mph fastballs hitting it over and over without breaking. A dog holding it in his mouth isn't going to do any more damage than one of those pitches.  EDIT: Ok I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here that this many people are still trying to argue that the dog carrying the bat from home to the dugout in a minor league baseball game could hurt the bats long-term. Why do you guys want this dog to damage the bats so bad?   First of all, it's weird to me that this is what you guys choose to take a stand on.   Second of all, I highly doubt any of you have actually played baseball or even gone to the batting cages if you're arguing that this retriever who is trained to carry things lightly is going to damage these bats.  A pitcher throws 95+mph, and batters swing speed can go past 110mph, and they hit dead on without breaking. They're thrown at the ground whenever someone gets a hit. They're smacked against dirt, concrete, metal, and water coolers or thrown around the dugout when people get pissed. These bats are covered in stain and varnish, and specifically made to hit things very hard.  On top of ALL OF THAT, they're disposable because bats (especially maple) tend to shatter when hit at the right point on the handle so teams replace them often, so it's not a big freaking deal either way.  This is the craziest argument I've seen people make on here without any evidence other than what you're making up on assumptions."
AnimalsBeingBros,3d13k2,StringTwitching,8,Sun Jul 12 19:49:45 2015 UTC,Arguably though the dogs teeth are piercing instead of blunt like a baseball. I'm no batdog expert but I would assume the weight of the bat alone could create scratches when held in teeth of a dog. Not that they would be intense enough to damage it right away but over time it would more quickly ruin the integrity of the bat. Whether or not that is a negligible amount I have no idea.
AnimalsBeingBros,3d13k2,jdm0,14,Sun Jul 12 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"Considering retrievers are bred to hold things lightly as to not damage them I can't imagine it would be more than a negligible amount. If dogs can hold birds, eggs, etc without breaking them. ""Over time"" isn't an issue with bats, they break when hit on the handle or at the end by pitches all the time. They aren't meant to last all year.  Also this is a weird thing for you all to be arguing. I haven't seen anyone have any evidence of a dog doing damage to a bat when it's carrying it, but this (professional) minor league baseball team who are paid to play and have been using and holding baseball bats their whole lives has one doing it and obviously no one sees any issues or they wouldn't have the dog there."

Instantly she rolls over, rolling around.   She obviously wasn't socialised well as a pup, so she doesn't really know what she's doing - and pretty much just stays rolled over on her back while trying to for some reason wiggle herself underneath the other dog?  Anyway, but yeah whenever we see this dog - even if it's far away - and just a white fluffy dog - she'll know it's him and pull towards him.

I have a bouvier and it does something similar at the dog park. He runs around herding all the other dogs until they are sitting next to their owners. Any wander away, he puts them back. The only exception is little dogs. They confuse him. He will just push over toy breeds to watch them stand back up."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cxv8s,CommanderBS,0,Tue Jul 14 05:16:15 2015 UTC,"But why do you feel the need to pipe up to say something like this? If we were standing together at the park and I mentioned, ""Oh, I'm so glad. She so rarely enjoys herself and plays"", you would just look at me and say, ""She's not playing with your dog. She's just herding her.""?  Why? Why can't you just smile and think it silently to yourself, ""How could she possibly think our dogs are enjoying each other's company? I should educate her but I won't because that would be arrogant and unnecessary at the park."""
AnimalsBeingBros,3cxv8s,WhitTheDish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel the need to assume that the dog does not enjoy herding amd working?  The dog thinks it is helping and protecting everyone around. It probably enjoys that more than any random play.  Is it so hard to imagine that an animal is excited to feel useful? You know, since that is what it is bred to do?  Why? Why can't you understand the nature of a dog bred to accomplish a task? Why can't you understand that completing that task probably gives that dog more satisfaction than anything else it does?"
AnimalsBeingBros,3cxv8s,Stresserella,0,Tue Jul 14 12:48:21 2015 UTC,Why can't you understand that your statement was subconsciously (I hope) to shame me for not being as smart as you?
AnimalsBeingBros,3cxv8s,parradise21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"Self victimize much? Are you so insecure that anytime someone points something out you automatically assume that it is shaming?  You mentioned being excited that the dog was actually playing and it does not do that much. It seems like you care and are concerned about it. Working dogs don't always play like regular dogs. When they do it is more of a duty to do it thing. They love herding.   My dog will go outside and bark at the neighbors' horses when they are horsing around. When they calm down he stops barking and comes back in looking satisfied.  When he decides we are bored he will bring a toy over and make us throw it 3 times. No more. No less. Only 3. After three he basically says that's it, you had enough activity, I am done.  When we have people over he walks around the outside of the room brushing against everyone's legs. They slowly get closer and closer to the center of the room.  He enjoys these activities. To him it is not playing, it is a biological sense of duty. Doing those tasks satisfies him.  It is so deeply ingrained in some breeds to do their jobs that they become unruly and seem like they are misbehaved when they cannot do them. They stop letting people out of rooms for example, barking at them or nipping them when they try to leave. They try to protect members of the family to the point where new people cannot get near them.  One of the ways that this is dealt with and treated is be actually taking the dogs to a farm once in a while and letting them herd livestock like sheep or goats. They love it, they feel satisfied, and it can really calm them down.  Learning that made it far easier to take care of a working breed dog.  But if you don't want helpful suggestions because you are so insecure that you automatically assume you are being attacked any time someone brings up information you did not know, go ahead and disregard."

They already degraded themselves by being wrong in the first place. I am helping them rectify their shortcomings.  I find it baffling that ignorance is valued so highly.  What if no one ever told people to wash their hands? Doctors were pretty pissed once upon a time when they were told to wash their hands. How dare some one correct a doctor. We see how that turned out.  Maybe if someone could explain to me why it is better to bumble ignorantly through life I would understand why it is rude to correct someone that is wrong or has made a mistake. I know I would rather be corrected than continue to be wrong because that means I will have learned something and in turn am better for it.  So I ask, why is it better to be wrong than right?"

AnimalsBeingBros,3csndp,fayryover,3,Fri Jul 10 19:09:40 2015 UTC,meh to be fair any average-large dog can probably bite straight through your leg if they wanted to bone included without much hassle so the danger increase from one size to another isn't that great.  My sisters lab breaks through cow bones as if its a cracker its bloody ridicolous and a little bit scary but hes very well trained so the most he'd ever do is accidentally mouth you then run away and hide because he thinks he's in trouble.

Where as I won't feed my mom's horses out of my hand because I don't trust them not to bite me. And it wouldn't change if it was 'my' horse either."
AnimalsBeingBros,3csndp,fayryover,2,Fri Jul 10 23:00:56 2015 UTC,i get what you mean i really dislike horses as well but tbh that comes from them trying to attack me whenever they see me when i was young which is weird because i used to have a massive fear of dogs because of a few bad experiences (dicks getting their rottweilers to chase me etc) but now i absolutely love them.

AnimalsBeingBros,3csndp,M4rmelada,4,Sat Jul 11 09:13:43 2015 UTC,It's a Jim Henson (of muppets fame) classic called the Labyrinth.  In the movie Sarah (Jennifer Connolly) has her baby brother abducted by the goblin king (David Bowie) who overhears her rash wish that her baby brother was gone from her life.  She has 24 hours to solve the magical labyrinth surrounding the goblin castle to get her brother back. Along the way she makes a number of unusual friends like the wonderful sir Didymus.

AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Kirillb85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"well, the old dog is being friendly, but is also protecting his house.  The kitten is being a little aggressive.  Note how the dog tries to stay between the kitten and the step, which i presume is the entrance to the house.  The dog is much calmer while he is between the kitten and the door.  He gets the ""zoomies"" when the kitten is between him and the house."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Enthused_Llama,3,Wed Jul 8 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"the kitten explicitly took a submissive (and playful) posture early in the exchange, the dog knew there was probably no threat to his authority or territory. any ""protective"" actions were likely in the appropriately playful spirit."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Kirillb85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the kitten is very bouncy and the dog is unsure but as soon as the kitten lays down and shows it's belly (submissive position) to show it's playing and not being true aggressive then the dog does the same to show it understands and that it's going to be friends too."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Enthused_Llama,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:52:04 2015 UTC,"Cat's body language I've noticed: On the defense, tail is pointing down, he's all puffy, he's submitting and standing ground.  On the attack, tail is high, thin and straight.   Also in begining cat doesn't lay down to show he's chilling. Think of cats as the grappelers in MMA. That's their A game.

AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,_corn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm not really a cat person but during battle I thought it was in murder mode. Besides being pretty chill in between scraps how can you tell it was just playing?
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,drproximo,3,Thu Jul 9 11:48:58 2015 UTC,"Cat fights are serious business.  That cat was prancing around, ears mostly up, falling over and not really caring. My cat plays too. Also, no huuuge claw extension like you see in fights."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,repodude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:15:21 2015 UTC,how can you tell it was just playing   If you imagine two cats fighting in a Tom and Jerry cartoon then that's not far off how cats fight in real life.
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,r502692,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:17 2015 UTC,If the cat was actually fighting it wouldn't be just swiping at the dog. Cats are extremely vicious fighters and it would've pounced at the dog biting and scratching. Also I couldn't tell from the gif but it also would've been hissing and screeching at the dog to back off which it didn't seem like it was
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Mishomatic,3,Thu Jul 9 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"actually one of the first ""plop"" laydowns isn't chilling or strategy, it's display, it's both playful and ""submissive"", letting the dog know that there's no threat to his authority."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,staythepath,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"When cats hold their tail high in the air (and not puffed up) it's a sign that says ""I'm not a threat""."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Skeptical_Romulan,-16,Wed Jul 8 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"So, no? The dog is trying to be friendly while the kitten is scared/aggressive. You can see the miscommunication in body language. The dog's playful pose with head low and but in the air is similar to the cats defensive pose with the raised back and tail strait up. Also, lying on its back with paws ready to strike is, again, a defensive move in the cats body language while its the opposite for dogs. From the dog's perspective they are playing, form the cat's perspective they are fighting."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Man-alive,30,Thu Jul 9 02:00:51 2015 UTC,"The kitten is the one instigating play time at the beginning of the clip. Unfortunately, I think the doggy gets a little too excited towards the end which confuses the kitten :P"
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,Enthused_Llama,9,Wed Jul 8 14:48:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I have both a cat and a westie and this is what happens all the time. They don't ever really fight but the dog often takes things farther than my cat likes.
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,ixodioxi,42,Wed Jul 8 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. That cat seems like he's playing, too. A cat won't likely roll onto their sides and expose its stomach if they're looking for a fight. Also, notice the cats ears aren't flattened and facing backwards and the tail, while upright, isn't puffed. Kittens like to play and I seriously doubt that one sees the dog as a threat."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,therealdrag0,10,Wed Jul 8 15:47:47 2015 UTC,"If anything, the cat wants to play and starts it, and eventually persuades the dog to join in."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,practically_floored,13,Wed Jul 8 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"No, that kitten is definitely playing. It's a little bit confused at the end but the way it slowly slumps down and playfully runs around and bast the dog is a clear indication. No puffing of the tail or flattened ears either. I think the dog just finally realizes what's going on at the end and the cat isn't into it anymore."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,STAND_BEHIND_BRAUM,6,Wed Jul 8 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"If you look at two cats playing with each other, that's how cats normally react. If a cat is scared, the back will arch high, tail straight up, hair will raise on their back too."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,ClandestineMovah,8,Wed Jul 8 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"At the very least the only time I thought the dog was playing was when it ran around really fast, at which time the cat was like ""wtf that's not how we play."""
AnimalsBeingBros,3cjwy7,sashay33,2,Wed Jul 8 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Arched back, tail straight up and running around quickly is how my cat plays. If the cat was scared/fighting it would fluff it's tail up"

AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,ShockinglyPale,87,Wed Jul 8 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"This is someone with Asperger's (now simply Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) having a meltdown due to sensory processing issues.  When their systems get overloaded with input there is a breakdown of operations.  Some cry and hit themselves; some get angry and try to hit other things.    The woman in the video is attempting to bring this sort of thing into the public's view.    I don't know her reasoning, but I know that a lot of people, not only, don't know what autism is (and isn't), but a lot of people can't tell the difference between a bratty kid throwing a tantrum and an autistic child having a meltdown.  One is a behavioral issue that needs to be handled; the other is a breakdown of the brain processing information and going a bit haywire.    This leads to people being all judge-y about shit they have no knowledge of.  Source: Am a 28-year old autistic man."

AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,4trevor4,2,Sun Jul 12 01:31:20 2015 UTC,That's very interesting. That looks a lot like when I have a panic attack.
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,silentpower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:36:59 2015 UTC,They‘re both behaviors that can be changed but the aspie may need very skilled intervention (ie. psychologist who has experienxe with aspergers clients). Some can eliminate their meltdowns altogether but that will take a lot of money and time.
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,dynawhey,2,Wed Jul 8 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"In my experience the best was to handle my meltdowns is to know/feel them coming and removing myself from whatever situation is making me feel that way.  So prevention > intervention, but that's true with everything.  Skilled intervention is important, but it's also important to remember what is slowly becoming an autism catch-phrase:     If you've met a person with autism; you know one person with autism.   It doesn't matter if you've worked with 100 autistic kids and their meltdowns the next kid might not respond to any attempts to calm them because of any number of reasons.  Also, you say ""some can eliminate their meltdowns altogether,"" but I would tend to disagree.  I think with a lot of work on prevention and recognizing the signs of a meltdown coming one might be able to prevent them altogether.  But the cause of the meltdowns is due to neurological function due to the altered neurological development that is autism.    Now, neural plasticity is something that can be used to help mitigate (with, as you stated, a lot of hard work), but I don't think eliminate altogether is a reasonable or healthy goal.  Meltdowns are something that happens to us; saying they could be eliminated would be like saying with enough time and effort you could prevent broken limbs.  You can strengthen bones, you can strengthen the muscles surrounding them, hell, maybe in the future we could replace a shattered bone with titanium, but there will still always be a limit.  NT (Neurotypical) people have breakdowns, too."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,JPozz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:39:45 2015 UTC,"Question: I do know to some extent how autism works, but I'm very far from an expert (my little sister has a syndrome sometimes classified as ""mild autism"", and I've read some and met a few people). I know there are many variations/degrees of autism. Do all people with autism get some kind of breakdown?"
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,brinlov,2,Sat Jul 11 11:00:16 2015 UTC,"It indeed send to be mostly ubiquitous, but I also know an autistic guy who is hyposensitive and likes and enjoys a constant cacophony.  I hate it. And the more we learn about the neurology of it we find that autistic people differ more from each other than NTs do from other NTs.   Note for the uninitiated: NT = neurotypical = non-autistic people  Do we all suffer those sorts of episodes? I don't know. I haven't met every autistic person. Is it safe to assume someone who is autistic would? Yep.    But the more important thing is what causes the meltdowns. For me it's social pressure (meeting people I don't know. Having to be ""on"" for extended periods of time etc) coupled with constant noise.  Our brains (for the most part, remember no two autistic people are alike) are unable to filter out input (noise and people for me, visual input or touch for others) that is unnecessary to process.  That inability to filter (which is something NTs do without having to think) leads to an overload and eventual breakdown. It's not a skill we can learn. It seems to be our brain structure that is the culprit. Note: this can happen to NTs as well, however, our threshold is much lower and is reached by things that most normal people wouldn't even consider a bother.   Example: Parties that include more than roughly 20 people sound like this to me.  If you can listen to that video with headphones on for more than 30 seconds without wanting to rip your face off: congrats.  I can't.  Also, you're sister is classified as mildly autistic. So am I.  I'm not debilitated by these things, I just had to learn how to avoid the situations that cause these meltdowns.  I had to learn that Mardi Gras is not for me. I learned that NTs find it very fucking hard to grasp that I hate dancing and clubs. I'm not being shy, I'm not being coy, I'm preventing myself from ruining my day/evening or what have you.  I don't go hang out with my friends sometimes cause they like to do stuff that, not only do I hate, but I'm doing my friends a favor by not going because my presence would ruin their time, too. I'm not being anti-social; I'm being fucking considerate."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,JPozz,2,Sat Jul 11 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Very insightfull, thank you!  The part of my sister that is related to autism (it's not technically autism, I think, but it has similarities) is that she can't process social situations like I can, especially if there is a lot of things happening at the same time. But she never gets meltdowns, which is very good, she just get irritated and very shy and wants to go home.  But yeah, I would be irritated if my friends didn't understand my inability to be in noisy places. I don't mind noisy places, but I can imagine (or try to) how incredibly stressfull it can be. I dunno, I don't like crowded concerts for example. Don't get meltdowns, but it's stressfull."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,brinlov,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"I would be irritated if my friends didn't understand my inability to be in noisy places.   This is the crux of a lot of autistic people's difficulty on maintaining a social circle.  I'm lucky to have friends that get and respect me, but a lot of NTs really have trouble grasping that other people don't enjoy the same things as they do. (Whether that be sports, dancing, clubs or anything). The only thing I would ask of any NTs would be to believe someone when they say they don't like something.  I have tried partying, I have tried bars, I have tried clubs, and I have found them lacking. Have you tried what I love? D&D, video games, sci-fi shows/literature, writing.  I bet you haven't tried my things as much as I tried to force myself to try to like the typical activities that 90% of the population seems to agree on.  Clarification: I'm not bitter, I'm really not. I'm channeling my thoughts from my teenage/college years. At least the thoughts I would have had if I knew then what I know now.  I just want to convey some thoughts your sister might not know how to verbalize.  Final thought: trying to force an autistic person to like that sort of stuff would be just as damaging/frustrating as trying to force a gay person to be straight.  We know it doesn't work, we know it's unhealthy, and it's lazy."
AnimalsBeingBros,3cio44,JPozz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. A bigger difference with my sister, which I forgot to mention, is that she, including the syndrome, has a general mental retardation or whatever it's called in English, I don't remember. So she's very young mentally, like 5, and she's 14 now. But my parents and me, and especially my mom, is like super into studying this syndrome of hers, which is a relatively newly discovered one, and know how her thinking pattern is and so on.  But she is suprisingly good with social situations, as long as there are people her age there and she knows them or it's in a place she connects with fun."

AnimalsBeingBros,3cf9c4,thelastcookie,14,Tue Jul 7 18:37:46 2015 UTC,If you gave your kitty a box made of paper it'd probably do the same. Those boxes just weren't strong enough for their curiousity.

AnimalsBeingBros,3cf9c4,PixelCollector,63,Tue Jul 7 15:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! Especially when the dog started running -- I was thinking, ""No, you're just triggering its prey drive! Don't run!"""
AnimalsBeingBros,3cf9c4,NetTrap,51,Tue Jul 7 18:22:46 2015 UTC,Pretty sure run or not you're fucked if a tiger is coming at you.
AnimalsBeingBros,3cf9c4,HWBunton,44,Tue Jul 7 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, if it's dead set on it, you're toast. But big cats can often be put off by a show of aggression. They need to survive a fight without getting seriously injured. For this reason, tigers are much more likely to attack unwary prey from behind. (That's the reason for masks like these.) So if the tiger was advancing on the dog and the dog barked and bared its teeth, there's a chance the tiger would just go ""fuck it, I'll find something easier."""
AnimalsBeingBros,3cf9c4,madisonthrow,15,Tue Jul 7 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"I like how the mask on the left looks mildly suprised.  Also is it just me, or do those look European? And why is the hair green and red?"

AnimalsBeingBros,3cieqv,badgamedotnet,6,Fri Jul 10 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"They may very well be farmers who are checking on a newborn calf.

The way they are picking up the calf, it looks like they may be about to castrate it."

AnimalsBeingBros,3cieqv,bleach86,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"That's how you pick up calves to get them to use their legs. If they're open range cattle, a calf staying down too long could mean death. The calf was probably born a lot earlier (based on how dry it is) and didn't try to stand up. When the farmers approached, the calf should have been up and ready to run away with the mother. Seeing that the calf stayed down, the farmers needed to stimulate it to move. The donkey was protecting the farmers from the mother while they tried to get the baby up.  It's not awful, just trying to make sure the baby stands. Also, the calf can't feed when they're on the ground. You want them up as soon as possible."

Supposedly turkeys [heritage turkeys-- not the ones that can't walk after a year of growth] are inquisitive and will follow you around the yard, look in your windows for you to bring out food. They are not as bad as some feisty roosters that will attack you as soon as you turn your back on them [I have had some painful bruises from them]. I'm not sure if either of them play like dogs and people do, for example.

AnimalsBeingBros,3c5e2c,kylegetsspam,2,Sun Jul 5 00:09:40 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it has to do with how secure and socialized they are.  I have had each since they were about 16 weeks and introduced them to a friends dog at about 6 months and they were fast friends.  Later on at about 18 months in was helping foster a puppy and after a day or two it was one big happy furry family.  Neither cat is particularly skittish though; they have led pretty relaxed lives.

AnimalsBeingBros,3c5e2c,Aspergers1,2,Sun Jul 5 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"I'm back and forth on it. She used to belong to my sister and had a cat roommate when she was young. I've seen pictures of them snuggling. Both cats moved in with my parents for awhile, and while I did witness her chasing the older guy around a lot, I assumed it wasn't much of a problem.  One morning, though, he jumped up onto a kitchen chair to escape her pursuit. His speed carried him across it, his back leg/foot got caught, and he fell over the side hanging upside down. He flipped his shit; my mom said she thought he was being murdered by how he was wailing and ran downstairs to save him. No broken bones, luckily. After that incident I was tasked with taking in the younger one.  A little chasing is fine if they're both into it, but I wasn't around enough to see how things went long-term. That she was given to me could be taken to mean she was too rambunctious and mean. But then she was always the more social of the two -- when people came over the old dude would hide and the young girl would come say hi.  She is afraid of loud things, though. She's hid so well while movers were cleaning out my apartments that I've ""lost"" her. And especially lately she just doesn't like noises that happen around the apartment. During the past winter a giant ice sheet fell onto the roof of my unit with an enormous BANG and shook the whole apartment. She's been especially jumpy at noises ever since.  I really don't know what to expect. She might take it very well but it has been three years since she was around another cat. I know she's social to at least people and likes to cuddle hard when she's in the mood. If I got a kitten she could be its ""mother"" and she's no longer a kitten herself and has calmed down.  So, I dunno. I do want to get her a cat, though, because she seems to get bored pretty easily. She's too smart for chasing balls around, mostly, and I think she'd be much happier having a cat to play with."

Makes sense that they brought the subs back up).

He was an ornithologist, which basically means a bird scientist. We was incredibly popular and well liked, as he would explain shit he knew about in a pretty friendly manner. This was all great, up until he gets in an argument with a 14 year old girl about the difference between jackdaws and crows, at which point he was shadowbanned for using multiple other accounts to upvote his comments and downvote her comments. He makes a post about it and admits to doing it, and Reddit becomes a little more jaded for it.   Now, keep in mind I'm not the end all be all source for this, but that is my understanding of what happened."

Super bacteria and viruses come from the cleanest places on Earth, hospitals, not your catbox.  So really, there shouldn't be this backlash against letting your cat touch your face. It's no different than another person doing it, probably cleaner, again, because humans put their hands near chemicals, toxic substances, and a variety of fecal samples beyond their own.   The only real threat from a cat is parasites, in my opinion."

Everything you said still applies to cats as well, plus the parasites you mention. Thus cats are as bad, if not worse."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bptz2,Rasalom,0,Wed Jul 1 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"I said in my original post that having a cat touch your face is no worse than having a person do it, so I already made the comparison between people. Why aren't you freaked out about people touching you, but are freaked about your cat?  Personally, my cats do not walk around in industrial wastes, lather themselves in chemicals, or waltz through bacterial sneeze alleys. The worst they get is some cat feces."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bptz2,andrewps87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:13:39 2015 UTC,"Your original post:   Haha, as if your hands aren't covered in fecal matter? You're worse, your able little monkey paws get into way more nasty places than a litter box.   You said ""You're worse"", which is different from saying ""a cat is no worse"" as if they're equal. You quite clearly ranked it and put it as ""cats > humans"".   Personally, my cats do not walk around in industrial wastes, lather themselves in chemicals, or waltz through bacterial sneeze alleys. The worst they get is some cat feces.   No, they may not, but your argument was human hands are coverd in ""fecal matter"" since it's just around in the world. So cats would also be covered in fecal matter, by that logic.  And by the same logic, cats would also be covered in tiny remnants of those same chemicals, bacteria and waste.  Cats live in the human would and would be as covered in microscopic particles as humans are. It's not like cats magicall repel those particles away from them.  Cats are far more likely to come into most microscopic particles that a human would than vice versa. Thus humans generally just get the human-based particles, whereas cats get both the human-based particles (such as what you listed) as well as the cat-based ones, from the cat activities.  Thus humans are definitely not ""worse"", as you originally claimed.   Why aren't you freaked out about people touching you, but are freaked about your cat?   I'm not freaked out, since I come into contact with most of those human-based particles myself on a daily basis and am fine. What I do not come into contact with is the cat-based ones."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bptz2,Rasalom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"No, no, no!  You come into contact with cat-based everything if you own a cat. You don't seem to understand... You are exposed to the worst stuff every day. Carcinogens, lead, flu viruses, etc. A cat is exposed to a few things in a home, a floor, a cat box, and you. That's it.   You go outside and expose yourself to surfaces a cat cannot touch, and moreso, you are exposed to the expulsions of other people from who knows where, people who are huge vectors for germs you will actually be affected by and not be immune to. Your cat only has exposure to you, so it's not going to pass something back to you.   And by the same logic, cats would also be covered in tiny remnants of those same chemicals, bacteria and waste.   No? When do cats go waltzing around workplaces with strange chemicals and sick people who are forced to go to work or lose their jobs?   When do cats spray themselves with harmful cancer-causing chemicals? When do cats work with lead or lung-irritants like asbestos?  When do cats go into public areas touching many, many varied surfaces with appendages that grip things like hands?   Hell, even the food we eat is more varied and often more sickening than what a cat eats: kibble and wet food."

Hell, even the food we eat is more varied and often more sickening than what a cat eats: kibble and wet food.   Uh most cats do go outside into the wider world and often touch/nibble at things we never would. I've often seen cats outside walk up to birdshit/etc and paw at it, which adult humans never would.  As for the chemicals, they may not spray things on themselves directly but it's hypocrisy to state ""We don't touch our shit but still have particles of faeces on us"" and not ""Cats don't directly 'use' chemicals but still would have plenty of particles of it on them"", even when talking about household chemicals. Of course cats have as many contaminants in their fur, but since most are outside during the day, they also have the chance to come into more contact with more of them than a human would, who usually goes to the same few places day after day with the same routine.  Cats also have the ability to easily wander into blocked off abandoned buildings, so their chance of encountering asbestos is much higher than the average human.  Similarly, sick people are everywhere and a cat wandering about for a whole day probably comes into contact with more sick animals and humans than you do sat at the one desk for many hours, if you think about it.  Tl;dr: Cats generally encounter more places and people than the average person, since cats aren't tied to schedules nor human norms of not touching weird shit. Therefore the chance for contamination is much higher."

AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,AustinTreeLover,40,Sun Jun 28 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"It is! They're a really interesting breed.   They're used a lot as barn dogs. Horses and JRTs have a symbiotic relationship. I have seen a JRT sit and wait while a horse hoofed at his hay until a mouse ran out.   Horse: Get that for me, will ya?  JRT: On it, pal.    In general, the only other animal you can count on a JRT getting along with is a horse. Lol.   They're hunting dogs, originally bred to ground small prey. Their shoulders ""fold in"" more than most breeds so they can tunnel better. They're bred for speed, tenacity, intelligence, stamina, and killer instinct. They're really compulsive, hyper-focused, egocentric little things. Basically homicidal toddlers.   They're hilarious and so much fun, but not for everyone. They take a lot of training and discipline.   The Rat Terrier is the JRT's closest cousin, bred specifically for vermin control, but with a much more ""accommodating"" personality. (i.e. They're not assholes. lol!) If you want a lot of the same characteristics, but don't have the time/patience for a JRT, the Rat Terrier is an option.   JRT race"

AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,ParadiseForParasites,6,Mon Jun 29 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"I think some dogs have stronger instincts than others. It also depends on the breed, to some degree. Dogs that were bred to kill rats and other small vermin would have a hard time doing this. I've seen many videos of pitbulls hanging out with baby birds. They were bred for dog fighting and protection, so some of them might not have a strong instinct to kill other small animals. But I think growing up around smaller animals and getting them used to them when they are still young probably makes the biggest difference."

AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,Lightspar,9,Sun Jun 28 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've read/heard and my personal experience volunteering, pits are extremely malleable. They are so eager to learn and to please. Not sure if this supersedes instinct or if this their instinct. But this is why they are chosen as fighting dogs, known as nanny dogs, and are great pets. They will do whatever you want them to do. Whether that's kill another dog, or be quiet and cuddly, or do fun tricks.   Edit: I would guess this video isn't a random occurrance. The dog was likely trained (pretty easily, thanks pits!) to get along with the chickens."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,thecynthesizer,2,Sun Jun 28 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"I have an American Bulldog/Catahoula mix that is the most gentle animal alive. I think he'd be just like the dog in OP's video. He loves other dogs, people, small kids and especially loves cats. He dotes over them and tries to win their favor, then he cuddles with them. He's just a peaceful wonderdog. We have 5 cats that all at least tolerate him, and 2 of the cats play and cuddle with him."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,lorelicat,3,Sun Jun 28 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"My dog does the same thing as this pit bull with his chickens and quail (I think he loved that thing more than anything!) and is even a bird hunting dog.   I think it depends on how the animals are raised, in this case the pit bull can go and smell the birds and see them every single day because of the cage they are in so he realizes they are his friends and not to eat them.   We raised our chickens where the dog can see them every day and smell them and get to know them so he is super nice to them. His instincs will kick in a little bit when they run away from him or a new chicken tries to attack him. What stops him then is that he knows he will be in a lot of trouble and he has gotten in trouble for being too rough with them before. We raised our cats the same and our dog loves to cuddle with them in his bed, it's pretty adorable."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,Semesto,3,Mon Jun 29 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"Dogs recognize two groups, those in their pack, and those out of their pack.

AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,lulumeme,26,Sun Jun 28 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"So sweet. Pitbulls are so loving and sweet, I hate the bad rep they get."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,glowingfiery,102,Sun Jun 28 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"They are a harder dog to own. You need to train them well, and make sure that you keep the training up. They are like toddlers- if they think they can get away with something they will. So you need to be on them and be firm. But in  return you will get one of the sweetest, boofiest, most loving dogs.  Unfortunately most people don't want to put in the constant effort that a pitbull requires, or they simply don't know. They assume that the 12 weeks of puppy training is enough like with other breeds. That is where lots of problems arise- in my experience anyway.  Pitbull and Staffy puppies are the cutest puppies too."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,princesskate,26,Sun Jun 28 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"My aunt breeds and trains them as search and rescue dogs. They're ideal because they're smart, strong, high energy, and have a really strong natural play response. They're also gentle, and when raised properly know their own strength. And of course any fog with that amount of bite force is great for pulling people out of rubble."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,starspider,4,Sun Jun 28 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think their behaviour has a lot more to do with affection than training.  If you raise your dog in a loving, happy environment, I'd bet anything that dog is going to turn out happy and friendly.  But if the dog raised with negativity or even just neglect, it will revert to its primal instincts which include biting and aggressive behaviour."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,JayString,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"I think their behaviour has a lot more to do with affection than training.   Sure, but dogs still have instincts that you need training to cut through. The problem with bigger, stronger dogs is not that they are more malicious but that they are more damaging. All it takes is once, so proper and constant training is critical to make sure things go well on the worst day of that dogs life."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,SquishSquash81,8,Mon Jun 29 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"I owned a pitbull once but she was a rescue and she was about 3 years when I found her. When she arrived at my house she was terrified of kids (I have 3). After a year she was great with them (still in training); I do agree it takes a lot of time and training but unfortunately there was an incident and I had to put her down. But I feel personally people shouldn't blame the dogs for their aggression. In my opinion and experience, dogs are vicious because of the owners. But I love pits, they're awesome dogs."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,glowingfiery,7,Mon Jun 29 12:46:48 2015 UTC,I'm sorry for your loss. Do you mind saying what happened?
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,lordcwat,21,Sun Jun 28 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the pit bull was running an illegal gambling operation out of the basement. That, or it bit one of the kids."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,fuckyoubarry,11,Sun Jun 28 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It still hurts thinking about her. A while ago, I let my stupid friends stay with me because she claimed her house was infested with black mold. Being her friend I was blind to her possible drug use (stayed up all night, had pick marks all over, lost massive weight etc.) and one day right around the time of 4th of July; combination of fireworks and her kids put my dog in extreme anxiety and to top it off, shes terrified of children (it took her a year to be comfortable with my own kids) and I thought she had gone into my room. Well turns out she was on my couch and from where I was sitting I couldn't see her so anyways, my ""friend's"" little boy went up to my dogs face but I don't know what he did and my dog bit him. It was a really bad bite and I take full responsibility but never did I ever blame my dog. She was training well and I think if I had more time, she would've learned to trust younger kids better. I know pits aren't evil but I'm terrified of getting another pit."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,glowingfiery,2,Sun Jun 28 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"I think that's a challenge you face whenever you rescue a dog. Any dog can bite, no matter what kind they are. The experiences they had before you found them will always be there somewhere. Personal anecdote: my family rescued a black lab a few years ago now. He's absolutely the sweetest creature I've ever met, and I love him dearly. I wouldn't think twice about leaving him alone with a baby (though he might lick and slobber all over them, so maybe not the best idea for cleanliness purposes). He loves everyone, EXCEPT bearded men. No amount of training has cured him of this phobia. My dad has to shave, and my sweet puppy has to be locked up when certain friends and family members come over. It can happen to any dog.   I don't want that to sound discouraging, I mean it in the sense that any dog will have quirks, regardless of breeding. You just have to trust them and work with them.   Additionally, I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find a healing furry friend soon, and some better friends, too."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,mochafrappuccino,5,Sun Jun 28 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"But I feel personally people shouldn't blame the dogs for their aggression. In my opinion and experience, dogs are vicious because of the owners.   Yes, owners have a lot to do with a dogs temperament, but you can't dismiss hundreds of years of selective breeding. In the same way that some breeds were designed for hunting, pit bulls were specifically bred to fight. That is their origins and it's in their DNA."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,whom,2,Mon Jun 29 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"True but it's being gradually bred out of them. Great danes were at one point bred to be aggressive and intimidating guard dogs, now they're just big teddy bears.   Besides, one of the reasons they can be aggressive is that they're so loving and protective of their owners. They also have a lot of energy and if that's channeled right it's a recipe for an amazing dog, that's just unfortunately not always how it works out."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,colourofawesome,2,Sun Jun 28 17:54:03 2015 UTC,We had ours well trained until we had a kid. She didn't get as much attention those first few months and my father in law felt sorry for her. He would bring her treats but want her to jump up for them which was something we explicitly taught her not to do. Then he started giving her scraps and she started digging in the garbage. Now we have to train her all over again.
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,thisisrediculou,2,Sun Jun 28 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying, but I think it's especially sad these topics come up every time a pit is posted. It's also very sad how many ridiculous misconceptions there are about pits. I think in the end, the 3 that need to be realized are:   Pits are great dogs, like any dog that's trained.  They don't have some insane bite power. As a matter of fact, they have below average bite power (average bite power 320 psi ""pounds per square inch"" and pits bite power is 232 psi iirc) The thing that makes them dangerous, is their tenacity. The reason their bites are scary and damaging, is because they hold on and will not let go. They are the toughest dogs there are bar none. But a trained dog and responsible owner wouldn't be in a situation where this matters. But accidents do happen, as tragic as they are.   I myself had my dog drag a kid by his hair. It was my fault entirely, he was out of my site, and the kid was teasing him with a cookie. I shouldn't have left him alone, and let that happen.   On a side note though, I just found out the kid has a problem with torturing animals. He as caught stabbing his dogs eyes out with a stick, and when it wouldn't stop yelping, he beat it with a rock. So truly, he could have also been doing other things to my dog, but only know what he told me.... You be the judge."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,-Youdont_knowme-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was pointing out that their bite isn't unique in any way from other dogs, in fact it was even less powerful than people think. I was trying to point out that one of their many breed traits is their tenacity/determination when given an objective. Whether that's pulling a car, protecting their family, or fighting in a ring. I am not saying this is a bad breed trait in any way. That's also what I was referring to as ""one if the strongest breeds bar none"" not because of their bite, but because I have respect for the lengths this breed will go through to succeed. That is however though, as you pointed out, a personal opinion of mine, because I really respect and admire this breed for that."
AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,-Youdont_knowme-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:31:40 2015 UTC,"You were right in a way, as pit bulls have been historically bred for gameness. It's a terrier trait, they'll just go and go until they've accomplished their goal."

AnimalsBeingBros,3bekmm,SmokyMcBalls,-5,Sun Jun 28 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is they were bred to fight bulls in pits. So they got a big ole head full of teeth and a fighting instinct.   ""They're only aggressive to animals, not people!""   Oh good. That's exactly what the fuck I want in a household pet.  Pitbulls are sweet because they're dogs. Dogs are generally pretty sweet. Compared to a zebra or a moose or something, yeah they're great pets. But compared to other dogs, they're more likely to win if they feel like fighting you, and they're more likely to start shit with other dogs."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,thepasswordis-taco,11,Wed Jun 24 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"I was watching some Brit's YouTube video the other day and he was ""complaining"" (it was a humor piece) that Americans often include the state when we say city names.   He was kidding around, but there's actually a logical reason for this. Since, as a rule, I don't comment on YouTube, I'll explain here.   It depends on the context, but y'all have to remember that our names mostly came from other places and we have a lot of cities that share names.   I went to Paris last year and if I'd told friends ""Going to Paris"", the next question would be ""Texas or France?"" (although, my inflection may have tipped them off since I was way more excited to go to France than East Texas) Obviously, when Europeans refer to Paris they mean France. But, it's less obvious when you live 4.5 hours from another Paris.   I used to live in Columbus. Just about any American reading that would assume I mean Ohio. Except for American soldiers, who might correctly guess Georgia first, given that most enlisted come through the nearby training base at Ft. Benning. Columbus, Georgia is a town of about 400k people. So, not tiny. Better to just say the whole thing, avoid confusion, and save time.   Columbus, by the way, is up the road from Athens, Georgia, which is well known because of UGA.   Athens, Georgia is two hours from Greenville, Georgia, but only an hour and half from the better known, Greenville, South Carolina, another place I used to live. So, when I was living in Athens, if I'd said, ""I'm moving to Greenville"", you can see why that wasn't enough information.   In total, there are 30 Greenvilles in the U.S., including Greenville, Texas, 3 hours from where I am now.   Americans get a lot of shit for not traveling, but we actually travel more than any other country, just within our own country. Since we travel so much within the country and we have so many significant cities with similar names, you can see why we're specific.   List of most common city names."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,HAL9000000,91,Wed Jun 24 14:16:07 2015 UTC,I guess this was the biggest single incident but he was always known locally for being a gentle giant even before this. This was shortly before his death in 1992.

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,masterslut,8,Wed Jun 24 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"well, gifs came out in '87..."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,1337Gandalf,6,Wed Jun 24 15:07:28 2015 UTC,"This might be true, but the overall quality of gif making between 1987 and today has dramatically changed. A gif of this size and quality would've been unfeasible to render in 1987.   Even in 1992, it would've been a stretch. In 1996, with faster internet, it might've stood a better chance. Overall, though, gif making was not a particularly widespread phenom until the late 1990s/early 2000s, where it had a drastic uptake due to the changes in the general user experience of the internet. Many more people were using the internet and technology was much faster than in previous years.  Also, the quality of the gif won't necessarily tell you how old a gif is, because a gif's quality is ultimately limited by the quality of the source video/images. Since the video is dated, the gif may look a little dated, but based purely on the size of the file alone it's safe to estimate that it's probably no older than 2004.  I'd put a good sum of money on even more recent."

The woman didn't die aparently.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokito_(gorilla)"
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Eugenes_Axe,313,Wed Jun 24 06:55:01 2015 UTC,"She had a habit of touching the glass that separated her from the gorillas, while making eye contact with Bokito and smiling at him — a practice that is discouraged by primatologists, as apes are likely to interpret human smiling as a form of aggressive display. Zoo employees had previously warned her against doing this, but she continued, claiming a special bond with him: in an interview with De Telegraaf she said, ""If I smile at him, he smiles back"".[4][2][5]   *sigh*"

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Neodymium,22,Wed Jun 24 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"Probably because to them it's us bearing our teeth, and eye contact to pretty much all animals is something you do only if you're being aggressive..."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,taicrunch,10,Wed Jun 24 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"People always call her stupid for doing this, but I'd like to point out that it's far from impossible to make an enclosure that gorillas cannot escape from. The zoo really should have made a better gorilla cage."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Hillbillyblues,4,Wed Jun 24 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, what can effectively contain a gorilla may be vastly different than what can effectively contain a pissed-off gorilla hell-bent on the murder of someone that's been pissing it off for weeks."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Mortimer1234,5,Wed Jun 24 15:09:12 2015 UTC,This the main point. Normally gorillas are shying away from water and are not likely to jump a 3 meter moat. But if you fuck with them for weeks at a time while behind that moat they eventually snap.

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,MayonnaisePacket,10,Wed Jun 24 20:26:42 2015 UTC,Yep. Good news all around. My concern came from my expectation of an animal attacking a human meaning that the animal must be put down. I am glad that the rest of the world doesn't seem to operate on Alaskan logic.
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,crescentfresh921,63,Wed Jun 24 11:27:40 2015 UTC,No she actually survived that one just got very badly injured. The only source i could find that was fatal gorilla accidentally happened in early 1900s. Apparently it was gay gorilla that had feelings for its handler and ended attacking him out jealousy of his wife/gf

However as a few people have responded, they can be prone to having huge mood swings with little indication even if you know their body language.  Gorillas are simple. Don't stand taller than them, avoid eye contact and sudden movements, and you'll likely be safe. Gorillas are so physically intimidating they're actually less likely to attack because they're less likely to be attacked."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,inlovewithinsanity,27,Wed Jun 24 15:18:16 2015 UTC,The eye contact thing is so weird. Even humans get aggressive sometimes with eye contact. Maybe it's considered some sort of challenge?
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Flaiware,22,Wed Jun 24 14:08:02 2015 UTC,It's also usually the ones looking most like big fucking apes that get aggressive. I think we might be on to something here.
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,dannimatrix,8,Wed Jun 24 10:59:40 2015 UTC,Isn't the eye contact thing true with every animal?
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Flaiware,13,Wed Jun 24 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"Most definitely.  It's weird because as humans, we rely on our sight more than most of our senses.  We tend to look directly at something.  In the animal world, other senses compensate, and they see direct eye contact as a challenge.  Kind of puts us at a disadvantage if we ever find ourselves in the middle of a gorilla enclosure."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,dimtothesum,8,Wed Jun 24 12:57:12 2015 UTC,"As far as cats go, making eye contact and slowly blinking is a sign that you're content and non-aggressive.   Yea I've read that. The blinking part is important though, if you just stare at a cat it will probably see it as a sign of aggression as well."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,gamerpenguin,10,Wed Jun 24 13:07:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes?   There's probably no harm in accidently crossing an ape's eyes, but staring down, at least where I from, is seen as a pretty fucking aggressive act in humans if you don't know the other."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Zenguard,18,Wed Jun 24 11:13:40 2015 UTC,China is an absolute shithole though. People there have no regard for human life. Watch any video of somebody getting injured in an accident and you'll see people just stand there and take pictures or walk by ignoring it.
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Sendmeyourfantasy,13,Wed Jun 24 11:19:46 2015 UTC,"Because if a person there tries to help, the injured one can sue you for causing the harm."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,OppressedCactus,3,Wed Jun 24 11:25:26 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, those are cultural differences.  As the other comment states, there are no good smaratarian laws in china due to this, because they value family ties over strangers.  Just like from an Asian viewpoint, the lack of support for elderly parents etc in western worlds is very much against their cultural values.  That being said, there are other issues too cough."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,TidalSky,11,Wed Jun 24 12:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ugh... You nailed it about the praying. If it's not moving, cat don't care, or he'll be curious then get bored and move on. That guy made himself into something that should be hunted (in kitty minds)."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,thevoiceofzeke,11,Wed Jun 24 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"He probably just fell in there.   Commented in the original post that he probably would've been fine as the tiger was just curious, then people decided to throw rocks which agitated the tiger."
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,dimtothesum,11,Wed Jun 24 21:44:07 2015 UTC,Seriously everyone handled that badly. Waving your arms around in front of a cat (whether you're praying or not) is a good way to initiate play time. Also seems the tiger carried him away because they pelted it with rocks. How did the guy end up in the enclosure anyway?
AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,I_want_hard_work,3,Wed Jun 24 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think this is it.  In that case , he jumped in and lived some time after we see him carried away..."

AnimalsBeingBros,3awwob,Throwaway1944719115,13,Wed Jun 24 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"At that point, he was unconscious or dazed.  The gorillas had backed away a bit when he started to come to and cried a bit.  I believe they signaled for the gorillas to move out of the outdoor enclosure and into the interior portion of their habitat (there's a locking gate separating the interior from the exterior so that the exterior enclosure could be cleaned maintained periodically.)  At that point, rescuers could go down into the moat and pull the kid out."

AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,Hakim_Bey,2,Wed Jun 24 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"Psa: Salt is OK, but apply the pepper AFTER or at the very end of searing/grilling. You will burn the pepper, and it affect the taste negatively.     If you marinate meat in anything that will burn during grilling/searing remove it before heating. This includes the wrong kind of olive oil.    And also (I assume you're from the US): Make sure you have quality meat, or you might as well be a vegetarian."

Even if I use my head to look at a wall or the ceiling he will literally look up as well and try to figure out what I'm trying to tell him. He is a very smart guy and he uses his nose for everything.   I have tried to get my little girl to be as successful at using her nose but she is quite special. She pretty much just tries to figure out what it is that I'm trying to teach her and then gets tired and uninterested. Although, she is really terrific at cuddling and showing affection way more than my big guy."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CreatureOfHabbit,4,Tue Jun 23 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"I have a nearly 14 year old lab who is unfortunately getting to be pretty deaf in her old age.  She can still hear louder sounds, and seems to hear certain frequencies/pitches/whatever better than others, but is pretty deaf to everyday normal volume levels.  We also took in an older lab as a foster home for dogs, and he ended up staying with us for good, and he got to be pretty much completely deaf around the time he was 15 or 16 years old before passing away a little while after.  I've always sort of known how good dogs are at picking up non verbal communication, but it really stands out when they lose their ability to hear.  At least from my perspective, it's almost as if they never lost their hearing, because I still find myself giving commands at a normal volume, and she still follows them, same as the other old lab used to.  Obviously some things are different, like how if she's facing away from me, I'll have to physically touch her to wake her up.  But even in those cases she usually knows exactly why I'm trying to get her attention before I actively try to communicate what it is I want.  She can often know right away without me having to point/motion, or mouth the words whether say, it's time to go for a walk, or just time to go outside, or time for dinner, etc (of course, some of that may be timing, but even if I go to take her for a walk well outside the normal time periods I walk her, she knows when it's time.)"

He looks more like a Doberman than collie as he has that chocolate/brown Doberman color but has longer hair than an actual dobi. And he does get that collie look in his eyes whenever a ball is around. He also is excellent at balancing stuff on his head. :)
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CreatureOfHabbit,3,Wed Jun 24 05:05:41 2015 UTC,That's one of the cutest dogs I've ever seen. Thank you for sharing!
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,stonecolddevin,12,Wed Jun 24 05:31:31 2015 UTC,That is because humans bred dogs to be that way. That doesn't make dogs inherently worth more. It is all illogical sentiments.
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CheesecakeBanana,18,Tue Jun 23 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"1.) Yeah, it is because humans bred dogs this way.  I don't see how this is relevant.  2.) There is no objective value for anything, but people on average are going to more highly value an animal that was specifically crafted to be a companion to one that wasn't in regards to companionship."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,skullpizza,-6,Tue Jun 23 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"The original post was saying, dogs are basically the same as farm animals, we simply eat farm animals. You responded trying to say they were different in some way that made them not worth eating, or something. I responded saying they in fact, are not different at all apart from sentimental reasons, or the obvious practical reasons but people don't care about practicality for pets as much."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CheesecakeBanana,15,Tue Jun 23 20:18:06 2015 UTC,"I never said anything about making them not worth eating.  I said that they are different in measurable metrics in regards to interacting and understanding humans commands and emotional states.  The poster before me basically equated all farm animals with dogs, I refuted this claim with scientific journal articles.  Research suggests most farm animals cannot communicate with humans in the same meaningful way an average dog is capable. I would posit that this is a large factor as to why dogs are more valued on average as companions compared to different types of livestock."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,skullpizza,-5,Tue Jun 23 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Do you think other farm animals couldn't do that if we bred them(to fulfill that purpose) for 10,000 years? That is why I said point number 1, you tried to be clever or simply didn't even try to understand me."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CheesecakeBanana,8,Tue Jun 23 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"You claim I didn't understand you but I did completely.  We certainly could breed other animals to be more like dogs in their ability to interact with humans, hypothetically.    I just don't understand what purpose this would serve, we already have dogs.  But more to the point, I don't know about you, but I don't have ten thousand years to wait around for people to breed a chicken that can understand when I'm sad, and I don't really care if they ever do.  Live stock are the way they are in part because we bred them to be that way, they serve a purpose to fulfill demand for meat.  There wasn't nearly as much selective pressure on them to become more socialized with humans, presumably."
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,skullpizza,-4,Tue Jun 23 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"It seems to me now, your original goal was just to say that the person was wrong. I took it to assume you were disagreeing with the fact that we don't eat them, or harm them, for some arbitrary reason of random scientific measurements. But it seems to me you were not even responding to that person because they were obviously not making an objective statement about the abilities of dogs or others. You could probably find articles saying cows,pigs, sheep are all distinct so bunching them as ""farm animals"" is irresponsible. How valuable would that be?"
AnimalsBeingBros,3au8wq,CheesecakeBanana,3,Tue Jun 23 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"farm animals are just dogs that we eat   This statement is incorrect.  I was responding to it.  The original comment I responded to was the one that generalized all farm animals into one group, I simply followed the format and disagreed with the general premise.  Dogs are very unique among all other animals in the animal kingdom in that there is scientific evidence that they are better at interpreting human demands more than any other animal currently known.  It is their defining characteristic in many respects, in my opinion.  This is what sets them apart from other ""farm animals"", indeed it's what sets them apart from every other animal on the planet.  It is also why people tend to choose them as companion animals and why, in my view, the statement    farm animals are just dogs that we eat   is incorrect."

AnimalsBeingBros,3aqa9m,justcurious22,4,Tue Jun 23 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"It was heavily sarcasm. Yes, this dog is on a pier. But, it's a dog. It can at speeds of up to 45 miles an hour. If that dog sees something and runs, well, exactly how far is the pier to the street? Not very far at all, would probably take a minute or so to get there.   As for the stolen thing, same situation. Dog wanders off. Owners can't catch dog. Stranger sees dog. Dog doesn't have any collar or tags signifying it has an owner or how to contact it. Stranger thinks, ""Oh, poor little beastie, abandoned down here! Why, you're so sweet, you must have been a pet at some point. I'll take you home with me.""Dog now has a new home. Owners are sad.   People just don't like hearing it 1. because they come to these subs for something cute and 2. because there are a lot of really irresponsible pet owners on reddit who think off leash is the best way to act and don't respond well to warnings or criticism. So, downvote me because I'm ""no fun at all and literally hitler"" for daring to suggest that the dog isn't safe, both in regards to him/herself and to others."

She has one bone that is plastic that she never plays with, just tries to hide. If she can't find a spot she will put it on the carpet and bury it. It looks exactly like how this dog was burying, without the water. Of course she was doing it above the carpet so she was only moving air but it is instinctual thing for them to go through the motions of burying it.   I don't know why they do, but I know they do. Some sort of instinctual thing to bury their food for later or hide it from others, I'm assuming."

The cat is trying to kill the fish. The cat failed and the fish fell into the water and swam away, so the cat got bored, gave up, and walked away.

They typically possess a long snout and nonretractile claws (in contrast to the cat-like carnivorans, the Feliformia). The Pinnipedia (seals and sea lions) evolved from caniform ancestors and are accordingly assigned to this group. Most members of this group have nonretractile claws (the fisher,  marten,  red panda,  and ringtail have retractile or semi-retractile claws ) [citation needed] and tend to be plantigrade (with the exception of Canidae). Other traits that separate the Caniformia from the Feliformia is that caniforms have longer jaws and have more teeth, with less specialized carnassial teeth. They also tend more towards omnivorous and opportunistic feeding, while the feliforms are more specialized for eating meat. Caniforms have single-chambered or partially divided auditory bullae, composed of a single bone, while in feliforms the auditory bullae are double-chambered, composed of two bones joined by a septum.

The ""hyper sensitive""  front paws are protected by a thin horny layer which becomes pliable when wet.  The five digits of the paws have no webbing between them, which is unusual for a carnivoran.  Almost two-thirds of the area responsible for sensory perception in the raccoon's cerebral cortex is specialized for the interpretation of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal.  They are able to identify objects before touching them with vibrissae located above their sharp, nonretractable claws.  The raccoon's paws lack an opposable thumb; thus, it does not have the agility of the hands of primates.  There is no observed negative effect on tactile perception when a raccoon stands in water below 10 °C (50 °F) for hours.

It was house broken after showing it the kittie litter box once. I still marvel at that. It used to sit in the hood of my sweatshirt when I cut grass. It banged around all night. It was like a three year old who never grew up. After 6 months it began nipping when it was around you. Not aggressively. Just always did it. We thought it was getting up in age when it might become aggressive. There were little kids around and they have needles for claws and teeth. We took him to a rehabber who eventually releases them back into the wild. My wife's son let his go to the woods when it was ready, since they lived next to the woods. She returned the following year with a couple babies. He fed her. She left and never returned."

AnimalsBeingBros,3afvk6,5edgy,0,Sat Jun 20 13:13:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen cattle line up on one of my dogs. I've read many stories like this: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=108_1245679238. I've been around cattle dogs, working cattle dogs, and they're not your typical house pet or city dog. Someone spoke in another comment about people not understanding what we humans have created. Cattle have preservation instincts and they see all canids as potential threats. Our pet dogs are short on understanding the threats around them. I've done herding, tracking, and protection work with dogs. And I, too, was ignorant of the danger presented by cattle, until about 10 years ago.   I was on a ranch and had a city dog with me. He was a great Rott, excelled in obedience, would nab a frisbee out of the air at six feet, and just the sweetest boy ever. We were out there to feed horses and cattle with their owner. Entering a building, he told me, ""You better get your dog. Those cows will kill him."" I looked out the door and sure enough, the cattle were lining up. I brought my dog inside.  Meanwhile, in the ensuring years, I've read many stories of people and dogs being killed. Most of those deaths seem to have been in the UK, where people walk their dogs in spaces occupied by cattle."

AnimalsBeingBros,3afvk6,5edgy,2,Sat Jun 20 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"Another point is that prior to training any dog for risky work, the dog's character and disposition is assessed to determine the dog's suitability for the type of work involved. Dogs have various ""drives,"" such as prey drive, pack drive, etc. Dogs can be ""hard"" or ""soft."" A hard dog thinks it is invincible, is unperturbed by most stimuli, and is great for protection work. A soft dog might wilt if given a stern look. Most dogs are soft. They're brought up in protected environments and generally don't face many threats. To assess a prospective herding dog's temperament, it is first exposed to ducks, then sheep, before cattle. That's by plan and is not happenstance.  I've been in dog rescue for almost 20 years and many, many dogs have lived in my home. I know dogs well. Since learning of the dangers of them being around cattle, I've had only one dog that would be allowed around cattle. She was sharp as a tack and a full on predator. She'd happily run 20 to 30 miles a day. Cattle just didn't have anything for her. She'd run right through the middle of them. And there was nothing they could do about it, although I'd see them turn to address the perceived threat.  One element of dealing with cattle is ""getting your bluff in"" on them. Who blinks first? It had best not be you or your dog. My neighbors are ranchers and have a working cattle dog. The intensity of that dog, her steely eyes, it's an amazing thing to see. She knows I'm there, hears what I'm saying, but her laser locked stare through the fence at my dogs doesn't flinch. That's the only kind of dog that should be around cattle, and even then only if you're prepared to go home without her."

Here we have an animal who is, in many respects, similar to a threatening pack predator... but he's just sitting there. So the cows are probably fascinated by the contradiction.

AnimalsBeingBros,3afvk6,iLikeOnesies,-1,Sat Jun 20 06:40:42 2015 UTC,"Cattle do NOT like dogs. Not that dogs haven't passed unscathed through a herd, but dogs AND their owners have been killed in attempting to do so.  It's the standard predator and prey relationship. Cattle have an instinctive fear of all canids.  I wish people would quit perpetuating these feel-good images of dogs that have been fortunate enough to survive their encounters with cattle. The cows are assessing a threat here. They didn't stop by to say hello.  There's an understanding among those who work herding dogs that one should never take into the field a dog that they aren't prepared to go home without.  If cattle attack, most dogs' instinct is to seek protection behind their human. That's as fine a way to die as any, I suppose.  Please quit posting these pictures out of ignorance. This isn't a happy situation. It's an extremely lucky one."

They can choke to death if allowed to eat without water. Check often throughout the day, as they drink large amounts.
