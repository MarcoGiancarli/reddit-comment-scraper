Kanye,3dub3l,Rogerss93,17,Mon Jul 20 15:25:07 2015 UTC,Apparently he didn't ask kid cudi if he could use some studio stock of him for guilt trip and cudi didn't even know he was in the song till the album came out and said something about how if ye wanted him on a track he should've told him and he would've come and did it for real. They haven't done anything since that AFAIK so there's a filet mignon there.

Kanye,3dub3l,Kingdariush,4,Sun Jul 19 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"Its fair to say that the downfalls to Yeezus, cases like these, could be blamed on how rushed the album was at the end. Ye and Rubin were just steaming through whatever they had with no time for any legalities etc, which is a shame."
Kanye,3dub3l,awkwardhipsters,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:48:19 2015 UTC,You're letting me down here bro. Yeezus is his second best album to me. I would call it pure (sonic) perfection. 10+! What a shame you can't recognize a clearly (non-rushed) designed album.
Kanye,3dub3l,besane,9,Sun Jul 19 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"Are you being sarcastic or not? Rick Rubin admitted they rushed everything in 3 weeks, Kanye approached him with tons of material and the deadline the record label had given him, they rushed everything they could.  The album is one of my all-time favourites, but I won't deny the imperfection of the process behind it. Who knows what it could have been had it was less rushed?"
Kanye,3dub3l,awkwardhipsters,0,Sun Jul 19 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Not in the slightest man. Kanye never called the album rushed. Instead he said to have worked on the lyrics for 2 straight years.. he was constantly writing down new interesting thoughts etcetera. The record was done when Rubin came in to strip it down. Rubin was ofcourse amazed by his shortscheduled work ethic, but couldn't grasp Kanye's oversight when he called it rushed.  To close it all off. Kanye went on record and said something like: ""this was the first time the album sounded exactly like i wanted"". Am too lazy to find the exact quote right now, if someone has it.. help me out! :P"
Kanye,3dub3l,besane,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with that, and I agree it's a great sounding album, but I'm talking about the issue with Kid Cudi- the rushing led to legalities being overlooked."

Kanye,3dv5fs,Gazareth,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you kind of. I like that he can go to a historically rock festival Glastonbury, have people petition against him, and then have tens of thousands of fans sing his songs along with him, and then troll all the petitioners by proclaiming himself the greatest living rockstar. He def. embraces the bad boy image but if you go too far with it, it gets harder to get airplay, to sell records, and more importantly for his goals, to sell clothing and be taken seriously by the industry. All day, should be a huge summer hit, but it's just kind of hit the airwaves like ""meh"". Granted I'm not really a fan of the song as a Kanye song, but it is a great hip hop song that by any other artist would be a huge hit."

You're using quotes out of context and your opinion of said quotes, combining them with poorly thought out theories and stating something as fact.  Drake would still be a chart topper if Kanye didn't release an album in 2008.  Influence/inspiration don't create an artist, they create art. Drake would still have created popular art."

Drake even states Kanye's and 808's influence on his career. Drake may have made it big without it, but Drake as Drake is today would not have happened without Kanye and 808's."

Kanye,3dqt76,v3ne,37,Sun Jul 19 08:56:00 2015 UTC,"I picked these 5 songs because I interpret them as the progression of a dysfunctional relationship. And beautifully done at that.  Devil In A New Dress - things are starting to go bad,  Runaway - breakup,  Hell of a Life - post breakup reckless lifestyle,  Blame Game - recklessness wears off, thinking about ex,  Lost in the World - lost in the world"
Kanye,3dqt76,Optimus_Mediocre,85,Sat Jul 18 19:29:17 2015 UTC,"Disagree.   It's a great run of songs, but I could never say that it's a better run than dark fantasy-monster. All of the lights and power are two of the most famous, most well-produced Kanye songs ever, gorgeous has ridiculously impressive lyricism, monster is a legendary banger with the only nicki verse I've truly enjoyed, and dark fantasy is my favourite opener ever, also with some amazing lyricism(2manyurkels)."
Kanye,3dqt76,tml417,60,Sat Jul 18 17:58:34 2015 UTC,The fact that you're debating which two sequences are better on the same album shows how good MBDTF is.

Kanye,3dqt76,SDJ67,11,Sat Jul 18 17:08:14 2015 UTC,Agree but that only works if you take out John Legend's I'll Fly Away prelude to Spaceship. But that is a great run of songs too.

But damn Lost in the World is good.   When I was anxiously waiting for MBDTF and Lost in the World leaked I wanted the song to last forever.  I actually ripped the Runaway film version wich has like 2 minutes of Justin Vernon's intro. It sets the mood for the song so well."

Kanye,3dqt76,Kingdariush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:53 2015 UTC,The Glory - Good Night tho...
Kanye,3dqt76,Scarscape,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"That whole album would be perfect all the way through if it weren't for Drunk and Hot Girls and Everything I Am. Don't get me wrong, I love Everything I Am (Drunk and Hot Gils is amazing as well), but it doesn't really fit with the album."
Kanye,3dqt76,pheymanss,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"To me Everything I am does, Drunk and Hot girls definitely doesn't. One is Kanye dropping the nonsense and getting soulful (I'm sorry, I can't find a better word than that) and Drunk and Hot girls is the exact opposite. Also Mos Def's worst collabo un his entire career."
Kanye,3dqt76,pheymanss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"I know Can't Tell me Nothing is far more popular since it was a single, but I can't fathom having a 5 song streak form Graduation without Good Morning."
Kanye,3dqt76,garretts101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:04:44 2015 UTC,I agree with OP.  Quick question: does anyone else's iTunes mess up the playlist on MBDTF? Who Will Survive In America is always the second track after Dark Fantasy. It really rustles my jimmies.
Kanye,3dqt76,pheymanss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm very happy for MBDTF and I'mma let it finish but Good Morning-Champion-Stronger-I Wonder-Good Life is the best 5 song run of all time. ALL TIME.
Kanye,3dqt76,john_ny_800m,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"Vehemently disagree. In fact, Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, POWER, All of the Lights, Monster is 10x better. I hate almost all of the second half of the album (Lost in the World and the outro save it)."
Kanye,3dqt76,WirelessSurvivor,4,Sat Jul 18 19:00:59 2015 UTC,Blame Game? Runaway?
Kanye,3dqt76,Scarscape,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"Although I think Runaway and Devil In a New Dress are good, they're the weakest songs on the album IMO."
Kanye,3dqt76,WirelessSurvivor,3,Sun Jul 19 02:10:27 2015 UTC,Runaway I think is widely considered one of Kanye's finest works and in my opinion Hell of a Life is probably the weakest (even though D.I.A.N.D. isn't my cup of tea)
Kanye,3dqt76,Scarscape,5,Sun Jul 19 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware that a lot of people on this sub think Runaway in the best Kanye song of all time, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Hell of a Life sounds really awesome to me and I don't really know why."
Kanye,3dqt76,TheDrugUser,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:46:00 2015 UTC,The super deep voice in the chorus layering kanyes voice is what really made me love it. The track is beautifully psychotic.
Kanye,3dqt76,pheymanss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:08:15 2015 UTC,"Devil in a new dress is actuality my favorite. It also has the added value that he first released a 3 minute version for his G.O.O.D. Fridays,and  then the interlude in the album version fucked my brain."
Kanye,3dqt76,Assassinationday,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:07:21 2015 UTC,How could you think runaway is weak
Kanye,3dqt76,Scarscape,3,Sun Jul 19 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"Vocoder part at the end is kind of annoying to me. I can't relate to the lyrics that much. Pusha T verse is alright, but not really as good as everyone says it is, IMO. I like the hook though"
Kanye,3dqt76,Assassinationday,3,Sun Jul 19 02:53:30 2015 UTC,Respect your opinion but its one of my fav songs of all time and I love all the parts of it
Kanye,3dqt76,john_ny_800m,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, those are the the worst songs on the album in my very honest opinion."
Kanye,3dqt76,Rise_Regime,27,Sun Jul 19 03:49:22 2015 UTC,You're part of the problem with comments like this lol
