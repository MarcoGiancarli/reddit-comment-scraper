HipHopImages,3e2m0s,jhans13,22,Tue Jul 21 15:21:14 2015 UTC,dude i don't know when or where people started spelling it as 'loose'. now it's so common i just read it as lose. idk man.
HipHopImages,3e2m0s,i_eatbooty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's a phonetic thing, like, beyond people just being bad at spelling.  ""Loose"" has a different sound than ""lose"", and some dialects/accents (like Gucci's) just pronounce ""lose"" as ""loose""."
HipHopImages,3e2m0s,don_leno,3,Tue Jul 21 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"""You better not loose that load"" could also mean ""Don't let the load get loose"" aka don't be shooting a place up."

All the top billing was at the main stage so I didn't miss out on that once all the other stages closed. I did get to check out Kendrick, Cole and the other Top Dawg performers that were there so that was cool.  It was awesome but like someone else pointed out the years prior were a different festival. More classic hip hop than anything, where De La Soul and Tribe were the headliners kinda thing. Love it or hate it, I'm surprised at how many of these up and coming rappers have risen to the top.   Here's 2010 and I specifically remember seeing the newbie Wiz playing the smaller stage haha."

HipHopImages,3duh6f,Waagwai,4,Sun Jul 19 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"It's just like one of those apps that listen to what song you listen to, find you the song and give you lyrics to it, but you can link it to shit like Spotify. It gets what you're listening to by letting Spotify broadcast what you're listening to to other apps and shows you the lyrics over whatever app you're using atm, or you can just open the app up with Spotify in the background, which you can see in the original post. Pretty cool."

HipHopImages,3duh6f,dkon777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"Go to your Spotify settings and find a setting that says Device Broadcast Status, if you turn that on it allows other apps on your phone to see what you're listening to. If you turn that on, then play a song while the musixmatch app is open in the background, it should bring up a box with the lyrics. That's how you do it on android, so I don't imagine it should be any different."

HipHopImages,3dsrxz,DankingtonNugwell,7,Sun Jul 19 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yams had helped build the ASAP brand around a certain image, including gucci goggles and gold teeth, but at the same time he despises the people who buy into that image. It's basically like if a CEO said that his customers are idiots for buying his products. And the last part about ""I'm not here to kick knowledge, just to get dollas"" sounds like him  saying that it's not his responsibility how people dress/act but he sure doesn't mind making money off them.

That being said, he does say some things that are hypocritical and self-righteous, but it's still great to read because he's being genuine.   I don't agree with it all, but it's cool to have people who are looked up to, and that are poster boys for that lifestyle, to give people a new perspective to consider."
