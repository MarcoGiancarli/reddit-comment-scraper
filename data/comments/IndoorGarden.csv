Until recently both the lower stems were green, one has completely browned off now... Not sure why. Think i have the watering schedule down. The upper 3 arms, however have all shown growth in height and foliage lately and it leads me to think the plant is picking favourites...  Anyway to encourage growth in the lower leaves... would make the overall plant far more attractive."

Not nearly as old as your Moms/Great Gramma's by a lot. It's kind of a needy plant so don't feel too bad that it reacted poorly. Google it, I saw something about loosing leaves if overwatered. I have learned to keep mine in the bathroom during the winter and outside for the summer and it's happy. . It took me a while to figure out what it liked and it looked pretty sad for a good while though. Good luck!"

It will grow back quickly and more thickly, then you can prune it as it grows depending on how you'd like it to look. Pruning the top most growth to prevent it from getting any longer makes it thicker over time. Pruning new growth is as easy as plucking it off. You can also make gouges in the base between nodes and it will branch out from there, giving it a bushier look. I personally prefer tree-like sheffleras, but people also make them bushy. All through guided pruning, much like bonsai :)"

You can combat them by putting a 1/2 inch of sand over the potting mix. The leaves could be curling do to sunburn, overfertilization, or overwatering/underwatering.

IndoorGarden,3dknoa,m4gpi,3,Fri Jul 17 01:14:50 2015 UTC,"Mealybugs live in the roots as well as on the plant. Breaking the stems won't do a thing unless you repot the entire plant first. You'll need all new soil, and to do an extremely thorough root rinse with alcohol (I've used mouthwash in the past) and/or neem.  Discard the pot and the old soil far far away from any houseplants.   Once you have the plant outside and out of the dirt it's in, don't repot it until you have gone over the whole thing and can't see any more mealybugs or their little yellow eggs. Spray alcohol on the tops and undersides of all the leaves and scrub with a toothbrush. They love to hide in cracks and crevices. At this point you're working against the clock because you don't want the roots to be exposed to the air for more than an hour or two. Maybe three would be ok as long as you replant into moistened soil. You might want to prepare the new pot before you take it out of the old one.  Also try not to repot in the heat of the day, morning or evening would be best.  After repotting continue to spray with neem every other day or so for a few weeks until you're positive there are none left. Spray the plant, the top layer of soil, the entire pot and the surface it sits on in case they come from somewhere else. In my case I got them from neighbors who were growing weed."
IndoorGarden,3dknoa,rogue_chicken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:28:51 2015 UTC,This is super-helpful. Thanks so much.   You think it's ok to spray neem that often? I was thinking I was over-doing it.
IndoorGarden,3dknoa,rogue_chicken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:34:24 2015 UTC,As an oil it shouldn't be absorbed into the plant very readily. The only thing you might do is wash the residue off the leaves once a week or so in case the buildup starts to inhibit breathability. Best of luck!

IndoorGarden,3dknoa,logictwisted,2,Fri Jul 17 05:35:59 2015 UTC,Maybe consider a systemic insecticide too. That's my last resort on those fuckers.
IndoorGarden,3dknoa,logictwisted,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"The trick to killing mealybugs is to break the lifecycle of the insect.  The sprays you're using only kill the adults.  They have no affect on the eggs or larvae.    I've had the best success with Safer's insecticidal soap (you could also use a diluted solution of Dawn dish liquid and water).  Spray the plant every 5 days for at least three weeks to kill the bugs.  Make sure they're not coming back from another source (open window, other houseplants that can host the eggs).  You say you've been using neem oil - that will work too, but it builds up on the leaves and can clog the plants pores, inhibiting its ability to breath.  After you use neem oil, wash it off before applying again (that's why I prefer the soap - it just dries up and falls off).    I had one Cattleya (orchid) that I just couldn't clean up, no matter what I did.  The plant wasn't even in soil, just attached to a wooden basket.  The mealybugs were laying eggs under the paper around the pseudo bulbs, and the plant was too big to clean properly - I couldn't even submerge it in a bucket of water.  If you're in this kind of situation (or you're just at the end of your rope and really want to save the plant), treat with Merit 75WP.  This is a systemic insecticide, which becomes part of the plant.  Once the plant has taken up the substance, it becomes incorporated in its cells, and the plant becomes toxic to mealybugs, aphids, and other nasty stuff.  Because you have an active infestation, drench the plant in Merit two weeks in a row (maybe 3, if you want to be careful).  Treat other houseplants as well.  Merit only kills adult bugs, but because its a systemic, newly formed adults that try to chow down on your plant will die a very sudden death.  Be sure to follow safety instructions on the label.  Merit is fairly easy to work with, compared to other products, but you should still use it in a well ventilated area until the plant dries off.  I would not use Merit in the garden as it's toxic to earthworms.    After you've killed the active infestation, treat all your houseplants about twice a year, just to keep everything clean.   Good luck!"

Yeah this puppy is in a gigantic pot - I can barely drag it across the floor, let alone lift it.  Which is part of why I wanted to repot it - no way could I get it into a tub to give it a drench."

When I noticed that you have two tomatoes growing in something that looks quite small, I envisioned the big veggies fighting for space and light, while the little herbs reach up as hard as they can before flopping over.  Maybe I am completely misjudging the size of the light, but tomatoes are usually planted 3-4 feet apart, so this looks like it only has room for one mature tomato plant.  Also, by that time, the light will need to be 4 feet higher up, making it impossible for anything lower down to grow (plants like to be close to fluorescent bulbs, 3-4 inches away).  No offense though, seriously, it's great that you have a little garden growing in your apartment.  I'm just wondering how this will turn out down the road; I looked up that Aerogrow contraption, and to my surprise, people love those things.  But!  Everyone uses them for salad greens or herbs, not both at once, and never with tomato plants mixed in.  So, now I'm double-curious how this will turn out!  My vote goes toward what I describe above, but I hope that's wrong; after all, I only spent two minutes looking into it :D  Thanks for sharing, I'll be watching for progress pics.  Good luck, and happy growing!"
IndoorGarden,3d52my,SteadyDietOfNothing,2,Mon Jul 13 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that the herbs are probably going to stretch really badly in this. Going to be hard to balance the tomatoes and them successfully. I'm assuming you just raised the light so it wasn't in the way for the pictures, but if not you can keep it almost right on top of the plants. The closer it is the better.   Also one winter I kept a Roma tomato going all winter under a 400W HPS, and those suckers get huge.

Then I'll just put them out on the balcony and just let them be for the rest of the season. From then on I'll just stick to the recomended plants for the contraption.

IndoorGarden,3d52my,DevIceMan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty garden!  This is how it all gets started  Most varieties of tomato plants are impractical to grow indoors, even with a semi-professional setup like what I have.   Indeterminate varieties grow really long vines, whereas indeterminate grow very bushy.  In the small aero-garden, you'll likely find your tomato plant quickly outgrowing your system.  The pepper plant will also out-grow your aero-garden eventually, but more likely it'll grow a bit wider and shade out nearby plants.  Most herbs will probably do fine in an aero-garden.  The last thing I noticed is you have a clear cup on top of your empty slot.  Cover that with something that does not allow like to go through.  Light will encourage algae growth."
IndoorGarden,3d56rm,a_peninsula,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"I went down pretty much the same path you did with a thrip infestation on my office plants.  The only thing that finally got rid of them was an application of imidacloprid.  One application killed 99% of them, and a second application a week or so later finished them off.  Haven't come back in the 8 months since.  Supposedly it actually absorbs into the plant tissues and makes the plant toxic.  If you use it, it smells pretty odd and isn't something you really want around your office so you'll need to spray it on outside in the evening and bring the plant back in the next morning."
IndoorGarden,3d56rm,Aetyrno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, imidacloprid. I use a protect and feed granular version indoors-- one of the big plastic jugs that you sprinkle onto the soil (I like the Rose Care version). As you water, it dissolves and is taken up to make the plant ""inhospitable"". Always keep in mind that you probably want to avoid using systemics outside unless the flowering cycle has ended for the season. Indoors I have no qualms with them at all. Very effective for long-term control."
IndoorGarden,3d2a0w,eleanor_ramilly,5,Sun Jul 12 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"The first is an asparagus fern. I dont really understand why people turn these into potted plants because they have huge root systems and are perennial. Each year an asparagus fern winters over outside, it gets bigger and grows more asparagus. They're pretty awesome as a bush in a yard in partial sun or shade. The second two are easy houseplants and should do just fine as long as you don't over water them. They don't even need direct sunlight as long as they are in a bright window. You can do away with the curtain guard. The window is plenty filter for the sunlight.  Most common houseplants are designed to be easy and just need light and water. If you're trying too hard, you're probably loving them to death. Biggest mistakes of people who just ""can't keep houseplants alive"" are usually these:  More water does not mean more love. Don't water a plant until the top layer of soil is dry, roughly to the level of your first knuckle. When you do water completely soak the soil but don't leave it soggy.  Putting your plants outside on a nice day in direct sunlight will burn them. Plants need to acclimate to high light slowly. Unless it's a special plant that really needs it, often its best to just leave houseplants indoors.  Potted plants need occasional fertilizing. Go to any chain hardware store or gardening store and you can find a basic potted plant fertilizer to add to your water. Follow the instruction because you can burn your plant with too much fertilizer."

The pebbles are to slow the evaporation of the water in the tray and also keeps your pot from being too soggy. The water level in the tray should be just below the top of the gravel. Those ceramic pots look nice, keep them in there! You can also set out these trays next to the plants or get a tray that's larger than the nice pots."
IndoorGarden,3d2a0w,FunkyTreasureHunter,2,Mon Jul 13 13:55:57 2015 UTC,I think the first one is asparagus fern?
IndoorGarden,3d2a0w,FunkyTreasureHunter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Just did an image search and I think you're right. Wow, they get big. Should we think of repotting it so it can grow? Do you think it can live in a little pot?"
IndoorGarden,3d2a0w,renewedhope,2,Mon Jul 13 00:23:55 2015 UTC,I think it can groove in there for a while at least.  Maybe one of starts taking off then repot it?
IndoorGarden,3d0f3v,obinice_khenbli,3,Sun Jul 12 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"/u/RyanGaussling sounds about right.  Just to add (I grow orchids, and this can be a common problem)...  make sure your cutting tools are clean and sterile.  Isopropyl alcohol from the drug store on a paper towel is just fine.  You could also boil your tools, or use a small kitchen blow torch.  After you make the cut, sterilize your tools before you use them again to prevent the infection from spreading.  I would also treat the end of the cut cane with a fungicide.  You can check at your local garden center, or you can use ground cinnamon, which actually works quite well.    Make the cut about 0.5"" above one of those nice, green shoots - that's where the crown should try to regenerate."
IndoorGarden,3d0f3v,logictwisted,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hey folks! Thanks for your help recently sorting out the flies in my soil :) Now I have a new problem haha that I need a quick solution to!  In the process of trying to save this plant after it was very badly treated (dumped outside my hospital for a week in terrible conditions), I've had to cut a bunch of the stems off. The leaves all died, and some of the stems started to shrivel and turn black & squidgy from the top downwards. I let this continue until I saw that the plant wasn't going to be able to halt this rot (or whatever it is?), so I cut the stems at the base so that the plant could focus its energy on the younger, still healthy stems.  Anyway, I've just found that one of my young stems seems to have begun this rotting process (you can see a minor change between last night and today, I think it will only get worse....), but it seems to have new shoots right near the end that I really want to save! Haven't seen these shoots on any of the other stems!  Do I try to cut the tip of the stem off to save the rest? Is there anything I can do to help on top of that? I want to act quickly to try to save these shoots if I can!  Again, thanks for the help :) As you can see from the far right pic, with your guidance my plant's slowly coming back to life!"
IndoorGarden,3d0f3v,RyanGaussling,2,Sun Jul 12 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"I would cut it cleanly about an inch below the rot, but I'm not an expert. When you cut it, make sure you cut it at a slight angle and that you don't crush the fibers"
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,geckospots,2,Sun Jul 12 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"I have a couple little citrus trees and they are very picky. Any change or anything they don't like will cause to to start dropping leaves. Make sure the soil dries out a bit between watering. Check a few inches down into the soil to make sure its not still wet inside and just dry on top. Also Make sure they get a lot of direct sun light. Those blinds might shade it a bit and also if its in a black pot it can get to hot. I would go with a bit bigger pot and use a light colored one, like yellow or cream colored are easy to find. Fertilizer, I use fish emulsion, about a tablespoon in a gallon of water."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,MoonGrass09,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply!  It's in a south-facing window so it should be getting all kinds of light - we're currently getting about 20 hours of daylight, of which easily half is direct sun through the window. There hasn't been much direct sunlight over the last 10 days or so, but it's never dropped leaves like this before in the winter when sunlight is extremely limited (only 3-4 hours per day).  I will make sure it dries out fully before I water it, and see if I have a light-coloured pot to transfer it into. I'd be deeply surprised if fish emulsion fertilizer was in the stores here (of which there are only a couple, I live in a very small town) but I'll look for it online.  edited to actually type out the light amounts."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,MoonGrass09,2,Mon Jul 13 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"Oh ok cool. I am by no means an expert but just from my experience. There are plenty of other fertilizers you can use, that's just what I think works best, its organic and cheap. I have a store called tractor supply that sells it but you can also find it at places like Lowes or Home Depot. But being a small town you can look, they have it on amazon for around ten bucks with shipping. Just from those pics its looks awful wet. What kind of soil is it in? If you repot it Id also make sure to use something that drains really well. I mix a bit of sand and hard wood chips in with my potting soil. The roots need a bit of air so they dont rot."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,MoonGrass09,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"It's just standard potting soil, but I have some orchid bark mix coming in so when that gets here I'll repot and add a cup of the bark."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,cantcountnoaccount,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, that will be perfect."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,BeSeXe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"Two great fertilizers for Citrus are Dyna-Grow Foliage Pro, which is a liquid you dilute in water and you have to buy online, and Osmocote Plus, which is a time-release granule and they sell at Home Depot and I imagine, many hardware stores (make sure its PLUS)"
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,MoonGrass09,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"I think I'm over watering my orange tree. How much water do you suggest when the soil is dry? Mine is a 3 year old tree, it looks sad, and is in a 12 inch pot soil is a mixture of perlite and organic soil.  I have been doing the finger test because I'm notorious for over loving plants."
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,BeSeXe,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:15 2015 UTC,I only water mine just a bit. Enough to make the top totally moist. Also depending on the type of pot make sure to allow any excess to drain out. As long as the soil and pot allow for good draining the amount you water you water at a time wont make much of a difference. The frequency of watering is whats most important.
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,MoonGrass09,2,Thu Jul 16 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"Great thanks! I have a good draining pot and I mixed a ton of perlite in it, so it's just my watering that I need to work on. Though, the poor tree had a scale bug infestation. Which is why it's probably unhappy. Thank goodness for neem oil!"
IndoorGarden,3d0htm,BeSeXe,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:57 2015 UTC,Yes neem works wonders. I just used some on my goji bush for spider mites!
IndoorGarden,3cz11b,SwankyPigFly,2,Sun Jul 12 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, the germination tray is on the radiator. It increases germination rates in winter, so I can start my plants earlier.
