atheismrebooted,2l6qwu,ChocolateSunrise,10,Mon Nov 3 19:54:40 2014 UTC,"Maher has been taken out of context by the Ben Afflecks.  Maher simply stated that of the approximately 1.5 billion Muslims, roughly 500 million of them think that killing someone for leaving Islam, or insulting Islam, is the right thing to do. And that what ISIS is doing seems perfectly fine to them. There is a smaller sub-group of the 500M that are the actual Islamic extremists that actually do the beheadings and other forms of terror. But Maher's point was that those 500 million people are the problem, and that that number of people is greater than the population of the entire USA.  Conversely, the point Maher is not being given credit for making because it went unstated by him, is that the overwhelming majority of Muslims, two-thirds or roughly 1 billion people, are peaceful. People who would never dream of committing an act of terror, or killing someone for leaving their faith, or stoning their daughter to death for getting raped and not marrying her rapist. Do the math. See the bigger picture.  Maher has spoken out against religion and fundamentalists of all kinds. Yet only when he does it about Islam, does he get labelled as a racist. smh."
atheismrebooted,2l6qwu,theDagman,6,Mon Nov 3 20:58:51 2014 UTC,"Exactly. When he slammed the Orthodox Jews and their practices, not a peep. When he slammed the pedophile protecting catholic church, crickets. Now he mentions that a portion of Muslim think it's okay to kill members who leave the faith, critize the religion, or are gay and its a real problem. everyone loses their fucking mind. People should realize no religion is safe from criticism and being made fun of."
atheismrebooted,2l6qwu,Fonsiloco,-3,Mon Nov 3 22:01:51 2014 UTC,"That is not correct. When he talks about the orthodox Jews he talks about orthodox Jews. When he talks about the Catholic Church priests, he is talking about the Catholic Church priests. What he is talking about extremist Muslims, he is talking about all Muslims. He is not making a difference. That is where the problem arises, it is one of generalization."
atheismrebooted,2l6qwu,NewYorkBeliever,1 point,Mon Nov 3 23:44:16 2014 UTC,"First of all if you think 500 million Muslims agree with Isis you are gravely mistaken. Do not think that statistics that show that a group of Muslims believe you should punish apostasy by putting the person to death is a quibble in anyway to be heading innocent people. It is a completely false statement!  He is called racist, or better yet prejudice, because he is generalizing one .5 billion people based on the actions of the few. If you want to talk about poles that talk about specific laws that Muslim support, you could do that on an individual basis. To group all Muslims who think different ways into an extremist group that literally be heads and kills innocent people is is extremely ignorant and offensive."

Christians say that on Christmas they give gifts to others because 1) show love for others, 2)emulate the story of the Magi bringing gifts to baby Jesus and 3) commemorate the gift of Jesus to us from God. Santa Claus is sort of a vehicle for gift giving, traditionally boiled down from Saint Nicholas into the modern symbol.   Here we see Santa Claus in someone's house, looking down approvingly on a Nativity set on a mantle or table.   A Christian child raised to believe in Santa would see this as a picture of a possible reality. A Christian adult who understands Santa to be a myth will see a playfulness in the picture as a symbol recognizes his origins. Some Christians would be offended by the picture.  If you believe in neither it's really just craziness."

Neither the prompting statement nor the question was disrespectful, nor even confrontational, far as I could tell.  Well, shit.  Way to exclude potentially interested parties for the sake of your laziness.  I was a CS major.  I didn't take classes whose content appeared to be obvious, so I kinda skipped enrolling for social justice and equality.  And I doubt that the majority of the people you're trying to reach (e.g., those with unacknowledged privilege, but an interest in socially equitable policy and behavior) have.  And your formative claim is that atheism has a problem with [insert demographic here]ism, so why wouldn't it be a 101 class?  Wouldn't that be a better public service than the ""fuck these regressives"" circlejerk it is?  Apparently, expecting respectful conversation is another argument from assumed privilege.  Ok, so that was harsh.  But seriously: the extreme censorship is counterproductive, and largely why A+ can't break 5k subscribers.  It's not that there's only 5,000 socially conscious atheists; it's because you keep banning those who didn't attend 4 years of feminist studies, as a result have no idea what you're talking about half the time, and ask innocent questions about how to get where you are.

There are many sects that have disagreements about what is necessary for belief. For example, in Christianity, Baptists despise homosexuality and basically hate anyone that is gay; Whereas Methodists are completely open and accepting of it. You wouldn't go on to say that Methodists are not real Christians and the Baptists are because they interpret certain passages of the bible more literally. With that said, we should still be aloud to criticise Christianity and Islam, as a whole, because there are texts that unify the sects. We can criticise these bad ideas and outdated texts without generalizing the people that follow them. Muslims are not bad people, people who interpret the Koran and Hadith literally and try to impose those specific views on other people through violence are bad people."

However pointing out things in ones religion that followers don't know about or disagree with is the first step in them realizing the truth about religion."

We’re talking polls that have been done over decades, time and time again telling us what people are thinking about the world. So this idea that we are making generalizations? It’s just stupid. We understand that 1.5 billion people don’t all think alike and that there are differences from country-to-country, but you can’t advance any sort of knowledge without making generalizations and it doesn’t mean they’re inaccurate. To say that it’s a widespread belief in the Muslim world that death is the appropriate response to leaving the religion is just a statement of fact.

atheismrebooted,2kyw1n,AdumbroDeus,2,Sat Nov 1 11:12:10 2014 UTC,"No, just no.  Literal versus allegorical interpretation of Genesis was a matter of debate in the early but that it was allegorical was such a clear winner that in catholic tradition even those writers that were proponents of literal creation later gave the caveat that it could be allegorical if subsequent discoveries of the natural world made it obvious that it was allegorical.  This is because of Augustine of Hippo, but here he is presented as a literalist but that's deceptive. Why? Because he initially intended to write as a literalist, he came to the conclusion that literalism was incorrect over the course of his writings and so he abandoned the project in favor of de Genesi ad Litteram which endorses an allegorical view.   More to the point, even the fact that his interpretation of creationism (based on Ecclesiasticus, the idea of instantaneous creation of everything) is that many possible interpretations of creation were possible and that it was first and formost presenting a spiritual reality as opposed to a historical one. Thus the primary tool for understanding the natural world and the history of the world was understanding of the natural world, eg if your interpretation of the bible conflicted with what is known of the natural world, your interpretation of the bible was wrong."

Really, this kid is in fact more in line with the Christian bible than they are. The bible doesn't say you're supposed to poke fun at witches or gays, or simply stop them. You're quite literally supposed to murder them. It's a command, straight from god. Not a misinterpretation, not a suggestion, not a ""I hope you do this for me"".

It was a long time ago because laws were written that took superstition out of the drivers seat a long time ago, to avoid that kind of shit. If the laws weren't in place, they would be hanging gays like they do in Iran."
atheismrebooted,2kvu6w,vengefully_yours,3,Sat Nov 1 14:10:16 2014 UTC,"Yep. The only thing that separates the level of violence in Christianity and Islam related to their holy books is that Christianity was the ""lucky one"" to find itself under more secular laws earlier on.  If granted total freedom to do what both books said, there'd be no difference at all in the level of violence we see out of them. In fact, even today in countries that don't have the laws we have here, Christians are every bit as violent as Muslims, and then some."
