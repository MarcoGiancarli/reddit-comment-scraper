radiohead,3e0ez7,Tactical_Lemon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"Took me months after my first listen to really appreciate it. It was my first radiohead album and really these guys are unforgiving to new ""fans."" Didn't move on in the discog until I finally realised it's greatness"
radiohead,3e0ez7,prettySpeeches,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:22 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's the actual sounds of the music you actively don't like, then there isn't much you can do to make yourself like it, except maybe changing your equalizer settings to give emphasis to sounds you might be missing, or to listen to it on speakers instead of headphones (or vice versa). If you just find it boring or uninteresting, I'd say find the themes in the album that are most relevant to today. I mean, yeah, OKC pretty much defined the societal sentiments of the turn of the century, but I also find it extremely applicable to today as well. Every time I drive through the suburbs around Dallas, for instance, and see all these really nice overpasses and car dealerships and construction cranes, I get the same alienating anxiety that flows throughout the album. The white cinder block walls at my school remind me deeply of Climbing Up The Walls and Fitter Happier. If you aren't someone who identifies with the sentiments in the album, though (although, if you're a fan of the rest of Radiohead's stuff, I can't see how you wouldn't be, at least to an extent), OKC might just not be the album for you. Which is fine, that doesn't mean you like the other stuff any less or you're somehow incomplete just because you don't like an album."
radiohead,3e0ez7,radio99cudi,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:14 2015 UTC,OKC was my first radiohead album and i liked it but I never got why people ranked it so highly. I preferred kid a or in rainbows or even tkol over ok computer for a while. Until I read the lyrics. I already knew the theme of the album but once I read the lyrics I was able to connect with it a lot more
radiohead,3e0ez7,Chackjicker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember that. I think it was ""No Surprises"" and the ""Let Down"" lyrics that changed my perspective."
radiohead,3e0ez7,sound-bagel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:13 2015 UTC,Listen to the meaning behind the lyrics. You can really discover a whole new level of understanding of music through listening closely to the lyrics.
radiohead,3e0ez7,thomasjthomasj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, while I love OK Computer, it's never been one of my favourite albums, and sits as my second least favourite Radiohead album. I feel it's an album of great songs but have never felt it fits together well as a whole, and it kinda sits awkwardly between 'early Radiohead' and 'real Radiohead'. I think in terms of its production I find it a little too bright and synthetic sounding. Kid A has this kind of muffled tone to it, where the albums that follow it all have a more organic sound to it. Beyond that I have a hard time explaining why I don't like it as much, because on a track by track basis, it's great (except Fitter Happier which feels like it comes straight out of art school and a bit cringey). Still, I think you'd have to be mad not to love the shit out of Climbing Up The Walls, Paranoid Android and Karma Police."

radiohead,3dzono,PermanentStarlight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible (and probable) that DOOM was influenced by Kid A / Amnesiac when we has working on Madvillainy.

Once Portishead (+Thom) had finished, we ventured over to said stage, only to find heaps of security and fences blocking it off due to it being full. From the people I spoke to who saw the set, they said there were a few technical issues but that it consisted of stuff from Tomorrow's Modern Boxes and The Eraser, and that it was only really semi-full, partly of people who had no idea what they were witnessing!"

And ""just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there"" as kind of a mantra of sorts to try to fight the negative feelings depression can bring on."
radiohead,3dudcg,tonymatt1188,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"It's Radiohead, it can have a million different interpretations. That's part of the fun!"
radiohead,3dudcg,Skeenip,2,Mon Jul 20 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think he's talking about the feeling of irrational fear, like when you're alone and start feeling like there's ""someone on your shoulder"". You look around and you know there's no one, but as soon as you turn back you start feeling the fear creeping up again."
radiohead,3dudcg,stRafaello,7,Mon Jul 20 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"Thom has explicitly said that Airbag is about Buddhist notions of resurrection ('I am born again...'). Pyramid Song is actually modeled on the Egyptian myths surrounding death and the afterlife (going into heaven on a boat, the black-eyed angels are supposedly crocodiles), but I think your interpretation works too. Also, the line in How To Disappear that goes 'I float on down the Liffey' sounds an awful lot like 'I float on down the Lethe', which is the river of forgetfulness in the ancient Greek underworld. Is this deliberate? I want to believe."
radiohead,3dudcg,pixi666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:51:36 2015 UTC,Pyramid Song draws heavily upon Dante's Divine Comedy.
radiohead,3dudcg,deterritorialized,11,Mon Jul 20 15:05:13 2015 UTC,A lot of their songs feature Buddhist themes. All of TKOL can be interpreted using the Buddhist idea of enlightenment.   But Buddhism is more of a philosophy. I doubt they support or incorporate organised religion into their songs.
radiohead,3dudcg,standby_for_drowning,3,Sun Jul 19 17:03:29 2015 UTC,Could you exemplify? I'm not a buddhist and I'm curious to know what those themes are.
radiohead,3dudcg,stRafaello,3,Mon Jul 20 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think u/bookerdewitt77 has done a better job than I ever could at answering your question in an old thread. Here is his reply:   The Buddhist theme of enlightenment and reincarnation runs through the album.  There's chaos at the beginning (Bloom) along with a deep desire to be free from all forms of fear and anxiety. Magpie then focuses the frustration on an external agent, blaming others for the state the narrator's in ( ""how you stole all my magic, took my melody"") albeit passively, fearing things could get worse.   Little by little then gets more direct (""Turn to nasty now"" and ""You've been around enough""). The narrator is now no longer afraid of his shortcomings and is ready for the struggle, which begins in Feral.   Lotus Flower is where he breaks free, and realizes his demons are his own creation, and as such have no power over him. He decides to let them go (""And now I'll set you free| I'll set you free). and, ""The darkness is beneath"" implying he is no longer bound to them. His melody, talked about in Magpie is back, and he realises he's had it inside him all this time.  Codex and Give Up the Ghost are related to death, though not of the narrator but of his ego, that had surfaced in Lotus Flower in the form of impossible desires and a quest for power over everything.  Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick  Just to see what if  Just to see what is  I can't kick your habit  Just to fill your fast ballooning head  Separator is the enlightened state. The ego is dead, and all that remains is bliss. The narrator is at peace with himself and the universe.   Of course, this is all just speculation. I've been reading a lot of Buddhist stuff lately and Tkol seems to fit its teachings.   Though I disagree with some of it; the ego never truly dies in Buddhism, you just realise it's part of the dance of life and become one with it, this is a pretty solid interpretation of TKoL's themes."
radiohead,3dudcg,standby_for_drowning,3,Mon Jul 20 05:47:46 2015 UTC,A Christian magazine did an interview with Thom once: http://www.believermag.com/issues/200907/?read=interview_yorke

radiohead,3dudcg,masta_nelson,2,Sun Jul 19 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"it's more spiritual, they draw inspiration from a variety of beliefs. To me In Rainbows clarifies this the most, the idea of seeing life as more of a rainbow than any one color, any one religion for instance, dominating. To me religion insinuates dogmatism, and for that reason I would never call their music 'religious'."
radiohead,3dudcg,capn_crowbar,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:27 2015 UTC,Nope. But Thom does believe in angels and other weird stuff apparently.
radiohead,3dudcg,Tim_Bar,3,Mon Jul 20 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"Sit down, stand up always striked me as a religious song. The constant demanding of ""sit down, stand up""  reminds me the church cerimony, where people sit and stand only at the orders of the priest, ""we can wipe you out anytime"" can represent the corruption and tirany behind such institutions. ""Walk into the jaws of hell"" is another reference to the mythology of religion and the ""teardrops"" being the god tears.   sorry for the poor english ."

radiohead,3dudcg,envaneexai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"If the members of Radiohead were to be religious, they would most likely be Anglican. I don't find there to be much religious imagery in their work, perhaps the closest thing could be the references to water and flooding you can find in many of their songs. However, rather than the ""flood"" be a biblical reference, it is most likely Thom referring to global warming."
radiohead,3dudcg,hiplink,4,Sun Jul 19 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"I think Phil's Jewish and the other 4 grew up in the Anglican church, which is more of a social club than anything. I think Jonny's wife is Israeli, which means she's likely Jewish too. Also worth noting that Thom's son's name is Noah, and he wrote Sail to the Moon for him (""in the flood / you'll build an ark""). Overall, I imagine most of the band is agnostic, but maybe I'm just projecting."

At all of his previous live DJ gigs, he (I believe, please tell me if this is incorrect) has only performed his solo and Atoms for Peace songs.

Kid A is my favourite album ever but Amnesiac is a trip, a really strange album that shouldn't be as cohesive as it is."

radiohead,3dsbrj,Gibmyster,4,Sun Jul 19 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"I discovered Radiohead just barely over a year ago and they've been my favorite ever since. I had been vaguely familiar with their older hits like High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, Karma Police but hadn't really, truly listened to them.  That changed last summer. I was going into my senior year of high school and out of boredom one day, some friends and I went CD hunting around town. I picked up used copies of Pablo Honey and Kid A that day and knowing next to nothing about them, I let a coin flip decide which one I would listen to first.  Of course I ended up listening to Kid A first. That was quite the experience, let me tell you. And it made listening to Pablo Honey slightly interesting, in a way.  Anyway, I was hooked pretty easily. Looking back I suppose I could say Radiohead sparked a sort of musical renaissance for me. I rediscovered the miracle that is lossless audio and had my mind opened up to a wider range of music in general. It was only a matter of weeks until I had Radiohead's and Thom Yorke's entire discography, and there are still days where I just can't listen to anything other than Radiohead."

After listening to them so much in the span of a month, I became obsessed.   I've mentioned him in several stories like this and he probably hates me for this, but he fucked me up and made my life amazing  at the same time😅"
radiohead,3dsbrj,androidthatsparanoid,3,Sun Jul 19 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"As an American immigrant, I discovered Radiohead as part of my effort to listen to more English music. My first encounter was Hail to the Thief (2+2=5), which was probably the most ""accessible"" Radiohead album since OK Computer. I liked it enough that I decided to give Kid A a try without knowing anything about that album. I still remember plugging in my headphones that night thinking ""I'll just listen to a few songs and fall asleep."" Um, I couldn't. By the time my CD player finished playing Idioteque (still a favorite of mine), my mind was fucking blown. That night was when I realized this was no ordinary band."
radiohead,3dsbrj,decafbutter,3,Sun Jul 19 06:31:24 2015 UTC,"When first listening to The Bends, I found it to be fairly easy-going, normal alternative music. Then the final song hit me like a train. Street Spirit showed me how this band was different, and eventually, one of the best I've ever heard. Still one of my favorite all time songs."
radiohead,3dsbrj,BurstingFlares,2,Sun Jul 19 08:35:40 2015 UTC,"Roughly same story for me (assisted heavily by the iron lung ep) - but today I almost find Street Spirit boring and bland. Tastebuds change and evolve and good golly miss molly, so did Radiohead :-D"

radiohead,3dsbrj,Bentham42,2,Sun Jul 19 00:17:23 2015 UTC,I always kinda liked them but my love began after hearing Let Down for the first time. The way Thom sings the second verse and how it builds to the chorus as the drums get louder. It moved me.

radiohead,3dsbrj,PermanentStarlight,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"I used to be a huge Coldplay fan in middle school and I remember reading this quote by Chris Martin:  ""It would be interesting to see how the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?""  That was the first time I had even heard of Radiohead, so I listened to Creep and Paranoid Android, didn't think they were all that great (I love them both now), but No Surprises and Karma Police won me over and now OKC is my all-time favorite album."
radiohead,3dsbrj,name-buster,2,Sun Jul 19 03:14:35 2015 UTC,I got Pablo Honey after hearing Creep on the radio when it first came out.

radiohead,3dsbrj,Azarjan,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"Love your story, OP!  Christmas break, 1997, my best friend brought over OK Computer and forced me to listen to Karma Police, which I didn't care much about. Before he left, he insisted on leaving the album with me, so it stayed in my 3-disc CD changer on rotation for the next week or two. I remember a very specific moment where I was playing some old-school RPG (Exile 3 I think) listening to music when Lucky suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks.

radiohead,3dsbrj,Polyfauna,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I completely avoided Radiohead because they were so popular.  I really liked MUSE at the time, and I refused to acknowledge that MUSE drew much of its style from Radiohead.  Consequently, I kept myself from listening to my now current favorite band for like two years!  What an idiot... Finally, my best friends started listening to them in the car, and I was ""forced"" to listen to them.  I remember listening to ""The Bends"" and thinking to myself that there was something authentic yet ""beyond the earth"" about them. I wasn't hooked until I gave ""In Rainbows"" a serious listen.  This was the album that truly hooked me.  The number of ""goosebump"" moments from songs like ""Nude,"" ""All I Need,"" ""The Reckoner,"" and ""Videotape"" completely shifted my views of Radiohead.  Ever since then, I was hooked!"

Always thought Thom looked like Martin Short's character, Jackie Rogers Junior Especially when he jumped into that pool during one of MTV's pool party shows.  Anyway, as soon as I heard Airbag for the first time, I knew they were of considerable musical girth."

I know that there are plenty of songs that were not recorded with all of them, and we know that for instance Videotape was edited after Thom went away. But what I have never heard of in all those years was them recording while one of them was away for weeks or days even, so I think that is unlikely. Besides Phil has said that they would reconvene in September, so that makes this also very unlikely, and Phil said on his stint where he sat in for Guy Garvey this weekend that he was on a camping trip, so that means that there are two absent.

I can find this   And then he and Thom like stayed up late one night in this big country house we rented out in England and did it on a keyboard. And Nigel like used to do pro tools and scratch the sound waves and made all these mad sounds that no one had done before. And it was amazing. Source .

'devil is in the details' is a boards of canada song, it's ridiculous to think radiohead would have a song titled that. or have lift be the #1 song they are working on? that's just riding on the fan speculation thats been going on since jonny mentioned it in an interview (he didn't actually say that they'd even been working on it)  obviously this is just some troll, there was someone a few months back that claimed to know a string player of an orchestra that supposedly worked with radiohead, this is the same kind of post. bullsht"

radiohead,3dj7pl,Brosephian,4,Thu Jul 16 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"It's a song so lodged in the past I can't see how they'd bring it back, unless they totally messed around with the arrangement.

radiohead,3dj7pl,Beetso,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:01 2015 UTC,I very much doubt it'll be the same Lift we heard years back. It'll probably receive a similar makeover to Lotus Flower and the like.

I think were most people are coming from though is this: look what they're able to do with the songs they hold on to. Look at what Nude became -- same song, but they gave it a whole new life.  So when people say they want Lift, I don't think they want a carbon copy of Pinkpop -- they want to see what the band can do with it with two decades more of experience."

radiohead,3dj7pl,thequietthingsthat,2,Thu Jul 16 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed.

radiohead,3dicx4,Beetso,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"I have a hypothesis about this. I'm guessing you're a younger fan? In my experience, people who got into Radiohead later tend to like this song, while those who were already fans when it was released don't.   I was 17 when PH was released, started really liking Radiohead when The Bends came out, and finally fell in love with them when OKC absolutely blew me away. Then Kid A came. Wow! It was, at the time, the most incredible thing I'd ever heard. A perfect album to ring in the new millennium, and Morning Bell was one of the highlights for me.  Then Amnesiac rocked my world all over again just a few short months later... except for the inexplicably dreary Morning Bell/Amnesiac. I just never got it. It seemed an unworthy successor to an already flawless song.   I love Radiohead. They are my absolute favorite band of all-time, and it's not even close. I love every single studio recording they've made since 1995 (album tracks and B-Sides alike). Except for one: the depressing, dreary, and droning Morning Bell/Amnesiac.  So my hypothesis (backed by years of observation) is this: Most later/younger Radiohead fans (those who had immediate access to most or all of their discography all at once) like MB/A, while most earlier/older fans (who had to actually wait for years [or months in Amnesiac's case] for each new batch of Radiohead songs) don't.  I can tell you for certain that it was almost universally disliked by fans on Hollywood and Vine, (a fantastic, pre-reddit, bulletin board-style online community) when it was still recently-released.  So what do think, Radioheaddit? Is the some validity to my hypothesis, or am just living in cloud cuckoo land?"
radiohead,3dicx4,standby_for_drowning,2,Fri Jul 17 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"am I just living in cloud cuckoo land?   I'm afraid you are. Been a fan since 97. The one thing I've learned since then is to consider every song they release as having its own independent existence. Judging and comparing it to another version of the song, (or any other song at all) makes you want to look for the feel of the original song in the one you're listening. It might work for other artists, and is a popular method used by music reviewers worldwide, but it doesn't work with Radiohead. Every song they have created since OKC is a wholly self contained world of its own.  The reason I love MB/A is because it is where the narrator hits rock bottom; he breaks within. Every song before it depicted the narrator in different personalities. He came as the masochistic cannibal in Knives out, the silent lurer to doom in I might be wrong, the man who feigns courage in YAWA, and the utterly insane personality talking of doors on rudders of ships in Pulk/Pull. What was his motivation to show us these visions?   He lives in such a world, constantly looping from the last song back to the first and then again. He wants us to feel his pain. He derives a sadistic pleasure in our uneasiness in shoving mice down our throats. A part of him wants to be free, of course. (Minotaur imagery, read it up) and this manifests itself in MB/A. This song is naked, open desperation. The narrator wants to be free, but deep down knows he can't. The next song will come. He will be pulled back into his world. His effort is meaningless. This frustration at the way things are turns to the angry rambling on DAC, and finally, utter hatred towards the listener on LSP.  The reason I love this song more than the Kid A version is because there is no buildup to it in the KA version. There  is the restlessness of Idioteque, and then the segue into MB's 'Release Me', to me, rings a little hollow. The narrator on KA is commenting on gruesome stuff, the one on Amnesiac is part of it, he is inside the gruesome thing KA is describing, (If anyone can find the fire analogy Thom referred to in an interview, I'd be grateful)and wants to leave.   Tell me something, would you rather be forced to watch a tiger mauling a man, or be forced into being mauled and experiencing every painful second of it?"
radiohead,3dicx4,Beetso,2,Sat Jul 18 06:50:48 2015 UTC,"I wish I could upvote you twice. This is an outstanding interpretation of Amnesiac, and how it contrasts with Kid A. I should be clear,   I appreciate the artistry of MB/A, especially within the broader context of the album, which is why I never skip it (or any other song, for that matter). It just gives me a bad vibe. It just makes me uneasy, (which I know is the whole point) and I don't care for the feelings it evokes."
