It will be interesting to see how things go when the headlining stars start filtering out, I know they've replaced people before but RDJ is probably approaching the end of the line-how will Marvel handle the inevitable Twitter controversy of ""how could they cast Such-And-Such to be the new Tony Stark!? #BringBackRDJ""?"

I felt you repeated some stuff or were just long winded when it came to certain aspects, the characters for example.  A little hypocritical, my reviews run about 8 minutes, but i have 2 co-hosts so the banter can warrant a longer review.  If you get your reviews around 4 minutes you'll probably pull in some more viewers.  I would also tighten up the edit. Try and not leave in bits where you start walking toward the camera.  In any case, keep doing it and you'll learn as you grow.  Best of luck,  Bloodbath and Beyond"

An example: when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy, about ~20 mins into it the first thing I said to myself was that I would be enjoying the hell out of this if I was 10. As I am well beyond 10 now, I found it vapid and unremarkable. Not their fault. But it's a struggle to catch that spark from the cinema anymore."

moviecritic,3cla6q,Verylazyperson,6,Wed Jul 8 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"I was pretty disappointed with terminator salvation. From Genisys I wanted a film that would push the story forward whilst NOT continuing in whatever direction that film was taking the franchise. Although i am a minority fan of T3 rise of the machines, this new film more or less continues the T1 and T2 storylines whilst allowing for more sequels. Albeit at the expense of some plot holes and an entire film being necessary to undo 2 films that effectively muddled this fantastic story. And the movie really wasn't that bad. Cool effects, homages to the past films, continuation of terminator canon...It has given us hope for new and better terminator films. Terminator: Rebyrth."
moviecritic,3cla6q,VegaThePunisher,9,Thu Jul 9 00:40:26 2015 UTC,"Seeing Arnold again. Seeing him as the 80s terminator. Seeing the way they changed time. The effects. The action.   The plot was caca. And the casting for Sarah and Reese was caca.   It was an okay movie if you are a fan, and a mediocre movie overall."
moviecritic,3cla6q,mastyrwerk,6,Wed Jul 8 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it.  I wasn't expecting much, and I got a little bit more than that, so it's a win for me.  Action was good.  Arnie was solid.  Effects were good.    The reviewer is a little extreme.  It wasn't that bad.  It's a strong 2.5/5, but it's not ruining creativity or whatever hyperbole they came up with.  But to warn people not to see it?  I probably won't read from this reviewer again."

moviecritic,3c2893,brittnie920,2,Sat Jul 4 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS; Exactly; its not t2 or the original directed by what anyone would consider to be a legendary director. The charm of terminator is a chase film, people being hunted by an unstoppable killing machine. Since t3 the terminators seem to be more of an inconvenience rather than a working piece of machinery. If arnolds t800 can stop magnet dude, then its hardly an upgrade or worth building id say by a corrupt cold machine such as skynet. And how many times do we have to kill this thing? At least in t3 they realize there is no point to stopping it and decide rather to hide and a wait the fallout. With all that said. Its fun movie, that should not be taken so seriously as it tries to reboot the legendary franchise."

Maybe if they live on a farm and have to slaughter animals a lot, ...and like nightmares. It's a lot of trauma and gore for no reason, boring themes that are geared towards adults (something about Nazis/war and childbirth decisions) with no payoff at the end."

moviecritic,3b2nw2,CoachTaylor76,2,Thu Jun 25 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"Wow it'd be nice to have some insight as to why it's so stupid other than ""hur dur it came out in the summer and has cgi so obviously it's dumb.""  It's obvious to me that those who dislike it were planning on doing so in the first place. This is evidenced by the knee-jerk reactions to certain ""cliches"" and ""inconsistencies"" which only take the imagination of a four year old to explain. Seriously if your going to say that the high-heels are ""cringe-worthy"" and have a problem with reckless boys being reckless boys, then maybe it's time you take a step back and ask yourself if the movie is actually bad, or if you just really really want it to be bad.  And by all means compare the movie with JP. But at least learn to distinguish nostalgia from taste in story quality. People seem to think JP is some pillar of story telling and character development. When really it's just a really good monster movie which mastered the use of animatronics and early CGI, with master camera work and pacing that is typical of Spielberg. But Sam Neil isn't about to rock an oscar from it. The dinosaurs are the stars, how the hell do people not get that?  Seriously, the only wave of stupidity streaming from this film is the flock of critics who can't wait to pat themselves on the back for griping over ""just another summer blockbuster.""  Edit: Also, the suggestion that the movies entire premise is about how ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore,"" further proves that this reviewer wasn't paying much attention in the first place. The movie is about surviving the monsters of modern society, most notably the monster that is 'the broken family.' That particular statement in the movie only emphasizes that, in a society of plenty, people will always be looking for new highs to help them escape. It emphasizes that people are so used to monsters in their lives that they no longer seem threatening or even particularly interesting. The irony here of course is that when people write off the theme of divorce as cliche and thereby tripe, they are falling into the movies trap."
moviecritic,3b2nw2,Lord_of_Phendrana,2,Thu Jun 25 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response, and your points are fair.  However, I question the reasoning behind ""maybe it's time you take a step back and ask yourself if the movie is actually bad, or if you just really really want it to be bad."" First of all, never did I mention any ""inconsistencies"" outside of bizarre tonal shifts--which I think is a valid criticism--and never did I actually call something ""cliche"". I dislike the assertion that I was going into this movie just to bash it, because that wasn't my intention at all (others? sure, but I can't speak for them). I thought the high heels and teenagers were products of lazy writing, and me thinking that doesn't make you somehow right about MY intentions/opinions.  ""When really it's just a really good monster movie which mastered the use of animatronics and early CGI, with master camera work and pacing that is typical of Spielberg."" Yes, that is why Jurassic Park is great. It has its own character problems, I completely agree, but I found those characters much more engaging than these. And yes, very different types of stories are being told here, so I still hesitate to hold up every element of one film to the other.  As for the dinosaurs being the stars, I even specifically mentioned in the review that it is a dinosaur movie. I completely get that. But as I said, that doesn't shield the rest of the movie from criticism. Sure, if you want to brush those elements off, do it by all means. But don't assume everyone else will. I didn't expect a character study or Oscar-worthy performances, but honestly? The weak characters were distracting to me.   And once again, I never wrote off the divorce plot as cliche. While ""most notably the monster that is 'the broken family'"" is a very interesting interpretation--so kudos to you for that--it's certainly not the ultimate angle reviews must take with this movie.   Maybe take a step back and ask if the reviews are actually wrong, or you just really really want them to fall in line with your beliefs."
moviecritic,3b2nw2,Lord_of_Phendrana,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:52:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  While many of my accusations may not be applied to your review specifically, I sensed that they were at least implied in your review. To be fair, your review is rather vague. It's full of generalizations with hardly anything specific to defend. So I suppose I'll have to work with what you've given.  I have seen the movie twice, the first time my expectations were low, so as not to be too disappointed by what I perceived to be ""just another summer blockbuster."" But I was surprised that it was so layered, and as a monster movie, I felt it hit the mark perfectly. The second time I was purposefully looking for flaws, but what I found was easily reasoned. Instead my assertions were only upheld. I want to see it again, so that I can further form my analysis. In short, I will adamantly defend the movie from such accusations as yours, and suggest that you and other harsh critics re-examine the movie from a different and more appropriate angle. I only wish I had a more full and complete argument, because yes I do want people to see what I see, for it makes the movie both enjoyable and meaningful.  But just from the top of my head: I myself fail to see the problem with the teenagers. They serve to relate the movie to it's target audience and are the most important characters in the film. Let's face it, JW is a boys movie and it's primary message is one that is aimed towards boys. JW is post-modern and it's a monster movie. It's presenting a guide for survival for generations who statistically have seen more broken families than any other. It's also telling us to let go of our illusions of control, a luxury upheld only by our technology. You see each person that perishes both represents one who is obsessed with that illusion, and also they represent options for young men--showing how one can choose to deal with the 'monsters' in their life. Hoskins obviously is the type of person who thinks man is the proper king of the wild. Masrani is a man who continuously seeks to hide in childish fantasies. Lowery chooses to hide the same way, only in front of computer, and with toys. What's interesting to note here is that Lowery's character represented the original young fans of the first Jurassic Park, all grown up...on the outside anyway. And then there's that big fat slob who was too busy shoving shit into his face to make sure the freak monster didn't escape. But then there is Owen. He represents the classic male role model. He does what he needs to do to protect his own while accepting that he's never in control, and he has a mutual respect with the monsters. He's tamed them. The children found a male role model which they needed, and learned that while their scum bag parents might try and gaslight them and treat them as a burden, they need to watch each others back while accepting that ""it's not up to them"" what happens with their parents. Also the new park/old park dichotomy tells us that by looking to the old ways might be helpful, it's not enough to save us.  The high-heels are on because Claire's character is a big statement on the modern woman's place in surviving the modern 'wild'. She starts off obsessed with control and it is her relinquishing of that control which saves her. Ultimately it is Claire who unleashes the T-Rex, and it is the T-Rex who reigns supreme above all else. Doing so in high heels? Well that's to further emphasize that women don't need to 'become men' in order to survive this world, and in my opinion that's a needed statement.  You see, in order to survive we need to prevent our technology and addictions to their power from consuming us. ""Did Trevorrow’s assistant kick him in the balls one time?"" Glad you asked. Zara was merely the shell of a human being. She was one with her phone and tablets, with not an inkling of what was going on around her. She was a robot. And she indeed got it the worst. So JW is saying, 'Don't be a robot.'  As for the bizarre tonal shifts, I suppose I would have to know specifically what you mean. But I'm guessing I get your point. Only I would argue that they succeed in luring the audience in to what at first appears to be ""just a ride"" and then slaps you in the face with horrifying realism. Perhaps it's the experience one might expect in Jurassic Park?  Apologies for the sloppiness of my defense as well as my general cockiness. I admit I was having a rough day. But I sincerely believe that there is a more observant approach needed, as well as an understanding of what makes 'art-horror.' I believe that every line of dialogue both pushes the story along and builds character. I don't think anything was done accidental or out of pure laziness and I think JW shines much more than a typical summer blockbuster. I hope to have an in-depth analysis typed out as soon as I can get a copy of the film to watch at my leisure."
moviecritic,3b2nw2,Sacha117,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:50:55 2015 UTC,"This is a great analysis. Thanks. And I must admit, my review was far from my best work, and you're right about the generalizations. I usually tend to go more into depth (I didn't even have a spoiler space for this like I usually do) with movies I really like, which I guess isn't really the role of a movie reviewer, to pick and choose. Nevertheless, I'm sure you can understand the feeling.  I definitely went into this one with a different mindset than, say, Mad Max. I went into this one just expecting to have fun, whereas I went into Mad Max expecting to pick up on the subtext AND to have fun. But you proved that you could find deeper meaning in Jurassic World, so thanks for responding."

moviecritic,3au4ua,cryjustice,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"[SPOILERS]  Seems like this could use a lot more work. It barely skims the surface. There's a lesson in JW on 'Human's place in the natural order' as well as 'How to survive the threats of the wild/the broken home.' While yes Owen represents the classic male role model, it is the rise of the woman which ultimately saves the day. Ultimately Claire needs to let go of her obsession with control in order to survive. For it was all those who couldn't let go of the illusion who perish. This happens when the two discover the children jumped the waterfall. Owen says something like, ""Okay first off, you will do as I say,"" and Claire's knee-jerk reaction is to scoff and say, ""excuse me."" But then, just as he treats the Raptors, Owen makes a gesture to show that this is about mutual respect, not male dominance.  Fast-forward to the end of the film. It is important to note that Claire is the one who releases the T-Rex. Owen's efforts weren't enough to save them and ultimately it required the woman to assert her power in order to conquer the monster. Owen and the boys need Claire just as much as she needs them. But it also ultimately depends on those who know the difference between right and wrong to step up, rather than sit in front of their computer watching shit go down, the way Lowery did. There was nothing masculine about Claire releasing the Rex, and the way she rocked those heels further emphasizes that women don't need to become men, so-to-speek, in order to have power. That power is inherent and was waiting there to be released all along."
moviecritic,3au4ua,Obtuse_1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:55:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading my post. I kept it short (400 words) because I only wanted to focus on one particular theme in the film: what a woman's priorities should be in life. I like your insights though, and ""control"" is definitely another important theme in the film.   In the helicopter, Simon Masrani says, ""The key to a happy life is to accept you are never in control."""
moviecritic,3au4ua,Obtuse_1,2,Wed Jun 24 00:09:27 2015 UTC,"In the helicopter, Simon Masrani says, ""The key to a happy life is to accept you are never in control.""   That threw me for a loop at first.  I feel like Simon represents the ""romanticized male role-model,"" or ""The Action Hero,"" in that he is childish, rash, and has a god complex. He is the cliche movie hero. It's interesting because it's as though Spielberg is being spoofed in his own production. When Masrani is about to board the helicopter and Vivian asks ""Isn't there anybody else,"" the camera zooms in on Masrani and with great dramatic emphasis he says, ""We don't need anybody else."" The first time I saw it I thought it was funny, but couldn't say why. I realized it's all part of his character. The music and his joviality as he goes to kill the monster adds to it. But things take a brutal turn for him. He lived carelessly and romantically and he thereby died a romantic, but anti-climatic death.  I will boldly argue that JW dabbles into the post-modern and is making a comment that, in this world the typical notion of 'action-hero' just isn't good enough.  I realize I've strayed off the beaten path. Sorry. I just enjoy the hell out of that film."

moviecritic,3a9rqg,onscreenfilm,5,Thu Jun 18 10:32:25 2015 UTC,"It’s the first Jurassic Park movie since Jurassic Park which feels truly Spielbergian, easily the film’s defining triumph.   That is a complete slap in the face to Spielberg. JW had absolutely dreadful writing and directing. This movie was much more Lucasian than Spielbergian. Half of the dialogue either fell flat or was a non-sequitur.   Chris Pratt continues his brand-building with a winning and likeable leading man performance here. Part Quint, part Robert Muldoon;   Agreed, although he was given almost nothing to work with in his dialogue, besides maybe one or two scenes.   BD Wong leaves an admirably slimy impression as the increasingly mysterious park scientist Dr. Wu   They randomly turned him into a mad scientist for no apparant reason. He is somehow allowed to hide what is going on in the lab from the people who run the park???? It was laughable.   poor Vincent D’Onofrio follows his stellar turn in the recent Daredevil series with a thinly written stock-villain character whose machinations are uninteresting and feel very much like invasive and forceful plot propulsion.   Agree completely. One of the stupidest characters I've seen in a long time. A guy, who, with a serious look on his face, advocates using dinosaurs in military warfare. Who the hell even is this guy?! It's never explained.   Visually, Colin Trevorrow makes a pretty solid stand-in for Señor Spielbergo;    No. Fucking. Way. How many scenes were there that they could have used practical effects instead of CGI? I saw many. I felt like I was watching the avengers. Trevorrow has no idea how to use subtlety for effect. There were so many unnecessary things in this movie that could have been cut out.   Michael Giacchino’s score meanwhile is a joyful ingredient to the mix, with odes to the classic theme interspersed skilfully amongst new romping musical arrangements that may not quite reach the dizzying highs of John Williams, but come pretty damn close.   The score was the worst part of the movie, by far. Remember the classic Jurassic Park theme? The only time it's used is when the kids enter their hotel. What? WHAT? I can't really tell you much about the rest of the score, except that it sounded like a hack trying to imitate John Williams, and failing miserably. I literally can't remember one song or tune from it.   This, in my opinion, had terrible special effects. The dinosaurs all looked much worse than the dinosaurs from 1993. I just watched the original a few days prior, and the difference is huge. The problem with this movie is they spent all of theire money on too much stuff. There's so much damn CGI in almost every scene that none of it ends up looking any good. It legitimately looks like a video game. I also watched it in 3D which did nothing for me. Man, I just hated this movie. From the first five minutes, you can already tell that the rest of the movie is going to be terrible"

moviecritic,39y6k7,psyhcopig,2,Tue Jun 16 06:38:32 2015 UTC,"Well I dunno, its in every plot synopsis of the film and is very hard to talk about without giving it away cause it happens so early on...  It sucks that it can't be left to surprise but at the same time its megahard to critique a film if 90% of the movie occurs after and focuses around this aspect of the film.  I see where you're coming from, normally I'd try to avoid spoilers but this is so early on and so crucial to the plot overall that I feel it can't be missed out, kinda sucks really but oh well :(.   Glad you love the movie though!"

moviecritic,398ao8,Mrdean2013,0,Tue Jun 9 23:49:24 2015 UTC,This reminded me of how much that movie sucked. Also this guy does a lousy job at explaining why it's so 'severely underrated' which he says like three times.
moviecritic,398ao8,burnt_reynolds420,0,Wed Jun 10 07:44:59 2015 UTC,This movie is a subpar adaptation of much superior source material so it deserves to be rated poorly in that regard. Am I saying it's a terrible film? Certainly not. Could it have been much better? Absolutely.  Also this guy's review is not helping matters.
moviecritic,3971mf,andyherndon,2,Tue Jun 9 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"You're desire for more original content in modern cinema is understandable. It's something I myself want to see more of. That said, I personally would rather watch a good reboot or re-imagining of a previous movie than a mediocre movie that's ""original"". Personally, I didn't think Tomorrowland was all that great and I'm not surprised it's the box office disappointment that it is. I don't think it's because people don't want original movies. I think it's simply because in general, people didn't find the film to be all that good and misleading marketing has led to people avoiding the film when others tell them about it. Not only that, but more savvy cinema goers will notice people attached to a movie and may avoid it for that reason, in Tomorrowland's case, Damon Lindelof, a writer who has a history of poor writing when it comes to a story (see Lost and Prometheus) IMO, it all boils down to quality and the names that are attached to your movie. The idea that original movies are made for cinemas and that they flop is generally not true. Previous movies you could look at are Inception. An idea that many big studios wouldn't dare try. But, under the direction of Christopher Nolan and proper marketing led it to gross over $800 million.  Secondly, often when rebooting or creating another sequel to a franchise, creative twists are used to make the movie more interesting or more accessible to an audience unfamiliar or uninterested with the original material. An example to look at is the upcoming Fantastic 4. The origins for the team and Doom are new, the ethnicity of Johnny Storm has changed, the characters physical appearances are different (Ben Grimm looking smaller and leaner, before becoming the Thing) and the director, Josh Trank has stated that the film is influenced by David Cronenberg in how the hero's transform to get their powers. All these changes make the movie different to what has come before. As far as story telling goes, there may be more similarities but I think it's unfair to say that Hollywood is remaking the same thing over and over again.   Thirdly, your point on making sequels to franchises from the 90's and in some cases even earlier. As long as the movies are good, I don't see why this is a problem. Bringing out a sequel to an older movie franchise now can help new fans become interested in the older movies. If Terminator: Genisys is a great movie, more people become interested in The Terminator and T2: Judgment Day. Not only that, but if Genisys is great, it brings closure to fans of the original movies that the franchise has gotten it's spark back, after the disappointment that was Terminator: Salvation. This same way of thinking can be applied to the Alien franchise. As a huge fan of Alien and Aliens, if the latest movie came out and it was good, I'd be very happy, since the franchise now had another movie to be proud of and more people would be interested in the other good movies of the franchise. Just think. If Sister Act 3 is good, more people want to see Sister Act and Sister Act 2."
moviecritic,3971mf,dafelw1997,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"Since when was Hollywood about originality? Most movies from the US can characterized by   The hero and a his female companion arrives They want something to do' Something is going wrong The hero solves the problem in the last 5min of the movie   When I was a student at a university for 20 years ago, I saw the first time the Ingmar Bergman series of Scenes of a marriage in 6hours and was tied by the story. There was no hero, no action, just the relationship between 2 persons. I was more fascinated  than anything I've seen before.   Since most movie critics are about 3dfx and stunning effects I know movies nowadays are boring like hell, because no one is longer interested into life.   I saw for some months ago ""Kinamanden"" (Danish production) on Netflix, which is the type of movie I love. It's about life. Movies like ""The good girl"" or ""Shipping news"" are highlights too. When I saw the final credits to ""Shipping news"" I wasn't really surprised the director was from Scandinavia."

But if you're doing this to show people and gain an audience, then I have a few suggestions:      BE MORE ANIMATED IN YOUR DELIVERY SO IT DOESN'T COME ACROSS AS MONOTONE    Use stock footage.  There are trailers and scenes all over the internet. You've managed to get an opening theme/video, so you have some editing know-how. Use those videos related to your film to punctuate your words. Kill the excess white space around yourself. Frame it better. Have fun with it. Enjoy sharing this information with your viewers as much as you've enjoyed discovering it yourself."

I am not sure about framing I will have to try stuff out. Thanks again
moviecritic,38t1o5,tethercat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"As a review video, you're allowed to show released trailer footage under a creative element, like creative commons or some such. You should research that.  The Masterpiece Theater premise works only if you can sell it 100%. Cookie Monster had a fully regal library with high-back chair, roaring fireplace, silk houserobe, and the classical music playing on top.  It's good you're getting started.  Write out your material beforehand. Make it solid. Don't be afraid to do multiple takes, and to edit heavily.   Since you're a video show, you have the advantage of all aspects of the visual medium.  No one is tuning in to a radio show to listen to you, so whenever you get the chance to highlight your examples, you should try to as much as you can.  Keep at it."
moviecritic,38t1o5,macdady87,2,Sun Jun 7 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"I'm all for editing but there were so many cuts in this video it started to distract me a few minutes in. I think if you write down your key talking points and try to get your point across in one take per idea then you will come across more fluid and natural.  Somebody already mentioned the framing of your video. Try and keep it clean, consistent (the camera moved around) and only include what is absolutely necessary. Loved your actual analysis and hat!

I watched a few videos, and the Star Wars reaction definitely sounds like you are putting words in her mouth. I'm fine with that, but does she actually enjoy doing this?  Again, I mean no disrespect, I'm just curious as most of the movies she's reviewing are what I grew up with being a 31 year old man."
moviecritic,38fibu,bondjaybond,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:08:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for watching :) No offense taken. Yes, most of the movies we watch are movies that I grew up with (32 y/o). If she had her choice it would probably all be tinker bells and my little pony. We watch a lot of movies together and I don't want to sit through that garbage. I like to think I'm educating her on good cinema. And I think it's working. Her favorite movies are the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies.   And honestly, most of what you see in the videos is her. Occasionally I have to prompt her by asking what she liked, what she didn't like, what was her favorite scene, what did she think about xyz, etc. But most of the answers are hers. And yes, if there's a particularly famous scene or catch phrase from a movie I'll plant that into her review. But, she's seen a lot of these movies multiple times and can usually pick up on the good parts.   For her Star Wars trailer reaction I actually let her watch it once and figure out what she wanted to say before we recorded her watching it. So we cheated a little bit :)"
moviecritic,38fibu,bondjaybond,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the clarification.  I think it's cute as hell and I think you guys will do well.  However, the big problem I see is her audience. Personally, I wouldn't come back to regularly to watch a 6 y/o review movies that far exceeded her time. It's cool for a one off ""aww"" type video, but I would think the target audience for her age would be females under 10, so it would make more sense to have a strong focus on the Tinker Bells and My Little Pony.  It's a tough game, but I would consider allowing for more reviews of films suitable for her age, which I see you have done a couple, I would just weight the content differently."

moviecritic,38d7rg,Zheiso16,2,Wed Jun 3 13:37:45 2015 UTC,How does it compare to 2012?  Some of destruction looks straight out of that movie.  I doubt I'll see it but the fact that it made so much money at its opening weekend makes me think a whole bunch of disaster movies just got green lit by knucklehead hollywood execs...
moviecritic,38d7rg,Beachbum74,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"It's like 2012 if you took all of the (attempted) fun out of it. It tries to balance the over-the-top annihilation of 2012 with the family drama of The Impossible, and it doesn't pull it off. It comes off as very bland and generic as a result."

The reason people rate this movie is because it is insanely fun, really clever, with a great style that you won't find anywhere else, all from a grassroots effort. Add to that a great attention to detail, immense production value, and really excellent sound track. It honestly hit all the right marks for me.  Maybe you didn't really get it, but you must admit the level of effort and creativeness that went into it is really something to behold."
moviecritic,388pk2,esssential,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"You aren't wrong, I understand the review is long but if you watched it all, you would know I agree.  I say I'm glad we live in a world where we can have access to something like kickstarter, and I'm very happy that people who backed this project got exactly what they wanted.  I also admitted that this movie wasn't for me, and that I did not fit into the desired demographic, so naturally I want a fan.  The main issue I have is that people are heralding it for breaking the mild and taking a risk, when the project was paid for since production began by a guaranteed audience.   I'm glad you loved it, I fully admit it wasn't for me, but I had a lot more to say in the review besides ""I think this is shit"""

Of course, I'm not Dangadingdangdoo, so I'm merely speculating on his part. Beyond that the writing definitely shows promise, there's just a little something missing and I'm not one hundred percent what it is.   Also personally, I hate the replacing of the word ""stars"" for other words just for cheap comic relief, but hey, that's just me and it hardly ruins a review, and that may just be me who dislikes that for all I know.  Hopefully this is a little more constructive than that guys criticism, just keep writing and things will fix themselves with experience :)"
moviecritic,386aiz,moviemoore,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. I have my own format for writing a review. The first half is the positive and the next is negative. The first paragraph serves as the intro and the next ones detail what I mean. I keep my paragraphs short and concise. I separate them into chunks to make them more easier to read.   I don't like to ramble in my reviews, so if I find that a word succinctly describes what I mean, I go with it. I mean its a review not a thesis or in depth analysis.

Sure, thousands may perish in your peripheral vision, but you, dear viewer, you can walk between the shrapnel, you can navigate the crest of that tsunami, all it takes is a spoken line of hope, and then your CPR shall restore her. Never mind the millions dead, put aside the fact that San Francisco is an island, and that Silicon Valley is underwater. In the words of The Rock, “We can rebuild”. Disaster films are a power fantasy that you can somehow skip through the greatest collective traumas of human history with little more than a scrape, some grit, and some mild flinching.  But isn't that almost any movie ever? Tracing the origins back to Greek myths, disaster frequently would strike and only a few people would survive."

Part of the charm of the original Die Hard is the explicit vulnerability of John McClane. McCabe and Mrs Miller, Seven Samurai, Alien- these are all classics that work by emphasizing the extreme fragility and vulnerability of the protagonists."

I've seen people compare both movies and they usually rave over Ex while giving Chappie critical reviews, so I did my own assessment.  After seeing Chappie the first time, I immediately wanted to see it again. So I did - 3 times, so far. It's no masterpiece of cinema, but a fun movie for the entertainment value. A solid 7/10. Will do again.  Ex Machina just left me with a ""meh"" feeling. Once was enough. It's an okay psychological ""thriller"" but the characters were obnoxious silicon valley stereotypes (with at least one incidence of ""hacker typing"") and cringe-worthy acting. I guess there's some adolescent interest in the Heavy Metal Magazine robot-girl fetishism, but I don't swing that way. I give it a generous 4/10; just good enough to not want my money/time back.  From my perspective, the two movies have similar themes (AI robots) but are polar opposites. One clean and polished (zzz), the other shitty and gritty (fuck yeah!). Chappie touches you emotionally on multiple levels while Ex Machina aims to mildly disturb you by throwing a little blood and gratuitous R-rated nudity into the one-dimensional drama."

moviecritic,37i5to,andyherndon,2,Wed May 27 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"The main premise of this blog post is that marketing killed Tomorrowland.    What the post fails to see is that good movies market themselves.  One thing I will say is that the trailers made the film look too scary for my 4 year old, and the PG rating made it not edgy enough for a 13 year old.  That really limits the audience here - it's as though the producers didn't know how to portray the movie to the public.  So marketing did have an impact, but was not totally to blame here.  I was personally excited to see the movie, then read mediocre reviews and was turned off.  Bad filmmaking is what kept me out of the theater."
moviecritic,37i5to,weeglos,2,Thu May 28 01:09:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't give a shit about Mad Max until I saw the reviews coming in. I didn't even like the trailer. I paid for a ticket and went to see it.  Good movies get good sales. I know that sometimes marketing can do a disservice to the film, but Tomorrowland has shit ratings, so I don't want to go see it. Simple as that."

Embarrassing blooper -> Team struggles with inner conflict -> Team has a revelation moment and comes together -> Team goes to the championship with much enthusiasm.   I will say there are several funny lines. The announcers are just hilarious, especially the male with all his casual racism. All in all a pretty good movie."

moviecritic,36f32h,flashnash,2,Tue May 19 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"That no primitive patriarch in his right mind would ever choose these particular women as “breeders” to keep his colony alive is immediately apparent.   Not to be too picky, but between the biker gang from MM1, the society that developed out of that in MM2, the mechanic, the Bartertown world of MM3, and (admittedly more forgivably) the kids of MM3, I doubt that the leader of the tribe would have had a full understanding of what an ideal mother would be.  And criticising the campy clothing/ skull motifs kind of detracts from the fact that the first three films were praised humungously for the world they created, where much of the costume was sourced from s&m shops seemed a bit off.   Admittedly I'd have to read further reviews to know whether her criticism of the other critics criticism (wat) was fair or not though."

moviecritic,35wtj4,RobotCookie,2,Thu May 14 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"It's receiving almost unprecedented widespread critical acclaim.  More reviews may indeed come in and drop the score a bit, but so far it has 90/100 on Metacritic based on 29 reviews:  http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mad-max-fury-road   That's insanely high.  For context, three Oscar contenders last year (Birdman, Whiplash, Selma) scored 88.  Two Oscar contenders (American Sniper, Theory of Everything) scored 72.  It's almost unheard of for an action film to score that high.  Off the top of my head, I remember seeing ""Dark Knight"" score 82.  The Avengers movies score in the 60s.  I expected this movie to be like ""300"" or something... which scored a 51.  On RottenTomatoes, it currently is 99% Fresh based on 87 Critics:  http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_max_fury_road/     Literally the only ""rotten"" review was a critic who gave it 2 out of 5 stars and said, ""Noisy, explosive and visually spectacular but depressingly hollow.""    ""Visually spectacular"" aint bad for a worst-case scenario.    Best case scenario?   Multiple critics like Richard Roeper calling it one of the greatest action films ever.    I'm pumped to see it."

I think that middle act really got to me the most though, and from then on all the little filmmaking gaffs started to bug me. A lot. It wasn't unwatchable or anything, but I sure could've sat at the bar and talked a looong time about it!"
moviecritic,35qwhr,Richeh,1 point,Tue May 12 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"OH SO MANY SPOILERS BELOW  You seem to be mistaking rooting for the protagonists with enjoying the film.  Like, you're making a big deal out of the fact that Stark and Banner are responsible for Ultron, but that's the point.    The Avengers are under attack as the ""world police"" that they want to be.  In the wake of SHIELD being dissolved as irretrievably corrupt, the world they try to protect stones and acid-bombs their robotic avatars.  Even between themselves, they have doubts about whether they're doing more harm than good.  Tony Stark's an egocentric genius-level weapons manufacturer, or at least was for most of his life.  It's in his nature to do reckless things ""because it's cool"".  Banner's a pushover who represses his negative feelings, and frankly has a bit of a bromance going with Stark, so of course he's on board.  And the film deals with this complexity of motives very well.  The Avengers are all very different characters, and each character's opinion is made plain; some are for proactive defence.  Some are against it.  Some are kind of amoral and don't give a shit.  Having texture to their personality doesn't make them bad protagonists, it makes them good characters.  As for going nowhere...  er, at the end of the movie Banner's run off in a fit of self-hatred, Stark's essentially resigned, Thor's on the trail of Thanos, leaving the Avengers with the B-team of Scarlet Witch, Falcon and Vision (overpowered, calling it now).  Nick Fury's resurrected SHIELD as an apparently rogue agency of idealists, and the world is reeling from yet another super-hero powered calamity - setting the scene for Civil War, next year.  Whatever movie you were watching, personally, what I saw was a skilled chess player arranging the board for a throwdown.  I'm not sure what your stipulations are for a good movie, but ""they caused the problem themselves?  DON'T CARE, MOVE ON."" is a fucking weird one.  If I was picking holes in it then my problem would be with Vision exploding from a metal coffin and immediately explaining everything to the protagonists like an actual literal Deus Ex Machina."
moviecritic,35qwhr,Richeh,1 point,Wed May 13 11:52:31 2015 UTC,"MORE SPOILERS  I do think that being able to root for the protagonists is tied very deeply to whether anyone, not just myself, can enjoy a story. The main character is someone who supposedly wants something; there is a goal, a purpose they are trying to achieve, whether they know it or not. Sometimes it's a physical achievement, but it could be emotional or metaphorical as well, but nearly every story contains something like this to drive its plot. But why would the audience even care to sit through it if they didn't want the protagonist to succeed? As soon as Stark decided to covertly do this thing that EVERYONE knew was a bad idea, he lost me, and I just didn't think the bromance between Banner and him has been built well enough to make me think Banner would go along with this clearly bad move. They knew this thing was dangerous based on the last movie, but the casual, flip way Stark decides to go rogue bugged the hell out of me. I get his character is like that, but why would everyone else trust him with the artifact then? More stupidity. Or inconsistency.  Now, I'm not opposed to mistakes being made and the characters still being relatable, but usually if they kickstart a plot they are done unwittingly. Stark knowingly creates a machine designed to protect the earth. What would logically do that? Destroying people, of course. Wouldn't have to be a genius to draw that conclusion, but the script decides to make the two scientists' brains take a nap so that we can have a bad guy.  Now, after all of this there is still a chance to explore something interesting about these people, namely remorse. But instead of focusing on Stark and Banner's incredibly irresponsible behavior, how they feel about letting the team down, and their fault in the destruction and lives lost, the story decides to spend time with Hawkeye on his family's(!) farm. Utterly came to a halt for me there, and a complete waste of time, as Hawkeye really played no major part in the macro events of this story. By the time Vision showed up I was just waiting for the end. It wasn't torturous, a couple of elements worked for me, but if this was a game of chess, it feels to me like it was being played by an amateur who made 20 moves when he could've won in 3.   Look, bottom line is that this is just my opinion, which of course every movie review is. I think there are many, many legitimate gripes with both the story and filmmaking in this movie. It just seems like it both tried to bite off too much and not enough at the same time. But I have talked to others who liked it a great deal more than myself, and I always appreciate the discussion. Some beers would've made this perfect."
moviecritic,35qwhr,Richeh,1 point,Wed May 13 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, absolutely!  I'm not attacking you, I just figured as someone who'd analysed the movie enough to write a review, you'd be interesting to discuss (or argue) about it with, and I figured you'd be up for it.    I don't think it's a great movie - superhero films generally aren't, they're the Haribo of cinematography.  I think that like you say, Banner and Stark's guilt will be examined further in Civil War next year, as they did with Stark's PTSD from Avengers 1 in Iron Man 3.  In ninety minutes, there's not really enough time to go through the hand-wringing of each character; I do like the model though of portraying massive world events in the Avengers movies and then character studies in the individual films."
moviecritic,35osvp,Fontaineclaire,1 point,Tue May 12 07:54:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think today's critics have any experience with or knowledge of actual film making.  That being said, they don't have to. They aren't judging ""film making"" they are judging films. They judge a final product not a process.

moviecritic,35nshl,Gamecube007,7,Tue May 12 00:42:02 2015 UTC,"Godfather 3 of course is the weakest, but I'm going to argue that One is a better film than Two.  I watched both again recently. The thing that stands out about Two is how powerfully engrossing the flashbacks to young Vito are, and in comparison the modern story of Michael and his rise to power and family betrayal seems mediocre and almost soap opera-ish. Give me a Godfather Part Two with all young Vito story all day, and save the melodrama for Part Three.  Godfather One has just about everything you could want in a movie. I can't really say the same for Two."
moviecritic,35nshl,Starch,3,Tue May 12 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"I would have to rank Godfather over Godfather 2. It was so full and complete, while being so perfect at all times. The characters, the acting, the MUSIC, the plot, the shots. All of it. Just perfect.  The themes it dealt with: family, respect, honor, love, betrayal, greed, brutality.  Every character was so well developed and necessary to the entirety. Michael's character arc was particularly amazing and while we see that paralleled (but not copied) in the Godfather part 2 with his father Vito, the change Michael underwent was the center of the movie and was therefore that much more powerful.  As a man, it had everything I could ever want in a movie.  As a critic, it lived up to every expectation and surpassed them greatly. It's one of those movies that just ruins 99% of other movies."

moviecritic,34hdzf,kbkid3,2,Fri May 1 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the author of the review misunderstood the movie? The ""plot"" is just the flow of history with the Hermitage capturing not just items but events, bringing them forwards for new generations. The piece was considered polarising by St Petersburg critics, although fairly successful. Did it really need the Steadicam one-take gimmick? Why were some events chosen and others not?  My thought is that if it feels confusing, come spend a day at the Hermitage. As one of the world's great collections, there is so much to see that you are in a sense overwhelmed but with a sense of wonder. This film has something of that feeling."
