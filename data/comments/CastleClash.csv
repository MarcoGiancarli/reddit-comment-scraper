CastleClash,3e5qt3,Washedlightning,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:58:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say overpowered... as you just get to skip a proc if it is on pd which is nice but you get an instant proc with revite so its like skipping a proc and with crests you can manage to = out in the long run
CastleClash,3e5qt3,Deej18,2,Wed Jul 22 05:41:16 2015 UTC,"Depending on the level, a 9/10 PD will probs be better with a 5/5 revite and a 2/5 zerk crest set"

CastleClash,3e698r,pussehmagnet,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:28:31 2015 UTC,It is a great talent for AC if you actually use him. Throw some 2/5 Sprint crests on him and you will be a real pain in Arena.

CastleClash,3e5l4j,iceswordlumers,3,Wed Jul 22 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"My personal advice is to use: PD, Vlad, Aries, Druid, and Santa, put in Orks as your 6th. The reason I suggest aries over say SM or TG is because his proc means the enemy can't run in and proc on you if they have full energy."
CastleClash,3e5l4j,Washedlightning,2,Wed Jul 22 03:46:28 2015 UTC,simple question are you using 25ish guardians in the army camps to soak sm/TG procs? with a 4 corner set up? cause with pd vlad druid aries and santa you should have plenty of wave clear with aries being able to snipe SM/other heros off with his skill but a lot of things could be a factor like hero base lvl can really help

With these heros I have seen a huge decrease in amount of time it takes to complete the later HBM. I can't seem to beat J with it though (my team are only 6's though with the exception of my 7 PD).

TH13 you can throw together a hodge-podge Deathbox (remove the walls crossed out in red). If you copy this design then replace the TH within the central structure because they will burrow for it if the walls are only 2 thick. Anything above this, just keep adding walls and prioritise the outside walls to make them 3 thick. At TH13 it will work perfectly most of the time, but occasionally with an unlucky spawn they will try to burrow through the walls. This info is based on my smurf with a TH13 version of the above base."

You need 8/8 (70%) on a 1000ms hero to get to 600ms."

CastleClash,3e4soz,bfeldman24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:36 2015 UTC,I would never consume a hero unless it is to make room for a legendary. U need them to boost your might.
CastleClash,3e4soz,bfeldman24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:25:01 2015 UTC,The reason I wanted to is because I was going to boost might to 35k for free gems (I'm at 33.6k rn) and I was going to consume the heroes to get back down to the might I'm at now
CastleClash,3e4soz,Deej18,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:11 2015 UTC,These days there really is no reason to try and keep low might.. better off aiming for next might title for better rewards every day

CastleClash,3e4soz,bfeldman24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:30:51 2015 UTC,Well why not just stay at 35k? It won't make that big of a difference for expeditions and then ur only 1k might away from the next daily bonus

CastleClash,3e2zmp,gcoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:29 2015 UTC,7/8 Zerk (50%) would get him to 800ms though.

CastleClash,3e2g0u,ksm92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"Vlad's ranged, so even if you put him in front, he will stop short and let melee heroes go on the first line (TG and PD).  So Vlad's not a tank, and it's not easy to use as a tank.  Most incoming enemy hits will go to the hero(es) with 0 range.  With an ATK range of 3, Vlad's not your best option here.  Besides, you will want to give Vlad a 5/5 War God when you get it later on.    For 5/5 Corrode, you want a hero that can use this talent for good, and not have the talent wasted by replacing it with another talent later on.  Get your shards out, buy an Antlaticore and give it to him.  Use a Sprint crest on him to upgrade his speed if you'll use him in other game modes besides Arena, Lost Realm and Lost Battlefield, where his slow movement speed can be compensated by placing him way up-front.  If you use him on Arena, Lost Realm, Lost Battlefield only, give him the highest Revive crest set you can make (or a 3/5 Revite crest if you cannot get a Cupid).  You'll have a formidable tank."

CastleClash,3e2g0u,Deej18,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:26:31 2015 UTC,You can tank with vlad though all it matters for enemy heros to target him is that he gets within their agro range first which will have them focus him till he dies and is quite a decent tank since his proc can heal him back up.  As for the talent would be better to just keep it on a dupe for might as it isn't that great
CastleClash,3e3g11,Charlie_In_The_Bush,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"You need more flying heroes, for starters.   Something that helped me progress a little further when my heroes weren't quite ready was using Ornithopters. Troops have been redundant for almost as long as the game has existed, but they can get you a tiny bit further here.  Even still, I'm only 54 dungeons in and I've hit the wall again even with level 180 heroes. Pretty much need Mino and Santa to go any further and I am lacking both of them."

The brick wall most people face is because of the magic towers stun which can super annoying but to can freeze a section and hopefully destroy them or enough to move on since most people just have to goal of getting to 7-10

CastleClash,3e3g11,mrsistermr,2,Tue Jul 21 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"It took me a looooong time to get through the expert dungeons after finishing the normals 100%. I started, hit a brick wall, then basically stopped for several months. Started up again, watched some videos, still got stuck halfway through 7. Took another month or so break and finally broke through.  Honestly, with only 5 heroes and without heavy hitters like Vlad, SB (or Mino - he just wrecks dungeons), I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the 57 shard dungeon. If you can't get that far, it's not worth doing them, imo. Just farm the 40 shard dungeon."
CastleClash,3e3g11,dormaterium,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"You should be using the highest level ornithopters as well as flying heroes, if you have them. Grizzly Reaper at 160+ with a LD crest is also a good idea to use - he is pretty much irrelevant in some other game modes now, but still extremely useful for expert dungeons.

This is because most people seem to have their #1 side second, so I sacrifice my worst team to them rather than risking my best side.   I am confident in my #2 beating their #2 at this stage since I have nine 9* heroes and most people don't have anyone higher than 7-8* outside of their main 6. This will backfire if they have their #1 side first, but since you can see their avatar you know that this isn't the case just based on the shitty heroes they present.  Haven't lost yet.

Most people have their #2 or #3 first, but then there is no way to select 2nd or 3rd team on defense. I think the computer then automatically selects your highest Might team from the remaining two and slots that one second."
CastleClash,3e1my9,ntropi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:54 2015 UTC,no way to select 2nd or 3rd team on defense   I believe it uses the most recent offensive setup to choose your defense.
CastleClash,3e1my9,Manageraddict,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"I would be more interested in knowing if the rewards are received per day or hourly just like in Arena... if it is per hour then I would be having 240 gems per day but then the person who is first would have 2400 per day? It would be insane so I think it is a daily reward?  I am pretty bad as I started to play this game like 10 months ago and I don't really pay to play so I am sitting on 5 loses from yesterday as I didn't know who to attack and left side just like in Arena and it seems like I was attacking full Revitalize and Revive teams, instead of attacking teams from the right side. Today I won 5 times."
CastleClash,3e1my9,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:43:53 2015 UTC,"At the end of the season I believe, so weekly (at least as far as the gems are concerned). I'll be able to know for sure tomorrow when I cross the 300 swords mark, as that bracket gets a 10% fame boost.  Come to think of it, it makes sense that you receive the fame boost per victory, because otherwise I don't see how it is possible for anyone to reach 1,500 swords in a week. I'm under 300 from 10 wins and I have chosen the opponent with the highest swords each time. No increase in rewards for the 140 swords guys over the 0 swords guys. Perhaps it increases if they are in another bracket."
CastleClash,3e1my9,Manageraddict,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:01:54 2015 UTC,"10 gems weekly? That is like raiding for mana twice a day, this would be a stupid reward, I need to keep track of my gems for tomorrow and see if it is daily or weekly.  I think that getting fame is meant to be difficult because they offer you 5 level talent for free basically. I wish to know why IGG doesn't give any information about the new mode and the user is supposed to get the knowledge by himself."
CastleClash,3e1my9,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"10 gems weekly for the 10k might noobs. It's like 1,000 for the top end players. IGG aren't going to give so many gems to hundreds of people on a daily basis.  We'll know soon enough, but I all but guarantee it won't be daily. Happy to be proven wrong though, because I will find myself in the 3rd to 4th tier and getting 200+ gems per day would be lovely."
CastleClash,3e1my9,Daggaroth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:43 2015 UTC,"In today's gaming community, there are far to many games that hand hold you and spoon feed all the information to you. So its nice, at least from a certain point of view, when you get something that you have to figure out yourself or collaborate with friends or the games community (like we are doing now) in order to gain further understanding.  Its what made the zelda water temple so frustrating but oh so rewarding but when you figured it out!    that being said, it would be nice if the option was available to go to some back corner of iggs forums or website to see the details of the mechanics should you choose to do so."

My wins were in the low 30s, so 3 wins and 2 losses got me to 289.  I was hoping to get to 300 to see what the next ""rank"" looked like, but I guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow. (Or maybe the next day, once the rankings refresh.)"
CastleClash,3e1my9,shlam16,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"You can see what the next rank looks like by clicking the sword above the season countdown timer.    Replying to your other comment here, to save time:  I think that the rewards are based on your opponents ""rank"", so day 1-2 everyone will get min rewards no matter who they fight, but after that when people tier up then you get more rewards based on that. This will be verifiable tomorrow, hopefully it is correct, because otherwise I don't see how it is possible to reach 1,500 swords and reach the top tier.  Also, I think ""might"" has to have something to do with it, because you have more swords than me and I am still unbeaten. I have also been choosing the people with the highest possible swords."
CastleClash,3e1my9,kak1154,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you.  I got bigger rewards on day one, though. Maybe just because I started at zero, and I was fighting people that had already done their 5 battles. Hopefully you're right, and the rewards have a multiplier as you move up through the tiers. It looks like fame does, but I'm not sure about swords."

CastleClash,3e1my9,nxexile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:47 2015 UTC,I don't see how you can get over 1000 swords by day 7 I did the math and it should only be possible to get to 1000 on that 7th day
CastleClash,3e1my9,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"My theory is that your rewards are based on the opponents ""rank"". If you click on the sword above the countdown timer for the season you can see the different tiers. 300 is the first threshold. I think that if you beat someone in the 300-600 threshold you will get more rewards than beating someone in the 0-300 threshold.  This way everyone starts off getting minimum rewards, but by day 3 you can start to make real progress towards the top tiers."
CastleClash,3e1my9,trixnfists,2,Wed Jul 22 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Don't forget you can refresh for strong opponents and unlike arena it's the ones on the left and not the right that are higher rank.

CastleClash,3dzq0e,harborhound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just had a look in the gem spending screen and saw the new layout.   These P2W players are insane. They already have multiple heroes at 8/8. It costs 3,000 fame just to get to 6/8. 10 green runes at 300 fame apiece. 150 gems per 3 fame means 150,000 gems just for 6/8.  Assuming it is still just 10 purple and yellow runes, then this means another 300,000 gems for 7/8 and yet another 600,000 gems for 8/8, totaling over 1 million gems spent just today.   Wtf... 1,050,000 divided by 22,680 = 46.2 purchases of the $100 option. These people spent almost $5,000 per hero.  Someone please tell me something is wrong with my calculations, because this is just insanity if true."
CastleClash,3dzq0e,TheLazyTurttle,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"Your math is right, but the p2w players got their first sets as a reward for prior gems spent. 300k gems or so would get them 7/8"

For example but not limited to, Vlad, cupid, PD, Santa, and Molt. I loved the jump from N to O because how challenging it was, but still doable with medicore heroes. Another big part for me is base building. Whenever I see a base I like, I try to make an adaptation of It and testing it. Dungeons isn't that fun. And lost realm as lost it's appeal. I have like 15 stamina cards just sitting there..."
CastleClash,3e1ym2,Washedlightning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"I like the strategy behind it and the fact that the game rewards you for activity and for skill. I know alot of people scream ""PAY TO WIN"" but the fact is for the vast majority of things in the game you can get for free with patience and a bit of luck.  Hell, even Moltanica can be gotten for free during the spend 2000 gems and flip a chest event as long as you saved up your gems prior. Spirit mage, Minotaur and Destroyer can all be gotten with excessive amounts of tapjoying (thats how I got spirit mage, just kept it plugged in and running during the work day watching the same damn video over )    buying gems just eliminates the wait.   But I digress.. Castle Clash is a great game for many reasons, there is so much to do, there are multiple PvP opportunities, multiple PvE opportunities, reasons to keep older and less powerful heroes so they still maintain some form of usefulness after you've unlocked a better hero (both for Garrisons and for might boosting)  anywho I am bordering on writing a small novel but i'll just end with saying Castle Clash is awesome :)"

Luckily, when I bought 10k gems for the first time after 2 years of F2P, I managed to get Pd, santa and ork with very decent talents (pd came with 5/5 Ld, santa 4/5 revite and ork 5/5 condemnation). Santa and pd left alone made me go up higher in hbm, although not too high (not working on higher hbm at the moment). The really fun part is doing mesas once you have that PD, anyways, man you're awesome... 50k tapjoyed gems. Jesus"

CastleClash,3dzg1x,da_wizard,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't get it either.  But you'd think they'd make their new hero useful for Boss 4 to get that whale money, and if she is FW should be too."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"Psyshield doesn't clear debuffs, it blocks the next one. which means if your heroes are all procing at the same time (perhaps because of cupid) it wont be able to block them all."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:42 2015 UTC,so it would only block one right? well then you would need a throw away debuff that can be applied .1 second before FW... guess if you could get the timing down having FW/Shaman down it doesn't matter which proc got through as long as one of them did
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"Do you think the slow down talent would get caught by a psyshield? You could put a 1/8 crest set on every hero just to bait out the psyshields. And then each hero would have a 25%chance of activating it with each hit.  With 6 heroes attacking at max attack speed (assuming you get there) you would have an 82% chance of negating it with just your slow down crests meaning it would be more likely to allow shaman or frost witch's proc to take effect.  If I were to pick an ideal team: cupid, druid, orksbane, PD, FW, vlad  All with scatter and or slow down talents/crests"
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:23 2015 UTC,would be worth trying out but I have a feeling that IGG has rigged it so his psyshield doesn't let anything by... but my guild isn't touching this till Wednesday at which I am more then willing to test some of these  on a side not I don't have a single scatter crest set done so can't test that... wish cause I have a 5/5 scatter ninja and Pixie so I'm close to easy scatter set up which is why I want to get ninja scatter to at least 6/8 (40 energy+pixies 25)
CastleClash,3dzg1x,kak1154,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"I used FW, Shaman, and Santa on Boss 4 last night, and some of the debuffs were definitely getting through. You could see his speed slowing. My best run was with PD tanking, Cupid, Druid, Santa, FW, and Shaman.  I also tried a Scatter setup with Pixie (5/8), Ninja (4/8), Vlad tanking, PD, Cupid, Druid. Didn't work too well; I probably need more than 45 Scatter."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:12 2015 UTC,Yea I plan on trying scatter set up once I can get my 5/8 scatter ninja up to at least 6/8 cause thay will be 40+ 25 from pixie
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:08 2015 UTC,I'm gonna start stocking up on scatter and slow down crests for when the update does hit
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:10 2015 UTC,Would be smart. I have 3/5 and a 2/5 set with like 2 1/5 sets done for slow down but scatter just won't drop for me
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:01 2015 UTC,Let me know if the slow down or anything else seems to work
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:25 2015 UTC,Will do. In the mean time I'm working on my treant to see if he will help but I feel like I'd need to get him to 8/10 ideally
CastleClash,3dzg1x,piffle213,3,Tue Jul 21 23:46:27 2015 UTC,The better discussion might be why do the rewards suck so much?
CastleClash,3dzg1x,dormaterium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess this post is irrelevant, as no-one has reason to figure out the details. lol"
CastleClash,3dzg1x,piffle213,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"They actually don't seem bad at all.  Once you own every legendary and you get them all past 9*, you have no use for the HB's you get by beating Bosses 1 through 3, not to mention the abunance of HB's flowing from Arena every hour.  So, getting Merits in BossIV should be a breath of fresh air for those at the top of the food chain."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,dormaterium,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"To spend on what, exactly? If you don't need HB anymore, then you don't need LHC ... which means you're already swimming in merits, too."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,piffle213,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"Once you moved your heroes to 10*, the heroes still have a long way to be maxed out.  So presumably you are still on the long road of building them up.  It's just that the last portion of the road doesn't require HB's.  Experience can be bought with merits.  Players who had their heroes maxed out at 9* before the update that change the max to 10* were pissing away HB on rolling heroes - nothing else to spend it on."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe. I am skeptical that top players are short of merits though."
CastleClash,3dzg1x,dormaterium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:07 2015 UTC,I have 10* heros and I'm still honor badge starved.. even prior to the update I wasn't capped because I was working on dupes...  if you are honor badge capped it usually means you are slacking because there is always the next thing to spend it on
CastleClash,3dzg1x,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"Stick to Boss3 for now, and when you get there, you'll know. ;-)"

CastleClash,3dzg1x,piffle213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:27 2015 UTC,I buy every single exp and shard that shows up and I'm always out of merit.
CastleClash,3dzg1x,TheLazyTurttle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:07 2015 UTC,It's faaaaaaaar more efficient to buy the quest refreshes than the experience books.

CastleClash,3dydwy,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:23 2015 UTC,I have a 5/8 scatter ninja that's about to get bumped up to 8/8 since it takes 70 away plus 25 from pixie I should be safe.. will try at lower ranks first but 6/8 is 40 even.. so that would be 65..
CastleClash,3dydwy,Deej18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:34 2015 UTC,does aries ability work? or vlad's fear?
CastleClash,3dydwy,Duality_Of_Reality,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:05 2015 UTC,Stuns or fears do nothing at all to him. Haven't seen anyone try aries but I'm willing to bet it won't be effective  Edit- Ended up seeing some one use aries and he was useless
CastleClash,3dydwy,Deej18,0,Mon Jul 20 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"FW with slow is actually pretty nice on this boss, probably one of the better ones imo."
CastleClash,3dydwy,TheLazyTurttle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:50 2015 UTC,really because from what I've seen from youtube videos it doesn't effect him at all really so gonna stick with useless.
CastleClash,3dydwy,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"He removes a single debuff every 0.2 seconds, so you need to apply them much more frequently if you want to survive.  FW has a non cooldown debuff, and can hold a talent debuff with i believe a 40% chance to apply at 8/8.  meaning with PD she can stack two pretty quickly.  Now throw in Ork with the same setup for 2 more debuffs, and fill in the rest with as many non or low cd debuffers as you can and you'll do fine.  You won't do all 800M damage to him, but you'll do enough...  I didn't have time to try, but I'm guessing Ice Demon might not be that bad too since there's no CD."
CastleClash,3dydwy,TheLazyTurttle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:31 2015 UTC,We think he blocks 1 debuff.. not removes but blocks... but this is igg and doesn't mean that boss psyshield has to follow the same rules as ours as seen by the .2 second cd so it could block much more.  That being said FW can only proc every 1.4 seconds which means you need something to soak up that psyshield first before it can go through most obvious solution would be slow down as it is on hit which happens before skills but even then you would need basically the whole team to have a consistent chance oc getting through psyshield and that is on the hope that igg only buffed bosses psyshield with the .2 second timer and not the ability to block multiple debuffs
CastleClash,3dydwy,Deej18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Your right, I thought it was remove, but it's blocks from my understanding.  So you need to apply more then 5 debuffs every 1 second. 6 slow downs, frost witch, and any other non cd hero would do well to help imo.  can't say anything for certain until i get more chances at him which sucks cause my guild wants to stick to boss 3 since most people don't need such a small amount of merit."
CastleClash,3dydwy,TheLazyTurttle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:30 2015 UTC,My guild isn't trying it till Wednesday but I think we will try it every once in awhile.. gonna hold a vote after we try it.. but I the end I'm the leader so it's my call haha..

CastleClash,3dydwy,TheLazyTurttle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"HB is about the easiest resource to gather, I'd much rather have more merit especially since I'm thinking they'll add fame items to the shop."

CastleClash,3dxcqu,shlam16,2,Mon Jul 20 12:31:42 2015 UTC,"At the end of each week there is a rewards payout depending on your ranking. Assume ~1,000 per week from dailies, then this can be multiplied by 30% for upper-middle ranked players. So call it 1,300 per week. This means it will take only one month for a talent box for a consistent player. Probably closer to 5 weeks accounting for random losses along the way.  If you are a top tier player then you will be getting 2,250 a week, and it will only take a little over a fortnight per talent.

CastleClash,3dwtqq,Shadow5h0t,2,Mon Jul 20 05:48:45 2015 UTC,"Pixie is a healer so she should probably take the spot until the Druid arrives. Not to mention she is helpful and should continue to be leveled anyway.   Edit: OP you are new and resources will be slim for a long while, but you should level almost every one of these heroes rather than neglecting everyone aside from a main 5. They all have their roles to play in various modes."
CastleClash,3dwtqq,shlam16,2,Mon Jul 20 06:13:10 2015 UTC,What makes tg your choice over dk or sz?  Judt curious
CastleClash,3dwtqq,Shadow5h0t,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:34 2015 UTC,"Dk is a nice hero and I use him now that I have him. Sz is easily outclassed and is only used in mesa and boss mainly. Tg is a huge hero for begining players. Pixie is a healer as the next person says but her heal is nill in comparison to what it needs.   You will need to raise them all though slowly. Pd vlad druid molt and tg will be a solid team until someone better comes along. His paralysis comes In handy.   If you want, you could easily trade him with DK for his proc. But again tg paralysis is better that avoiding a debug at your might."

OB or TG might work too in place of cupid but more than 2 melee is usually bad news. Anyway look up the Warmachines or hyuga16 base and put some slowdown crests on a couple guy and you should be farming O no problem. P when you're 9 star.  For arena, since you don't have a high revite Aries you could try doing a counter strategy with pixie and scatter crests, or sending an atlantacore down their lane with psyshield. Not sure on the specifics but I get stomped by those setups sometimes.  Also with PD less than berserk 4 is kind of useless, so unless it's letting you keep 3 stacks up some lifedrain crests might work out better. Sounds eh but it's saved my PD from insanely stupid deaths lots of times."
CastleClash,3dvav7,da_wizard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:39:58 2015 UTC,Thks for your answer. Siren for hbm?
CastleClash,3dvav7,Eddyfus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:18 2015 UTC,"You should be leveling PD, Cupid, Druid, Vlad, Santa, Molt.  Those are best heroes for HBM.  Since you don't have Vlad, Santa or Molt focus on PD, Cupid Druid to max level, then Immortep, Pixie and TG or Aries if you have a 6th base.  I would COMPLETELY stop leveling Paladin, Champ, Siren, AC, Succ, Ninja, SZ.   No shards no xp tomes. Champ doesn't need to be any higher since you will only use him on boss for his stun and he can achieve that where he is now. Siren and Ninja suck, Ninja can be good for torch battles though. AC sucks/doesn't need to be any higher to serve his purpose.  SZ is highest damage for boss and Mesa, but doesn't need to be any higher than he currently is to achieve that, he's already past capping out on boss and Mesa damage.  Use him on Mesa and daily boss. Succ doesn't need to be any higher and I wouldn't even use her.  She is useful in arena if she can get to other end and proc, but I wouldn't use her when you have other heroes.  Some people say she's useful for hbm final wave boss but thats crap you don't need her, just need slow down crests.  Level a Frost Witch up to 120 and get it to 4/10.  Great debuffer for lost realm.  For HBM, give your Cupid, Druid and Pixie Slow Down crests.  If you're not using them already, this should significantly up your hbm game.  You will not compete well in arena unless you have 5/5 revite Aries and Cupid.    I'm top 100 Arena and it's still a bitch and you only get 100-160 HB an hour.  I would give up on getting anywhere high in arena until you get Warlock, Santa, Aries and Cupid with 5/5 Revite.  HBM team: Druid, Cupid, PD, Immortep, Pixie and Aries or TG if you have a 6th base.   If you haven't invested too much into PD 7-8 yet, I would switch and level Cupid to 8 first.  You should join our guild we help people out with stuff like this all day long, if you have lots of questions you'll find lots of answers.  All us leaders are 100k-140k might, 2 in top 100 arena, three cleared all expert dungeons, and two working on T5.  We carry everyone through Mesa 4 and WG 2-3 every day, no matter what heroes they have.  Silly guild name but bunch of fun people, no assholes.  Stiflers_Mom is guild name, you can just apply or add me in game first, Edifus.   Line chat you can add Stiflers_mom or Edifus as well.  Good luck man!"

I know your Orksbane is 4/5 Bulwark, which means that 5/5 Life Drain will be a nice upgrade for the Orksbane, but if you do not use Orksbane at all, then it's really wasted.  I use all three of my Orksbanes in different game modes other than hbm so if I had 5/5 Life Drain i'd use it on Orksbane or Moltanica."

Wargod cant increase  heal. Lifedrain is 5% of total HP including inscriptions and amazingly will stack on top of tenacity and bullwark crests(which can increase the amount healed by 10-30 %). After adding everything together that 5% becomes a huge number and that is why whenever someone has 5/5 lifedrain they always say ""he never dies"" cause its true. Dont listen to bad advice, go with your gut..LIFEDRAIN on Vlad is OP"

Immortep is a very good help on HBM and does bring a lot of damage to bosses, but has a chance proc and it's melee. Grizzly is amazing on raids. I combine him with TG and I can raid bases with heroes 10 levels above mine easily, with the advantage that he's not as dependent on a good layout as TG. Not bad on HBM too, but not as good. Really depends on what you need more: Raid or HBM help. But I personally love Reaper, so I'd pick him. And chances are, if you ever get Dracula, Immortep just feels useless (I should know this, rolled him recently and despite still being lower level is doing so much more)."

If you have less than 300 swords, you get 10-100 gems.  The highest tier 1500 swords gets a bonus of at least 690 gems and an additional 50% bonus of their earned fame points.   4)you can refresh your opponent lists.

CastleClash,3dnsot,shlam16,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:12 2015 UTC,"Total, so it works like expedition.  You can have one PD.  Now, this is speculation because neither myself not the two players can read Chinese, and they didn't show the team building part in the video, but neither their team nor any of the people they played against had a duplicate, so thats my deduction."
CastleClash,3dnsot,shlam16,2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"you get 5 tries per day, and each season is a week long.   Do you know if you have to spend your fame within the given season? Or can you hoard it?   winning earns you swords (which correlate to ranking)   Does losing lose swords?   you can refresh your opponent lists.   Indefinitely? For a cost? Which currency?   The avatar appears to be the strongest hero in your opponents first team   This is great for me. I have had my teams planned since I first saw the sneak peek. I intend to place my weakest team first, however the avatar for my weakest team will be AC, so people won't know what to make of it because AC can either be epic or useless and they won't know which - meaning they won't know which of their own teams is required to beat it. My strongest team will go second and my second team will go last.    Edit: Few more generic questions. I know I'm going a bit overboard, so feel free not to answer everything. I'm just excited for some solid info.  1) How much fame do you get for a victory? I saw in the video that the talent cards are brutally expensive compared to the runes. How hard will it be to buy them?  2) Along the same lines, how many swords do you get for a win?  3) Do you get fame/swords for successful defence?  4) Does it show the opponents Might? Or their class (King/Duke/etc)?  5) How many runes does it take to upgrade a 5/8 talent to a 6/8 talent?  Thanks for posting this, and sorry for the bombardment of questions. Just looking forward to this update more than anything they have released since LR/HBM2/Expert dungeons."
CastleClash,3dnsot,shlam16,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this with saying I haven't actually played the update, I just found the video and translated the important parts of the German conversation.   I imagine you can hoard fame, while the swords will refresh every season, but I honestly dont know. If you attack and lose you appear to gain a set 10 swords and 10 fame, but I do not know if being defeated causes you to lose swords.   I do not know anything about defending, sadly.  I too am anxious to see how that will work out. It appears you can refresh your opponent list 5 times for free.  I do not think you can purchase additional refreshes.  I also do not know if that is 5 times per day or per season, that's something we'll have to wait and see about.   As for your third team having AC, that is something that I imagine several players will do.  Since AC can single handedly carry an otherwise weaker team.  Thus, if I see an AC avatar, Im going to assume it's their weakest team, and Im gonna send my 2nd team led by my pixie out first.  This is going to be one of the most strategic game modes there is.  I can't wait.  Okay, now to your additional questions:  Grouping one and 2-- The amount of fame you get appears to vary based on how many swords the opponent has.  This is tough to gauge because the players in the video only won one of their 5 matches.  You receive the same amount of swords as you do fame, plus the additional fame bonus at the end of the season depending on which tier you fall into.   I dont think you'll get fame or swords for successful defense, but again I dont know how defense will work in terms of effecting your fame and sword. It shows how many swords your opponents have, which is a way to judge their might.  If they have 1000 swords, they're gonna be real tough.  If they have 50, not so much. The talent question I'm not 100% sure on, but Ive read elsewhere it will take 10 of the corresponding runes to go up each level.  So basically 10 of the cheapest to go to level 6, 10 of the middle to go to 7, 10 of hte expensive to go 8.  But thats just what I read elsewhere.   Sorry I couldnt answer more of your questions, but yes I am equally excited about the Lost Battlefield"

CastleClash,3dmik5,Daggaroth,3,Fri Jul 17 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"PD, Cupid, Orks, Mino, SB, Vlad/Molt is the premium team. Though understandably most people are missing some if not most of these heroes.  I have the 2 achievements for completing and 3-starring 50 expert dungeons and my team is: PD, Cupid, Vlad, Druid, GR, Aries. I'm dying to roll SB, but the game simply isn't cooperating with me.  I've got 551 flames and I am stuck there. I cannot progress any further with these heroes. My team gets permastunned by the magic towers and the arrow towers just chew me to pieces. At least I have enough to 10* heroes when my vaults get there.  As for your suggested heroes: Spirit Mage and Angel will be SHREDDED by towers. It will take mere seconds for them to be dead.   Edit: Just want to add, the reason PD is a must is because the towers have so much HP that you genuinely can't do enough damage in time to clear the stage without him. P2W players just use PD to buff their Mino/SB so that when they proc the stage is essentially cleared then and there. It is how they farm the 57 shard dungeon."
CastleClash,3dmik5,shlam16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:24 2015 UTC,Good to know.. thanks!   I was thinking the primary danger of the later expert dungeons is the hero bombs but I can see i'll have to worry about the towers as well..

CastleClash,3dmik5,shlam16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:21 2015 UTC,I beat about 30 with my team at ~155-160 before it got too hard. When I found out the requirement for 10* heroes was 550 flames I revisited it with my heroes now 165-175 and I breezed through it until I hit the wall severely somewhere in the 6th dungeon set. I went from 3-flaming everything to doing like 16% in the space of a single dungeon. I see no need currently to persevere any further considering I now have enough flames for the highest requirement.
CastleClash,3dmik5,nerdrake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:26 2015 UTC,10* and the achievements are all I really care about. I've just started getting my team up to 9. PD is 166 and the highest level so I guess it's just more time.

CastleClash,3dmik5,shlam16,2,Sat Jul 18 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I use Snowstorm right out of the gate and put it over the magic towers which can hit my initial drop point. Then I drop PD and Cupid, wait a second or 2, then drop the rest of my team for an early buff. As soon as I am finished dropping my heroes I use Ares Frenzy to do maximum damage from the first proc (primarily Vlad). After this I just babysit them with Guardian Angel and Restoration. Usually give GA to Vlad and whoever is nearby when he starts getting low so that he can heal himself. Try to save Restoration for PD/Druid when they die because they both have revive crests.  Is there a better strategy?"
CastleClash,3dmik5,iamsecond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"I use PD, Cupid, Orks, Druid, Vlad, Aries. Aries is a last choice, he's just the strongest hero I have after those first five.

I almost always have to use four spells."
CastleClash,3dmik5,iamsecond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:58 2015 UTC,do the rewards of the later dungeons compensate for the use of the spells?
CastleClash,3dmik5,iamsecond,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Not really. Four spells would cost me like 180k gold (restoration, GA, AF, Ice thing), dungeon 5.8 gives 15k gold.

I'd think you should at least be able to clear through 40+ dungeons if they're 140+. I'd also recommend putting revive crests/talents on PD/Druid/SB (if you don't have / can't get better) to keep them in the fight. I have revive 1 crest on PD, 3/5 revive on Orks, 5/5 revive on Druid, and it helps a ton. My heroes are 140-165, 80+ inscriptions, medieocre talents."

(though once i get some more revive crest sets they are probably going to get them all as well)    I just got used to doing them without spells so I try and do the same but i'll have to use my spells when I attempt the elite dungeons I suppose."

CastleClash,3dmi53,cardinalf1b,3,Fri Jul 17 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"A little of both. Revive is a great talent, don't get me wrong, however having it as opposed to other talent combos for certain heroes isn't ideal. Heavy hitters go best with heavy hitting talents. Specialists require specialist talents. Revive kind of wastes a slot in these cases.  It is funny to watch though when you are raiding."
CastleClash,3dmi53,shlam16,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"Agree that it isn't as offensive as other talents, but i find more reliable survival on expert dungeon 7/10, HBM R, expeditions, and raiding... And since damage is capped in some modes, I just gravitated slowly to revive.  As a side-note... I recognize your name from Arena (you are ranked 2606 at the moment)!

Slowing attack speed is especially strong against players that don't have 5/5 revite on their heroes because it basically elongates the time it takes for their heroes to proc significantly.

CastleClash,3dhpli,deutscherhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:07 2015 UTC,"I am only basing this off what I read in their sneak peeks, but I highly doubt you can use dupes in LR. I hope you can't. It would be boring if people just fielded 3 identical teams. It would be much more strategic if everyone had to use 15 different heroes.  As for the 8/8, I really, really hope you can upgrade from any level, but I know deep in my heart that it will be only from 5/5. It will make more money out of people who just settled on 4/5 talents. They now need to keep on spending so they can progress with the OP talents.  My TG will have an epic 8/8 Blade Shell because that is the only 5/5 I will be able to spend my new currency on.  Edit: Just thought of a good idea. They could make it so that you can only upgrade any given talent by 3 levels using runes. This way people can get their 2/5 talents to 5/8. People with 5/5 talents can get all the way to 8/8. Etc."

Team 1 - The power team  Empty front row  Cupid - PD -   Vlad - SM - Aries    Team 2 - The stun team  Empty front row (or perhaps tanking with TG)  Champ - TG - Immo  Druid - GR -    Team 3 - The leftovers with surprise AC   - AC (low revive + revite) -  SZ - Ninja - Succy  Siren - -     The first team is my default team in LR anyway, and I manage to perma-hold altars at 66k might. The second team is a huge pest with so much stun, not to mention 3 of them are also 9*. The third team is pretty weak, but the talent/crest combo on AC makes him a force to be reckoned with. Ninja has 5/5 Scatter too.   In the end though, it doesn't really matter how you try to defend because all they have to do is challenge you once, see how you defend, then send their #1 against your #2; their #2 against your #3; then just sacrifice their #3 to your #1.

CastleClash,3diemh,Mailos343,6,Thu Jul 16 14:59:29 2015 UTC,Hero bases should definitely be leveled up since it gives a defense bonus which can help for hbms and also gives you increased range which can help dealing with hbm waves where say a sm likes to attack towers just outside your normal range  As for guild hall.. only big use for it is the health it gets since it is small and can get a lot of hp it's used inside walls to tank agro of a wave in hbm... also being able to hold more flags at once is nice
CastleClash,3diemh,Deej18,3,Thu Jul 16 15:11:35 2015 UTC,"This.  Upgrade bases to make heroes stronger on defense (when others raid you, HBM, HT) and to give the bases more hp, which also helps on defense (enemies may take longer attacking your bases so your heroes can defend for more time before being attacked themselves).  Upgrade guild hall because at high levels it has a lot more hp. Enemies will take longer attacking your buildings so your heroes can defend for more time before being attacked themselves.  Also upgrading them provides might, which you do want in general"
CastleClash,3diemh,iamsecond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"for me, upgrading hero bases are a priority as it gives my heroes a larger area of operation. Currently the way I have it setup there are two paths to the single entrance of my base and as such, typically only 4 of my 6 heroes respond to one side, currently I am upgrading them from level 20 to level 21 and that +1 range is making all the difference in how quickly my heroes respond to approaching enemies.    The defense bonus is great as well, especially in the later waves when you have to deal with thunder god and grizzly reaper hitting you with their procs a few times while they take out your other buildings in wave 1.    As for guild hall, I use it as a tank building at the entrance of my base and I enjoy the extra flag capacity as my guilds leaders are sometimes sporadic at putting up replacements, so I tend to horde them :P   anywho I can't recommend enough that you upgrade your hero bases, the range really makes a big big big big big (takes breath) big big big deal later on in my opinion."

CastleClash,3deaxy,cbfwaiting10mins,5,Wed Jul 15 16:29:58 2015 UTC,Do none of the enemies have flame shield talents? If your SM is buffed by 3-4 cupids and 3-4 PDs and 2 druids he could be doing enough damage that the 20% deflection would kill him right?
CastleClash,3deaxy,SireAquinas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yes it would, but they problem with this is that the heroes with FG would be killed by the same attack, since FG only deflects a small amount of the attack. These heroes always survive unscathed until an attack finally penetrates their defence."
CastleClash,3deaxy,shlam16,3,Thu Jul 16 04:24:08 2015 UTC,"I always use SM on m4 and he rarely dies (I use revive which is almost always activated).  My guild doesnt do stupid shit and start in the middle, so im sure that helps the situation.   All in all SM with revive is highly recommended for m4."
CastleClash,3deaxy,ShackledOrphan,2,Thu Jul 16 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"I've run sm on m4 maybe 10 times, and of course I run revive, and it has died at least 7 times. I stopped running sm, even though I love the way it looks."
CastleClash,3deaxy,stickbo,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:18 2015 UTC,It looks awesome when there are 2 or more SM rattling off procs in succession. The battlefield is reduced to dust in instants (until they kill themselves).
CastleClash,3deaxy,Nerdy_McNerd,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"It's not blade shell, it's flame guard. If SM hits when he is buffed he will be killed."
CastleClash,3deaxy,shlam16,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"This can't be the case, because the heroes that get hit would die at the same time.

CastleClash,3deaxy,ntropi,2,Thu Jul 16 04:22:40 2015 UTC,The hero being hit could be one of the bosses
CastleClash,3deaxy,shlam16,2,Thu Jul 16 13:02:07 2015 UTC,Interesting. I've never thought of the bosses having talents before. Wonder if there is any documentation about this.
CastleClash,3deaxy,ntropi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:24:39 2015 UTC,I've seen them start with revite... at least that's the only one that's readily apparent. I always assumed the talents were randomly assigned for every enemy at the start of each fight.
CastleClash,3deaxy,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"When running with guild I've used SM just for the dps and while it does happen, I think he was surviving about 80-90% of the time.   It could just be that the group I was with was taking out some of the blade shell guys before he'd proc, though.  I would start in top left. SM was somewhere around 150 with a tenacity and a revive.   As silly as it sounds tenacity may have been the key. The first few attempts with SM went about as poorly as you report. It's possible that that extra hp let it hang on just long enough for druids to fire.  With addition of other heroes to the game I don't really use SM in mesa anymore."
CastleClash,3deaxy,ExplodingJesus,2,Wed Jul 15 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"All told he has roughly 70k HP including his inscription and crests, so another conclusion I've had to come from from this is that the damage cap doesn't apply to Blade Shell either. With the multiple PD and Cupid buffs, SM must be doing well over 100k per proc. If it were capped at 60k then he would survive his own attack.  I could try Tenacity, but based on the above, I don't think it will work. The only times he survived in my test was when there were 2+ Santa who were able to splash damage the BS heroes and clear the path for SM. I assume when you run with the guild there are plenty of SB in each run?"
CastleClash,3deaxy,FatFed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly how things got swapped out, but I think in general I've been using SB instead of SM with the regular group.  I know the conventional wisdom is that SM is bad at M4. But sweet baby jesus once he gets spooled up he procs like a machine gun. It's not worth losing the debuffs SB brings to the table but at the time it was quite valuable. As long as those druids would proc it didn't matter if we were floating a lower level player... the constant stream his proc did great damage."
CastleClash,3deaxy,shlam16,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I am lacking in the SB department. I ran with Aries for a while but he kept dying also, though not quite as much because of the long cool-down on his proc.   If not for SM/Aries, my next best hero for the 5th spot is TG. He is guaranteed to survive which is good, but I actually want to help with the ranged killing in some way."
CastleClash,3deaxy,FatFed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"I came to a different conclusion, that it's SM on top with the flame guard talent. This is also why the four corner strategy is best on M4, because your teammates will clear those pesky heroes out before too many PD and Cupid stacks."
CastleClash,3deaxy,novalyfe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"I've replied this a couple of times already in this thread, but I don't think it can be FG because if it were then the heroes themselves would die when they are hit by the ranged attack. Be it Aries, SM, GR, even occasionally SB if his missile specifically targets them - the hero always survives with full health. This can only be Blade Shell. If it were Flame Guard then they would die at the same time.  I will never accept a match in M4 with a 4 corner lineup. I simply don't trust other teams not to lose 2-3 players and therefore risk losing me the match. I will either do 2 centre, 2 bottom; or 2 bottom, 2 right. Even when 2 teams go at the top I feel very nervous that the Mino will proc before they can which always results in heroes dying."
CastleClash,3deaxy,FatFed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yes they would and that's what I've always observed. I haven't identified the ground unit that has FG, but SM definitely does because I've seen Aries, GR or Santa proc against him and they both die. I use Mino to clear the ground out and when he procs with only 1-2 buffs he survives but with little health. When he procs with multiple buffs he'll instantly die.  You don't have to trust the other teams, just yours. My cupid will proc and get PD buffs going as long as I'm solo in a corner. 2 teams in one corner doesn't help and actually hinders your performance."
CastleClash,3deaxy,novalyfe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"not true actually. Having a team in every corner (unless you have all figured out your drop orders and assembled teams to have permascatter) is probably one of the slowest ways to do it. You should pair off to two sides (whatever you want, probably best to take two sides that have the BS npc's) and have an ice demon in the group (or once again permascatter), the other 3 bosses will never proc."
CastleClash,3deaxy,FatFed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"We usually finish in 100 seconds, our heroes aren't min/max either, just use what we want. Pairing up isn't better or faster, it's just a handicap."
CastleClash,3deaxy,novalyfe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"well it goes back to your setup. If you guys are permascattering, it makes no difference, but the bonus to pairing up is you limit how many bosses can get their proc off. If you take on 2 bosses (lets say top and right), and you get at least 1 decent ice demon in your groupings, you can slow the other 3 bosses to speeds where they are almost not moving at all. Plan your setups so that your ranged heroes are first to reach next boss and the other 3 bosses will not proc, or might proc once. No stun = faster kills = faster complete."
CastleClash,3deaxy,FatFed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"For your specific Ice Demon strategy, sure that works, however it would be almost impossible to prevent a melee hero from reaching the next boss before a ranged. Without Ice Demon, pairing isn't more effective than four corner."
CastleClash,3deaxy,novalyfe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:03 2015 UTC,"its setup man. Not everyone uses the same heroes you use. I use ranged heroes for example, just because of the ice demon strategy. A friend of mine has a group where all 4 communicate amazingly, and they've figured out deploy orders and have gotten a permascatter setup. They also find pairing works better, and once they get upto 200ms attack speed, boss never procs. You mind letting me know why you think its a handicap?"
CastleClash,3deaxy,iamsecond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:01:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but how is your ranged hero beating PD to the next boss? Even if you're not using PD, 2-3 of your other teammates are. Even skipping the stun on the first two bosses, you're likely to have PD reach first on the next 3. I'd have to see video of your run because after seeing this one, I'm not impressed.  It's a handicap in two aspects, first if your group is carrying lower level players that would die very quickly in their own corner. Secondly you destroy the tower too quickly before PD/Cupid procs go off, and your corner partner will aggro more of the dangerous corner heroes. If you're a 5/5 revit lineup, obviously this doesn't matter."
CastleClash,3deaxy,Hebbmeister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"Well I don't have a set team, so I run with randoms more often than with guildies. But when I do run with them they have a sprint on one of their ranged heroes (usually vlad if I remember right). When I run with randoms we usually go middle+bottom/side (pairs) because for some reason people hate running 2 sides. In that case after that side/bottom boss dies, they join us in the middle and then two bosses are more than guaranteed to agro a ranged first as the melee heros are closest to the boss in the middle.  When we run two sides, I guess I haven't thought about too much but I imagine they have sprint on one of their heroes, as I find they always beat the PD's to the middle (and again to the last 2 bosses). But next time I get an opportunity, I'll see if I can record it quick enough.   also about the handicap thing, I didn't really get the first one. It seems pairing off would be an advantage if you're carrying a noob. I do agree with the second one though (but if you pair off to the right sides a vlad or immo proc should kill them quick enough I think (at least 2/3 of em))"
CastleClash,3deaxy,shlam16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:44:51 2015 UTC,"Being bored, I figured out the chances of SM living and dying given certain assumptions. Snorefest below:  Assumptions   Spirit Mage is at 6/10, firing at 7 targets. Survivability will improve with lower skill level (less chance to hit heroes with Blade Shell) All twenty-nine heroes are still alive when SM procs. Survivability improves as the ratio of enemy heroes with BS talent decreases. (Starting point is 3/29, so odds to survive improve if BS heroes have died when SM procs, or if less than 10 non-BS heroes die for each BS hero that has died when SM procs). *Results are for just one SM proc. Could do math for a second, but that would require more assumptions about how many heroes have died, and how many of those had / did not have BS talent. Too many scenarios to be able to generalize well. SM proc has an equal chance of targeting BS heroes and non-BS heroes, including the bosses. BS hero = hero with 5/5 Blade Shell. OP said 3 enemy heroes have 5/5 BS, I'm running with that assumption. Below ""live"" = ""BS does not reflect dmg to SM"", and ""die"" = ""BS DOES reflect dmg to SM."" Percentages are the total overall probability for each outcome. E.g. when SM procs, there is a 3.98% chance that one of the 7 projectiles will hit a hero with BS AND that the proc will reflect back to, and kill, SM. This is not the same as ""IF SM proc hits just one hero with BS, there is a 3.98% chance SM will die."" If SM hits just one BS-hero, there is a 9% chance the projectile reflects back, this is Blade Shell's definition. Percentages rounded arbitrarily to nearest 0.01%.   Survivability    Number of BS heroes hit by proc Live/Die % Chance    Zero Live! 42.15%   One Live! 40.27%   One Die :( 3.98%   Two Live! 11.51%   Two Die :( 1.14%   Three Live! 0.87%   Three Die :( 0.09%    In conclusion, overall all chances to live and die following first proc by a 6/9 SM given above assumptions:   Chance to live: 94.8% Chance to die: 5.2%  So either the game mechanics for SM's proc work differently than I've assumed (maybe SM proc favors BS hero over a non-BS hero, OP's SM is higher than 6/10, SM proc favors normal heroes over bosses, probably something) or it's just a case of very bad luck. Either way this was a fun exercise in calculating probabilities!  Questions/comments/formatting advice welcome :)"

CastleClash,3ddw57,ShaitanUnborn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"Between ~3,000 to 5,000 is my usual range. Occasionally foray higher, like now for instance, I am currently 1,400.  My record is way back when the game was still new. I made it into the top 50 on Android. This was when Ninja was the OP hero. I used to free-lane with Ninja, Assassin, and Marksman, and tank with Pally, Champ, and Werewolf. My heroes were at a staggering level 80.   Level 80 was actually a big deal back then, before HBM or EXP books. The only EXP to be garnered was by farming low level dungeons and raiding people.    I really think that the rewards should be changed for Arena rankings. Despite having millions more players, the payout scheme hasn't changed, and only the top 50 get anything resembling decent rewards. They should add a couple of zeroes to each of the payout brackets, let the early-game players fight over something rather than being stuck at 50 p/h forever. Let's be honest, ~2k per day is pathetic and irrelevant these days.  Edit: Just to clarify, when I say add a couple of zeroes I don't mean payout 500 p/h, I mean expand the bracket for 60 p/h from top 50k to top 500k, and so on up the list."

I make about 40k HB per day, so I'll have more than enough of them when the time comes around. I'm spending 30k apiece on dupes so that I can take their inscriptions to level 80.

GR is only good for my second raid option (""kill enemies from far"") but he will only dmg heroes after killing all troops, so thats not so usefull if the enemy is well prepared, and when you kill all of them he will not dmg with his skill buildings (TG and DK will), i dont know much about his dmg and HP so idk if he will be usefull for HBM, but i guess he is if your base is well built because he will not have to walk much and have the highest rate of fire (so high dps[?!]), and also clean the heroes while hit troops, which is also a good thing"

I know this for a fact because my friend recently beat it with literally identical heroes at the same levels and TH13 with 5 hero bases.  My design has 180 walls. I have crossed out 50 to show how it is possible at TH13. If your TH is higher than 13 then just use your best judgement and put walls where ever you feel like, it doesn't make any difference - the functionality will not change. Put the 5th hero in the middle and make a 2-1-2 arrangement out of the bases. Make this the PD too.  You're not going to be able to farm it at those levels, but you will be able to beat it and make your way to HBM2.

CastleClash,3da4at,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"Yep just follow the template I set. Put those extra 20 walls where-ever. Using 16 of them to create funnels in the entrance like I have would probably be your most productive use for them.  Also, sorry to tell you, but HBM2 is awful for EXP. Farming J should be your goal if you want EXP. It's not even until N that you earn more shards either. M gives the same as J and is a lot easier though, so if you just want guaranteed shards M is the best goal for your current levels.    Edit: Oh, one thing though - you can't put your town hall in the central structure unless you have 3 thick walls around the outside. Put your highest HP building in its place."
CastleClash,3da4at,novalyfe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"the two-thick part of the wall being that long will fail. The mobs won't walk around at that rate and will just break through. I don't have a picture of mine atm, but you need to make at least some part of the side 3 thick."

LR your standard team would probably be PD, Santa, Vlad, DK and Siren, with TG and AC being two you can sub in if you need them.

I keep everything within range of the towers to dissuade people from plinking at my mines and not giving me a shield. Almost always kills an attacking hero with the hero traps.   Base 2.   HBM J. No troops or garrisons. 100%.   Base 3.   HBM Q. No troops or garrisons. ~90%.   Sometimes loses to unlucky spawns. It is a guaranteed win in HBM P and can beat most heroes in HT12.    Smurf (TH11-13)   Base 1.   Farms HBM G at TH11. No troops or garrisons. 100%.   Just remove the 16 walls at the bottom and 4 from the top. Also put the highest HP building you have in place of the bottom tower.   Base 2.   Farms HBM H. No troops or garrisons. 100%.

CastleClash,3d878u,Don_Thuglayo,0,Tue Jul 14 07:55:47 2015 UTC,"My personal philosophy. I prefer to actually try and defend my base. My vaults are always full unless I just cleared out a Merchant, and I get 100%'d within seconds of going offline.  Also, something I've noticed is that you seem to lose less resources when you have full defenses. If you have 4 million in your vaults then they may ""steal"" 1 million, but you only actually lose a small fraction of that. When you roll over and beg for a shield you always lose the full million.  Ninja edit: As you can see from the screenshot, even with barely any gold I still have no trouble getting a 10 hour shield."

CastleClash,3d878u,Grassii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:45:13 2015 UTC,Are you accounting for the resources that are currently built up in your mines? Because that's included in the 25% resources taken from your base.
CastleClash,3d878u,FatFed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:59:10 2015 UTC,"When you have a 4 corners deathbox like my HBM J base, people will plink at your mines/vaults and do about 8% damage before leaving.  When you have a corner design, like my HBM Q base, people will wipe out your external buildings and if your heroes are still alive they just quit, resulting in a 2 hour shield.  My design dissuades people from plinking at the corners and incentivises the use of magic. When they drop magic people are more inclined to complete an attack. The results speak for themselves; my base is virtually always 100%'d by the first attack. There are no annoying nibbles, only serious customers.    Edit: Just realised what you were replying to, so my initial comment was on a bit of a tangent. I am talking about seeing on the envelope that somebody stole 1 million gold and mana; but then my resources literally haven't deminished, the vaults are still at capacity."
CastleClash,3d878u,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:29 2015 UTC,Resources are so easy to get I prefer a full shield or at least my heroes alive before boss the resource loss is not as big as say Coc I. Can easily get 1M from a single raid maybe you're lower might so that might be it
CastleClash,3d878u,Don_Thuglayo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"You can literally see my might in the screenshots, without the backhanded insult.

CastleClash,3d878u,shlam16,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that too, but have super weak defense and always remove my heroes from my bases for easy 100% for attacker.

CastleClash,3d0110,bfeldman24,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:33:57 2015 UTC,"I did actually, rolled 7k of them and got only elites and ordinary, that's how i ended up with a full party of elite heroes actually. What I was hoping to know is what are expediotions, how do merits work, what are the dungeons(not the normal ones) and challenges. It seems a lot was added since last I played and I haven't found a guide to tell me what is good and what to do."
CastleClash,3d0110,Miner_Guyer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, so on the top left border of your map, there should be a sign. Those are ""missions"" and you can complete them to get bonus honor badges (you'll need A LOT later on) and books. Just below that should be a portal looking thing, and when you tap on it a dragon and another symbol should appear. The dragon one is HBM (Here Be Monsters) use it to get shards, and save up those shards to get Thunder God, a good early legendary hero.  On the top right is a bridge to a portal, but you need 10k might for that.  Above the sign I talked about earlier there is another portal. There are two modes, mesa and WG (Wretched Gorge). Don't bother doing WG, because you team would be nowhere strong enough to help. You may not have enough might for mesa I (I forget if there's a cutoff) but there are four people that work together to defeat a boss, and you get a box with random rewards, including merits. Expidition is a mode in your arena altar where you attack random bases with your heroes and nothing else, but you can take up to 15 at a time. You are rewarded in honor badges and merits. Basically do all these and save up gems to roll more heros, and make sure you always have at least 300 gems, because one of the quests is rerolling a heros talent, which costs 300 gems. There's no real consensus about what to buy with merits, if I were you I would save up to buy shard pack III until you have enough for TG (Thunger God).  I think this covers everything, feel free to ask more questions."

I have 3k might currently and for what i played so far i think that's a little too much for my current party configuration because it's really hard to do most of anything, fun though.  I've seen TG beeing recommended as a first by multiple ppl, but by the time i get the necessary shards I might have enough merit to buy the legendary hero card. I just want one legendeary dude to start things off because I am noticing a considerable difference between legendary and non-legendary heroes.  On that note, how can I earn merit fast because I noticed out of the blue I have 2k of those without doing more than 2-3 expeditions?  Cheers for the info!"
CastleClash,3d0110,Don_Thuglayo,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"Expeditions will be a disappointing grind for you (I imagine) with those heroes. Just keep doing them every day, as many as you can. You'll slowly accumulate enough to buy whatever you want. Always keep at least 300 merits though, so if you find the free reroll thing in your Warehouse you can afford it!"

Spending 200+ gems to buy a little bit of gold/mana is brutal and leaves you with a knot in your stomach. Buying time in LR actually gives you some proper game time as well as the chance for more events and therefore more good resources.    One that really bummed me out recently was dungeon refresh. I waited for 19 minutes 59 seconds so that I could do my 6th dungeon as part of the quest boards, and in my impatience trying to rush it - the timer hadn't properly reset yet and I instinctively accepted the popup, spending 100 gems on 5 bloody dungeons."

CastleClash,3crdrc,ntropi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"FYI, I've noticed a pretty easy way to waste a lot of gems while upgrading, especially with walls. When you spend gold it ticks down your gold balance instead of immediately dropping to the new value. If you try and make a second transaction while your gold is still ticking down it will allow you, even if your gold balance is insufficient. It spends your gems to cover the insufficient cost, and it doesn't warn you or ask permission. I lost around 1400 gems last week because of this.  At least that is my best guess as to why it happened, I'm unwilling to try and repeat the process to confirm, as it wastes a lot of gems. I put in a support ticket and IGG's response was essentially fuck you you're free to play."

CastleClash,3co26l,ntropi,0,Thu Jul 9 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"Nice guide , but I am going to add something about Snowzilla here, most of the players do not understand this, but Snowzilla is actually the highest dps hero in Storm Mesas, and here is why:  When the damage cap is at 35k and everyone hits that cap rather easily, Snowzilla 's Snowball fight allows you to deliver an attack once every .5 seconds, thus making him the highest single target dps in the game.  Plus if you put Slow Down and Deadly Strike on him, it makes you deliver up to 35% extra normal attacks.  This is a must have hero in MESAs.  Some will argue that Santa Boom does more dps overall than Snowzilla, yes, on paper that is the case with 20 ticks of the Firework Bazooka on a single target over 7 Seconds is more than one every .5 seconds, however Firework Bazooka is random and doesn't fire on the target that you are currently attacking, this can increase the chance that your whole team can be stunned again by the boss if you do not beat that timer with focus fire.  On top of that, unless you have multiple Santa Booms and can afford to Slow Down / Deadly Strike one, you are not going to be getting that 35% extra normal attack, thus making your dps actually lower than Snowzilla.  Snowzilla is the best dps hero to have in storm MESAs, if you join a random MESA you can often tell how good your team is with the count of snowzillas in the group.  I use Snowzilla for this reason as well in here be demons, when that reduced damage boss needs to be dpsed down as fast as we can, without Snowzilla sometimes I run into the problem of not being able to one shot that boss."

CastleClash,3cpvii,WakeAndVape,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks!"
CastleClash,3cpvii,nerdrake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:43:39 2015 UTC,Good point. I've been doing J for awhile now so Aries is just part of the HBM lineup in my head.
CastleClash,3cpvii,nerdrake,3,Thu Jul 9 21:19:46 2015 UTC,That's the five I would use. When you get a 6th base I'd throw Immo on it if you haven't rolled someone better but I don't think you need him in addition to Vlad. I don't have Orks so I can't say if he's better than TG overall. My opinion of him is very high from LR and Mesa and I would love him for expert dungeons.   Join a guild. The rewards are really helpful.

CastleClash,3ckomh,ThePremed,2,Wed Jul 8 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"I went from 40k to 60k in about a month. Loving every second of it. The Arena bonus has taken me from dropping in and out of top 10,000 to permanently under 5,000. The Expedition bonus gets me ~15k HB daily from there alone, as well as ~800 merits. The quest rewards are great. The raiding is easy.  It's really not hard. Take all your dupes to 80 and inscribe them to their cap. Then start working on them 1 or 2 at a time and take them to 100 and up their inscriptions again. Rinse and repeat. Wasn't difficult at all and hasn't been detrimental in one single way. I'm considering if I have the motivation to work towards 80k now. I want to, but it won't be so easy."

CastleClash,3cmal0,FatFed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"He's great for clearing out heroes when there's nothing in army camps, but SM clears entire bases more quickly."
CastleClash,3cmal0,shlam16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:53 2015 UTC,"In my opinion GR is better. SM does too much damage. Most bases will be 4 corner designs and if you drop SM his missiles will shoot all over the place and hit everything (likely missing the heroes in the process). This will unbalance your attack if you drop one hero in each corner because SM will take out random buildings and make your heroes stagger into the centre. Same goes for Santa.  TG, GR, Aries, Cupid is a perfect 4 corner raiding setup."
CastleClash,3cmal0,Saftneger,2,Thu Jul 9 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"SM hits heroes only when there is no troops, so does GR though, but sm has more dmg and can hit 5-6 heroes in 1 proc with a low skill level. For Reaper to hit 5 he needs 7/10 and 6 9/10, thats why i said sm.  But reaper is better in hbm"
CastleClash,3cmal0,shlam16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:14:49 2015 UTC,"Okay. I don't have one, I am just basing this on what I see during HBM J. I do it with no troops and out of his 9 missiles he might hit 2-3 heroes but the other 6 hit buildings. I figured it would be the same if you owned one."

CastleClash,3cmal0,Captkornnutz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:13:24 2015 UTC,You should make 30-40 troops and stick them in each corner... SM won't kill your heroes ever again in HBM J.

Before I rolled Aries I had trouble with J sometimes even with camps of gaurdians and farmed N. Now I just need to get my TH up so I can start doing O."

Santa Boom has the most dps out of your heroes, so he should be in almost all game modes as well, but he really needs to be 7/10 skill or higher to really start shinning for your team.  I went with Grizzly Reaper, because he is ranged, attacks rather fast, and can heal himself, if you have Sprint on him it'd make up for his deficiency in speed.  Aries just has the longest range of all of the heroes, and within HBM (which most players would consider the most important game mode), it's all about having a ranged hero.  Does not really matter that he's got 7 seconds of cooldown as most of the time you are only going to proc once any wave."
CastleClash,3ce6c6,Wesvaroth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:32:55 2015 UTC,"PD, Druid, SB, Cupid are mainstays. Then you'll likely want to rotate between the rest depending on the mode.

CastleClash,3ce6c6,piffle213,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"PD, Cupid, Druid, SB are obvious.  Immo you have to use for HBM until you roll a Vlad period end of story.  The sixth I would use Aries as even tho he is merely solid in HBM he is completely mandatory in arena/LR/HBD."

I'd literally never cared about HBM2, the guaranteed shards and EXP of J were all I focused on because I've been getting my PD and Cupid to 180 and 9/10. Last night on a whim I decided to see what I could do so I designed a corner base and I smashed O and P first time, then I got stupidly unlucky on Q when an AC eliminated my entire team. Got the shits and went back to P and beat it another 3 times without losing. Could probably beat Q, it seemed easy enough until one of my heroes derped over the wall and let the AC proc before the rest of my team came over and decided to kill themselves."

CastleClash,3ccexz,shlam16,2,Mon Jul 6 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Well Champ should be in your boss lineup also. His 3 second stun is crucial when you don't have a Cupid.

CastleClash,3cbcav,Captkornnutz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"He locks down other heroes skills.  He is the superstar for arena and LR.  Basically where you want to use him he is the top hero for those modes and where you don't want to use him he is still solid (HBM).  Even if you had ever hero in the game you would still use Aries a lot, but you would almost never use GR.  I use my reaper only to run torches and even in doing that Aries might be better."
CastleClash,3cbqpl,NedStarky51,3,Mon Jul 6 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is painful to look at all the incredible talents you have ... and then see you don't have PD, Cupid, Vlad, Aries. 5/5 revite on a ninja?! Ugh.  You should stop rolling for talents and only focus on heroes. You at least want the holy trinity of PD, Cupid, and Vlad ... and I imagine an Aries would also benefit you. Then you need to pray to whatever god you believe in that IGG actually follows through with their plan to allow talents to be switched between heroes.  Outside of that, I don't have some of the heroes you have (DK, Pixie) so my advice might not be spot on. In terms of which heroes to use, it will likely depend on what mode you're playing. Start with SB and Druid and rotate the next 4 around them. DK, Siren, Pixie, GR, and TG are all possibilities. You might benefit from an Immo for HBM as well, but I'm not sure if Siren can reasonably replace him (someone else might be able to chime in here).  In terms of whose skill to level up ... you want Druid to 5/10 so he can heal all 6 heroes (assuming you have 6 hero bases; if not, work toward that as your #1 goal). Then get the other heroes you are using on a regular basis to 5/10 ... and then either SB to 7/10 or save your shards in case you do roll a PD / Cupid.  Speaking of shards, make sure you are in a guild so you can be doing torch battles (and boss fights). Don't skimp on doing dungeons, they are an underrated source of shards. And, of course, make sure your Mesa/HBM are never capped."
CastleClash,3cbqpl,piffle213,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Fixed my typo - I have SM not SB :(   Just got the SM (as well as the DK, SZ, AC, Siren, and Pixies- I've been tryin for PD! lol) and leveled him up for Mesa. I am mostly using Druid, SM, SZ, DK, and GR for all except for Boss which I use AC, Champ, Druid, SM, and Succy. I tired using TB for more stunning and while would generally last longer, DPM was less and I kill the boss faster with the other setup (~15 minutes).  I have stopped rolling talents after some recent reading. All those lower guys are new and have their born with talents! But I definitely have wasted too much on talents for some and just been unlucky with the key Heros (I can't tell you how many druids and pallies I consumed).  So with the way the game works now, I should not consume my lower Heros correct? I am farming HBM G but I really struggle with whatever the other challenge is called (the one that sends a ton of Heros). I am up to L5, but can only farm L3 consistently and even then it depends on who I get.  Currently building lvl 16 TH. hmm, just looking at wikia, I think I'm doing it wrong lol..., working my way up but 6th Hero will be a while and also need to slowly work my hero bases up too (@5/6).   Edit: Yup - confirmed I'm doing it wrong. Need more resource buildings up to lvl 16...This will take awhile.  I've pretty much given up on Arena. I have trouble clearing more than R2 expedition. I have to use magic to consistently clear a Raid without skipping a bunch of bases.  Thanks again!"

It is easy enough to get revive crests and that is all VD needs. He pops back to life and insta-heals to full health with a simple 1/5 revive. For this reason I consider damage dealing talents like WG best for him.  It's a shame you don't have many other options. I'm looking at Druid I guess."

(Would have never predicted that would work, simulation said it would be almost as many attacks as my usual setup, it was right.) It actually predicts Cupid 1 would work, but I don't have a cupid at level 1.   The major outstanding question I have, if you think of a way to figure this out: how does CC handle attacks where haste is lost. I.e. if I'm supposed to attack every 600 ms with 3 stacks, and 800 ms with 2 stacks, and 400ms after my swing a stack expires, when do I attack? 600ms after that swing (i.e. the timer is set for next swing when I swing) or 800 ms after (i.e. the timer checks my haste and time since last swing)."

Sure some of it are easy, like say is 5/5 Revitalize better than 1/5 Bladshell?  But most of the questions today involves really marginal improvements, like say is 5/5 Bulwark better than 4/5 War God on a Vlad?  How about 5/5 Bulwark vs 4/5 Berserk on a Destroyer?  It's impossible to answer that properly without knowing what comps they use, what game mode they want to focus on, and what crest sets they are using to supplement that main talent.  Not to mention that most of these questions came after a lot of money rolling on it, so it's even tougher when you make a mistake.  I remember one of my biggest blunders was after reading Vlad Dracula 's preview I told several close friends that it looked terrible on paper and that Immortep was much better. Not knowing that when they released it about the 100% chance to hit on first proc, it was quite a humbling experience."

Very important is that you do all dungeons possible means do 5 dungeons in a row set a timer on your phone and come back after 1 hour 40 mins and do more.

CastleClash,3c5d13,Geldo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"I was able to perma stun boss 3 with 6/10 PD and just TG and champion. You tank with your PD, drop all your heroes on one side and then you have to drop your champion a little bit away from the boss so his proc is timed right when TG's stun ends. It was really tricky timing but after I did it a few times I could do it pretty reliably. It's much easier with 7/10 PD"
CastleClash,3c5d13,zakazak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:42:15 2015 UTC,I try getting some heavy blow crests. Besides that I can survive 3 mins with pd 7/9 + 3/5 zerk and champ (no tg).
CastleClash,3c5d13,nerdrake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:18:04 2015 UTC,I have 7/10 PD and Cupid and I tank with PD and almost keep boss 3 stunned with just champ. He occasionally gets off attacks but never more than one proc and my team tanks that no problem and Druid heals. I don't like having to time my hero drops and Cupid will mess up your sequence because everyone goes at the same time.
CastleClash,3c47lh,Daggaroth,2,Sat Jul 4 16:48:35 2015 UTC,Reviving heroes in Mesa seems like a pretty big help - that's the biggest benefit I see.

CastleClash,3c4gvj,HarryKeogh,2,Sat Jul 4 18:13:27 2015 UTC,IIRC most of the top 20 gem buyers events winners are spending ~$300 which is honestly probably cheaper than trying to win her rolling.  I recently friended a guy with Molt and it's been a huge help against the LR boss.
CastleClash,3c4gvj,nerdrake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:12:23 2015 UTC,Can you see the top 20 as you spend money? Or is it more of a blind auction?

I just added the top 10 ranked players and use their OP teams. Really there are only 3 which you need. 27355 (or something like that), Mistereon, and Nadal(something). Between them you can beat any demon type. I only use 3 heroes and place them on the back rank so the demon aggro's them first and lets their 5/5 revites proc before the demon can build any sort of attack against my team."

CastleClash,3c0fi8,shlam16,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't even notice Ork in the list. He is another hero that has his uses, but many endgame players simply don't bother with him. He is great in Mesa 4, expert dungeons, and stun Demon - due to being resistant to coma and providing heals to the team while they are stunned; but aside from that he doesn't get used too much. I would say to keep him leveled too, but you won't progress very far if you are leveling like 10 people at once.  I'd say you should garrison OB, DK, Pixie, Aries/GR while doing HBM so they all slowly level up - and use your books from quests to speed level your main team."

Use TG for raids, so keep him leveled also.    SZ is essentially useless. His DPS is pretty meaningless when literally everything can be done without it. DK is a good tank and hits hard, so I suppose you could keep him leveled too - but you don't really need him."

CastleClash,3bxdvx,shlam16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:16 2015 UTC,I didn't think there would be. I farm J or N with ease but O just doesn't work. I've beaten it once. I'm almost done with the 6th base so be able to work on TH very soon. The jump from J/N to O is crazy.
CastleClash,3bxdvx,nerdrake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:17:06 2015 UTC,If you can babysit a Succubus through the first 4 waves then it can be a game changer because there is no damage cap on the boss. You can knock off like a third of his health in a single hit. Also if you can babysit the bombs then they will kill the boss because they take off 10% of health regardless of total HP. Finally you should use Slowdown crests on as many heroes as you can.

CastleClash,3bx581,shlam16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:09:47 2015 UTC,Buy Immo unless you roll Vlad. If you do roll Vlad then don't even bother with Immo because he becomes useless - buy GR in that case and get rid of the Siren.
CastleClash,3bva6m,iamsecond,4,Thu Jul 2 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the nice format. I'd place it on Druid. It's a great talent for PD too, but you might want revite or berserk later instead. It's also better than LD on Vlad, but not by much, and I think it would do the most good on Druid."

CastleClash,3bva6m,stickbo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"There is, not sure what it is, but I imagine 36k is enough to run 4. Keep in mind, total might is only representative of all your troops where mesa and lr might is a real world representation of your used troops. You may have a stronger main 6 than someone who has 50k might. When you go to form team in lr or mesa, you will see a might there. For mesa 4, around 6k is what most shoot for. I would be interested to know what yours is. I know some have said they wouldn't run with you during to your week cupid, but I would. Your pd is far more valuable than the cupid in mesa. Chances are everyone will have a cupid anyway."
CastleClash,3bva6m,shlam16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your posts! Was able to successfully do mesa 4 these past few days. Mesa might is around 5.5k right now, but that's because I'm using a new Orksbane (level 130 and just 2/10). Could raise it easily but just doesn't seem necessary yet so saving shards for Cupid. No issues finding a group to run with and it's almost always a win with 3 or 4 PDs."
CastleClash,3bva6m,stickbo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Probably can't get matches in Mesa 4 very easily. The PD looks good, but when you check team might and see it to be far too low for a team of 9* heroes then you become suspicious and question just how many low level heroes will die in the initial assault which may cause you to lose in the end.  I've become very picky with my SM4 matches. I used to just run with any 3/4 PD groups, but now I have a bunch of requirements and I will quit if most of them aren't met:   Might ~>6,000. I always get suspicious when I see a high level PD and their team might is was lower than it should be;  At least 3 PD's; At least one SB;  At least 1-2 other ranged killers (Aries, SM, GR);  The person in the bottom square of the middle of the map doesn't have heroes at the bottom of their setup, because they get pulled down to the 5/5 Scatter Immo/Cupid and killed. Unless they have crazy high might, I won't run with teams in any other corner except for the bottom or right. I hate teams going to the top because Mino almost always gets a proc off and people die - game over. I will always quit if they go left (revite PD).   This might seem OTT, but even with this I still lose about 1/5. Mesa 4 is too easy to lose, and I value the merits, so I don't like losing because people don't understand any of the above.   Never takes me more than a couple of minutes to find a match.    So all of this is to say; I would probably quit if I saw OP's team because their might would be ~5000 with those 6* and 7* heroes in the mix."
CastleClash,3bva6m,piffle213,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"Could be. I would think that with his pd,cupid, Aries, immo and druid his might has to be close to 6k though. I agree with you. 6k is my minimum too, but on my smurf my hero's are as follows Pd 8* 160 7/9  Cupid 154 7/9 Santa 158 6/9 Orks 153 6/9 Aries 155 7/9 All insp over 80 but I don't know if it counts that.   And my might is 6146. I just figured that he had to be close to that or maybe a little lower, his crazy low cupid does hurt him. On ios I notice a lot of people try to get carried in mesa 4 vs Android for whatever reason, but even then I find it much easier to find good randoms on mesa 4 vs 3."

CastleClash,3bvdgm,JLSMC,3,Thu Jul 2 13:35:54 2015 UTC,I'd put it on AC. Doesn't look like an improvement and definitely not a long-term talent for any of your main heroes.  I say AC > a random because at least you might use AC sometimes for expeditions? Otherwise doesn't seem to matter to me. I like Frost Witch's HB talent more than FG too.

But with that said, I'd recommend Vlad unless PD dies often. If PD does often then upgrade him first, you need him to stay alive while Vlad can keep himself alive with his proc. But if PD doesn't die often, level up Vlad for the extra damage / extra self heals. He's a beast!"
CastleClash,3bv4pb,iamsecond,2,Thu Jul 2 13:10:15 2015 UTC,Pduke's already 7-star.    He's already 7 star. I'd go with Vlad and then Druid.

My heroes can't even beat E with the clover, yet they farm F 100% with no garrisons (or inscriptions) using this base.  If you don't have Vlad you probably won't be able to beat that high, but this should provide you the best possible results.   Edit: Added the fact that my heroes can do this without inscriptions.

CastleClash,3brg1v,boredguy8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Vlad advice is correct. As far as talent focus: not many talents really matter. WG, Bulwark, Revit. Your priority for revit is Aries.   Skills: you need to get your cupid up and your PD to 8. That will be a huge improvement in game quality for you."
CastleClash,3brg1v,Captkornnutz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"You should focus on your top 6 or so for now if you are running short on HB.  Vlad, Druid, Cupid, PD, WL, GR, and TG if you go 7.  You just got the best talent for Vlad.  PD will want zerk 4 or higher or revit 5.  Druid's best talent is zerk 4+ altho technically revive 5 with 5/5 zerk crests would be best due to crest stats but lets be honest you're not getting 5/5 zerk crest set this decade.  Cupid revit 4 or 5 depending on if you have revit 5's on other heroes.  WL revit 5.  GR attacks fast but moves slow so you want LD, sprint, or scatter on him, a combo of 2 of those between crests and talent is great.  I prefer WG on TG but others like zerk since he has no cd, your call.  Leave druid at 5/10.  Get the rest to 7/10 then get PD to 8, cupid to 9 and leave them both there while getting your damage dealers to 10/10."

But 7 doesn't do a ton b/c even at 4 stacks, you're only at 400ms.   At 8/10, though! 45% haste means that if you have zerk 2+ and have an external source of energy (cupid), you reach 200ms atk, at which point you self-sustain 4 stacks. 8/10 is a huge jump, and it's where you can leave your PD for quite a while."

CastleClash,3br42f,zakazak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"**Credit to /u/boredguy8 for creating this, I only modified the framework he created.  I made a modification to the code by /u/boredguy8 to single out the effects of different levels of Celebrate and Zerk.  https://repl.it/utY/16  This runs a 60 second simulation of PD attacking with no outside influence, for all combinations of Celebrate skill level and Berserk level, and displays the number of total attacks achieved in that time span."
CastleClash,3br42f,Macrado,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool. Here I look at a more real-world situation: Cupid level 7 thrown into the mix. You can really see why people emphasize the importance of Cupid. And the impact level 8 PD has on the game. Though there may be a bug, I'll have to look into it: higher zerk is coming out with fewer attacks.  Skill 8 Zerk 0 Attacks: 112 Skill 8 Zerk 1 Attacks: 112 Skill 8 Zerk 2 Attacks: 227 Skill 8 Zerk 3 Attacks: 248 Skill 8 Zerk 4 Attacks: 250 Skill 8 Zerk 5 Attacks: 250 Skill 9 Zerk 0 Attacks: 199 Skill 9 Zerk 1 Attacks: 199 Skill 9 Zerk 2 Attacks: 248 Skill 9 Zerk 3 Attacks: 248 Skill 9 Zerk 4 Attacks: 236 Skill 9 Zerk 5 Attacks: 236   OK I took a look at things in way too much detail and those numbers are right. 4 and 5 zerk at PD 9 actually hurts you. The easiest place to see this is around the 13 second mark. With Zerk 3, PD gets a huge energy boost from Cupid at 13.8 seconds: he goes from 60 energy and 3 stacks (last proc at 12.2) to 100 energy from Cupid's proc & he procs again at 14.2 seconds, giving him 4 stacks. He briefly loses them, but goes back to 4 and sustains it from 16.2 seconds onwards.   Zerk 4, the proc timing with Cupid is way off, and he actually doesn't get down to 200ms in the first 17.4 seconds. For instance, PD has full energy from his swing at 13.2 seconds, when Cupid procs at the same time. He doesn't get to use any of that bonus energy: instead, his swing at 13.6 seconds blows all the energy he built up and the energy from Cupid, basically making Cupid's proc pointless."
CastleClash,3br42f,boredguy8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, man.  In a truly real-world scenario, the timing would probably get messed up somewhere when someone rushes ahead and gets more hits in, or gets hit, etc, but this is the kind of analysis I love to see."
CastleClash,3br42f,Macrado,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah this mostly applies to boss.   Also, I realized I had a bug when thinking about my code last night in bed lol. The cupid code won't buff any cupids with energy, when it should buff anyone not that cupid. So the code in that section should read:  if self.name[:5] == ""Cupid"":     for hero in heroArray:         if hero != self:             hero.addEnergy(arrow[self.skillLevel])       Also, tangentially, you should get used to camelCase variable names for variables, reserve capitalizing the first letter for class declarations. Hence: ""Hero"" = hero class. heroArray, heroLevel, &c = variables."

Do you want us to confirm your opinions or are you looking for ppl here to talk you out of it?  What's the point of this?  I'm not sure what to tell you if you're having trouble raiding.  Most ppl leave their loot outside their walls.  At 60K might I can fill my storages just raiding with troops if I really wanted to.  There have been times doing the quest board that all my main heroes died and I had to complete raids with lvl 40 dupes and have not had trouble with it.

I have more than half the gem only heroes, and 34 legendaries total. 79,000 might. Two of my heroes are 9/10. I've found PD on both my main and on one of my smurfs.  Paying money won't make your account significantly better or more fun. It's good that you haven't spent money. I'm having a hard time understanding how you could not have found better heroes and at least a PD on any of your accounts in two years. Unless you haven't really been playing regularly in that time.

I think the reason it has gone under the radar right now is because people don't understand how to make it work. This is understandable, I know before I learnt python I would have thought this was gibberish too.  Anyone has any questions about how to make it work let me know. The instructions in the script are pretty clear and if you follow them then it will work just fine."
CastleClash,3bogw8,shlam16,2,Wed Jul 1 10:50:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'll also answer questions. I made it as clear as I could - it didn't seem like asking for input was the best way to do things, but I may change that.   So far all the testing me and one other person have done shows correct output based on weird edge cases we had calculated before. It can also be (relatively) easily modified to answer some more esoteric questions (like: could you hit 5 stacks against boss with Molt + scatter team, with PD tanking, and no cupid? (answer: yes)).   Obviously this works as an 'ideal' (aka mostly boss fights) but does help answer key questions (and esoteric ones - ex: 4 PDs level 2 can hit 200ms at 14 seconds, and keep it permanently at 15.8 seconds).  Anyway, if you find anything weird, any edge cases, or have any questions, let me know.  Edit: since I saw you in another thread, you might find this spreadsheet helpful. It's less awesome than the simulator b/c some things may seem clear that really aren't, but it's helpful."
CastleClash,3bogw8,shlam16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't realise you were the creator. I've made a few small changes myself, such as changing the length from 30 seconds and seeing what can happen in 10 and 15 seconds because that is how long most Arena/LR fights go for. Also just adding all of the different attack speed heroes (GR, Ninja, Vlad, Mino, AC).  One thing it would be great to see is how many procs each hero achieves in the given timeframe. My python skills weren't good enough to write this is - though if it is an easy thing for you to code in I think it would be good to know."
CastleClash,3bogw8,shlam16,2,Wed Jul 1 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"I just left the time decently long mostly b/c boss fights and to see any weirdness (there is some - for instance, if two PDs are together and one is getting more energy, it can actually take longer to reach full stacks). You can always scroll up to see the state of things at any given time. Also, LR boss doesn't stun (for me) so...yeah. OK give me a few minutes to add a total number of procs count.  edit: Oh haha you saved over my version 12 times ;) anyway, here's the version with proc count output: https://repl.it/utY/13"

CastleClash,3bnlxd,shlam16,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"Cupid is (mostly) useless at 10/10. 9/10 is the magic level. At 9, his proc raises the energy bar of allies by 55. The energy bar fills up at 100, leaving 45 empty. 45 takes 3 attacks by the heroes to fill up.   At 10/10 he raises the energy by 65, leaving 35 remaining. It still takes 3 attacks by the heroes to fill 35 energy (with 10 going to waste), meaning 10/10 is only occasionally more useful than 9/10 (such as being attacked by a group of troops). For high level players this is pretty rare.  No idea how you can conceivably think Santa is ""not so much"" of a solid choice. He and Vlad are the correct answers for the first 2 to level up."
CastleClash,3bnlxd,spacitybowler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"With Santa I was reading it as just increasing damage from 600% to 690%, which doesn't seem that helpful.

CastleClash,3bnlxd,Saftneger,-5,Tue Jun 30 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"Cupid is the obvious first choice for 10/10. PD is next, and Vlad and Molt are probably also very much worth it. Santa and Mino after that maybe.   Ignore people who say cupid or PD aren't worth it for 10/10. They don't understand the game."
CastleClash,3bnlxd,Nerdy_McNerd,-2,Wed Jul 1 01:07:12 2015 UTC,"You are dumb, learn to do the math, cupid will not proc sooner, pd wont hit speedcap sooner or with less procs = useless to level, best choice is probably moltanica then vlad"
CastleClash,3bnlxd,Duality_Of_Reality,2,Wed Jul 1 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'm really tired of you on this sub. You are a constant source of negativity. And you are often wrong, as is the case here.   Cupid will help to proc sooner at 10/10, but that isn't why leveling his skill is so important. At 10/10 he will give 65 energy, and with 3 attacks that will become 110 energy. After activating a proc there will be 10 energy left over. The game mechanics will allow up to 10 energy to carry over after a proc, so the additional energy from a 10/10 cupid will be used. But that is not why he is so strong. The extra 10% bonus to everyone's attack is what makes him so strong at 10/10. This affects everyones normal and proc attacks. It is a huge effect.   Similarly with PD, his extra 5% attack bonus is huge. It lasts for 8 seconds and will stack with itself. Since it affects the whole team and works on all attacks, not just proc damage, it is way more beneficial than bringing a dps hero like Vlad or Santa up to 10/10.  Edit: Ah, so I was mistaken about the 10 energy carry-over. That mechanic was described in the wiki, but it has since been removed/updated."

I don't do arena almost at all (trying to maintain my rank at top 100k just for 60 HB an hour), so I find LD on him a much better talent, especially in HBD and LR generally, since he loves taking that agro and his survivability increases a lot with that LD (he heals 1.4k at 40 insrc and 100 level). I'm leaning on SB since his proc is really important for me (higher proc damage = better HBM), I can only farm H right now, so I thought that by increasing SB survivability and damage would be more helpful at this moment.

CastleClash,3bmc8e,nerdrake,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:37:21 2015 UTC,I would switch TG in for raiding over Immo.

CastleClash,3bmc8e,nerdrake,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:23:34 2015 UTC,TG is a beast in LR because his skill doesn't have a cooldown and often hits all the enemies. I have Santa and Cupid and extra ranged firepower is really nice to have on raids. My Immo has sat in a tower waiting for a 6th base.

CastleClash,3bj4n8,FMarkassa,5,Mon Jun 29 17:26:40 2015 UTC,Dear god no... and save your gems until you have 2k then only spend in 2k increments during an uncover the treasures event.
CastleClash,3bj4n8,Captkornnutz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:45 2015 UTC,By far the best way to spend gems.
CastleClash,3bj4n8,levyl44,2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"At 950 gems ur chances of getting treantaur are about .....1 in 1000? Do whatever you feel will increase your odds but they are so low to begin with that I wouldn't expect to get one. If you are expecting one you are likely going to be disappointed.  As a side note... especially for rookie players missing heroes like molt, cupid, pd, orksbane... I would wait until an event that gives you chest rolls for SPENDING gems. They typically hand out 1 chest roll per 2000 gems so try to spend in 2000 gem increments during those events.  PS: don't listen to the joker telling u to power level your town hall with gems. He's likely just trolling you. Never use a substantial amount of gems to shorten building upgrade times. It's not worth it. You'll get there eventually."

CastleClash,3bj4n8,Don_Thuglayo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:11 2015 UTC,Yea like others have said save for 2k event and roll then so if you don't get anything at least you get a chest draw
CastleClash,3bj4n8,brightinly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:14:20 2015 UTC,I would use them as fast as possible as long as there's the 2k gem event.  That way you don't have another useless hero with a chance to roll.

CastleClash,3bj4n8,harborhound,-8,Tue Jun 30 14:00:26 2015 UTC,Yes but not to roll for treantaur. Save gems and power your town hall from 20 to 21 then start on gold vaults

CastleClash,3bj4n8,harborhound,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:39:39 2015 UTC,Not never. My main 6 were 180 capped so I gemmed up townhall to 21 ans gold vaults so I could uncap. Would do again.

CastleClash,3bj4n8,Don_Thuglayo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:18:30 2015 UTC,once you are later in the game and feel you have a good team (i have pd vlad santa cupid druid reaper/pixie as 6th) i would think about using gems for other things since im not likely going to get molt from 2k event and using gems in other ways still counts for 2k event anyways

CastleClash,3bie6u,pussehmagnet,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"You do meet the requirements, however, you need to develop your PD - skill and level.  Fortunately, we can help you do that by joining us in daily Mesa4 runs.  That will give you plenty of Essence and Shards to grow your PD's talent to a more desirable 6/10 or 7/10.  You will struggle on Boss fights, because I don't think you can Perma-Stun the boss based on your current team.  You need a PD & Cupid combination, and they have to be around 6/10 before your Champ can start perma-stunning.  This means you will not be able to get max rewards out of Boss3 fights.  We have a couple of members who are in the same boat, but they were willing to lose on some Honor Badges in order to be in with us and maximize their shard earnings.  Our boss fight only lasts about 3 minutes, so you'll get whatever damage you can do in that time.  So, the decision is yours.  If you wish to join, apply and will approve you in.

If you wish to dig further, you need to calculate L.D.'s benefit over a set period of attack time, for example, over 12 seconds.  You can then do this:  [0.03] * [Hero HP (including inscription)] * [12,000(ms)] / [Hero ATK speed (ms) ]  Compare the results for different heroes.  The one that yields the highest number, will be collecting the highest benefit from L.D. 3/5.  If a hero has Berserk, include that in the ATK speed.  For other levels of L.D, replace the 0.03 with 0.01 for 1/5 LD, 0.02 for 2/5 L.D., 0.04 for 4/5 L.D. and 0.05 for 5/5 L.D."

Don't mess these up by throwing extra buildings in there or some shit.   You've invested too much into PD. You need a stronger druid, and stronger AoE (area of effect) heroes. Put more into skilling Pain-da, Druid and Reaper. Also, buy an Engineer and replace your succubus with him. Eventually you will want a TG and Immo. Spend all of your gems on hero rolls (after getting 5 builders). I ended up never getting Immo on my main since I rolled some good alternatives.

CastleClash,3bbqo8,Vezko,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"i have no idea but maybe someone will jump in that has tried the new ones our so far but here is a post from the CC forums  his is my review and evaluation of the new talent Corrode and a question on what you all think about the new talent Condemnation. Was fortunate to have rolled both 5/5, played with one, undecided on the other.  Just so evryone knows the stats: 5/5 Corrode- Has a 16% Chance to reduce the Energy of 3 enemies by 50 when attacked. No Cool down.  5/5 Condemnation- Has a 20% Chance to reduce the ATK SPD of 4 enemies for 4 secs when attacked. Cool down= 2 secs . So! I rolled a 5/5 Corrode the day of the update, and after much debate and contemplation, i made the call to put it on my Mino. Suffice it to say, I am incredibly impressed so far! I was extremely skeptical about the new passive debuffing talents, but after seeing Corrode in action, they r much more valuable and useful than they appear. I am so happy with it on my Mino as well, Corrode combined with his skill both reducing enemy energy at an extremely high frequency is fantastic! I have 3/5 Revite crest set on him as well.  I just rolled a 5/5 Condemnation yesterday and have yet to make a decision on which hero i should put it on! I was wondering if anyone else has had a little experience with using it or just an opinion in general and share any insight on which heroes you believe would be best with it! Thank you!!"

If boss comes far away and the first hero that walks first to attack him will be targeted, thats why u need ranged heroes on the outsides, this hero will probably be druid and boss will target him, the boss will die before he gets around the walls and hits druid.
