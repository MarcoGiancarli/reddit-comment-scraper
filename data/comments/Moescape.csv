In this picture, while the character does take up a decent amount of room, she is clearly not the focus. She is as much a part of the scene as the chairs, counter, shelves, and window. She doesn't ""pop"". She's layered in with everything else. And I think it's a perfectly fine piece for /r/Moescape.  Source"

You do have +17 votes from me though if that matters.  Also, ordinary reddit users can draw too lol. There are drawing novelty accounts and /u/Firez_hn, someone who works way too hard modding /r/vocaloid, is getting to be okayish at it.    could you elaborate and explore this statement for me?   https://www.reddit.com/r/Moescape/comments/30emjw/library_original_7241024_xpost_rkemonomimi/cpsseak  Following that discussion I posted a bunch of pics that I feel represent the type of content the sub was made for (or at least the type of content I subscribed for) and was told to hammertime.

Connected to the Harmony module's sides are Kibo and Columbus, the Japanese and European labs respectively. The other robotic arm thingy is Dextre, a multipurpose attachment for the Canadarm2, it's attached to the Destiny module, which is the US lab. The partially visible black module at the edge of the pic is a Shuttle docking port which is itself attached to the Unity module, a connector module."

Moescape,360taq,SauceHunt,-2,Fri May 15 03:57:59 2015 UTC,Why's he riding a girl's bike?
Moescape,360taq,Levy_Wilson,2,Fri May 15 05:57:41 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like a girl's bike?  It could be red The guy could like pink, hell I like pink. Is the basket an indication of bike gender? They're pretty useful I'd imagine. It could've once been red but it could have faded to a pink."
Moescape,360taq,Luy22,2,Fri May 15 12:51:42 2015 UTC,"The position of the frame's bars indicates gender. A bike designed specifically for women will have the bars between the steering column and the seat lower, so to allow the rider to wear a skirt while riding the bike. Here's a unisex bicycle. And here is a women's bicycle.  I've been shopping for bikes recently. I was surprised they made bikes specifically for women too."

Moescape,360taq,Luy22,2,Fri May 15 12:59:12 2015 UTC,"It could very well be her bike too.  I'd like a basket for my bike, biking with a bag of catfood  wrapped around one handle is pretty unbalancing."

This somewhat larger version is a bit better but not much.  The whole background is a giant tease :(  Having said that, I try to upvote every submission where a character doesn't take up 3/4ths of the damn picture and makes it look like a random /awwnime pic, so have an upvote.  edit: and the sub looks pretty interesting too, I'll subscribe to it, thanks for the mention."
