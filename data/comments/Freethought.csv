So now Hobby Lobby (and any other privately owned company/organization by fewer than 5 majority members) can negotiate for contraception-free health care package for its employees, only for the insurance company to later go around to all the business's employees individually and give them contraception for free.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a national healthcare system kind of guy, but did this decision come with free blindfolds for the owners of Hobby Lobby? I never really understood the original ruling in the first place - I'm of the opinion that if you operate in a public space and engage in a public service, regardless if you're privately or publicly owned, then you're responsible for maintaining the operation in a way that acts in the interests of the public. And since health and safety are a public issue, I don't see how you can pick and choose what federally mandated health related services you can offer to your employees. It's one thing for an employee to not wear a hard hat due to a religious belief, it's another for a company to deny hard hats to all employees due to the same belief.  Of course I'm also of the opinion that there shouldn't be religious exemption for vaccination, so that probably shows a bit more of my bias. Also, I digress...  What I was trying to say, this whole thing seems rather silly. Business owners now get to stand on some moral high ground and stick their heads in the sand while their employees still get free contraceptives anyway.  While I'm on the subject, it feels a little weird that a SCOTUS ruling was so easily side stepped anyway, like sort of a trumped up health care laundering."

There is overwhelming evidence that the scripture they claim is so noble, is in constant contradiction with itself and riddled with hypocrisy.    Interpret that how you want.  But it at least indicates that Christians are exceptionally good at compartmentalizing logic and critical thinking skill.  The inability to be generally skeptical in nature is a skill that inoculates people from propaganda.  Religious messages are propaganda.  Advertising messages are propaganda.  Consumerism is driven by the ability to easily influence others, often despite the lack of evidence of the claim.  In the context of the Duck Dynasty people, we are talking about fundamentalist evangelicals, who don't believe in evolution and interpret the old testament more literally, so I think they're even less rational.   Perhaps it was a mistake to use the term ""Christians"" in general when we're only talking about 40% of Christians, but the same argument about lack of critical thinking can be applied to Catholics to a lesser but equally-significant degree.

The government has no business being in the marriage business at all.  If 4 guys and 2 girls or 6 guys and a goat want to call themselves married I am fine with it.  The problem comes in when the government uses their power to promote one over the other.  The real solution would be for the government not to recognize any marriage at all.  Let people incorporate their relationship if they want.  This way any 2 or more people in a group could call themselves married and then sign a contract with each other that could be used for legal matters.   So if one person wanted to leave the group the contract would handle that.   Just like a corporation.  Get the government out of our lives.  That is where all the problems come from.   If a Christian wants to look at two gay people who got married and say I don't recognize that marriage let them.   Since there would be no legal definition of the word at all every group could define it as they wished.  But to tell a Chaplin to disregard what his rule book says is just silly.  If the government gets to tell Chaplains what god says than it is better off to just get rid of the Chaplin service.    BTW.  I do not believe in a god but I can read and have read the bible. It is pretty clear.

You are not allowed to proselytize or discriminate against protected classes. Mikey Weinstein is correct in this regard. By chaplains actively discriminating against LGB members, it causes a rift within the unit. It is against good order and discipline and I agree, they need to shut up or get out of the military."

Why is it that the ""new comers"" aren't the ones causing the rift? Why must people change their traditional, established belifes for the benefit of a supposed ""protected class"" that has only existed for a few decades if that. Why must they change their view on traditions that have been around for a mellina just for the sake of people and ideas that have been around for far less.  Also, fuck this ""protected class"" bullshit. How Orwellian. ""All humans are equal, but some are more equal than others"", really?"
Freethought,3cp1lz,NigsAndJews-BadNews,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Because personal beliefs should remain personal. A uniformed member acts as an official party of the government. Since the government defines race, religion, and now sexuality as a protected class within the organization, any member must also follow those laws. They don't have to change their personal views, they're only required to keep them quiet while in the workplace.  Furthermore, protected classes aren't about ""some are more equal than others,"" it's making everyone equal. You can't discriminate based on race, which includes all races. It's not just protecting blacks or Asians, it's everyone. And now your sexual preference is also defined as equal."

On the same note just because beliefs are new does not make them any more valid.  Ancient traditions, as arbitrary as they may seem to our modern eyes, have withstood the test of time and been vetted by past generations. Precedence is a powerful aid in guiding us yet there seems to be a lot of people like you out there who have no problem declaring that previous generations were wrong or incorrect in their beliefs."
Freethought,3cp1lz,NigsAndJews-BadNews,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:24 2015 UTC,I never argued that an idea is more valid because it's new. That would be just as fallacious as appealing to tradition.  Example... Being gay wasn't a big deal in the times of ancient Rome but those values were established when Catholic religion became the supreme power over society. They had no issue declaring that what had been vetted by previous generations was wrong.  Things are constantly in a state of change. We look back and reflect on the past because we can use the lessons that only time and a removed perspective can provide.
Freethought,3cp1lz,Dystaxia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"I never argued that an idea is more valid because it's new. That would be just as fallacious as appealing to tradition.   On one hand I agree that 'appealing to tradition' is the easy way out and that certainly is a factor in some discussions. However, it should carry more weight against new ideas because of the fact that those ideas have survived the test of time. I'll invoke Dawkin's idea of a meme in its' original meaning. Ideas (memes) are subject to natural selection just like genes. Ideas and genes that have managed to survive over a millennia would likely be robust and noteworthy. Of course no idea, just as no gene, stays exactly the same through the generations. It changes little by little. The problem I have is that change is happening to rapidly that we are losing are barrings and moral compass.   Being gay wasn't a big deal in the times of ancient Rome but those values were established when Catholic religion became the supreme power over society.   This isn't quite the case and context needs to be added. Homosexuality wasn't tolerated as we know it today. Even I admit I do not fully understand their logic but they viewed sexual relations between older men and young boys as permissible. Probably in the same sense that slavery was permissible. Grown men were not having sexual relations with each other. It's important to make this distinction because it's not like the Roman's had ""enlightened"" view on sexual relations, only to be oppressed and suppressed by the Catholic church.   Things are constantly in a state of change. We look back and reflect on the past because we can use the lessons that only time and a removed perspective can provide.   I agree with this statement but I feel that change should be organic. Survival is hard for any creature and any challenge to precedent must be shown to be able to survive on it's own and it must have organic support, otherwise it will fail - it would be artificial. With so much noise it's difficult to truly craft one's own opinion these days. There's paid shills, PACs and ""super"" PACs, media, political organizations, ""electioneering"" organizations, etc, etc all with an agenda. An agenda to spur change but by artificial (e.g., non-organic) means."

Because I'm evidently very bored at work, here's an example to show what I mean. Let's say you are drawing two samples from the same population with the same mean and the same variance, which can be done for example in R:   boxplot(rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=100), rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=100))   You'll get a plot that looks like what you see in this article.

I'm reading a book series that, while I don't agree with all of its premises, has given me a different outlook on this whole STEM discussion that reddit loves.  The author takes the case of Rudy, in which an aspiring football player puts thousands of hours of effort into something he's obviously not good at, all for the chance to be put in for one single play in a game with a foregone conclusion. And he was treated as a hero, both in the movie and in real life, simply because, in the end, he did something he was overall pretty shit at. Imagine if he'd dedicated all that time and energy to something he had actual natural talent in.  So we find ourselves in a time and culture in which some people tell us, ""Do what you love!"" and other people tell us, ""Do something productive for society!"" More and more, though, I'm thinking, ""Do what you're good at, whether it's fine art, math, science, or grammar."" It seems like a nice middle ground. if you're doing something you're good at, you're more likely to both enjoy it and use it to be productive. We spend so much time in our society improving our weaknesses and ignoring our strengths that people lose sight of the positive areas of their talent."

As much as Victoria is loved, this reaction is not all a result of her departure: there is a feeling among many of the moderators of reddit that the admins do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits, which they feel is expressed by, among other things, the lack of communication between them and the admins, and their disregard of the thousands of mods who keep reddit's communities going.  Let's tackle this idea...  On the one hand you have a company that owns the site.  They in effect can do whatever they want with it.   On the other hand, the value of the site is directly associated with the content and community that is created by the users.  How does this conflict reconcile itself in this new age of social media where the content creaters may be, in effect, serfs, doing the work but not getting enough recognition, not getting any profit-sharing, not getting as much cooperation from the owners as they may feel is necessary?  Facebook is also heavily suffering from this problem right now.  People have abandoned their traditional web sites they control, in favor of creating communities that are conjoined with larger systems where the traffic is, but they're also losing control, losing revenue, and losing respect?  Thoughts?  Comments?"

All we can do is ban people, it's an often blunt instrument which not at all helpful at times.   So in part, one reason why mods come off so draconian is because of the limited, ineffective tools the site owners make available.  That being said, people love drama.  I predict more mods are going to resist the administrations call to go back to normal because they've already ordered popcorn and it hasn't been delivered yet.  There's a very valuable discussion to be addressed here, which is where does the equity and responsibility and respect line drawn with web sites that are mainly valuable because of user-created content?   It's not just a line between the owners and the users, but the owners, mods and users.  Mods do a good bit of the heavy-lifting to make the communities work, but users seem to think it's all about them.

Not really sure what is so terrible about that, it's just one aspect of the site and for all we know it's for a good reason while they find a replacement.

If it's a management issue in the defaults or something than that sucks, but I'm on Reddit for the smaller specific subs which are well managed outside whatever drama is going on elsewhere. Most of my favorite subs are still open because no one seems to know why we should care.   I guess that's the crux of it for me. Why should I care about a temporary close in AMA when I barely go there? Other people are making the website unusable for a lot of people who it doesn't seem to affect. It feels like mods are shooting themselves in the foot. Why do other subs claim it matters? There's all this talk about administrative missmanagement but I haven't really seen anything substantial. Even the firing of whoever it is, doesn't feel like a big deal because we don't even know why she was fired. For all we know it was the best possible move.

If they cannot provide the tools to help make that content happen and respect their suppliers then they have shown they do not understand their own business model.  Add go this a CEO who has shown she is more about control and power than the business and you have a recipe for a disaster.  This firing was simply another symptom of the problem.  I really think the community should put up a list of demands and a timeframe to have them met.  If they are ignored or no effort is made to correct the issues, I think the community should shut Reddit down.  My personal opinion is that there are two major demands that need to be met.  1) New CEO.  Give Reddit 30 days to get a new CEO who actually understands the model they have.  2) Fix the moderators tools.  You have 4 months to fix the tools to make moderating easier.  Can't do it then you do not deserve the loyalty and hits from your users.  There may be more issue that need to be addressed, but those 2 would be a great step and show the community is serious about their actions."
Freethought,3bxx5e,RhomboidStorm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:08:21 2015 UTC,"Reddit needs to come to grips with the fact that they do not control Reddit.    Let's qualify that.  They [The owners] do control Reddit.  They can turn it on or off.  They can ban whatever they want.  They can monetize whatever they want.  The users make Reddit worth visiting.  So control does rest with the owners, but value rests with the users.    I think you underestimate the degree of control Reddit could have employed to shut down any and all dissent.   The primary way the community interacts is through a system they exclusively control.  If they wanted to silence all debate or dissent, they could have done that.  I think the fact that they didn't (completely) is less a testimony to their respect for the community as it is an indication of how technologically-inept they are in managing the system they own and control.  It is true the users have made Reddit what it is, and ironically, perhaps one reason why it's continued to do well even though it's been taken over by a corporate entity, is because this entity is in-effect, ""old school"" and doesn't understand the playing field.  This is also why (according to reports) Conde Nast has not been able to effectively monetize the platform.  They're an old-school publishing company with significantly less exeperience in interactive media.  They create content, they push content out the door.  Wash. Rinse. Repeat.   That's not how Reddit works.   It's almost as if they're scared and afraid of what they've got with Reddit and how to manage it.  That's worked out ok as long as they didn't mess with it, but now they're starting to mess with it.   And there's no telling which direction it will go, but if history is any indication, when a company that doesn't understand the Internet and social media takes over a venture like Reddit, it's often a disaster.  There's obviously a power stuggle but the people with the real power are the owners.  The users are essentially an amorphous blob of people who are not easy to wrangle and control.     My personal opinion is that there are two major demands that need to be met.  1) New CEO. Give Reddit 30 days to get a new CEO who actually understands the model they have.   This ""changing of the guard"" IMO is merely symbolic.  It's a symbol of the modern expectation that a hollow change of that nature will reflect a fundamental policy change.    Kind of like how we expect every new president to magically, instantly undermine all the bad things their predecessor has done.  Nice idea in theory, but I'm skeptical it means anything major.  I guess it could be a symbol that within corporate someone can be held personally accountable, but again my skepticism is that these large entities tend to operate under their own momentum which is less-directed by any single figurehead than by their generic corporate-like nature.   2) Fix the moderators tools. You have 4 months to fix the tools to make moderating easier. Can't do it then you do not deserve the loyalty and hits from your users.   I'm all about this.  Although I wouldn't even give them four months.  I'd give them 60 days tops.    It's going to be interesting to see what happens.  My prediction is, not a whole lot is going to happen.    Imagine if you will this as a perspective scenario at Conde Nast.... a meeting is called between executives and admins.   They discuss what went wrong -- they can do this one of two ways...   a) they can discuss it from the perspective of how they pissed off their users and how to avoid doing that  or  b) they can discuss it from the perspective of how do they control pissed off users?     Given the fact that the community is calling for the CEO to step down, assuming the CEO and other people still have power, what is the most likely way they'll react?   If someone is calling for their heads, are they more interested in making sure those people (who are basically an amorphous blob) are happy, or sedated?   My guess is b.     So what we may see is a big change in Reddit, but not the change people wanted.  And since this is all technology-based there are plenty of technical solutions they can apply that can nip future upheavals in the bud.  We may see positive change.  We may also see a major expansion in admin tools to stop future outbreaks like this.  So I would suggest the users of Reddit be very careful what they wish for.   The current CEO has demonstrated she's relatively inept at managing the site, which has resulted in the users and mods running everything.   It's entirely possible a new CEO won't make that mistake, and will step into the position with a newfound desire to make sure there is no question over who has what control over the site, and who can post what, and who can ask who to leave..."
Freethought,3bxx5e,MarioneTTe-Doll,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:56:55 2015 UTC,"When I said Reddit Corporation does not control Reddit, I was not referring to it in the literal sense.  They can force the subreddits back on, edit posts and do whatever they like, but the fact remains that in doing so they drive away the very people who actually did the work.  These are not employees that they can threaten to fire and replace.  They cannot simply bully a community into towing the corporate line.  The administrators actually do none of the work that drives traffic to the site, with the exception of the AMA person, which is what started this.  The corporation does not control what the users do.  they do not control what they moderators do.   They support the community which, in turn, drives the monetary compensation for the corporation.  Without the people doing the posting and moderation, Reddit is a useless pile of 1's and 0's on some corporate server.  In that very real sense, Reddit corporation does not control the site, they only support the community.  As far as the CEO, it is more than symbolic in this case.  She came in and immediately made changes that thumbed Reddit's nose at the community.  IF they choose another CEO who does the same thing, it shows that they do not understand, or simply do not care, about the community.  I suggested 4 months because I know that these projects can take time.  So far they have ignored the needed changes, but that does not mean that they could simply put them in place over night.  30 days would not be enough time to actually put any meaningful steps in place, but 4 months should be enough to put all the required features into action and test them.  If they cannot do it in 4 months then they are simply not willing to and it would show that do not deserve the community.  By placing it at 30 days, you give them a valid of excuse of ""we simply did not have enough time to do it right"", which they could draw out.  To make a decision on that scale you have to give them enough rope to either hang themselves or pull themselves up.  Hindering them only hurts the bargaining position as they will use the unrealistic demands as an excuse as to why it was not done or not done right."

They cannot simply bully a community into towing the corporate line.   I think that's a bit dramatic of a characterization.  I don't see the company ""bullying"" anybody.  They have interests to protect that are different from the needs and interests of their users.  There will always be conflict:  You have people who want: a) unrestricted stuff  b) for free c) as much control and autonomy and respect as possible, but you also have a corporate entity that has bills to pay and a need to justify the expense of operating the resources the people use, while also limiting their liabilities.  There will never be a solution that makes everybody happy.  I've noticed an increasing trend of Redditors anthropomorphizing corporations as if they are people with feelings and intent, and that they should be empathetic to their users, yadda yadda.  It sounds nice in theory, but in the end, corporations only have one primary mandate: create value for shareholders.  If that jives with keeping the community happy, then it all works out.  But that's not always a rule of thumb, especially if you have a monopoly or gigantic market share with no serious competition (see: Comcast, Clear Channel, Microsoft, AT&T, Wal-Mart, Facebook, Google, Paypal and eBay).    In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there's plays in force now to try and sell off Reddit to somebody like Microsoft or Google.   If they cannot do it in 4 months then they are simply not willing to and it would show that do not deserve the community. By placing it at 30 days, you give them a valid of excuse of ""we simply did not have enough time to do it right"", which they could draw out.   I'm curious who's going to be in charge of holding them accountable?

Freethought,3bxx5e,Kayge,2,Sat Jul 4 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"You are right, corporations don't have feelings, but the people running the company do.  The spat about corporations feeling or acting in a certain way is simply an analogy to represent the management's direction attitudes and actions.  It is not meant to be literal.  And bullying is not over dramatic.  Subreddits are being take down that they don't like and others are left up that violate the same supposed rule, but happen to be what the CEO wants.  This is very much an attempt to bully the community.    I also want to point out that the idea that corporation's only mandate is to create value to shareholders is wrong.  Originally corporations were only created to do projects that normal companies could not do, and had an obligation to the community. From the history or corporations   Initially, the privilege of incorporation was granted selectively to enable activities that benefited the public, such as construction of roads or canals. Enabling shareholders to profit was seen as a means to that end. The states also imposed conditions (some of which remain on the books, though unused) like these*:   Corporate charters (licenses to exist) were granted for a limited time and could be revoked promptly for violating laws. Corporations could engage only in activities necessary to fulfill their chartered purpose. Corporations could not own stock in other corporations nor own any property that was not essential to fulfilling their chartered purpose. Corporations were often terminated if they exceeded their authority or caused public harm. Owners and managers were responsible for criminal acts committed on the job. Corporations could not make any political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making.   It is also horrible business sense to force a company to look at short-term gains over long-term profits.  If Reddit wants to survive, or even sell the company, then they need to make a stable community.  Reddit has chosen to rely on the community as their business model.  Without it, Reddit does not exist in any real sense, and certainly not as a profitable business.  A manufacturing business does not smash their equipment with hammers and wonder why it's broken and not making them money.  The management at Reddit doesn't seem to understand this.  The only reason Reddit has gotten to this place is because the community was open.  You change that piece of the equation and it would be like Porsche making small 2L hatchbacks suddenly.  It is not what the business was known for or what the customer want.  If they sell it to Comcast or Microsoft, it was be the death nail because neither of those companies knows how to deal with communities.  Who would be in charge of holding Reddit accountable?  Most likely the people who need the tools the most, the moderators.  They are the ones who do the work and need the tools.  They can decide after that time if they want to stay of just say screw it.  However, if they cannot deliver the tools in a reasonable amount of time, they are not going to.  It would likely be a shutdown entirely.  Moderators of the major subreddits would simply stop doing anything.  They don't have to go private, they just have to let the noise build to a level that they become unusable.  Users would begin to post garbage and mess with voting as protest.  Without moderation, the effect would snowball and be un-redeemable within a few weeks.  Reddit doesn't have the manpower or the skills to manage all those subreddits, especially without proper mod tools.  Simply stopping automod bot may be enough to tip the scale, I don't know.  What I do know is that the users don't need to do anything.  The mods are the ones hurting and asking and they are the ones that have the power to let Reddit live or die."

A noble endeavor that in no way represents the way modern companies operate. Case in point: Google and eBay make assloads of money and have never given (AFAIK) their shareholders dividends.  There's a new breed of corporation that isn't about rewarding investors in the company or the traditional model, but only profiting at the expense of someone else, and inflating company value so that key people within can cash out like bandits.

From what I can gather, they feel that gay people are still equally protected because they can still have a heterosexual marriage.  Being attracted to the same sex is a ""choice"" and if straight people don't have that right, they shouldn't expect to either.  They seem to deny it being an equivalent biological attraction.  There's also a point about heterosexual marriage being ""natural"", and that there's a biological imperative for men and women to conceive and raise their own biological children long term.  They conveniently leave out that many couples can't have children or decide not to have children, the possibilities of surrogacy, etc.  They also say that it's not their job to legislate from the bench, that they are putting words into the constitution.  But the majority opinion is also  incorporating the precedent of Loving v. Virginia, which was unanimous.  So yeah, pretty disappointing.  I can't help but think they're acting on judeo-christian beliefs no matter how they try to dress it up with inaccurate and irrelevant quotes about ""natural"" human behavior."

Freethought,3b7093,IrishPrime,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"Help me out, then? Because IANAL, but I'm generally pretty good at recognizing and discarding my biases to play devil's advocate, and I had a really difficult time following the reasoning in either Roberts' or Scalia's dissents (other than Scalia's complaint that the wording in the majority opinion was far too fanciful).  I'm just going to go through the first bit of Roberts' dissent. I understand that you're time is valuable and you don't really need to argue with a layperson about this, but the opening of Roberts' dissent just bothered me greatly and seemed pretty irrational and full of mistakes.  I understand that there's no constitutional basis for marriage, but going by Roberts' assertion that it's an institution that has held humanity together for millennia, and his obvious support of the concept of marriage, I don't understand how he justifies the rest of his position.   But this Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. -Chief Justice Roberts   I'm with him here. I understand where he's coming from and see no problems with this statement.   And a State’s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. -Chief Justice Roberts   States get to define marriage. Okay, got it. Except he goes on to say ""every culture throughout human history,"" ignoring all the places in which marriage has been expanded to include same sex couples.   The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition. -Chief Justice Roberts   And earlier...   Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. -Chief Justice Roberts   Again, the first part makes sense by itself. But Section 1 of the 14th Amendment ends with, ""nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Marriage provides several protections (both legal and financial) to couples who choose to enter into it, but these bans deny same-sex couples these protections by prohibiting them from having the option to enter a marriage.  I will admit, that when I make the case for marriage equality in debate, this isn't the thing I focus on, but it strikes me as a great and compelling position when arguing for the constitutionality of same sex marriage (or the prohibition thereof). The entire challenge was that the bans were unconstitutional, per the 14th Amendment.   Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a butt over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept. -Chief Justice Roberts   Except that it already has popular support nationwide, and continues to gain support.   Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer. -Chief Justice Roberts   Again, it seems to me like he just completely missed the entire case as it was presented. The court was asked to settle a legal dispute about whether states could ban some people from getting married or not, and he's acting like the court was asked to pass legislation redefining marriage to the oh so horrible kind that the majority of people support and which treats all citizens equally and fairly.  It appears, to me, to be a simultaneous misunderstanding on his part of what was actually happening in the court room, why the case was brought, what was being argued about, and how society at large views the issue. He goes on to demonstrate a gross misunderstanding of history, anthropology, and the fact that procreation and marriage are two totally independent actions.  If you think I've mischaracterized his dissent, I'd love to know where, so that I might argue against it more effectively in the future. If you don't have time, I totally understand. I didn't plan on writing nearly so much when I first sat down.  TL;DR: My understanding of the case, majority opinion, and dissent is (roughly) as follows:   The term ""marriage"" was not well defined, legally. Many states amended their constitutions to clearly define marriage in a legal context. Lawsuits were filed claiming that these definitions of marriage were unconstitutional (the definitions themselves, not the process of defining marriage). The majority opinion was, ""They're right. You can't just define marriage in a way that is, by definition, discriminatory."" The dissents were, ""No, they totally can. Our understanding of marriage has been discriminatory for a long time and should continue to be."""
Freethought,3b7093,mrpithecanthropus,2,Sat Jun 27 08:49:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is a bad summary, although Roberts does stress the following additional points:   There is nothing specific in the Constitution that specifically addresses issues concerning marriage. He does not think it possible that a right to marry can be implied in the Constitution either.  Precedent shows that only rights that are fundamental can be implied (which is pretty ironic, if you think about it - if a right is so fundamental then you'd think it would be express) The court should be extremely cautious about ""discovering"" fundamental rights in these circumstances where to do so would cut across democratic processes whereby decisions can be made by the people So, on the face of it, marriage is a state issue and the states are free to define it as they see fit through their legislatures."

Freethought,3b37df,mepper,36,Thu Jun 25 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"I just transcribed it.  Edit: Hyperlinked most sources.   Hello friends! I've just traded my seven year old daughter for a goat.  You see, I've been living, as we all do, in accordance with traditional marriage rules going back thousands of years. That's why I've been girding my loins to stone any bride who isn't a virgin, going dates on ghosts, and why I was recently fired for kissing my wife in public...just as it's been for thousands of years.  But wait, what was marriage traditionally? What is the real definition of traditional marriage? Well, I'm glad you asked. Let's go back 4,000 years to Mesopotamia where the laws around marriage were close to the laws around slavery. As with slavery, Hammurabi's code specified how wives should be paid for, who owned the children, and even the terms for getting a refund on your spouse. So that's a nice tradition.  But then the Bible had to come along and redefine everything. Traditional marriage in the Bible is pretty polygamous. Abraham had three wives (or at least two wives and a slave he had sex with). Caleb had five. David had 18. Moses: Just two. And King Solomon had 1,000 wives (although to be fair, 300 were concubines). The Bible's rules about marriage are very clear: Rape victims must marry their rapists; if a woman's husband dies, she has to marry his brother even if he's already married to somebody else; interracial marriage is strictly forbidden; and if you marry a woman who turns out to not be a virgin, you have to stone her to death. Really, the whole Old Testament makes marriage seem like it's more trouble than it's worth, which probably explains the advice in 1 Cor 7:28 which is essentially ""dude just never get married.""  In ancient Rome, it was considered gross for husbands and wives to be in love. According to the Stoic Seneca, nothing is more impure than loving one's wife as if she was a mistress. And Plutarch called it disgraceful when a senator was caught kissing his wife in public. He was removed from office over the scandal.  So that's what traditional marriage looked like...except maybe not, because it kept changing.  Early church officials were pretty opposed to marriage. St Jerome wrote around the year 400, ""We must never be in the bondage of wedlock for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray."" Jerome surrounded himself with a circle of women who had taken a vow of virginity and wrote letters to them about what they should wear.  Around 500, Emperor Justinian redefined marriage again with the Corpus Juris. Under those rules, fathers could give away their daughters when they turned seven; Christians couldn't marry Jews; and a husband was allowed to beat his wife, but if he did, he had to pay her afterwards.  So that was traditional marriage...for a while, until it changed again.  Around the 13th century, the Catholic Church decided to get into the wedding business and made marriage a sacrament. Pope Alexander redefined marriage to be an agreement between spouses instead of their parents.  But it still wasn't great for women.  In the 15th century, Bernard of Siena told parishioners to cool it with all the wife beating and they should treat their wives with as much mercy as they would a chicken or a pig. And Martin Luther wrote that he gave his wife a box on the ear whenever she was ""saucy.""  Ok, so traditional marriage was basically treating women like a punching bag. Actually no, it was much worse.  In 1736, jurist Sir Matthew Hale wrote in [The History of the Pleas of the Crown,"" that a husband cannot be guilty of raping his wife since a wife had given up herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract.  By the 1700s, marriage had been redefined over and over and over. But the one thing it had almost never been was something you do with somebody you love. The advice in the 1700s was to marry someone you could learn to tolerate, thereby anticipating the Kramdens by several centuries.  If you wanted to get married in colonial America, all you had to do is say you were married...as long as you were white. Slaves still had to get permission from their masters. As for women, the very being and legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, wrote William Blackstone. The very being, Blackstone literally thought women ceased to be when they marry...tradition! Former slaves were finally able to marry after the Civil War. And in the late 1800s, South Carolina became the first state to rule that men were no longer allowed to beat their wives. It wasn't until 1920 -- less than a hundred years ago -- that wife beating was outlawed nationwide. These changes were radical redefinitions of traditional marriage, and they were redefinitions for the better. As a society improves and the people in the society improve, those people improve marriage.  It was in the 1920s that people started marrying more for love than for property. The term for it at the time was ""love marriage"" and people were fascinated by this new idea that you could be in love with the person you marry and you might not be allowed to beat them up. This was all coinciding with suffrage, improved economic mobility, and a stronger society in general, so it was no surprise that marriage grew stronger as well. And yet, there was still resistance. Conservatives at the time said this new definition of marriage would completely destroy the institution by the end of the 20 century.  And there were still more changes coming.  It wasn't until 1967 that the Supreme Court overturned bans on interracial marriage in Loving v Virginia. At the time, states justified those interracial marriage bans by claiming that they were, you guessed it, ""traditional."" They also claimed the Bible justified the bans and that interracial marriage was an attack on religious freedom. One judge even wrote, ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay, and red and he placed them on separate continents. And, but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriage. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.""  In 1971, the Supreme Court overturned laws dictating that when a husband and wife have a legal dispute, males must be preferred to females. The young attorney who argued that case, by the way, was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who may understand better than anyone else on the Supreme Court why it's OK, and sometimes necessary, for marriage to change.  It wasn't until 1979 that states got rid of head and master laws which said that a husband can do whatever he wants with his wife's property. And until 1993 -- 1993! -- it was legal for a man to rape his wife in some states. If you want to be technical, outlawing spousal rape was a radical redefinition of marriage going back thousands of years. Because remember, marriage is one man and one woman, enslaved, not in love, polygamous, married to a rapist or your brother in law, or never married, with a seven year old girl, beaten as you would a chicken or a pig whenever she's saucy, barely tolerated with no being or legal existence, and definitely not a different ethnicity. And we didn't even talk about non-Western cultures where marriage has developed in even more definitions.  Look, marriage has been a lot of things. But when you get down to it, it has always been an agreement between people. And as people strive to improve themselves -- to become a more fair and just society -- the marriages that they formed improved with them.  So today, you might only have one spouse. You might even be in love and you might be a union of equals. These are experimental changes to the traditions of marriage. It wasn't long ago that women were treated like property and people of color weren't even considered human. As society learned from those mistakes, people updated the rules of marriage.  Even more recently, LGBTs were thought of as dangerous perverts unable to form real relationships. And now, people are changing marriage again as we realize the fundamentals of same-sex marriage are the same as straight relationships. Letting same-sex couples get married is actually completely traditional. It's part of the tradition of constantly improving the institution of marriage."

Before the Civil War tariffs were lower than they had been in previous decades, up to the point of the Morrill Tariff, which wasn't passed until after several southern states had seceded. It seems like they would have waited for the bill to pass before seceding if it was the reason. As for state's rights, the primary state right of concern seems to have been slavery. Was there another infringement of state's right brought up besides tax rates and slavery?  Actually, it seems like the formation of the Republican party strongly shows the cause for the war. The party formed after opposition to the Nebraska-Kansas Act as the first major party whose primary focus was abolition. Lincoln was the first Republican president and states started seceding between his election, where he was absent from the ballot in 10 southern states, and his inauguration.

And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.

One interesting point he did make was in the scenario of certain firearms becoming banned, their value would go up, and it makes sense that even if criminals had access, the cost to get these weapons would potentially make them unavailable to a significant chunk of people who might have access now."

You could say that the murder rate dropped by 50%, which might sound like a big deal, but if that 50% is the result of a drop from 2 murders to 1 murder then that isn't a very interesting statistic.

Nonetheless,  it still serves the purpose of ensuring a huge death toll (mostly citizens)  if an overthrow of the government was deemed necessary by the governed... And that alone might be enough to make it effective.  A government can't kill all of its subjects,  and the more that die fighting the government,  the less validity the government retains,  and the more it's power erodes.... So,  as a ""lemming""  attack,  guns vs helicopter gunships might work.   Other than that,  I live in Alaska,  and I legitimately need a rifle just to go walking around my farm.  I have had to shoot bears twice to cut short an attack,  so there's that. I can definitely say that I need my gun,  or I need to exterminate the bears,  one or the other.

If homicide had no regard for race whatsoever (ie., no perpetrator killed about the race of the victim, and no one was more likely to be a perpetrator or victim depending on their race), then the chart would look very different.  Around 80% of all homicides would be committed by whites, and of those, 10% would be committed by whites against blacks (around 8% of the total).  The actual percent is close to that, at 7.6%.  The rate of murders that are black-on-white would actually be the same, since 10% of murders would be committed by blacks and 80% of those would be committed against whites.  In reality, though, both the race of the victim and the race of the perpetrator do matter.  More homicides are committed by African Americans (who tend to live in high-crime, impoverished neighborhoods).  52.5% of murders are committed by African Americans, so you would expect the percent of black-on-white murders to be just over 41% of the total.  It is, in fact, 14%.  The fact that it's not that high likely reflects the segregation of both communities from each other.  With the rate of white-on-black homicide still sitting at around the same level as expected for a perfect population pool, though, it's actually higher than you would expect.  Since only 45.3% of homicides are committed by whites, the expected rate of white-on-black homicide would stand at roughly 4.5%, so less than two thirds of what it actually is not even considering that the same sort of neighborhood segregation that keeps the black-on-white crime rate lower than expected should do the opposite as well.  If you divide the rate of expected white-on-black homicide by the same factor separating the expected and observed rate of black-on-white homicide, you get an expected rate of 1.6%.  Again, the observed rate is 7.6%, significantly greater than expected.  When you consider that historical circumstances and present racism are behind the fact that African Americans tend to live in high crime areas with poor education and little economic activity, the statistics tell a very different story than the one that this blogger is going for.  Blacks are likely to live segregated from whites (hence the lower than expected murder rate), they're more likely to be involved in crimes of poverty because they live in poverty at higher rates, and they're still significantly more likely to be murdered by whites than would be expected while murdering whites at a lower than expected rate."

That was in the context of a hypothetical where neither rates of offense nor victimhood were linked to race. I specifically stated that it wasn't reflective of the real rate. The point was that, with the real rate being higher for African Americans and lower for whites (and with interracial homicides rarer than expected because of separate neighborhoods, schools, etc.) the percent of homicides that are white-on-black crimes is almost eight times higher than would be expected. Just knowing that is pretty much useless in figuring out how many of those crimes are racially motivated, but it does point out an important flaw in this blogger's interpretation of the data.  It's also important to consider the context for these problems if you want to see them solved. In general, the consensus is that higher rates of violence and crime are tied to circumstances linked to extreme historical discrimination and modern persisting racism.

They're useless if you don't account for population size, which you haven't done.  So assuming your percentages are correct based on data, 14% of black murders are black on white murders while 7.6% of white murders are white on black.  Blacks commit more murders per 100,000 in the population and are committing NEARLY DOUBLE the percentage of murders against whites than whites are against blacks.  The reality of the situation is that blacks are killing whites more than whites are killing blacks despite being only one sixth of the population compared to whites.   I think you're trying to make the point that blacks commit less murders against whites than we should expect based on how many blacks live near whites, but is that really the message we should be sending people?  ""Hey they don't kill as many as we thought they would."""
Freethought,3atis8,Titan5000,-2,Tue Jun 23 21:07:08 2015 UTC,Can you address your criticism toward anything specific in this article?
Freethought,3atis8,Xon,7,Tue Jun 23 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"There is a lot wrong in this article.   First, the FBI crime reports are voluntary reports. This means crime is under-reported, and seeing as how the vast majority of the US is white, it means crimes by whites are under-reported.1  Secondly, it's well known that crime against blacks is under-reported. So, that's another data point that will be unreliable.   Thirdly, the report relies on murder rates that actually suggest the opposite of what the author intends to communicate. The approximate murder rate for white on black is 5%, and for black on white it's 10% (of all homicides). The US population is 10% black and 80% white (I'm using 80% because the FBI crime report treats whites as including hispanics). Thus, we see that both races under-select victims outside their own race (compared to what we'd expect if murder was proportional to population). Instead, whites kill black at 1/2 the expected rate, and blacks kill white at 1/7 the expected rate. That's a pretty big difference, and suggests that white people are selecting black victims more readily that blacks select white victims.      Just to be clear on this, black communities are historically segregated. So in a random town of 100 people we'd expect to see 10 black people and ~80 white people, but instead we see something more like 2 black people and 90 white people. So of course we'll see a higher overall rate of black on white violence: white people are just less likely to run into black people. But on the same token, it also means that the expected rate of white on black violence would be lower. This means whites are probably killing blacks are close to the expected rate, while blacks are under-selecting white victims for homicide by a remarkable amount.    tl;dr: Using rates of crime is meaningless. It'd be like if an alien came down and killed humans, and you said the rate of alien victims is 100% human. It doesn't mean anything."
Freethought,3atis8,Titan5000,-4,Tue Jun 23 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"The FBI crime reports are based on convictions and arrests, not accusations.  You also can't discount crime rates in which areas are more racially heterogenous.  If areas are 90% white, then it is only obvious that there will be more white on white crime, not that it is under reported.  If it is a more equal mixture, you will see higher white on black and black on white crime. How is it well known?  Is this just speculative?  If it's reported as un-reported, is it then considered reported? I think you are confusing the statistics.  This inforgraphic might be beneficial.  The sources are included.  I will reluctantly concede to the argument that cross racial murders are equal given population size, assuming blacks make up 13% of the population, we can say whites make up 77% as per US census information, this means we would expect to have 6 times as many white deaths than black deaths, since there are about 6 times more of them.  However we see more than 10 times white deaths than black deaths.  I think the more startling number to look at is the number of deaths attributed to blacks in TOTAL.  Blacks generally are responsible for 40-60% of violent crimes, despite only making up 13% of the population.  Despite making up 77% of the population whites are killing other whites, only slight more than blacks are killing whites, and it seems that blacks are on a mission to exterminate their own race according to the numbers.  It's very troubling."
Freethought,3atis8,Xon,2,Tue Jun 23 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"My first point was that arrests and convictions are under-reported to the FBI. Because of structural factors, places under-reporting crime tend to be (a) non-urban, (b) small, (c) predominantly white. This is a criticism of the FBI's data gathering methodology, and I feel it impacts any argument made from that data. This point does concern reports of crime. Reports of crime against black people is under-reported, which means fewer opportunities to make arrests or convictions. There are also problems with relying on convictions and arrests because law enforcement tends to arrest white suspects less often, and juries convict them less often, even when the evidence presented to the juries is identical. One, Two, and if I can find the identical evidence study I will link that.  I think TudorGothicSerpent makes the original point quite clear.  The article ignores structural issues in favor of conjuring, from nearly whole cloth, a narrative based on violent crime rates.  Between 2001-2011 there were roughly 176k homicides, and 88k black victims, 80k white victims. White people are not dying at ten times the rate of black people.   6.   and it seems that blacks are on a mission to exterminate their own race according to the numbers. It's very troubling.    I'm afraid that comment betrays some racist tendencies, or a misplaced, almost Kipling-esque regard toward black people. There is a staggering amount of data about why some communities are violent, and that explain the homicide rate. These communities aren't out to exterminate themselves, they're trapped in cycles of poverty from which drug-dealing and violence become potential escape routes. Historical segregation has left them impoverished, and legislative response to these problems has been a ""war on crime"" and a focus on prosecution, not rebuilding communities."
Freethought,3atis8,Xon,-3,Tue Jun 23 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"Between 2001-2011 there were roughly 176k homicides, and 88k black victims, 80k white victims. White people are not dying at ten times the rate of black people.   But 50% of those homicides were committed by blacks, even though they make up 15% of the population. And an overwhelming majority of those black victims had black perpetrators.  Blacks in America disproportionately kill compared to whites. Fact.  Now we can most certainly mention that poverty is a big influence here - and more blacks suffer from poverty and dismal circumstances that push them to murder and crime. The War on Drugs is also a big influence here, as people in poverty tend to get pushed into the black market where many disputes end up being settled through violence.  But why do you have to twist every fact to fit one narrative? Why can't you accept a piece of evidence as is - even if it doesn't tell the whole story? (and no single fact tells the whole story)   I agree the article oversteps by saying this is proof that the ""racism narrative is false,"" but it still brings up some relevant evidence that I think we should be willing to accept and talk about, not just try and explain away.  When I first saw these statistics, I was very surprised. I think most people would be. The news puts a huge emphasis on white on black crime, and I would've never guessed that blacks actually commit a disproportionate amount of overall homicides."
Freethought,3atis8,Titan5000,4,Tue Jun 23 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm twisting the facts. I've criticized the facts and the basis the facts were found on.   But let's talk narrative, I'm happy to. Let's take your statement:   Blacks in America disproportionately kill compared to whites.   I assume, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that this statement is based on the premise that 10% of the population commits 50% of the homicides, while 80% of the population commits the other 50% of the homicides.   So I'll accept as true that, in proportion to the demographics, black people commit a disproportionate number of the killings.   But what if we asked about homicide in proportion to the % of the population in poverty? What about homicide in proportion to the % of historical wrongs committed against a group?   If you want to make an argument based on proportionality to the population in general, first you need to show that proportion is the proper comparison to use. Compared to population, nearly 3x more black families live in poverty than the population in general, and it's something like 4x the rate compared to white, non-hispanic families. 41% of black households rely on food stamps, compared to 11% for whites. (20% for the rest of the population).   Which proportion should we use? Which proportion properly measures injustice? And why? Violence is violence, but people are rarely engage in violence as an ends to itself. The problem with the article is that it doesn't explain or make any attempt to explain these rates of violence. Perhaps the reason, to go to the articles ultimate thesis, that the media covers white on black violence more than its proportion relative to total homicides is because white on black violence reflects systemic bias and prejudice, which has bubbled to the surface lately. The article simply doesn't address these possibilities, it assumes the truth of its underlying assumptions, and then uses crime data and proportionality to argue that the media coverage is biased. But I think the media coverage would be biased if it did give proportionate representation to homicide coverage and responses: black on white crime is unusual and does not generally reflect system racial disenfranchisement."
Freethought,3atis8,Xon,0,Tue Jun 23 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"But what if we asked about homicide in proportion to the % of the population in poverty? What about homicide in proportion to the % of historical wrongs committed against a group?    You can't subjectively account for something that is going to be measured objectively.  That's a flaw in your reasoning.  Poverty does not drive people to kill, it drives people to steal.  Trillions of dollars have been sunk into the war on poverty for decades, so the poverty argument is invalid.  America is the first civilized nation in history to abolish slavery, a concept which still exists in the world btw.  How about the wrongs committed by African people by selling their own people into slavery?  How about the black slave owners who made up roughly 30% of slave owners in the south?  How about the vast majority of white families who immigrated here AFTER the civil war?  The government has tried to correct these wrongs through affirmative action, welfare, EBT, and countless other methods to make reparations.  This argument is invalid.  The white population has more people in poverty that the entirety of the black population as a whole, yet its crime rate is still lower than blacks.  This has nothing to do with poverty, that's just a convenient scapegoat.  Black on white crime is not unusual, it is the second highest crime rate in America, yet it is ignored by the media to advance the narrative that white people are evil.  Even uttering that you are a proud, white man will get labeled you a racist."
Freethought,3atis8,Titan5000,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"Your comment:   Poverty does not drive people to kill   is objectively wrong. Since the 90s, at least, it's been understood that poverty and violent crime and deeply related, and that poverty increases the likelihood of violent crime. E.g. Hannon, et al., Racial Similarity in the Relationship between poverty and homicide rates: Comparing retransformed coefficients, (applying a new statistical method to examine poverty's affect on homicide rates); Hagedorn, Gang Violence in the Post Industrial Era, (describing the economic basis for homicides related to drug dealing, which make up a significant portion of homicides).  The USA was hardly the first country to abolish slavery. China did it between 1723 and 1730 (though the reforms eventually rolled back partially), Portugal did it in the 1700, England did it for England and Wales in the 1700s (the famous Summerset's Case), Russia did it in the 1700s (but retained serfdom), Haiti did it completely in 1804, Netherlands did it before 1850, Chile did it in 1823, Great Britain finished abolition by 1843 (when the last exceptions became part of the British Empire).  As far as I can find, that 30% of slave owners were black is a number pulled out of the air. If you have a source, please let me know so I can look at it. I haven't found any good data on the number of black slave owners. In 1830 the census indicated 3,777 free blacks owned slaves (according to Cecil Adams). They owned about 12,000 slaves, out of  2 million slaves identified by the census. That's 0.4% of all slaves. (12k/3m x 100). I honestly have no idea how accurate these numbers are, and I have reason to be skeptical, since Taylor, The Internal Enemy, points out that light-skinned blacks, often the offspring of white masters and black slave women, often inherited from the white estates (if they were light skinned enough).  Affirmative action and these other methods have not been particularly successful, but before you dismiss them, you should do some extensive reading about why. I'll give you a hint: start with histories of the United States after reconstruction, and how forces like Jim Crow basically reduced blacks back into slavery. For more modern reading, there are plenty of scholarly articles about the quite intentional legislated failure of these measures. There have never been reparations that even closely amount to the value of labor or the wrongdoings suffered by blacks.  Uttering that you're a proud, white man will not get you labeled as racist. But it should. Can't a person just be a proud person? Why do they have to be white? What the hell does color matter anyway? But, see, it's mainly just the racists who feel the need to affirm that they are proud and white.   You know why black people have affirmed that they're proud and black? It isn't racism. It's because white people, which I suspect includes you and I, have attempted to diminish them for their blackness for around 400 years, ever since European whites started the modern tradition of black slavery. A tradition that undeniably reached its cruelest and most exploitative stage in the southern United States. The end to slavery didn't end the diminishment of blackness, it just changed its character. White people erected a statue of one of slavery's ardent supports, Calhoun, in a public square. Are you religious? If you here's an analogy: imagine your religion has been oppressed for hundreds of years, and you're finally given theoretical legal equality, only to see a statue of one of your most dedicated opponents erected in front of a city hall, or a court house.   Black people have been forced to assert their racial identity because otherwise racist white Americans would have destroyed their dignity, and used it to enslave them again (which is exactly what happened in the wake of reconstruction. In some ways, it was worse, because the black population never received significant land grants, and those they did were largely rolled back by Congress. Thus, landless blacks were forced to work at subsistence wages for white landowners who mostly got all their property back).   But I digress. Deconstructing the antebellum mythology isn't the point. The point is that people who feel the need to assert their whiteness in this way usually are asserting it at the expense of the non-white. Non-whites who assert their identity are usually asserting it because otherwise whites and whiteness would crush them."
Freethought,3atis8,Pilebsa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"There are about 8 million MORE whites in poverty than there are blacks, yet the black community is committing crime at a SUBSTANTIALLY higher rate, as I've already proven.  The straw you're grasping at is not that poverty pushes people to have an unrelenting urge to rape, kill and sell drugs, it is that poverty is an indicator of poor upbringing and deteriorates values associated with a strong family unit.  This lack of values leads people to live a life of crime, which then plummets them further into poverty as a result.  The government's numerous attempts at alleviating the plights of the poor have ended in failure because recipients had become dependent on assistance and complacent with where they are and romanticizing the culture, not because it wasn't enough.  It sounds like you are harboring a lot of white guilt and feel the need to find excuses for peoples' behavior, but all the twisting of reality in the world won't change the fact that these stats exist.  The ultimate privilege is being able to commit atrocious crimes and have large groups of people make excuses for you - that is nearly exclusively black privilege.  Just as a side note, only 1.6% of the US population owned slaves in 1860, the year slavery was at its peak.  This is data taken directly from census information by the US government in 1860.  You should read this article that will educate you on black slave ownership, which says that nearly 42% of the free blacks in the US owned at least 1 slave, and many black slave owners owned white slaves as well.  So being proud of my white heritage, when my family immigrated here AFTER the civil war will label me a racist?  But any other race can proudly exclaim theirs and they are not racist?  Talk about double standard.  People who argue these points don't want equality, they want to oppress others."

What isn't a fact is the presumption that the killing is due to them being black.   Despite there being an implication.  You suggest all other socio-economic factors are the same, and they aren't.  The more likely reality statistically is that a person's race isn't as critical to their propensity to commit crime as their education or poverty level or their proximity to other factors that represent increased crime risk, and not specifically-race.  I agree with others that the data has been cherry-picked to present an un-scientific premise."

That has nothing to do with blacks altogether then.   Reports of crime against black people is under-reported   So blacks aren't going to the police?  I can understand that.  They've been fed a narrative that the police hate blacks and all the statistics twisting tries to convince them that the police are not their friends.  I can concede that argument.  However the same point can be made that whites may not go to the police to report crimes either, you can't speculate on anything that isn't reported and then try and account for that.   White people are not dying at ten times the rate of black people   In terms of cross racial crimes?  I think you need to look at the statistics again.  Look at page 3 of this document on Table 1 to see that blacks actually make up a higher proportion of offenders than they do victims, where as whites make up exactly the same proportion as they do offenders.

Second, while it's possible to use religious opinions or texts to condone violence, it's not really necessary. Again, the article makes this clear. An appeal to informal moral standards is often sufficient, while an appeal based only on a religious passage may not be sufficient, at all.  Third, an appeal to religious texts is not always successful.

I'm wondering just why he singles out the no-fault aspect there.  Requiring that one person in a divorce be assigned blame forces the entire process into an adversarial stance and more or less eliminates most chances of an amicable divorce.  It also rules out that both parties realize that if they just cannot get things to work between the two of them, it doesn't mean that either did anything wrong, just that the two of them can't sustain a happy and healthy relationship.  By demanding that one side locate a glaring flaw or defect in the other and display it for the court, it generates not just an act of character assassination, but it creates more feelings of ill-will towards others than there was before or is required.  It's bad enough that nearly everyone expects their marriages to be of fairy-tale quality, but to require a villain just injects more drama into these lives than real life needs at any point.  I'd understand their point (not that I'd agree with it) if it was divorce in general that they referred to as a problem facing the ""sanctity"" of marriage.  But since it is a given that people change as the progress through life, it is possible to find yourself married to someone that you realize you have come to absolutely despise.  The biblical solutions to problems like that would be to either remain trapped in a marriage where both parties hate each other and they wait for it to wear off, or for the woman to eventually be killed by the husband.

I'd understand their point (not that I'd agree with it) if it was divorce in general that they referred to as a problem facing the ""sanctity"" of marriage.   Obviously if you really care about the sanctity of marriage then you should also ban divorce outright, but I suspect the author rightly realises that at that point he'd even lose half his Christian audience, so he's going for the softer option of criticising the more extreme expression of the trend while carefully avoiding the more debatable end that might touch on more debatable (or merely hypocritical) positions his audience holds."

Their moral standard comes from what they call the infallibility of the church.  It's a complicated (convoluted) teaching, but boils down to this.  When a preponderance of bishops agree on matters of faith or morals, they are protected by God from making mistakes.  This is a big problem for the church when they want to change their minds on something - thus the complications."

My point was that to the Catholic faith, the Bible is an important artifact of the faith, inspired by God, but not a history or instruction book.  It always makes me cringe a bit when atheists get this one wrong.  Different arguments need to be made against the Catholic church than would be made against denominations based on fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.

Freethought,39x71c,Pilebsa,5,Mon Jun 15 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm most interested in the fact that the author makes a pretty massive assumption (and even gives limited evidence) that this is a modern phenomena born from academics. This is significantly older than modern academia. It's been around in various forms for a long time; it's existed since before empiricism was a thing. It is this specific intellectual force that prompted Kant's writing of his critique of pure reason. This is not new, sadly.       Anything can be reasoned as truth; anything can be reasoned as false. Simply because they can be reasoned as true or false does not make them so. I think most of the modern struggle is in defining what 'true' means. Does it mean factual? Does it mean undeniable? Is it absolute? Is it relativistic? Relativistic truth is what has allowed humanities to go as far as it has; it is an intellectual tool that is significantly more useful in non-empirical realms. It's hard to fault its use entirely. Clarity in the definition of truth; especially as it pertains to harder sciences should be the goal, not the killing of the idea of relativistic truth."

I don't know if you're open to community feedback, but that's the kind of thing that would make me unsubscribe from r/freethought.  I get the desire to cut out the noise and preserve signal, and I'm on board with a heavier moderation regime if it's necessary to preserve the integrity of the sub (especially at the moment, with a lot of polarisation, controversy and butthurt flying around reddit), but I cannot see any way that eliminating downvotes helps to improve the quality of the conversation, or reduce the quantity of noise.  The downvote is sometimes abused, but it's also the primary mechanism to discourage and reduce noise.  Trying to mandate away negative judgement of each other's comments and turning the sub into a happy-joy-goodthink place where nobody's ever allowed to categorise another comment as bad, irrelevant, poorly-argued or just stupid doesn't improve the quality of discourse - it just lobotomises it, since it beomes impossible to differentiate between a comment the community deems bad, one that the community has no strong consensus feeling about, and one the community hasn't even seen (eg, because it was posted late in the discussion).  It also completely removes the ability of the community to self-correct - eg, where an initially-compelling (and hence upvoted) claim or argument is proven by later discussion to be disingenuous, misleading or factually inaccurate (and hence arguably undeserving of its previous prominent/lauded/consensus-approved status)."

The last thing I want is a ""happy-joy-goodthink"" place, but at the same time, I think we're more heavily-plagued by the ""I disagree therefore I downvote"" brigade.  As evidenced in this thread, we have some people who have made un-popular and/or inaccurate statements that have been heavily down-voted but at the same time, there has been some very insightful responses to those modded-away OPs.   I think sometimes the best posts are responses to a poorly-conceived argument.  How can we make sure that great content doesn't get buried?   Do people really follow the ""Only downvote bad stuff not stuff you disagree with"" rule?  Anyway, I'm open to debating the pros/cons of this issue.

Anybody who has ever had sex knows the difference between consensual and non-consenual, but how is this determined and fairly judged when there is no physical evidence of abuse and all you have are two conflicting peoples' testimony?

If the justice system is failing to prevent rape, then it makes sense for a university to take steps beyond what the justice system is willing to take.  My only idea of how to prevent innocent accused rapists from being expelled is by implementing a process: if you get a person expelled for rape, next time you will need audio or video evidence. If you get raped a second time and you don't have a source of audio or video evidence, your options are the justice system or leaving the university yourself."

I think it's entirely possible, maybe even probable, that he raped her. Her deciding not to file a complaint until months later, mostly because of the difficulty in pursuing such a case and the reluctance of colleges and police to help in pursuing such cases, greatly diminishes her chances of getting some sort of conviction/disciplinary action against the accused.

One of the other accusers against this man originally had the school find him responsible, but that was dropped after she declined to keep pursuing after an appeal, as court cases were interfering with her life. I can't imagine how many victims simply decide to never pursue, and try to live with it unresolved.  That said, this man is not responsible for the system that is in place that is broken in this way. He was found not responsible for this alleged attack, which at this point, I think was the only reasonable decision. I don't think a system where people are convicted with only one person's claim as evidence would be sustainable. (I don't know the evidence in the other complaints against him, and why one initially found him responsible.) And his situation feels terribly wrong: he has not been found responsible, but his name has become synonymous with ""serial rapist"" to many. In cases where the accused has been accused of morally reprehensible things, generally rape and/or pedophilia, it seems obvious that there should be protections in place to hide the name of the accused, that continues indefinitely if the accused is found not guilty. Though I think it can also be argued that this public shaming is the only viable current recourse for victims of rape, as the legal system in place is not designed for their needs. To me, resolving this conflict would require an overhaul to our current system, to treat everyone involved with respect.  I have no idea how I feel about this man's case again the college, with respect to the woman's right to freedom of speech, versus protections for him not to be harassed or slandered. There's likely a legal opinion much more informed than I am, so I won't comment.  However, in spite of all this, I've found her art pieces about the situation fascinating, regardless of the truth of what may or may not have happened. So many people come to a conclusion about his guilt and her intentions before hearing any details about the case, or with only cursory knowledge of her art projects, and I think it says a lot about how we all take sides and condemn the accused or the accuser each and every time a rape case arises in the United States."

Freethought,39thxs,qwertyasdfg123456,11,Sun Jun 14 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"What you refer to happens when an abuser holds an emotional grip over someone. For example someone I know was abused by such a psychopath because he kept telling her nobody would like her and she would be alone if she left him. But Sulkowicz claims no such thing.   There was no abusive relationship, because they were not in a relationship. In fact, it sounds very much like she wanted one, but he didn't. You can't continually emotionally abuse someone you aren't with and don't want to be with. That just makes no god damn sense.   What's more likely, that against all odds she was actually raped but was so shocked that she kept sending him iloveyous for months, or that she is getting back at him for not wanting a relationship with her?   Also note how she begged him for anal sex (""fuck me in the but"") before the alleged rape, he doesn't appear to be particularly into it, and then she accuses him, much later, of having done just that, but against her will.   Well I know a woman can change her mind, but seriously? Is there any other crime where that would not be very fishy? ""Hey dude, do you want a free TV? I've got that old thing I don't use anymore gathering dust, come pick it up before I put it in the bin"" and then months later you sue the guy for theft of said TV. Well maybe you changed your mind in between, it's your right, but what court in their right mind is going to be taking you seriously?  Consider also the converse: what if Paul had been begging her for anal sex and she said she didn't want it, and then she accuses him of anal raping her. That would be rather bad for him, wouldn't it? It wouldn't prove anything by itself, but it would definitely be strong circumstancial evidence."

I think in many ways, this is enough. You just don't have free will in the sense of your will being uncaused or independent of the rest of physical reality. Everything that happens is either the deterministic consequence of what came before, or purely random. Your thoughts and actions are part of the universe and follow its laws just like everything else.  But I feel the question of free will might just be a kind of bad question. Let's say I generally want to quit smoking, but right now I really want a cigarette. So what is my will here? Clearly, I want two things at once that are mutually exclusive. Whatever I do, I am both acting in accordance with and defiance of some part of my will.   Our mind is not some monolithic, coherent entity. There are countless processes going on in our brain at any moment, only a fraction of which are conscious, leading to many impulses, motivations and wishes that influence each other. In the end, one impulse will be the strongest, and that's then what you'll do.   I think it's impossible to do something you absolutely don't want to do. To do something, one of those countless processes in your brain must lead to it. It would be impossible for me right now to eat a spider. I simply don't want to.

I chose to link the subreddits you cite because they are based on parodying established scientific and social falsehoods.    In the case of the IdrawMuhammad subreddit, Freethinkers believe that there is no such thing as an ""off limits"" area of free speech and that's a powerful way of illustrating that.  In the case of conspiratard (or atheism), it's a way of making it clear we mock ideologies that are without rationality.  That's the degree to which science takes precedence over popular opinion.  You are free to disagree, but note that one of the tenets of this subreddit is: Not all opinions are equal.   So if you have a contrary opinion, it can't simply be because you disagree or you can cut-and-paste.  You have to demonstrate a more thorough and deeper knowledge of the subject or use superior references than others.  Circumstantial evidence, hearsay, and opinions from non-experts is not acceptable.  And that is basically what you've cited in your responses.

Let me tell you a story about the etymology of ""tin foil hatter.""  This Label was popularized in the 1980s and applied to a group of skeptics whom the mainstream media and general public slandered as paranoid and crazy for sugggesting that an Orwellian-like state surveillance was being implemented; the idea was that they were paranoid about the government spying on them, hence the tinfoil hats to dissuade electronic surveillance. We all had a laugh.  But to much surprise this turned out to be true with the leaks by Wikileaks, Snowden, Manning and countless other whistleblowers. So calling someone a ""tinfoil hatter"" or recommending they put on their tinfoil hat is making reference to a rhetorical legacy that initially aimed to slander a group who have actually been proven to be largely correct, despite this fact you seem to think this label somehow discredits them. It's actually rather telling, not to mention counterproductive, ad homenem attack coming from a place of childish naivete or willful ignorance and cognitive dissonance.  And to pour salt on the wound, many conspiracies that were once considered fringe and untrustworthy are now regarded as truth.   Government spying on people in this country and people in other countries used to be a conspiracy theory but now the NSA is a common household name.  The CIA securing poppy plantations in Latin America then smuggling it over to sell to the black community in the United States used to be a conspiracy theory until it was exposed by Journalist Gary Webb. Not soon after they destroyed him with the help of MSM.  Killing Middle Eastern people for oil used to be a conspiracy theory until it became so blatantly obvious.  Think again, for yourself this time. Blind patriotism is not free thinking."

So calling someone a ""tinfoil hatter"" or recommending they put on their tinfoil hat is making reference to a rhetorical legacy that initially aimed to slander a group who have actually been proven to be largely correct   I don't agree with this.  And since there are no citations, we can discuss this in a rather generic, non-scientific way, based on logic and reason.  I think the term ""tinfoil hatter"" refers more to mental illness than cogent social activists.   The idea that wearing a tinfoil hat will ""block brain wave reading devices"" and the like -- not indicative of a surveillance state as it is simply irrational and paranoid.   And it's too easy to take something that happened in the 1970s and then fast forward 40+ years later and claim it was prophetic.  You haven't actually made a legitimate causal argument between the origin of the term and modern events decades later.     And to pour salt on the wound, many conspiracies that were once considered fringe and untrustworthy are now regarded as truth.   And many more conspiracies that were considered fringe, were proven to be ridiculous and false.  Why not cite the moon landing hoax?  Or claim that Elvis is still alive?   Or Global Warming being a lie?  Or Area 51 and UFOs?  Bigfoot?  Ghosts?  How about the theory that Saddam Hussein had a Stargate and that's why America invaded Iraq?  What you are doing is cherry picking data (and some would argue your examples of ""true conspiracies"" are not exactly true) and assuming that because you can cite some examples that came true, this means all examples should be believed?   That's not scientific.  Plus not all ""conspiracy theories"" are equal in terms of claims and rationality.  If you want to raise a particular issue, raise a particular issue.  But be prepared to back it up with more than cutting-and-pasting from a random web site that is dedicated as a clearing house for paranoid, bizarre ideas.  That's not the most credible source.  There are plenty of ""conspiracy-esque"" theories that modern science is tackling and are worth examining: bee CCD, genetic/GMO arguments, geo-political issues, fossil fuel activities, surveillance issues, etc., but there's a difference between addressing issues and searching for truth, and coming up with a gradiose claim and then back-tracking to make it seem plausible.     Conspiracy theorists are like theists: they invent god first, then they ""fill in the blanks"" to make him seem plausible.  Scientists are exactly the opposite.  They look at the evidence and this leads them to a conclusion.  If you want your opinions to be respected in this forum, you have to be willing to admit your theories are wrong if the evidence does not support the claim.    This is the difference between a scientific theory, and a conspiracy theory.  When confronted with overwhelming contrary evidence, conspiracy theorists ignore the evidence and cling to their conclusion.  That's not scientific.  It's emotional and ideological.  Just because every once in awhile, some actual tidbit of reality jives with their conclusions, does not make their conclusions totally plausible.  The big picture has to be taken into account.  Regarding 9/11, I'm sure most people would admit there are definitely things that were not made public about the nature of how things went down.  There are definitely facts that came to light that make one wonder how much the government actually knew and when.  But there's a difference between that and claiming it's the result of some shadowy organization composed of lizard people."

It's more of an anomaly for a government to fail in its primary job of providing basic resources and protections for the people.  But in today's uber-comfortable, uber-critical style of living, people who become slightly inconvenienced have a tendency to suggest the whole system is horribly broken and corrupt.

She was criticizing the fact that a lot of the study of evolutionary psychology was done by white men under social conditions where strong racist, sexist, and classist assumptions went unchallenged.  This is not a particularly controversial statement.  She is approaching the issue with some very ham-handed indignation, obviously, but what do you expect?  It's Twitter, not an academic journal.    The problem with the author's argument is he pulled up some random person's Twitter account, cherry-picked a statement that taken out of context appears to be much different than what it is, and then proceeds to use that as an emblem of how  the academic discussion of gender and racial studies is causing harm to our society.

There's a golden opportunity there to elucidate his argument and tie both of those anecdotes together in a powerful way, and he makes the ignorant assertion that the debate is not even happening!  Why would he not go into detail about why it was incorrect for them to address the issue by silencing debate?  The argument practically writes itself.

And the cost to people is real, in-depth, discussion.  Whether or not to teach about law pertaining to rape at Harvard has been brought into question, by people laboring under the title of feminism, undermining the herculean effort by feminists to get society to honestly look at what the solutions are to address rape.  Canceling the discussion for fear of offense to others hamstrings intellectual development.  You can't be a surgeon if you cannot bear to see blood.  You can't fix social ills by refusing to discuss them in depth. This, paired with Title IX claims against professors who dare to discuss anything that intersects with identity politics is stifling.   Maybe you aren't from the US, or if you are, you just missed the hullaballoo in the midwest in the 1980's, but Mark Twain was routinely banned at the school board level.  In the past, it was due to the fact that Twain was a liberal atheist whose work exemplified resistance to a dysfunctional system (Huck Finn particularly), and now it is because of the portrayal of racism and casual use of the word, ""nigger"".  Do you see the difference?  Twain was disliked in the past because he de-stabilized old social orders by satirizing the injustice of his times.  He is being banned today because he is too crass for students.  In both cases it is censorship, and the latter case is motivated by a far less compelling fear.    And maybe we just have different life paths, but I've met students of the ilk that the professor fears.  Students that reject not just evolutionary psychology, but any academic assertion by an author who belongs to a privileged class.  Not just in psychology or sexuality studies, but even in the arts, here is a reactionary blog about the proponderance of male white voices in poetry: http://electricliterature.com/should-white-men-stop-writing-the-blunt-instrument-on-publishing-and-privilege/ And there is a point to be made that we are hit over the head with the same paradigmatic lens all the time in culture, so maybe curating more non-white voices into ones artistic reception is better for us all.    Add on top of that the way these conversations get shut down hurts progress.  Radical feminists and trans supporters cannot easily get along and find common ground, as the concept of ""womanly"" to a radical feminist is a social construction where some trans advocates argue that it is innate.  And obviously, there is a lot of middle ground there, especially when amplified by human diversity both genetic and cultural, but feminism itself is being splintered by politics of identity.  Dan Savage is being attacked from the left for deficiencies in thought and speech while existing in a culture that still fears homosexuality (it is getting better), but also sex in general.  Any thought or action less than 100% pure and correct is grounds for dismissal on an alter of personal offense.    This sub-culture of personal offense paired with too much emphasis of the obvious identity of the speaker is leading to situations where one's voice is ignored, on purpose, because it is coming from a mouth lined with the wrong color skin, not because its ideas are deficient.  And that is where the problem really is.  Ideas and concepts exist outside of race and can be discussed as such.  They can also be informed by race and sex and class, and should be discussed as such.  College students today curate those discussions, however, omitting divergent viewpoints which leads to insufficient social solutions, just as has been exemplified time after time in history by whitefolk, as well as Zimbabwe, and next, the radical left as it currently exhibits itself."

Let's say that the 'criminal' was actually a law abiding citizen, he loved his family, but someone injected him with a drug (let's say PCP) and he suffered a violent delusional experience, he thought the sister was his wife, he thought the family were devils, and that's why he did it. He was only caught days later after PCP testing couldn't be found, and he never knew what he'd done.  Should he still get killed, or just life in prison, or something else?  Or let's say that there were no drugs, but his own family were being threatened and tortured. Perhaps he lives in the US, and his family live in Russia, and the mob got to them and could keep threatening them. The mob used him to threaten another family, and he was told to commit the rape or his own family would be raped and murdered. He made that choice under duress, and he isn't allowed to say why he did it.  Should he still get killed, or just life in prison, or something else?  These are absurd scenarios but that's the point. You can't prove that these things haven't and don't happen, and our justice system isn't expected to know everything. That's why we have retrials -- to make amends for new discoveries in cases that we can learn about only years later.  The death penalty is a waste of money and no justice system knows enough to kill people."

That aside I feel that we must keep the death penalty on the table and a case I read about today highlights it especially well. I actually haven't been able to get it out of my head. Link to the case here.   Herman Robinson was sentenced Wednesday to 100 years to life in prison for repeatedly raping a girl and killing the child she bore as result of the rapes. The victim, now a young woman, had endured seven years of sexual abuse and watched her infant child killed before her eyes. The child’s body was never recovered by police.  Robinson raped the victim from the age of 11 until the age of 18. She was 20 when she testified. The judge also found Robinson fathered the baby with her when she was 14. Robinson ordered her to keep the pregnancy secret, and he delivered the baby. Moments after the March 2010 birth, Robinson struck the baby girl’s head to the floor twice, killing her.   This crime is indescribable. Heinous doesn't even begin to describe it. This guy took every shred of dignity this girl had, and then he brutally murders her newborn in front of her.  I am sorry if you disagree but I wholeheartedly believe this man should be put to death for what he did. Its torture. He basically terrorized this girl for 7 years. And no, its not just because he's black, I would be calling for the death penalty even if the guy was white.  Like I said in another thread, I never wish rape upon anyone but I'll make an exception for this guy. I hope some gang members get a hold of him and turn him inside out."

I have this hypothesis that the religious background of a country plays into this. If you think ""an eye for an eye"" is the right way to go, if you think there are people that are intrinsically evil (instead of results of their social etc. environment), then the death penalty seems acceptable.

My view isn't at all influenced by religion (I'm atheist), it has far more to do, I think, with working with Victims of violent crime on a regular basis.  Some of these people have been forever broken by unspeakable violence and depravity and they deserve some semblance of retribution."
Freethought,37metd,-Dv8-,2,Tue Jun 2 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughtful response.  First, I would like to address your assumption of 100% certainty. There is no 100% certainty in this world. And even if we are 99.9% certain, we might be wrong. And we have been in the past. There is no way to know for certain at the time of conviction (and execution).  Let's still assume we were 100% certain. My moral compass will never point at ""does no longer deserve to live"". It may point at ""does no longer deserve to live in freedom"", however. In my opinion, the various types of prison serve these objectives (I only thought about it for 2 minutes, so it might be incomplete): - protection of the society - punishment - resocialisation (when possible)  I think that killing a person for a crime he committed is a form of blood vengeance that is unnecessary and immoral. Why do I think it is unnecessary? Because there will be hardly anyone who - before committing a serious crime - will weigh up the possible punishments and think: ""OK, if it's only a lifetime sentence in prison, I'll kill this guy. But if I will be executed, I'd rather don't.""  My moral compass works something like this: ""Let us try to maximise the overall (short- and long-term) well-being of conscious creatures."" Killing a criminal does not maximise the overall well-being. Punishing a criminal does though because it prevents further crime as a means of determent and protects society (if a violent criminal has to serve a prison sentence). I think it is just a matter of habituation for a family of a victim to accept that a lifetime sentence is the hardest possible punishment. As a family member of a victim you want the hardest possible punishment, I understand that. But this should not be a society's moral compass. It should maximise overall well-being. In all (but one) European countries, people have gotten used to the ban of the death penalty and appreciate its abolition. (Some polls show different results but those polls are prone to extreme views - and are typically conducted after extremely violent crimes and hence show a very emotional response.)  Did that make sense?  EDIT: Typo."
Freethought,37metd,sabertoothedhedgehog,2,Tue Jun 2 11:43:52 2015 UTC,Thx.
Freethought,37metd,sabertoothedhedgehog,2,Tue Jun 2 11:43:54 2015 UTC,"It does make sense, I still disagree to a large extent, but I fully understand where you are coming from.  You embrace a far more utilitarian morality system than I.  The needs of the many and all that, which I can certainly respect.  Valid point on never being 100%, but I do think we can often get to 99.9%, and as callous as it might seem thats morally acceptable to me.  I have personally been involved in dealing with the victims (immediate family members) in several murder cases, and I can tell you with no doubt in my mind that the perps were guilty, and they deserve to die.    I don't think we should use the death penalty as a deterrent (I agree with you that doesn't work), I think we should use it primarily as retributive justice.  I feel that allowing some of these monsters, and thats what some of them are, to continue to live is what is immoral.  Especially when we look at the pain and suffering they have willfully inflicted upon their victims.  The people that commit these kinds of crimes should not get to live out their days with free meals, free shelter, and free medical care while their victims are rotting in the ground and their loved ones are suffering (often in debilitating ways).  When I look at the scales of justice, your version just seems unbalanced to me.   I also have spent times in prisons (for work) and often interact with prison staff.  I don't think its fair to put their lives at risk by forcing them to look over some of these monsters, and their lives are at constant risk.  Many of the worst offenders have no want to rehabilitate, they could care less about anyone or anything but themselves.  And until the day they die they will be a danger to those around them, be it other prisoners or prison staff.  It seems to me the maximum benefit to society would be to simply remove these individuals. I also think this is an issue of accountability.  You reap what you sow in most aspects of life, and when you kill others, especially the more malicious killings, what you sow should be the forfeiture of your own life. Despite my views I am not some blood thirsty ""kill em all"" type of guy.  I cry every damn time I watch the notebook, I'm a relatively sensitive guy.  My view on this topic has changed drastically as I have been exposed to actual murderers and their victims.  So I may be too close to the subject and that has probably biased my opinion quite a bit.    While I know you won't agree with my thoughts on the matter, I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and that it's not a place of hate or immorality."
Freethought,37metd,-Dv8-,2,Tue Jun 2 12:47:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for another thought- and respectful response.  I chose the above morality system (adapted from Sam Harris) because it gives you a universal, highly objective framework. Without it, one could say ""How can you impose your European (or country abc) views on our American (or country xyz) culture?"".  I don't see those people as monsters. I am probably overly rational (for whatever reasons). But a person doing horrible things could be caused by many factors: * your social background / having been mistreated as a child by your parents * use of drugs that change the way you see the world * pseudo-religious indoctrination that makes you believe you do the right thing (while in reality you don't), like suicide bombers * physiological abnormalities where certain areas of your brain are slightly damaged or underdeveloped so that you lack empathy * ... I think their behavior is a result of many factors - which leads them to making the wrong choice in the moment of the crime. (This is not to diminish the pain inflicted on the victim's family.)  I have not been exposed to murderers or victims though. It may be possible that I would change my mind. I would doubt it though - I thought about this a lot.  I am not sure if this (imperfect) analogy helps or is even more alienating: I would never blame anyone just for being a pedophile because I assume that pedophile sexual preferences are formed out of control of the person (by genetic dispositions, early influences in life or whatever science might find out). So those people are not monsters either. But they are to blame if they act on their sexual preferences and abuse a child. We just cannot allow this to happen as we see a child as worth protecting from the psychological and physical harm that would be caused by this action.  EDIT: After having written this, I think I overly stressed this single argument. My main arguments are: (1) Death penalty is irreversible, has killed innocent people and will kill innocent people in the future (as we're never 100% sure and 99% is not enough). A single case of an innocent person waiting for his planned death - knowing that he is innocent - is unbearable for me and I could not live in a state that cannot exclude this situation. (2) It does not prevent more crimes than just a life sentence. (3) It is unnecessary from a safety point of view - society is already protected if the criminal is in prison. (4) I consider the time you have to wait before you get executed as torture. Unlike an emotional act, this is a planned and announced execution."

On Easter, 1976, Greene began building a replica of Noah's Ark atop a prominent hillside along what is now Interstate 68 featuring a sign that announces to passing travelers: ""Noah's Ark Being Rebuilt Here!""  Ground was broken for the ark in September 1976 with over 3,000 tons of concrete. It was built to biblical proportions, around 450 by 75 by 45 feet, which is about one and a half football fields long.   Pastor Greene's main inspiration for building the ark came from a three-part dream highlighting Noah's Ark and his vision of salvation for the people of this Earth.  The vision began in the spring of 1974. The vision was to buy three acres of land from the farmer who owned it and build the ark. The three acres of land would not be enough to build the Ark so he was told by God to not ask the farmer to buy more land, but; instead ask the farmer to give it to him.  The pastor currently owns the four acres where the structure still stands along with the church as well.  Pastor Greene claims that the land itself has curative and restorative powers.  It took the pastor and the church fifteen years to save up $200,000 to start the project.

In actuality, abortion/""pro life""/""anti-choice"" is a movement created by organized religion and political leaders as a way of controlling large blocks of people.  The religious leaders use abortion as a movement to focus their flock's attentions on singular issues and away from scrutiny of the institution and its doctrinal inconsistencies.  Political leaders use abortion as a way to mobilize voters to support specific political candidates and parties.  Many citizens are now ""single-issue voters"" who will always support a pro-life candidate over a pro-choice candidate.  This has been specifically orchestrated by certain powers.  Don't try to find consistency in the concept of being ""pro life"" - there is none.

Freethought,37j0uk,deej2701,5,Wed Jun 10 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"After reading a couple of the other stupid comments I saw here.... As someone who is a Christian and pro life I think I can answer.  We believe that every single human has unalienable rights from God. And those are rights that no one can take away. (This, in fact, forms our basis for any sense why we shouldn't hurt another person, etc.) To the point: we believe that a baby, at its conception, is a human. And we believe they have the right to a life, same as you and I. It's not about sex at all like a lot of the people here are saying. It's not about some dogma to focus our attention. Many very conservative Christians (mind me, I'm coming from my particular experience; don't start thinking I'm generalizing about all Christians) really do believe that a child is a human being. Think about it? Do pro-choice or pro-abortionists go around asking for people to kill or abort disabled or elderly people? Of course not. We obviously don't value their lives as just their minds or thoughts, because disabled people often have no mind or skill at anything. But we still give them the right to life. So why does that logic not apply to a child?  And I think that a lot of us are willing to make exceptions to rape. In those cases, rape is the issue. But I do think if it was consenting sex, it's rather your fault you became pregnant, etc, why are you killing the baby, it's human just like you.  I really hate the attitude of many of the commenters here. So hateful and ignorant. Figure out what we actually mean before condemning it.  P.S. An interesting thought: think about when you think that you became a human being. Was it the moment you popped out of the womb? If so, what exactly were you before that besides an embryo?   EDIT: After reading even more comments on christians condemning sex.... I'm gonna tell you right now, every Christian I've talked to says sex is awesome. So that ""point"" can go straight out the window. haha :P"
Freethought,37j0uk,ntomallen,2,Fri May 29 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I completely respect your beliefs and I would never attempt to take them from you. I apologize if I have offended you, it was never my intention.  My question was not made to spark up a debate on abortion. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and I think it is wrong for anyone to damper the beliefs of another. I just question why more of a uproar isn't made about praying to end rape or end disease. Instead of incriminating and judging people for abortion, why not strive to end the things that lead to abortion?"
Freethought,37j0uk,ntomallen,3,Fri May 29 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, hey :) I'm not offended by the topic or by abortinists or discussion at all! - I'm just offended that people are misrepresenting/making up/kind of... stereotyping Christians without any real thought behind it, you know?   I agree with you! I think that Christians focus a lot on other people, whereas the seven deadly sins mostly have to do with personal character. (murder is not one of them - but anger is.) (also, the seven deadly sins are those that are Biblically the most important to focus on.)   However, I must say that rape and disease are not leading reasons to choose to abort. From that data, it seems as if most abortions are from pregnancies that were pure accident.   In all, I really feel that Christians shouldn't condemn anything as much as we do. We're supposed to love. We don't know everything someone who chooses to abort has going on in their life. And I also think that those who have unexpected pregnancies should be more careful, because they really are dealing with lives. If they didn't abort, it would definitely become a baby :P   EDIT: I also want to apologize for not directly answering the question the first time around :P"
Freethought,37j0uk,DingusMacLeod,2,Fri May 29 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"It's fine for you to feel that way on the topic.  I don't think anyone has problem with that.  The problem I have is when people try to pass laws in order to stop others from doing what they feel they need to do.    Nobody is making this decision light-heartedly.  This is not done on a whim.  I know some women who have been through this.  They feel regret years after the procedure, but they still feel that they made the right decision given their particular set of circumstances."
Freethought,37j0uk,ntomallen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:21:47 2015 UTC,"Sure :)  I guess another question comes up here. Is it ever okay to end the life of any human? Such as someone who's probably going to die anyways, or a disabled person, or an elderly person, or anyone else? If you can justify any of those, I think you can justify abortion. But if you can't, I don't know how you can justify abortion. Because abortion is ending a pregnancy because the baby could be inconvenient. (Mind you, I'm using this as a catch-all word for any kind of inconvenience - be it financial, emotional, coming from a rape, whatever. Maybe its even impossible to give it a good life.)   Yeah, this is an overblown example. I'm going with it anyways. Hitler felt as if what he needed to do was destroy the Jews. So he did it. You can't ever use the logic ""do it if it feels right"" when other lives are in the balance. That's our argument - a baby (even not born) has the same rights as every other human. That's really what the question is about. We want abortion illegal not because we want to enforce some dogma on someone - but because we appreciate every single human life very deeply. And if we cut the corner in one situation, it makes it so much easier to do so in other situations."

I disagree with the latter, but I can still respect it.  What I do not understand is why don't they pray to end the things at the root of the problem?

The second aspect is somewhat more sinister, and frequently pro-lifers will refuse to admit to it, even to themselves. The desire, put simply, is to punish women for having sex.

Domination, mind control and pregnancy fetishism - all obviously part of the package. Of course, giving up control of your sexuality to others - that's a great BIG thing in BDSM fantasy.  It can be couched in religious terms and dress it up in denim jumpers instead of leather or latex - but if anything, that makes it worse. It's not ""Master's Will,"" it's God's.

On a regular basis, groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation fight these violations of Church-State separation.  If there weren't groups out there fighting lots of little battles, religion would have made a much more significant impact on government and society despite the intent of our founding fathers and the Constitution.     One of the reasons religious imagery is still on currency and coinage is because people didn't challenge these activities earlier and instead interpreted the endorsement more as ""tradition"" than what it actually is, which is religious propaganda.  Perhaps most importantly, it's the symbol of Congress' change from the much more noble and secular national motto of E. Pluribus Unum (""Out of many, one"").

It does not mention ""god"" at all.  The National Motto is in direct conflict with the Constitution.  The Constitution expressly puts the power and trust in the people and their representatives.  The national motto on the other hand, indicates that we put our trust in a mythological being.  We're not talking about a sign above an overpass in Iowa.  This is the national motto - an indication of what America's priorities are.    If you don't think it's important, that's your choice, but it saddens me to see people who want to discourage others from fighting principaled fights simply because they disagree.

A lot of people think the ACLU or the EFF or the FRFF engage in a lot of seemingly-trivial lawsuits, but the way the legal system works, with decisions being based on precedents, all those little things add up to big things that can either give or take away our rights.

A ""national motto"" is an endorsed statement that represents, not something historically, but a summary of a nation's priorities.     Look at the national mottos of various nations...

A motto is a statement about peoples' hopes.

The idea of inserting more, opposite-aligned bias into science seems like a very bad one to me. I don't think the M&M-counting example is a good model. I'd imagine most real-world issues are more complex than two groups of people with exactly opposite tendencies influencing a result that's just one single number.  Also, science doesn't just quietly work behind closed doors until it has it all figured out. Biased studies get reported on, and might influence public opinion and policy before the group with the opposite bias has had a chance to review it or present their own results. So, I think bias can do real damage, and adding more bias is not a good thing."

However, he convoluted SO many definitions of 'liberal', had few sources (most were conjectural claims) and didn't seem to understand this 'liberal' mindset he was talking about one bit. his proposed solution were protected ideas. Any ideas you want protected. They shouldn't be questioned or examined (the true tools of the liberals there), they should be supported and grown. Now, I'm not a huge fan of an empirical-only approach to the world, but what he suggests seems like a step away from empiricism- or even the breakdown of it. Having protected ideas won't support intellectual diversity, it will kill it.       He also talks about finding truth. He talks sometime about philosophical truth, sometimes about scientific truth and doesn't seem to care which definition he's using. This is difficult because as philosophy has broken down over the years, we've discovered that truth can be quite a relative concept; when talking about science, this is not true. There isn't a relative compisition of water. You can't assume that combining gold and hydrogen will make water. This convulsion of these two definitions of truth is dangerous. Because why should I care about global warming if I can just hope it's not true to make it such?     Intellectual diversity is great; clarity of defining terms is even better.

The fact that many factors, beyond the control of a child, influence their ability to lift themselves up out of poverty.  (Directly refutes the 'Lift yourself up by your bootstraps' mentality that conservatives often hold)  Among those factors are    Food Security  Parental Education level  School quality in their area  Ability of parents to provide enriching activities outside the school year.   These are just some core simple examples that children are completely unable to correct or change, or even understand, but directly contribute to the outcomes of children as adults.

Freethought,36g4kn,_JimmyJazz_,1 point,Tue May 19 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. Do you think conservatives are against food security, parental education level, school quality, or the ability of parents to provide enriching activities outside of school? This sounds more like economic disagreements, not psychological ones.  Conservatives talk frequently of the influence of traditions and cultural values - they most certainly acknowledge that outside forces play a role in social outcomes. Most of them aren't nearly as ""rugged individualist"" as they pretend to be - they are cultural warriors coming from a different point-of-view.  First, it's true that conservatives tend to overestimate the role of personal responsibility, but that doesn't mean that it plays no role - or that people are completely powerless over their circumstances. There are other factors that correlate to success too: willpower, grit, delayed gratification, growth mindset, etc.  Second, ""personal responsibility"" isn't the only socially conservative value. They also tend to value things like ""hierarchy,"" ""authority,"" ""family,"" and ""sanctity"" - and in certain contexts, these aren't necessarily bad social values (again, see Haidt's ""The Righteous Mind"").  Hell, even as an atheist, I have to admit religion has shown to be beneficial toward psychological and community well-being. And that's something that tends to be a conservative talking point.  Critical thinking tip: If you think someone has absolutely nothing to offer to a conversation, you're probably the one who is biased."

THAT probably has more to do with the lack of 'conservative' findings than anything else.

It may actually end up being unsafe to slow down all traffic to account for the slowest truck.  Or if there is quicker traffic, automated or otherwise, in the form of cars that needs to be dealt with. Or if there is construction. Or if there is an accident that changes traffic patterns.  On top of that, different algorithms from different developers will likely take slightly different philosophies that prioritize fuel efficiency over schedule or vice versa. Even two algorithms shooting for the same goal will end up behaving slightly differently.  There are likely dozens, if not hundreds of other factors I'm not even thinking of as a non-trucker, non-mechanic.

I'm in my late 50's and I don't recall any people of my age as being particularly religious. I was a mainline protestant (Episcopalian), and for youth within that cohort, (and of course, within my geographic region,) overt religiosity was seen as being - well, evidence of being a bit superstitious, a bit gullible. So while we'd always nod and say we were christian and mention our particular faiths, it meant little or nothing about actual faith and had everything to do about social status and the connections we could rely on for a job and career.   This was as the Cold War wound down, but the Vietnam War raged on. The mainline churches had aligned themselves with establishment thought; had taken strongly anti-communist positions - and so had to somehow teach around the fact that ""anti-communism"" didn't really square all that well with the New Testament.  You may recall there was an absolute explosion of non-traditional religions - many of them were outright cults, like the Moonies; others were seen as such but were more-or-less serious religions in evangelical mode - such as the Hare Krishna movement. Everything from Zen Buddism to Tantra exploded onto the bookshelves. Eastern martial arts (and the associated Taoist and Buddhist thought underpinning them) became a thing, as did Yoga. The whole hippie culture became a thing. The Neopagans got their start around then, in the sixties and seventies. And if you were anything like me, you were exposed to a lot of good questions as you passed them on the street - and found that orthodox Trinitarian thought didn't have any ready answers.    There was a brief uprising within Catholicism - the Social Gospel - which brought the term ""Social Justice"" to the fore. That was crushed by succeeding waves of arch-conservative Bishops.   Crushed - but they have had trouble getting people to join religious orders and become clergy ever since.   Something similar seemed to happen in the protestant churches. Anything social movement that was focused on improving the lot of actual people was seen as ""communist"" and was therefore ""unchristian."" If you happened to go to college and happened to take any courses dealing with sociology or political science, it was difficult to avoid learning how the church was and had always been a means of social regulation and control, for better or for worse. You would learn what Marx meant when he said it was ""The opiate of the People."" You would then be offended, snort derisively and try to argue the point as the teacher watched you attempt what generations prior to you had struggled to come to grips with.  Your best and only shot would be ""and that's a good thing. But then you had to look at what good it was doing in that capacity - and what it said and beleived about itself as a movement and organization. Boy, there's a lot of not thinking involved in thinking that it's a worthwhile investment of  your time and attention.  I recall many articles and sermons railing against the ""Communist"" African National Congress ""Terrorists"" who were trying to overthrow the ""Godly"" South African Apartheid government. That was a tough sell.  People on the ground could see the results of this mindset; guys in hard hats punching hippies was one of the iconic images of my youth. Good Christians all - and that was WHY they were out there doing the Godly work of Hippie punching.  Increasingly, the churches were something you did in order to not be seen doing anything that was a threat to established interests.   This made them more social clubs than churches. Where I grew up, they had become associated with your rank and station in life. (The Evangelical movement was just getting a head of steam - at that time they were dismissed as ""holy rollers,"" and considered to be a remnant of the sort of willfully ignorant sorts who'd been pilloried in Menckin's reporting of the Scopes Monkey Trial.)  Hm. so maybe it goes farther back than that. Certainly there was an unspoken feeling that if you were the sort of christian that talked about being christian or did anything activist or militant, you would be an embarrassment to everyone.  So... I didn't have kids, but I wouldn't have raised them Christian and to me, religiosity is a complete turn-off - and an indication of someone likely to do or say something possibly violent and certainly harmful to me if I happen to say the wrong thing in their presence. Most of my generation just didn't say anything about that which they were skeptical about - but they clearly didn't invest much into sustaining the churches as institutions, either. Certainly the longstanding tradition of of guiding a younger son into the clergy lost importance - and if nobody is tracking that or paying attention to that as a social phenomenon, they should.   And all this happened prior to the internet being much of a thing. The internet has certainly accelerated the process, taking what had been coastal and urban pockets of skepticism and bringing it to browsers everywhere, but even before then, rapid communication existed, the price of information storage was falling, books proliferated and people had started to more widely value literacy. Prior to say... WWI, or perhaps WWII (I'm sure it varied), education was viewed with suspicion. Well, it never entirely vanished; it was retained by the socially conservative religious sorts.   Anyway, to me and the people I knew well enough to have some guesses as to their views on the topic, religiousity  is a sign that outward observations have entirely replaced thought, doctrine has replaced conscience and the person is the brainwashed minion of some politically well-connected guy in an expensive suit - like Billy Graham or Jerry Falwell. We might show up at church and participate in the rituals, we might even enjoy it as a social thing or a comfort - but we don't give it all that much moral authority.   And we like to say that we think for ourselves. But of course, the outcomes of that are variable. I suspect for most, it is simply a relief to not feel obligated to waste a perfectly good Sunday.  TL;dr: I was paying attention in Sunday school, and my conscience was informed. Unfortunately, it informed on the church and the church did not perform well during it's mandatory self-criticism sessions."

Pemala Geller is free to disagree with a religious belief of Islam just as the Persians and Turks used to have artwork of Muhammad.  You can see the moment Fowler loses the argument when he says to Megyn:   ""If they never had that event the Jihadis would never have shown up.""    Please, consider... if you slightly changed the sentence fowler said you will realize the logic is completely flawed:   ""If she didn't dress provocatively, the rapist would never have shown up.""   Fowler also seems to think Muhammad is a God (says it twice). And isn't aware that in Islam, drawing Jesus or other prophets is also seen as a sin. So the jihadis could have shown up to a church that had a ""sculpting Jesus day.""  Please don't downvote just because ""fox news"" or ""blaze"". A broken clock can be right twice a day.

If you have rights only on the condition you never try to use them, then you don't have rights: If threats are allowed to cow people into letting some speech become forbidden then that sets an easy precedent to emulate, we don't have free speech if we allow this.

But when you look at this particular event, and consider organizer Pamela Gellar's decade long campaign of alarmist fear mongering against Muslims, it would be hard to believe that the people involved had any interests outside of offending Muslims.  If you're not aware, this is the same person who coined the term ""Ground Zero Mosque"" to stop a developer from building a Muslim/interfaith community center near the WTC (I'm not what you'd call a ""Muslim Scholar"", but I'm pretty sure actual mosques don't usually include swimming pools and daycares on premise), and is devoted to ""stopping the Islamization of America"" (meanwhile, in the real world, we're probably about to elect a female president in 18 months and legalize gay marriage nationwide in oh I don't know like five fucking minutes.

Geller is being criticized because she's a hateful bigot who has a long record of inciting and promoting violence against Muslims in the U.S. and overseas. Geller deserves all the criticism she is getting because this latest stunt was just another attempt on her part to incite violence against a religion/adherents she actively despises and that criticism and condemnation of her actions and her event are warranted.   Geller wasn't censored by anyone, her event wasn't shut down, she wasn't arrested, cited or in any other way sanctioned for her ridiculous views or behavior and this giant strawman that Kelly and you have erected is nonsense. Criticizing Geller for her absurd and bigoted views is completely different from refusing to allow her to express those views as she wishes. She got the chance to express herself and now she is facing the free expression of others and that free expression happens to be a condemnation of her bigotry and hate."

Throughout the years, we've seen cartoonists and ""blasphemers"" be murdered by Islamists that are indirectly propped up by ""moderate"" protesters against something as harmless as speech.  But here's the thing, these Islamists have limited targets - which is why they're able to do what they do. If more people stopped taking their shit, they wouldn't be able to fight it. I've seen far more offensive speech aimed at Christianity, and when it was rare, it was something that was fought against, usually violently. Today, we see South Park giving a Virgin Mary statue menstrual bleeding or Family Guy implying that Jesus was just a clever magician, and it's just another day in the park.   But dare to depict Mohammed in a drawing, and all hell breaks loose. I look forward to a day when that same kind of satire can be directed at Islam without needing extra security to protect from violent repercussions.  I don't really doubt that Geller is actually a bigot and maybe her intentions were not in the right place, but I'm able to acknowledge that a bigot can be right one time out of a million. The reaction to this event seems to reinforce the need for more of these events. Can you imagine if no Muslim would have paid attention to it? Nobody would have even known about it."

These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.       This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size.  By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can only comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships.  Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150.   Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.

Agreed. If these researchers are trying to determine the cause of IQ variations then I'm struggling to understand why the same broad, unhelpful variables are being used so frequently. What is this determination to associate IQ with variables that are clearly not causally influential? ""We know that there are both religious and irreligious people with high/low IQ, but we still seek to make a point that religiosity has something to do with IQ"". Why? I believe the controversy stems from both using such crude and widely encompassing identity-based variables, then insisting that they have something to do with the dependent variable in question. I like the following quote:  ""The third problem, with both ethnicity and “ethnic groups”, is the implied explanatory framework. If for example we show that British Indian 18 year olds are more likely to apply for and enter university than ethnic majority (“white”) 18 year olds, then the deployment of an ethnic comparison carries with it the assumption that the “ethnic variable” forms an important element of an explanation. This is not an unusual formulation in the use of statistical findings. That is, we are likely to encounter formulations like “ethnicity explains differences in entry into higher education”. In truth, at the level of simple correlations these are empirical observations: in a population of 18 year olds, comparing those ticking a box marked British Indian with those ticking a box marked white British, x% of the former went to university compared with x-10% of the latter. The question then becomes how do we explain this finding? This is the difference from assuming that “ethnicity” explains the findings. The normally cited (“ethnically relevant”) factors are values and social support. That is, some populations (ethnic groups) are seen to be placing greater value on higher education than others; or some ethnic groups are able to call on greater resources of family and community networks as a social resource. Thus the actually operative causal factors are educational values and social support. Both these variables have an established history of explaining differential educational success"" (Carter and Fenton, 2009)  In terms of the analogy, researchers are currently obsessed with looking at the effect of ethnicity on academic achievement (controversial and inaccurate) when they should be looking at the effect of educational values/social support on academic achievement (uncontroversial and more accurate). The latter is more refined than the former, correlates better and has more explanatory value, so should be seen as preferable."

Freethought,33kw2g,bolognahole,3,Thu Apr 23 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"I wrote this today on Facebook in response to this story:  Congress intentionally distracts us from the real news by stirring up controversy with bullshit laws that won't pass. They don't want us to notice the real things going through Congress right now like the 6 year extension of The Patriot Act, the expanded computer spying provisions, or the Trans Pacific Partnership. Haven't heard about those things? That's because your liberal friends only notice the anti-gay stuff. Real news isn't as exciting as tabloids, so both the corporate media and social media ignore them.  They're really fucking us with the TPP though, and giving corporations way more power to abuse individuals and the environment. The environment is already totally fucked, so that's really serious. Along with expanding abuse from corporations, they're expanding the governments power to abuse us with a ""cyber security"" bill that undermines our security, and a ""patriot act"" that throws our constitutional rights out the window.  They're also working on some new tax cuts that only help billionaires, gutting the budget even more and meaning even fewer services for those who work two jobs and still starve.  America used to be an amazing and wonderful place. Where the downtrodden could make a life for themselves and care for their children. Now parents have no time to spend with their children, millions of Americans go hungry every night, and wages are still falling.  Meanwhile Congress is putting on a theater show for the cameras while they gut our nation for personal profit.  Don't get mad at the goings on of the theater, but what really goes on behind the scenes. Read news through an aggregator like Reddit, read the comments to see critical opinions, and focus on independent news sources like HBO, NPR, PBS, The Intercept, Der Spiegel, and non-profit journalism centers.  Get mad enough to follow the real news and talk about it with friends. Don't fall victim to news baiting - ignore the bullshit and learn about the stories that matter.  If you're reluctant, just spend 30 minutes each week watching John Oliver's Last Week Tonight. It's okay to pirate it, try kat.ph. It's more important that you gain knowledge at no cost to anyone than stay ignorant out of concern for over zealous copyright law. Sharing is not wrong. Learning is invaluable.  When you're in the car, find the local radio station for NPR. It's KQED 88.5 in most of the bay area. Siri or Google can tell you which radio station is NPR in your area. Leave it on whenever you can, and keep it on a preset channel so you can easily go back. Download the NPR app if that's your thing.  You are not helpless, but they want you to feel like you are. WORK to keep yourself educated. No one else will. Educate others when you can. Ignorance may be bliss but it's also suicide. They are shooting innocent people in the streets and charging protesters with terrorism. We don't need more ignorance, we need more understanding.  And this may sound fluffy but it's actually a serious and important point: love one another. Loving one another is an active strategy for winning. We are all fighting the same fight. If we fight each other our oppressors win. Don't let them win."

Sorry to be nitpicky, but bullshit laws like this relating to D.C. are likely to pass if they have the votes, as this one apparently does, as Article One, Section Eight of the US Constitution gives Congress complete legislative control over D.C. laws with no threat of presidential veto, or concern over voter backlash, as D.C. can't vote for members of Congress. It's rare Congress overturns local laws, but it does happen (they are also using a budgetary trick to try and block marijuana legalization in D.C.)   independent news sources like HBO...

Enter political correctness and the term was changed to ""handicapped"", then ""special needs"", ""specially able"", now ""differently able"" (or maybe it's changed several times from that).  The net effect is now I can insult someone with a variety of ridiculous terms that refer to someone with a disability.

I live in China and while there is no state religion (same as USA) you are allowed to practice whatever religion you wish so long as it doesn't threaten the control of the government.  Where I live there is one Christian Church (in a city of about 5 million) and on the big festivals (Christmas and Easter) there is a large police presence outside the church, ostensibly to control the traffic. Also the traditional Chinese religions are still very popular with shrines to various gods almost everywhere. Buddhism is (I think) the main 'traditional' religion."

There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both.    I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in ""A,"" ""B,"" ""C"" and ""D."" Just who do they think they are? And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?    And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate.

I've worked the polls in every election since 2007, and anecdotally, the under 30 crowd is woefully under represented. I'd guess 10-15%, but that's all it is, a guess.  The 50 and up crowd represent 60% or more of those that vote in the precincts I've worked.  As to the youth in general.  You'd be surprised how sheltered some are.  Even in this age of vast amounts of information from around the world that is so much easier to get today than even 20 years ago, so many around here don't poke their heads out of their shells.  Their upbringing is such that anything that contradicts their parents or their preacher is bad.  College sometimes opens some of them up to other possibilities, but in many cases their fears of a sinful, scary world is just confirmed.  They like their little corner of the world, and refuse to accept that not everyone is like them.  Don't get me wrong, I live among some of the kindest, nicest people.  Some topics are just better off avoided at times, though.  The thought that someone might not be a Christian (be that Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Pagen, whatever) is enough to perplex many of them.

Freethought,32ouyu,rotll,2,Wed Apr 15 19:18:27 2015 UTC,Yeah in the UK all the far right groups and right-leaning centrists have no or minor focus on religion and it definitely has helped them keep support with younger people who see religion as stupid or outdated.
Freethought,32ouyu,MMSTINGRAY,2,Wed Apr 15 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"I just can't understand why a political party would want to reduce their potential support by aligning so strongly with a specific flavour of religion. I can easily understand that there are different political approaches to economic and social welfare issues, which may have some religious foundation, however, the policies of the supposed ""Christian"" Republican party in the USA don't appear to align with any Christianity I'm familiar with...  The entire system appears rigged against the rise of one or more alternative parties. Having a few more parties would allow for a broader range of opinions spanning the entire political spectrum, rather than the current mix of just two right of centre parties. (And I say right of centre based on the global political spectrum)"
Freethought,32ouyu,SumasFlats,2,Wed Apr 15 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"Because religion really is a good method of ""soft"" control and pacification, even many religious people will admit this (although normally not for their personal specific sect/belief/whatever of course).   And it seems that in the US, more than anywhere else in the ""modern western world"" has a large amount of really fanatical religious nuts. This means it is instiutionalised, you don't need to convert new people, you just need to adopt an existing movements ideals and rhetoric, perhaps even paint yourself/party as a defender of the faith and, easy as that, you have a mass of devoted people who will support you. And best of all they are less likely to evaluate your politics critically if you assure them it is Christian politics, because then criticising you is critcising Christianity! See all the medieval examples of people who questioned religion, political and social structures being brutally put down as heretics, etc even when being, what an objective person, would still call Christians.   And the two-party system, many people argue, is meant to keep the discussion of politics within specific boundaries. Everywhere you look it seems that where there are two big parties they are not that opposed. In the US the example is even more clear. For example in the UK the Labour and Conservative parties have been very similar for the past 20 years but they look world's apart compared to democrats and republicans who, despite their rhetoric, only really disagree on minor issues that have little bearing on the real running of the country. That is why in the US, stuff like Universal healthcare is viewed as extremely left wing, whereas the rest of the western world view it as a moderate leftist or centrist idea.   Now it might not be a conspiracy to have done this. Especially in Britain where looking at history makes it clear that a two-party system made sense given the social landscape, political factions, etc of the time. However what may have once been logical has now became almost a tradition, meaning it is essentially accepted without any question. So even if it isn't a deliberate manipulation of the political system it is, at best, an undermining of true democracy through negilence."

There are plenty of people out there ignoring religious morality, or even morality altogether, and this must be obvious to even religious people. So, how absolute is that morality, when it can be so easily ignored? It's not like God is going to strike people down with lightning.   I think most people can form a working morality based on empathy. Louis C.K. once said that if murder weren't illegal anymore, ""there would be so much murder!"" I disagree. I think the reason most people don't commit crimes like murder is because they don't want to, because their sense of empathy makes them dislike causing others to suffer. Of course, there are also victimless secular crimes and religious ""sins"", such drug use or homosexuality, which empathy does not prevent. And guess what, people are ignoring them en masse. Even Christians. Because in the end, most people do whatever they themselves consider right intuitively.  I also think it's absurd to say that schools ""keep teaching relativity"".

In time these ex-Christians, through personal reasons came to a place where they did not hold the beliefs anymore and turned away from them.

Telling me most feminists are armchair feminists that believe in gender equality and merely practice it in their personal spheres (much like I would have identified as feminist 10 years ago) don't really count.

He's saying that the sense of ""something ain't right"" felt by the hypothetical atheist comes from god. He's saying that this shows the atheist is wrong to deny god - because if there really were no god then there'd be no reason to feel ""this ain't right"".

God guarantees you freedom... Most mainstream religions are retarded, granted... But because their stories don't make sense doesn't mean that God doesn't exist. We have freedom of religion so we can come up with our own ideas of what god is or believe theirs. All God does is guarantees equal rights for all by being a neutral entity holding absolute power in law thus preventing psychopath rulers from ever attaining that power because absolute power corrupts absolutely.   You serve God and can not serve two masters. god is what YOU chose it to be since you have freedom of religion and the people seeking authority over you are actually equal to you since they too are under God and that's your protection.  Since God is about equality of rights to serve God is to live, defend and preach the principles of equality of right and that's how one makes peace and what makes a man a son of god. ""blessed are the peace makers for they shall be knows as the children of God""  Now reexamine the story of Jesus with this new knowledge.

I used to be an atheist, until I found proof of the existence, effect and power of the word God within the context of law. God isn't necessarily what nutjob religious people claim it is. But the law is pretty clear as to wtf God is about.  Here's an example:  http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-12.3/page-1.html  The Parliament of Canada, affirming that the Canadian Nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, the dignity and worth of the human person and the position of the family in a society of free men and free institutions;...  ...It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,  (b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;  (c) freedom of religion;  Free thinkers aren't free thinking anymore it appears"

If only you would try to explore the subject and stay within the right context and forget the preconceptions you have of what God is supposed to be within the religious context. Deception and misconception is the name of the game in this area. Religions distort the truth and purposely misinterprets things because they don't want equality, they want power. They are wolves in sheep clothing. In many respect most mainstream religion seem to represent the people who nailed Jesus to a cross, not Jesus himself. God is all about equality of rights but has COMANDMENTS!!!! riiiight.... Those are the commandments of the church, it's them trying to claim authority over people, They crave the power of God, they want to be the source of law! They attack God (equality) in the name of God basically and now Atheists are gona get rid of it for them lol. you guys are being played.  God has nothing to do with religions but religions have to do with God. Look at every religious statements staying within the context of law, nothing supernatural. Figure out how the word God is used in law and then you will understand its purpose and realize that it is the only thing protecting you against slavery and oppression because we always can revoke consent and quit since as equals, mutual consent is always required. If you remove God then the source of law becomes up for grabs. and if you think democracy is a good way to manage that power remember that democracy is mob rule and the masses are easily manipulated by the media. We already have religious leaders trying to speak for God and usurp its power, now the state is trying to become God with absolute authority... This is not going to end well... The war is and has always been between equality of rights vs oppression.   All the proof you'll ever need is in the Canbadian Bill of rights, first paragraph, right at the top  http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-12.3/page-1.html  In the context I'm talking about God is ""something"" unknown, anything and everything because of freedom of religion. It is something that holds the source of power and why human rights are GOD GIVEN. They come from a place in law higher than anyone who would wish to violate them, those are the rules of the human game, we're all born with those rights. Remove God and I guaranty you slavery, misery and tyranny. When I see this Atheist activism I'm always reminded of the prediction Albert Pike made for ww3:  ""The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the ""agentur"" of the ""Illuminati"" between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.""   http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm"

Free will (in some form other than illusion) exists from the creator YHWH that, at a minimum, has attributes of perfect knowledge of the results of YHWH's own cognitive actions and is the universe creator (i.e., Yahweh has purposeful knowledge of, and is the cause of, all actualization) Mind-body dualism (i.e., a soul), or something similar, exists; some part of the ""I"" survives physical death to exist in the afterlife An afterlife exists and that some or all of the ""I"" will have actualized existence in this afterlife Heaven exists (if Heaven can be shown to exist in actualization, then the other levels of the afterlife will be accepted) (Bonus: What, from the point of view of YHWH, is the purpose of Heaven?)

KnownEdge, can you/will you support your positive claim position(s), present an argument(s) and meet the burden of proof to support your claim(s), and then defend your argument(s) against refutation/criticism?  And will you agree to follow some simple debate rules? If the argument fails for lack of credible evidence or supportable argument, and/or for logical fallacies, then the person making the argument never brings up that argument again with anyone. Ever. Additionally the person making the argument must demonstrate that they actually understand the argument(s) being presented - a copy/paste of an argument from someone else is intellectually dishonest if the presenter does not understand it. The definition of words commonly misunderstood, like ""theory,"" will use Wikipedia definitions unless otherwise explicitly stated. Consider these Debate Rules as applicable to all parties when presenting your argument/post.  Finally, be aware of these common logical fallacies when presenting your argument/claim/assertion as the use of these fallacies will significantly reduce, or outright negate, the credibility of your argument.   The difference between a claim/assertion and credible evidence or supportable argument Circular reasoning. (e.g., The claims made in the Bible/Qur'an (or any ""Holy Book"") are true because the Bible/Qur'an says so based upon the authority of the Bible/Qur'an which says the Bible/Qur'an is the authority.)

Freethought,32gjgn,TooManyInLitter,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"ok...  My claim is that God is a word that is used to hold the source of authority in law. Now is there evidence for that?  Canadian Bill of Rights:  ""The Parliament of Canada, affirming that the Canadian Nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God  It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely...  (b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;  (c) freedom of religion  Ok, so let's look at the implications of this...  1- God is supreme in Canada, not the queen, pope, prime minister or governor general, but GOD.  2- We all have equal rights, under God... Probably why governments govern with the consent of the governed  3- And only you can decide for yourself what God is for you because you have freedom of religion.  Now if you think a little about why it's setup like that you may start to understand the purpose of God.  The way it's setup God is anything and everything. People can believe whatever they want BUT one important fact remain... Whatever they believe God to be doesn't change the FACT that as individuals they remain equal in rights under God, whatever it may be.  So when I look at the whole God thing I don't look at it from the Christian or Muslim or Jewish perspective but from the perspective of the law and human rights. Religions are interpretations of what groups of people believe God is, you can join them and accept their interpretation of form your own.. up to you. Religions are supposed to compete in order to promote and create the most egalitarian free society possible because God is about equality of rights. But instead they distort things to turn people into followers and gain authority over people.   I see God as a legal construct of sort that has been put in place to guarantee equality of right between all men. God is there so no one can ever be the source of law because absolute power corrupts absolutely, we've seen it with inquisitions, witch burning etc... those are consequences of men usurping the power of God. God having that power, and us having freedom of religion means that God is a totally neutral entity holding that power guaranteeing equal rights for all individual. So a christian and a Muslim can have very different interpretation of what God is but they remain equal in rights under God.  Here's a logical equation I came up with to simplify the whole thing...  God = euqality of rights > harmony > peace > Heaven  Devil/satan = Oppression > chaos > war > hell  Heaven and hell are not places we go after we die. it's the type of society we live in. Are we moving towards a more egalitatian society or are we moving towards oppression?  The same principles can be found in US law, but it's a bit less obvious than Canada...  Declaration of Independence  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights""  See here, they refer to God as the creator. This means origin, beginning of the universe, existence, life... and with freedom of religion, ur free to have your own theories as to how that came about. Your rights come FROM your creator. This important... it is not saying rights come from God but from YOUR God.  ""One Nation UNDER God"" This isn't referring to the christian God. it's a statement of law.  Now if you look at the story of Jesus in that context... you will get a totally different story... based on the exact same information, you can arrive at different conclusions depending on how you interpret things.  I'll summarize quickly because i don't want to spend all day going into this....  What is Jesus known for? ""Do unto others as you would like to be done unto"" Isn't that the very principles of equality of rights? Didn't he treat the poor, the rich, the sick and healthy with the same respect? Jesus served God directly and can not serve two masters. religions try to lead us to believe this means God and money but what it really means is God and the state/church. By serving God directly he's put himself in a position where he was equal in rights to the religious and state authorities. Now can you understand why the authoritarians of his day might have wanted him dead? With him going around teaching this information to the common people he was undermining their power and authority which was a fraud to begin with. That how he cured the blind and the deaf... the mentally blind and deaf not physically bind or deaf. He was publicly executed to scare people from following him and submit to their authority which was based on oppression, intimidation and fear not truth. Jesus lived, defended and preached the principles of equality of rights and that's what made him a Son of God and this doesn't mean the son of some of a magical creature in the sky... it simply means that he was a peace maker... ""Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be known as the children of God"" And you make peace by treating people as equals.  A lot of things in religion is true but misinterpreted, usually on purpose by the religious authorities because they want you under them, not under God. It's very clever how they get people to believe different things than intended, Jesus died for our sins? sacrificed himself? really? lol, he was murdered, silenced and made an example of.  And if you want to know what God (as a supernatural being) is, you will find it with DMT or Psilocybin. It appears to be the source to which all life is connected... some sort of super-consciousness we can all access.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoNVgVdzk1U  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ua5HOOQ8_8   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw9iFZMYpMU"
Freethought,32gjgn,KnownEdge,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for there reply and please excuse the lateness of my response.   My claim is that God is a word that is used to hold the source of authority in law.   In the above quoted text, the claim is not that God exists, but rather the claim is a word, or placeholder, an abstract construct, for some undefined authority upon which law is based.  With this presentation, one could argue that the point of view of the law, the source of the law, is one that attempts to be disconnected from the human condition, and the accompanying emotions, bias, conceit, etc., inherent within humans, a source that does not have a vested interest in the law beyond that of non-partiality.  If this is the argument, then cool.   However, your previous claims....   I used to be an atheist, until I found proof of the existence, effect and power of the word God within the context of law. God isn't necessarily what nutjob religious people claim it is.   read that God is an actualized entity and not an abstract construct.    And you also go on to restate some form of actualization of God in the above reply.   God is supreme in Canada, not the queen, pope, prime minister or governor general, but GOD.   And then flips back to an abstract construct.   I see God as a legal construct of sort that has been put in place to guarantee equality of right between all men.   And then back to actualization.   See here, they refer to God as the creator. This means origin, beginning of the universe, existence, life... and with freedom of religion, ur free to have your own theories as to how that came about.    So, I am left confused.  A suggestion, if make any new posts/debate this topic in the future, please provide a more coherent presentation of the term/phrase/construct/idea of what ""God"" means in your presentation.  A nit:   The same principles can be found in US law, but it's a bit less obvious than Canada...  Declaration of Independence  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights""    The Declaration of Independence is not a part of current US law nor of any foundational documents or sources for the US Constitution or law.  The DoI is essentially a bitch letter sent to England prior to the formation of the US.   Additionally, the authors of the DoI were referencing what we would currently call a non-intervening Deistic Deity/God as the ""Creator.""  Moving on.   What is Jesus known for? ""Do unto others as you would like to be done unto"" Isn't that the very principles of equality of rights? Didn't he treat the poor, the rich, the sick and healthy with the same respect?   And now we are back to a claimed actualization of God, specifically the Christian version of God, and of Jesus,  Jesus is known for being a failed Jewish Christ/Anointed One/Messiah/Mashiach claimant, and the claimed narrative of the words of Jesus present a non-evidential splinter religion based upon an exclusionary apocalyptical message where it's followers live for death at the expense of this life; and with a foundational morality that supports this position.    ""Do unto others as you would like to be done unto""   One of the claims of fame of how good the message of Jesus is to all people - this so-called ""Golden Rule"".    Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.  Luke 6:31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.  To me, a morality must do 3 things: 1. Provide a methodology to assign or judge impending and executed actions with either a positive or negative moral value on a personal, tribe and overall societal level, 2. be capable of practical implementation and 3. be something that can never be completely satisfied.  Against this framework, the above golden rule fails 1 and 2. For the 1st one, the golden rule is extremely subjective and dependent upon the personality of the person. Against the 2nd one, this rule would only be effective and fair if 100% of the people apply it equally; it fails under almost all variants of game theory. i.e., the golden pro-active rule fails to achieve and maintain a positive working morality in any condition where it is not actively applied by 100% of the population (e.g., in non-zero sum game theory), and as such it is unrealistic and of limited utility for use as a basis for an effective societal morality.  From the point of view of inclusion and of personal suffering, the morality attributed to Jesus, less the divine attributes, do not form a ""good"" and supportable morality. For the society and culture in which it was presented, the morality of Jesus was extremely liberal and progressive. However, in most of today's cultures and societies, the exclusionary and repressive morality presented by Jesus is just not good enough and most adherents cherry-pick the tenets/morality they follow - tacitly admitting that they have a sense of morality independent of their religious beliefs.   Didn't he treat the poor, the rich, the sick and healthy with the same respect?   No.  The message of Jesus is inherently exclusionary.  Christianity, and the reprehensible violence inherent in the words and actions of the Jesus, includes advocating pain, suffering, violence, and killing in the name of a splinter Jewish movement (that later came to be called Christianity).    The Parable of the Ten Minas Luke 19:27   ""But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.’”  [See here for a refutation of the argument that this verse is taken out of context as it was presented in a parable]  Not Peace, but a Sword Matthew 10:34-36  34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.  35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.  Matthew 12:30-32  30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 31 Therefore I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.  The absolute morality of Jesus (fully human, fully Yahweh) not only condones exclusionary murder, but commands it. Do not be blinded (cherry-picked) by the few verses of (exclusionary) love attributed to Jesus, the message of Jesus foundationally represents an apocalyptic messiah exclusionary movement that literally lives for death.  From the very beginning of Christianity, the founder/source/mouthpiece for Christianity, the failed Jewish Christ claimant himself, advocates exclusionary violence against non-adherents.   KnownEdge, since you are appealing to Jesus, God (YHWH?), and the Christian belief/religion, as having real actualization, the challenge I made above - for you to meet the burden of proof of some of the foundational claims of the Christian version of monotheistic yahwehism applies.     It's very clever how they get people to believe different things than intended, Jesus died for our sins? sacrificed himself? really? lol, he was murdered, silenced and made an example of.   The Gospel narratives related to the trial of Jesus are very troublesome as the trial narratives are a completely inaccurate portrayal of the actual Roman trial law and procedures in the Trial of Jesus, however, accepting that Jesus was put to trial, found guilty of some capital offense and then crucified, I agree that the non-divine explanation is better supported rather than the post hoc characterization, as presented int eh Gospels, of a blood sacrifice (some form of propitiation and substitutionary/vicarious atonement) to provide salvation for adherents.   And if you want to know what God (as a supernatural being) is, you will find it with DMT or Psilocybin. It appears to be the source to which all life is connected... some sort of super-consciousness we can all access.   And now God is a feeling (or an appeal to emotion) of some spiritual interconnectedness having a discrete cognitive capability that is accessed through the use of neurologically active compounds.  Hopefully, with my reply, you can see why I am confused as to your coherent definition/presentation of ""God."""
Freethought,32gjgn,TooManyInLitter,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"my point is simply that God means different things within different contexts. Most atheists wanting to get rid of god are talking about the christian God and I kinda agree with them, the christian god is a form of mass control tool and isn't very credible. however, what most atheists fail to see is that removing the christian god also removes it as a protection in law and that is extremely dangerous and the reason I am no longer an Atheist... I'm still a free-thinker though :)  And psychedelics aren't about a feeling. It enables you to see ""God"", for lack of a better word and communicate with it. It interacts with what you think about as you look at it. It's not like you think about it and you see it. You're not designing any of this stuff... you see it and it responds to what you think as you see it and it keeps surprising you.  You see the impossible unfold in front of your eyes, It is of a level of complexity that is simply indescribable because nothing in our reality come close to any of that stuff. What most religions refer to is the entities found in psychedelic trances but that knowledge is obscured and lost for the most part. You can decode it in art, traditions and symbolism. Like Christmas or Easter for example, they're all about the magic mushroom. but like God, there's several interpretations. kids see it one way, parents another way , same with the church and government as well as the shamans, they all have their own interpretations of the same data. Which is true? It is not entirely obvious... depends on your point of view I guess. But the more aware you become of all those different views of the same data the better idea you have of the big picture. There's a lot of disinfo around.

What is morality without discrimination?  discrimination plays an integral role in our decision making process.  But you're suggesting that capital is amoral, I suppose and this a valid arbitor in this decision making process, whereas character or identity is not.  If I don't have much money, I have to sit at the back of the bus- hell, I might not even be allowed on the bus.  So money is valid as the arbitor in business, but other values are not.  Can I chose not to sell to a person because they're an asshole?  Then why can't I chose to sell to someone representing something I find morally disagreeable?  The example I keep hearing is about not selling gay wedding cakes.  It's not even discriminating against the people, it's discriminating against the event.    If I'm a sign maker, should I have to sell the Westboro Baptist Church a sign that says ""God hates fags""?  As a person, I should be allowed to boycott people, business and cultural norms that I find morally represensable.  The way I chose to conduct business is probably the strongest voice I have.  So why should that not go both ways.  I can chose not to buy from groups I disagree with.  Why should I not be able to sell to them. I can't sell without representing a business (the truth is that I can't buy without representing a business either, but we won't get into that).  What about this Jewish group that has been putting up islamophobic ads on public transportation in NYC and Philadelphia? http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/03/11/court-orders-septa-to-run-anti-islamic-bus-ads/  Beyond the fact that this would never fly is someone tried to put up anti-jewish ads...  If I run a private transportation company which sells ad space, should I have to stand for this?  Should I be required to advertise for products or ideas that I find morally repugnant?  No way.   I respect your right to freedom of speach and ideas, but I should in no way be required to aid you in espousing them.  That's the value of being a discriminating person.  Otherwise it's all about money, and money doesn't care what your values are.  Government should not be allowed to discriminate, but individuals and groups certainly should. Let's make sure gays are given equal rights by the government before we go casting stones at private parties."

We all know what this really is all about, it's plain hatred and bigotry tarted up in a modern soundbite, but underneath it is what it is and everyone with eyes to see and a genuine sense of decent morals knows it.  You can be a discriminatory bigot in private, that is your 'right', but that shouldn't be permitted when you are in business, especially one set up to provide a service.   All humans are (or should be treated) equal. That is the most fundamental, basic right of being a human.

Freethought,32cqzd,EddieMcDowall,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, look- I just wanted to have a conversation about it, not strike a nerve.  It's very broad to say ""discrimination is morally wrong"".  I don't want to have to feel like I'm walking on egg shells to support a very valid premise here.  I'm not advocating discrimination on the basis of race or sexual preference (and conservative christians seems to adhere to the idea that sexuality IS a preference- which makes it a moral issue to them, regardless of what you or I may believe).  BUT i don't think it is inherently wrong TO discriminate based on these things, though we have seen many instances in which bigotry leads to discrimination.  Yes, you and I agree that there are marginalized groups and that the government is responsible for managing/limiting discrimination (not everyone would agree with us on that, and there ARE valid arguments to the contrary). Plessy Ferguson rightly applies to the government, which should not discriminate AGAINST disenfranchised people.    I would even go so far as to argue in favor of ""reverse discrimination""- the idea that some people deserve MORE rights due to their historic disenfranchisement.  But this should be limited to certain industries/businesses/ public and non-profit services, and specifically oriented to bring cultural balance to a society.  I personally agree with affirmative action, but again there are plenty of good arguments against it.  I also agree with the end of affirmative action which not only gives preferential treatment to blacks, but discriminatory treatment to asians- not because I have a moral problem with asians, but because culturally, they are better prepared for educational standards.  That's a personal opinion that cultural diversity is valuable.  And that idea should be differentiated from cultural relativism or placing value on homogenization and integration.  Again, the argument is about a business being told to provide a service antithetical to the values of the business owner.  If you say that the owner doesn't have a right to decide, you are ruling that there is no place more morality in business.  Why do businesses have the right to boycott Indiana, but indiana businesses don't have the right to chose the circumstances in which they chose to prove their services?  It's inconsistent.  I feel like the argument being made on your side is about not about the right to choose what to sell to whom, it's about an emotional reaction to protect a group you feel has been disenfranchised.  I agree with the sentiment, but I think it's the wrong forum."

Freethought,32cqzd,ThinkBEFOREUPost,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll try again and I'll make a concerted effort to ensure I 'sound' more reasonable.  Firstly, I genuinely believe all discrimination (with the exception of discrimination based on ability for education or employment) is morally wrong, and that, for me, includes positive discrimination.  Secondly, I am firmly of the opinion that most of the current furore over LGBT marriage is pure bigotry 'tarted up' in fancy words. It is, to me, no more than white power with another cause. Perhaps we should rename it 'Straight Supremacism'?  Finally, I think there is a huge problem with allowing 'corporate discrimination' in that if you allow businesses to pick and chose who they serve based on whatever random criteria they decide it won't be long before we'll be living in an Apartheid-like system where only those who conform to some alien concept of 'normal' are permitted to exist in peace.  So my position is clear, (I hope) however, as with all 'realities' when you examine the detail it becomes obvious a 'one size fits all' solution won't work.  I could be persuaded of the validity of extending the freedom of personal discrimination into the business of the self-employed or maybe even into businesses who employ less than 5 workers (but I'm very reluctant about the latter). I would also exempt religious institutions from being forced to 'marry'  or accept into their congregations those they feel offend their beliefs, (and I'm an Antitheist so, for me that's a huge concession), but the general principal that discrimination is morally wrong I think stands based on basic human equality.  In conclusion I think it's pertinent to remind everyone (especially Americans) of the Declaration of Independence:   We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

It shouldn't apply for anyone holding a monopoly for a particular service, or in an emergency where the lack of immediate service could cause harm.  And we need to beware of unintended consequences - Would a group that organizes a boycott of a business that, for a claimed religious reason, refuses service to homosexuals, itself be liable for discrimination against religion?  And, what if the discrimination isn't based on the intrinsically unfounded rules of some religion, but only on personal repugnance?"
Freethought,32cqzd,aescolanus,3,Sun Apr 12 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Thoughtful comment, a few points:  First, on your licensed-by-the-state argument. This quickly devolves in to just about every person, organization and business. I'm not making a value judgment in saying that, it is just a fact. Public funds course through our entire economy, and you'd scarcely be able to find a sector that doesn't have some public monies flowing to and from it.   I think monopoly for a certain service would need to be parsed down a bit more. If I construct wooden toy helicopters out of a specific species of tree, I have a monopoly on that service. I don't think you intend such a hypothetical (albeit contrived) situation to be within the borders of what you were describing. I'd say monopoly for an essential service.   On the boycott religious discrimination argument, two points. First, we accept people picketing outside the Church of Scientology all the time. You can demonstrate against whatever you wish -- so I'd say there is no concern in boycotting there. Second, the same ""tolerance"" policies contemplated by the article would, one would assume, protect individuals that choose to boycott/speak out against a given religion.   On your last point, I think that is a fundamental question that comes up whenever exceptions are made for religious grounds. Look at anti-vaccinationists. First, many states allow those objecting on religious grounds to simply sign a waiver. Then, what exactly constituted a religion was open for debate and, thus, many adopted a ""philosophical objection"" category. I would imagine that a framework such as that discussed in the article would have to do similarly.   On the article itself, at the end of the day the proposed policy is just disaggregating regulation. On the opposite end of the spectrum from the proposed policy, you have anti-intolerance mandated and policed by the state. The proposed policy just basically breaks up that regulation and distributes it to the population as a whole, with a wave and a ""If you don't like what they are doing, don't shop there"" instruction.   I think this probably works fine in some circumstances -- wherever the injection of market forces will turn winds in the direction of progressive ideals. However, in areas with more regressive policies, such a policy will just further entrench those policies. You will basically get bigot enclaves across the country. Small pockets of regressive ideals that refuse to change.   Whether or not that is a good thing is dependent on whether or not we think government should be following our principles, or helping shape them."

NFL football.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Football_League_on_television#Expansion_to_cable_and_satellite_TV   By 1990, Turner's TNT network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season. The combined 1990 contracts with ABC, CBS, ESPN, NBC, and TNT totaled $3.6 billion ($900 million per year), the largest in TV history. One major factor in the increased rights fee was that the league changed the regular season so that all teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period. ABC was also given the rights to televise the two Saturday games on the opening weekend of the postseason. This was made possible after the league expanded its playoff format to include more teams.  In 1994, the league signed an exclusivity agreement with the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service DirecTV to launch NFL Sunday Ticket, a satellite television subscription service that offers every regular season NFL game.  When contracts were signed in December 1993, CBS (which had been home to NFC games for 38 years) lost their rights to the fledgling Fox Network, and it just so happened that CBS also lost its MLB coverage (which it never recovered) after that same year. Fox offered a then-record $1.58 billion to the NFL over four years, significantly more than the $290 million per year offered by CBS. Fox was only seven years old and had no sports division, but it began building its own coverage by hiring many former CBS personalities such as Summerall and Madden.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Sunday_Ticket  You can see how FOX moved in in 1994 beating CBS, and then the bidding war where NBC lost to CBS:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_on_television#NFL_broadcasters  You can see the dollar amounts double in 1990  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_on_television#List_of_NFL_television_contracts  You can see how viewership of the SB has skyrocketed since 1990  http://www.statista.com/statistics/216526/super-bowl-us-tv-viewership/  When the networks had to overpay for the NFL, they had a huge incentive to really push the games so they wouldn't lose their shirts.

In fact, most national army warmaking hopes to coerce the attacked people into submission long before they are all murdered.  Now, it's not easy to sum up all acts and especially threats of military action — for example USA does not have to keep telling Iran that they will be attacked if/unless they do x, y and z, or even drop hints that the military is ""gearing up"" for invasion and so on. Iran feels feels plenty threatened as it is. Even if USA would explicitly give Iran two months off, ""officially threat-free"", they would still feel threatened.  And they are not the only ones. Military strategists around the world are not ignorant, they know where power lies.  We can look at the yearly report from DoD to the President and the Congress, which is put together by some of the most competent military minds in the world, and which outlines both the above points: It states that (for decades now) USA remains the only country in the world with the military capacity to pursue a sustained war beyond its national borders — meaning not just limited to defense or waring with its neighbours. It also states the goals and limits of use of its superior forces — The DoD will do whatever it takes, including unilateral (meaning one-sided aggression) use of their military superiority, to ensure uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources. [...] Guarantee freedom (for USA, so by definition removing it from everyone else) in all seas, airs, and space, and in all important communication infrastructure.  That's rather threatening.  And it's not only people who work in the military industry who notice this threat, global polls of ordinary people show USA far ahead as the ""biggest threat to peace"".  Now, USA was only an example. A better methodology to see the major currents of international terror, which is nevertheless supported by the above example, is to look at yearly national expenditures on military.  Sure, ISIS is not typically in that list, but even if they were they'd be far down.  Then there's a multiplying factor to consider — if a terrorist bomb goes off in the forest and no one is there to witness it, did it really happen? — i.e. if we have two arguable acts of terrorism, of whatever independent scale, and the media in one country never mentions one and never stops talking about the other, then which one will the public be most terrorized by?  Arguably then the society is terrorizing itself. We could even make up a terrorist group, let's call them the Chinese ping pongs. If the media in Britain talks about their hatred for the opium wars or whatnot, and so creates terror in the British population, then obviously China is not to blame, but Britain.  tl;dr - look at the religions/ideologies behind the majority of military expenditure in the world (and as it has been invested/accumulated over the last half-century), and add to that the religions/ideologies of the most influential media in the world, and it probably sums up the world's leading terrorists. Also, hamas or whoever probably pales in comparison (although national media in e.g. western countries do help them create a lot of terror, but hamas can't take credit for that)."

Freethought,31wk24,BertyBertBertBert,2,Wed Apr 8 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see sexting is it's done so that you can still be sexually ""connected"" with your partner when you're away. Just as cell phones gave rise to people calling their partner during their day, so has picture messages. It's only natural that we humans want to keep relationships alive as long as possible.   Have guys overstepped their bounds with dick pics, making them extremely unwanted and ruined it for those who, under the right conditions, want to show their partner their body in an attempt to feel the same thrill?   I think you're on to something here. The ""specialness"" (for lack of a better term) is effectively lost because of sexting. The arousal that one might feel may even be different as well in both a positive and negative way. Positively speaking, the scenario might be that a guy sends a dick pic and the girl get's horny and then the guy comes over and you know the rest. Now on the other hand the guy sends a dick pic and completely ruins the passion, racing heartbeat, and straight up horniness by just blatantly sending a dick pic. In my opinion, I would rather stay away from it because of that possibility of ruining the sexual situation."

I've always understood the reason to sext, but I've always been too afraid (for both parties) that it would somehow comeback and bite someone in the ass. People are immature. I actually knew some kid (kind of weird to begin with, but thats besides the point) who actually became a sex offender when he sent pictures of his ex around because she had sent him a picture of herself having sex with someone else to this poor kid. A real fucked up situation.   I would never send a picture unless asked for it, because society today has made guys into semi-rapists in so many ways. Talking about their butts to their face, touching them unprovoked, and the list of nastiness goes on. It just sucks for people who treat women like equals and respect them, yet we're exempt from some acts because others have made it anything but innocent and debatable rape. Thanks for the input! I'm honestly just curious about this phenomena and how it plays with gender equality in society. Blah, I don't know, I'm incredibly tired right now."

I think it's wrong but allowable for someone to decide to personally discriminate e.g. I won't hang out with [insert group here]. Or I won't ride in a bus with [insert group here]. However once you open a business I am of the opinion that you should be legally required to serve all legal persons or groups equally. Yes some will come up with the extreme example of a KKK man entering a shop in a black neighbourhood and  being refused service, and in that case that person (the KKK guy) should be served.  However, actions (and discrimination is  an action) are not without consequences, (both legal and illegal) and if that theoretical KKK guy really does drive through a black neighbourhood he (or she?) has to expect some backlash."

I think that asking the question in the earlier wording, in the context of this subreddit, is just a less long-winded way of asking the same thing.  However, I think think that normalizing discrimination is generally pretty dangerous. What about not letting WBC members open an account in your bank, or buy a house, or rent an apartment? Would you want everyone else to do the same thing, and for them to be homeless, or is it about vanity and being able to say that you were part of making their lives more difficult.  Neither one of the two outcomes sound great to me. One, increasing general unpleasantness of these people's lives is more likely to make them double down on being offensive than the reverse. Or, two, you implement an institution of shunning that is so strong in your community that they fear for their survival, and that increasingly more people find that they need to be compliant with the majority's opinions on everything.  It is pretty clear that whey Rick Santorum talks about people complying with community standards on morality, he never means that where he should feel social pressure to adjust his views wherever his views radically diverge from most Pennsylvanians or Americans."

Psychiatry has, in my opinion, oversimplified depression since the widespread acceptance of a vague, generalized serotonin/neutotransmitter-based hypothesis of etiology. For a very long time, despite what the APA or the DSM may actually say, the boots-on-the-ground psychiatrists (and, probably more often, primary care clinicians) have carried the banner of neurotransmitter imbalance and, conveniently, have an answer in their prescription pad.  Now I am not here to argue that this isn't an improvement over the preceeding prevailing thought, that mental illnesses are attributable to deficiencies of character, morality, or some divine favor. Obviously riding on the science of neurotransmitters (and the efficacy, however imperfect, of psychopharmacology) is better than victim-blaming, exorcisms, and the hopelessness of being depressed and being told it's your fault.  However, to the general public, ""chemical imbalance"" seems simple to the point that all we need is a ""chemical re-balance."" The belies the complexity of depression causes and treatments. When less than a third of people will respond to the first line of treatment for depression (regardless of what that treatment is), we need to be honest about the absolute fact that, at least so far, there is no simple explanation.  The simple explanation of depression is that it is complex, is likely caused by a variety of things that influence one another, and is very different among different people in terms of etiology and treatment.

I will say that of all the reading I've done about Jesus, the single best scholarly book I've ever read is Misquoting Jesus by Bart D. Ehrman, professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, one of the most respected New Testament scholars in the United States. It may be both one of the most accessible instances of textual criticism of the Bible and one of the strongest cases made for general ignorance of the history of the Bible, even among religious scholars.

It's not like a Jesus or some version of a Jesus somehow makes the Bible a reliable source of historical or moral or scientific or universal truths.

For the scholarly study of the life of Jesus, see Historical Jesus, for analysis of information supporting the historical existence of Jesus, see Historicity of Jesus, and for the debate over the validity of stories in the New Testament, see Historical reliability of the Gospels.   The Christ myth theory (also known as the Jesus myth theory, Jesus mythicism or simply mythicism) is the hypothesis that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels.  The Christ myth theory contradicts the mainstream view in Historical Jesus research, which accepts that many of the events described in the gospels are not historical but which still assumes that the gospels are founded on a basic historical core.  Different proponents espouse slightly different versions of the Christ Myth Theory, but many proponents of the theory use a three-fold argument first developed in the 19th century:   that the New Testament has no historical value that there are no non-Christian references to Jesus Christ dating back to the first century that Christianity had pagan and/or mythical roots.    The core tenets of the Christ myth theory trace their history back through the Enlightenment to the conflicts in the first Christian centuries.       Despite this there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical biblical scholarship that a historical Jesus did live in that area and in that time period.        However, scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus,  and the only two events subject to ""almost universal assent"" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.    Some scholars have made the case that there are a number of plausible ""Jesuses"" that could have existed, that there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was the historical Jesus.

Seems a pretty inefficient way to get my message out, in fact it might be the most inefficient way imaginable, especially if accuracy was crucial.

The reason is greek philosophy and the weak understanding of existence and reality at the time. If you have a concept in your mind, it is a form of existence we would now probably call virtual, Christ existed in this form long before the gospels were written, what the gospels do is to personify Christ, probably to make Christ more ""real"". It was a concept that something existing in your mind could exceed physical reality, especially if the concept is more perfect than physical reality.  This could possibly also explain the ""realms"" of gods, as the realm of gods is something other than our known physical reality. The realms of gods are in our minds, and in our minds we can make them more significant and more powerful, and by that make ourselves virtually more powerful.  But as virtual existence and physical existence was a blurred line, virtual power was thought to have real power too.  So it's no wonder that people sought powerful gods, and that the ultimate all powerful god quickly became dominant, and formed the basis for 3 religions.  Obviously invented by the Israelite, but since the Jews were secluded he had to be reinvented to be accessible to the rest of the Greek/Roman Empire.  At the time that Christianity was shaped, there was conflict between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire, the dominant Persian religions predated Judaism, and were likely what inspired it. So Christianity was based on Judaism that was again based on Persian religions. And then Christianity inspired Islam around year 600, and when the Arabs conquered the Persians in 634, they took Islam with them.  It is pretty clear to see how religions evolved ever stronger gods, and stronger gods were used successfully for politics and conquest. Although Islam didn't really introduce a stronger god, it introduced a merger of religion and ruling, and Muhammad spared no opportunity to stress the weakness of Christians, and Muslims were able to conquer the Eastern Roman Empire in 636, significant Christian territory that included Constantinople."

Many believers can write these inconsistencies off as part of the mystery of their faith, but there is a lot of scholarship that cast varying degrees of doubt upon a literal interpretation of the gospels, and much of this scholarship comes from the Catholic Church itself."
Freethought,31fpha,elwood2cool,9,Sat Apr 4 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"Actually there have been historians who have cast doubt on whether Jesus of Nazareth was a real person since the 18th century. And this author is correct that very few if any contemporary sources of Jesus have survived. He appears in the historical record after his death much more than during his life. It's a more credible hypothesis than you are giving him credit for, and many PhD historians have taken up the theory that Jesus did not actually exist. It's certainly not a mainstream belief, but it's not a crackpot theory either."

As I see it, comparisons are the only way to get to the heart of the matter. I would say that saying any of these violences as "" Christian"" or ""Muslim"" is isn't informative; all of our cultures have committed horrible atrocities in the name of all the religions, and every group has struggled to justify and excuse their actions while vilifying the actions of others.

Or that the only purpose was to further promote an Us vs. Them mentality.  Or that this person, who is supposed to ""Love thy neighbor"" would prefer to piss off and alienate some of them.    But, along with gusthebus's thinking, this jackass would be talking shit about every believer if he were atheist, or be an asshole in whatever way he thought he could get away with.

Freethought,310hsx,TinyBabyAlli,2,Wed Apr 1 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""religious"" thing. A lot of atheists don't like anyone who isn't also atheist. Then you have people who are racist, or bigots against homosexuality that sometimes use religion as an excuse.   A lot of people just don't like ""the other"", that is a group of people completely different then them. You'll see it in subtle ways like when people get uncomfortable if they are in a group of people and they are the only one that speaks English. Or if a barista is surrounded by computer Scientists and she can't speak their scientific mumbo jumbo.   This is partly do to culture, and evolution. We are programmed to seek out the same. The hard wired mentality is what kept our ancestors alive for millions of years. Differences were shunned, ostracized, or even killed.   We, as a species, are starting to rise above our preprogrammed messages, but there is only so much we can do each generation."

I don't believe in religion, but I find that most religions speak to open mindedness and loving everyone and accepting people, yet most religions fail to do so.  Another thing that bothers me is that religious people often give God credit for good things, but not bad things. They think god (in whichever form they believe) will fix things like cancer and poverty but it won't. If it was possible it would be done. If he's the ""creator of all"" or whatever, should he not be at fault for bad things too? That's just my opinion.

Freethought,310hsx,iongantas,3,Wed Apr 1 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with religion per se, and everything to do with the way many/most people instinctively react to cognitive dissonance - people instinctively rejecting and dismissing ideas that contradict or threaten beliefs they personally hold dear.  The basic mechanism seems to be that those cherished, core beliefs form part of their identity - they gradually stop thinking of themselves as ""a person who believes X"" and start thinking of themselves as ""an X-believer"".  When this happens disproving or even just counter-indicating their belief isn't merely disagreement with what someone thinks - it's undermining a fundamental part of their conception of who they are.  You're not just ""suggesting an alternative belief"" to these people - they perceive your actions as trying to kill a part of them, and react accordingly (emotionally, and strongly).  Similarly, the whole ""danger"" that cognitive dissonance warns us about is the possibility that a belief we hold might be incorrect.  As such it's incredibly dangerous to your existing belief-set to accept even the possibility of this new idea and assess it on its merits, as it may well turn out to have merit, and hence modify or destroy one or more existing beliefs you hold dear.  As such the game is not about entertaining and assessing the idea and rationally arguing against it, as that admits the possibility of failure.  Rather the game is to get the idea to go away without ever being properly considered, which is why people suffering cognitive dissonance tend to quickly withdraw from reasonable, adult discussion and flee into irrationality - repeating thought-terminating cliches and slogans, resorting to demonstrable logical fallacies or merely getting angry or upset and trying to terminate the conversation that way.  It's not about working out whether they're right or not - it's about stopping the other guy talking about the subject so they never have to wonder if their beliefs are right or not.  It's not a game of playing and seeing who wins - it's about avoiding playing the game at all, so you can't ever lose.  To bring this back to the point at hand, aside from curtailing the interaction in situations where someone is specifically trying to argue their beliefs, any belief-based group can shore up its bonding belief in an ongoing way by dismissing, ridiculing or otherwise demonising opposing groups or beliefs even in their absence.  Even aside from the reassuring effects of circle-jerking with likeminded adherents about how good and correct and wonderful your belief is, it's even easier to reject atheism (or theism, or liberalism, or conservatism, or whatever) if - in addition to avoiding the discussion or arming yourself with counter-arguments - you also pre-convince yourself that to believe those things would make you evil, or stupid, or gullible.  It's unreasoning, emotional armour-plating for your belief that compliments or replaces any rational justifications you already have for it, and helps you to internally justify to yourself refusing to even address the issue in discussion.  Now, the more irrational your belief the harder it is to rationally justify.  Given that I strongly suspect that both:   Irrational beliefs tend to attract people more inclined to mount irrational/emotional defences than rational ones, and That even aside from that a person who holds an irrational belief will be more inclined to resort to emotional/irrational defences of it simply because it's easier and more likely to succeed than attempting to rationally justify a fundamentally irrational position.   So yeah... certainly religion is one of the more common culturally-inculcated/irrational/uncritically-examined beliefs, but it's a long way from being the only one, and there's nothing inherent to religion about this phenomenon - it's just a common part of human psychology amongst the vast majority of humanity who don't take intentional, specific pains to consciously examine as many beliefs as possible and strive to remain rational at all times."

I only read a few of the top comments on yesterday's thread and in between facepalms that's what I saw, a lot of nothing when it comes to actual, solid, evidence-based reasons for believing. A lot had to do with arguments from ignorance, explaining how the universe came to be by assuming a deity of sorts, or just silliness like pantheism (everything is god). People just don't like accepting the reality that there is no god(s) and we simply don't have all the answers to every question.

Missions may go into orbit around the Earth, on suborbital missions that briefly fly into space and return the ashes to Earth, to other planetary bodies (such as the Moon), or into deep space. The cremated remains are not actually scattered in space, and thus do not contribute to space debris. Instead, the ashes remain sealed inside their spacecraft until the spacecraft either: (A) re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up upon re-entry (Earth orbit missions); (B) parachutes back to Earth for recovery (suborbital missions); or (C) reaches its final, extraterrestrial destination (e.g., the Moon). Only a sample is launched so as to make the service affordable.  Celestis, Inc.  and Elysium Space     offer space burial.

Because they are deep personal beliefs, and we arent talking about disagreeing we are talking about mocking those beliefs. The same way you want them to treat you with respect (which they ALWAYS do from my experience, never have I heard of or witnessed a real life example of rudeness from a religious person to a atheist).   If you dont start a conversation with a basic respect for the others persons lifelong beliefs you are an asshole. Yea, you might think you are right, but you are a shitty human being for mocking them.   You should always treat any opposing side with the most respect and best treatment possible or the conversation isnt going anywere for one thing, and they are human being above all else.

Freethought,307p8s,rmandraque,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"we are talking about mocking those beliefs.   No, we're not.  We're talking about Ron Reagan saying ""I'm not afraid of burning in hell.""  He's literally saying that he, personally, does not share a belief in hell.  I understand that these are deep personal beliefs.  That doesn't mean that people should be forbidden from expressing disagreement with them.  I'll admit that I got this conversation off on the wrong foot by talking about respect and disrespect and by being rather callous with my opinion of belief in hell. I agree that starting a conversation with a basic respect is the way to go. But the point, in this case, is that Reagan wasn't disrespecting the beliefs of Christians - he was saying that he doesn't agree with them. And this is the part where (huge generality coming) atheists are generally far more open than Christians or others belonging to organized religions. Although you wouldn't necessarily know it from Reddit, most atheists aren't offended by displays of Christian belief unless they creep into areas that are supposed to be unbiased public forums, like courthouses. They can't be too offended by simple displays of faith, since Christianity is the dominant religion in the U.S. - if they got up in arms every time they saw an expression of faith, they'd go nuts. But on the other hand, many Christians are deeply offended if they see any expression of atheist belief, like the ""Good without God"" billboards that are constantly attacked.  I'm all for mutual respect, at least until the other party proves that they deserve otherwise. I'm always willing to listen to an intelligent explanation or defense of someone else's beliefs. As an atheist living in a very religious area of the country, I just wish others would reciprocate."
Freethought,307p8s,whitedawg,2,Thu Mar 26 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I prefer to win over their trust and respect with how I act. People arent open IF you bring up religion. By why would you, as an atheist, ever give a fuck about bringing up religion? I dont really give a shit about religion.  Ron Reagan is laughing at them basically. With a smirk. Yea sure its funny, but you know some people will be bothered by it and you dont care. His attitude is a mirror of what has shaped conflicts for all of human existence. He makes an argument for atheist by atheist, and that fine, but recognize it just makes the situation worse and it makes atheist look childish."
Freethought,307p8s,rmandraque,2,Thu Mar 26 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"By why would you, as an atheist, ever give a fuck about bringing up religion?   Well, that one's easy: when other people's religion negatively affects my life or the life of those I care about. Two of my best friends are a lesbian couple with two daughters who until recently couldn't get married, due in large part to other people forcing religious beliefs into the public sphere.  It's still legal for my friend's employer to fire her for being gay, even though her sexual orientation obviously has no bearing on her job performance. I'm sure you can think of innumerable other ways in which people are forced to account for religious belief, regardless of whether they share it. On the other hand, atheists shouldn't have any effect on the lives of Christians, short of preventing us from living in a theocracy, because they have no inherent beliefs to impose on others.  I don't really think Ron Reagan is laughing at Christians - I just see him as demonstrating that people can be positive and happy without belief, and that they don't need to be scared of hell if they don't want to be. But if he is poking fun at Christianity, it's the mildest possible form of joking. In my last comment, I mentioned how atheists need to teach themselves to tolerate expressions of faith.  I'd suggest that Christians need to grow some thicker skin as well, because we live in a pluralistic culture.  It's OK to be offended if someone says ""fuck you and your religion,"" but if someone is merely smiling as they say they disagree with your beliefs, that really shouldn't be cause for offense.  Right now much of the U.S. is in a place where any disagreement with Christian beliefs or culture is characterized as an attack on believers. I'd argue that this willingness to see an attack on faith behind every corner is much more a cause of human conflict than a slightly irreverent disagreement with the concept of hell.  Edit: one other thing... you appear to be calling into question the need for this FFRF commercial to exist.  I'd argue that something like this is needed to reach out to people struggling with conflict between their disbelief and the implicit threats in Christianity of what happens to those who don't believe.  Kind of like an ""it gets better"" program for those doubting their faith.  There really isn't any way to do this without at least temporarily ""making the situation worse"" in the eyes of some Christians.  But the alternative is to tell atheists to shut up and to keep their disbelief hidden, and I don't think that's a tenable solution."

That's not so hard to understand and you're certainly not changing any minds doing anything different or by pretending they deserve respect for ideas and beliefs that deserve no respect.  People are free to believe whatever nonsense they wish, but when they bring that nonsense into the public sphere and it is accurately called out for being nonsense then that's the accomplishment. They still pass deeply discriminatory and bigoted laws based on their absurd religious beliefs and those laws continue to be overturned because they are based on absurd and bigoted beliefs.   We're not going to change the minds of assholes who believe a dead Jew is going to send you hell to burn for eternity or that some other mythical Jew wandered the desert and talked to burning shrubbery, but with enough ridicule and mockery -- which are excellent tools for stripping the self-righteous of their self-woven garments of righteousness -- but we may open the eyes of someone else who recognizes that the mockery and the ridicule are earned."

If they're trying to appeal to the public for support and/or understanding, they've hit all the wrong buttons.

I interpreted the tone of the commercial as being condescending and insecure.  People who think the way the right-wing do have a very clear-cut us vs. them mentality.

I want people in my family to put aside the silly beliefs that keep them ignorant and bigoted.

They criticize your 'choice' and feel justified because they argue according to their religious doctrine, which, unlike science, cannot be changed. Nature provides the answers to the reasonable person. Since people play out their natures, the whole moral argument is meaningless because people are not choosing in the same sense the moralists insist they must be.

Since so many people believe evolution and religion are not compatible, the general consensus anywhere (be it church or school) is that they are at odds.  As someone who was raised a Christian, I was terrified of science in school because I thought it negated everything I believed, and that is how I was taught, to a degree.  I left the public school system practically an agnostic.  Only later did I realize it didn't (unfortunately no thanks to my church though).  Both have the responsibility of separating science (at least evolutionary science) from religion, and neither is very good at it.  Now that I think about it though, I think the church is more to blame for the misinformation.  Those who never learn of evolution can easily deny its verity, but with an increase in education comes an increase in those who understand that evolution is true.  And unfortunately, it is mainly the church who claims it to be false.  You can't blame the school for teaching scientific truth, even if it misinterprets its relation to religion.

Why can't they be Islamic morals? Or humanist morals? Why do Christians hold authority?  The point in this specific case is that the government is supposed to be secular, and anyone who pushes for any policy based on religious sanction is not only in violation of the Constitution but is typically hypocritical in their cherrypicking of which ""morals"" they abide by.

If you want a sincere shot at getting anything that involves more than 8 human beings to work (and that's a generous outside number), you need to have a way of detecting and excluding assholes. Otherwise, they end up running the joint, and aside from the injustice, the oppression and the exploitation, they are assholes and can't work together any better than they work with anyone else.   That's why there's no worker's paradise or, for that matter, Galt's Gulch. Assholes. Not politics, not theory, not even religion taken as the original authors intended (except Scientology, I'd argue.). It's a lack of asshole proofing.

Asking and answering the question was difficult at first - you need tons of data - but we now have the internet.  But there's always been a rule of thumb that works quite well.    My father always told me to avoid assholes at all costs, no matter how rich or powerful they might be, because I would catch their nastiness and impose it on others. I learned, as an organizational psychologist, that his advice is supported by research on “emotional contagion:” if you work for a jerk, odds are you will become one.    That is independent of politics. It's in alignment with Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism and Social Dominators, but it's a more pragmatic and perhaps more useful way of looking at it, because it allows us to stop arguing doctrine and politics, realizing that those ideas are being used by unreasonable people to beat us into submission."

What will the Jewish kid, or Muslim kid, or Hindu kid do while everyone is reading from the bible in class? Play along?   Religion is a personal thing.

If there is a god, I'm pretty sure he'd be ok with us trying to figure out wtf is going on.  What religion does is takes the answers people have found from that curiosity and puts those thoughts into stone.  That's when it becomes something other than curiosity.  It becomes an identity, one that the ego will defend at all costs.  When that kind of separation is created, people are capable of some terrible things.  Saying ""I'm not sure"" is a completely acceptable answer in any circumstance.

Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume that we are the center of the universe. God looks astonishingly like we do! Or we turn to look at our shadow, and assume that all is darkness.

Even if true, it does support the idea that we are becoming more peaceful. The conclusion that violence and war are declining remains the same.   If great powers have avoided direct armed conflict, they have fought one another in many proxy wars.   Even if true, that still marks a decrease in overall violence. The conclusion on the decline of violence and war remains the same.   While it is true that war has changed, it has not become less destructive. Rather than a contest between well-organised states that can at some point negotiate peace, it is now more often a many-sided conflict in fractured or collapsed states that no one has the power to end.   The conventional thinking on war is that if it must happen, it should be quick and decisive to minimize suffering and loss of life. If what he says is true, then this represents a practical realization of this doctrine, which means the conclusion that violence and war is on the decline is true.   It may be true that the modern state’s monopoly of force has led, in some contexts, to declining rates of violent death.   This undermines his main point.   Estimating the numbers of those who die from violence involves complex questions of cause and effect, which cannot always be separated from moral judgments. There are many kinds of lethal force that do not produce immediate death. Are those who die of hunger or disease during war or its aftermath counted among the casualties? Do refugees whose lives are cut short appear in the count? Where torture is used in war, will its victims figure in the calculus if they succumb years later from the physical and mental damage that has been inflicted on them? Do infants who are born to brief and painful lives as a result of exposure to Agent Orange or depleted uranium find a place in the roll call of the dead? If women who have been raped as part of a military strategy of sexual violence die before their time, will their passing feature in the statistical tables?   This is about the only part of the article where I agree. If you are going to make a bold statement that violence and war are on the decline, you need to make sure your data is rock solid.  However,   While the seeming exactitude of statistics may be compelling, much of the human cost of war is incalculable.   This is as much true of the past's wars as the present.  Then he goes into some conjecture about historical conflicts and what-ifs and so on. Obviously, I have cherry picked here, but those seem to be his main talking points. It's pretty weak overall.  I happen to agree with him that in a lot of ways we are just as violent and war-hungry as we have ever been. However, the face of war and violence have changed, so it's hard to compare the present to the past. What are millions of people hacked and arrowed to death in a great medieval war compared to millions killed in bombing raids during a world war? Is one worse or better than the other? Do the numbers alone tell us the tale?  You don't have to resort to these weak logical points and fantasizing about ""what-if Lenin was assassinated in 1918"" and so on. It's tiresome."

Freethought,2z0q6v,cigerect,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:14:19 2015 UTC,"Dyad (sociology):       Sociology defines dyad (from Greek dýo, ""two"" or sanskrit ""Dayadaha"") as a group of two people, the smallest possible social group. As an adjective, ""dyadic"" describes their interaction.  The pair of individuals in a dyad can be linked via romantic interest, family relation, interests, work, partners in crime, and so. The relation can be based on equality, but may be based on an asymmetrical or hierarchical relationship (master-servant).  The strength of the relationship is evaluated on the basis of time the individuals spend together, as well as on the emotional intensity of their relationship.  A dyad can be unstable because both persons must cooperate to make it work. If one of the two fails to complete their duties, the group would fall apart. Because of the significance of marriages in society, their stability is very important. For this reason marital dyads are often enforced through legal, economic, and religious laws.   Dyadic friendships refer to the most immediate and concrete level of peer interaction, which is expanded to include new forms of relationships in adolescence - most notably, romantic and sexual relationships. Already Ferdinand Tönnies treated it as a special pattern of gemeinschaft, 1887, as community of spirit.

A sudden communication between two strangers in the street and not continued afterwards or not having lasting aftereffect on each other can not be termed as dyadic communication."

Personally I think religion is the issue here. I believe the sun will come up tomorrow,  justified by the fact it's come up ever since I could remember. At the same time that is faith as well. I have no proof the sun will rise. Everything involving the future has to be taken on faith. After all you could die tomorrow or even this minute.   But faith doesn't kill or hurt people.

It's not exactly 1, but it's close enough that I don't have to worry about it.  Your concluding argument does not works either, because faith is the basis for most religions whose dogma is harmful.

Your right, the probabilty that the sun will rise approaches 1 to a very high degree. HOWEVER IT IS NOT 1.  The problem is not faith, but rather belief as a whole. If you believe in something, no matter if you have all the reasons in the world, there is no proof that your belief is still not wrong at the end of the day.  All I can do is reitirate Russell once again, the problem isn't Faith or Belief, but rather the Belief that we are right."
Freethought,2ypem8,Owlsdoom,4,Thu Mar 12 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't follow your argument. We assume the sun will rise in the morning because there is strong evidence to support such a claim. We know with a high degree of certainty how stable the sun is (it's extremely unlikely it will explode any time soon) and we know how the planetary orbits work for all the bodies in the solar system.  In other words, with all the knowledge we have about the world we can predict some aspects of nature with a very high degree of certainty, even though it's not with 100% certainty. And this is not faith, rather it is an accurate educated guess based on provisional knowledge.  But, everyone are destined to make some assumptions. For example, I assume I exist and that the world as I perceive is real. And I assume that inductive- and deductive reasoning stand on its own without needing justification. However, I do admit that these beliefs are assumptions that somehow could change. So this isn't faith either. Faith is blind belief without evidence. It's special pleading where a specific belief is considered above scrutiny or where counter-evidence isn't perceived as useful or valid. If people assumed a supernatural god existed, then there wouldn't be a problem. They would then change their minds as soon they were introduced to new better information or were given a good enough reason to leave the assumption. Clearly that's not the case, so faith is not equivalent to an assumption."
Freethought,2ypem8,Madsy9,1 point,Thu Mar 12 10:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I think you are just a little biased here. The biggest problem is that we aren't agreeing on what faith is, and I certainly don't believe faith needs to be defined with negative connotations.   To me faith comes before belief, and if anything belief is more dangerous than faith. A solid understanding on what faith is, and how it relates to the general idea of belief is needed here. Faith is typically referred to as an irrational belief, confidence or trust in something, be it a person, ideology or religion. A much simpler and more accurate definition is that it is simply belief without a Proof in the logical sense.  However you must hold faith in something, even if it just the fact that things can be definitively proven, or otherwise you will never reach the status of a belief.  Now the funny thing about beliefs is that you can hold them with or without just cause. Every belief is justified on what we consider subjectively to be right reasoning and good cause.   At least with faith someone will tell you I don't know why I believe it, or I can't explain why I believe it. Any other form of belief comes from a place of CERTAINTY. And if you are certain about any of your beliefs then you haven't read enough Russell.   ""I would never die for what I believe in. After all I could be wrong. ""  He understood it was never the nature of belief or faith that was the problem,  but rather the belief that your beliefs were certain. That they were correct, and right and beyond reprisal.   So I will never take umbrage with a man who tells me he has faith the sun will come up. That's just a man who has seen how far the lines of causality stretch, shrugged his shoulders and said what will happen will happen. The universe made it this far I'm sure it has some idea what it's doing.  However the man who says oh well here is a laundry list of reasons why this will happen and that will happen and this is the outcome is just a man who hasn't seen enough to be proven wrong yet.  Now in the first example we take aim at religion because they mutate that trusting faith into blind obedience in the rightness of their belief,  through as I said, religious Dogma.  In the second I'm merely warning all academically minded people to be aware of the results of their own inner beliefs through, you guessed it, scientific dogma. The men who are remembered aren't the ones who kept the status quo, but the ones with strength of vision to change the status quo.   When Mandelbrot broke the news that there was an infinite amount of infinities it drove him mad. And part if the reason was his peers steadfast refusal to believe that their own beliefs are wrong.  Scientific certainty holds back science as much as religious certainty does, and the problem in both cases isn't faith, it's instilled belief that one is absolutely correct through the application of dogma."
Freethought,2ypem8,Owlsdoom,0,Thu Mar 12 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"What about ethically hopeful heuristics?  Suppose that, regardless of whether or not Religion A is true, things pragmatically turn out better due to behaviors generated by unverifiable beliefs in the tenets and cosmology of Religion A.  The tenets and such would be held purely on faith, but the belief in that faith's pragmatic effects would not itself be held on faith but instead empirically tested.  It would be possible to drop that faith based on those tests, so it is not ""blind"" faith; but at the same time, for that faith to have its intended effect, it is possible that it must be strongly held belief in the tenets despite their unverifiability, and not merely weakly held belief in their efficacy.  In such a case, one could argue not only that this brand of faith is good for them (because of the effects), but also that it is an ethical obligation for them because it is good for them, relatively speaking.  This sort of faith need not be for a religion.  A person could have this sort of faith in science as well, for even if we are more adept at truthfinding when axioms are held as mere suppositions; perhaps we are better at producing ethical results in the study or application of science when certain axioms are held in faith.  IMO, this is a question that is really best answered at an individual level, but ironically only if the person were open to having their mind changed.  So I see faith and scientific empiricism as tools that can potentially work hand in hand.  To ignore one for the sake of the other would indeed be ""blind."""
Freethought,2ypem8,Tioben,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"but ironically only if the person were open to having their mind changed   In my experience, this is the #2 issue with faith:  It's sorta the opposite of having an open mind to having your beliefs changed. In many respects it can be defined as ""belief despite the evidence.""  For me, its not faith but imagination that works hand-in-hand with science.  The #1 issue with faith, is that knowledge gained through it can never be discerned from fooling oneself."
Freethought,2ypem8,TallahasseWaffleHous,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're trying to say here. It seems you're trying to set up religious faith against the assumptions required to justify the scientific method, and then conclude they are equal. Is that a correct assessment?"
Freethought,2ypem8,Madsy9,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly claiming that we should judge beliefs not on the content of the beliefs, nor on the method of coming to those beliefs, but by the actual effects of the beliefs in our lives.  For instance, I reject beliefs in conservative interpretations of Leviticus because of the (scientifically proven) harm that belief has done to LGBT homeless youth -- not because of any argument about how the beliefs themselves fail to be testable.  I wouldn't claim that God as my own even if I could prove he really existed.  On the other hand, suppose scientists eventually discover humanity's longterm survival requires genetic inheritance of cruelty.  So some people very reasonably adopt a philosophy that eschews compassion and promotes cruelty.  I'd still rather be neighbor to the irrational religious fanatic who maintains faith in a compassion-demanding God.  Their faith has value regardless of whether or not the beliefs to which it refers are accurate.  Now, suppose we find out someday that the universe operates in such a way that the scientific method has actually been terribly inaccurate this whole time (something something p-values, haha).  That, hypothetically, the best fruits of our labor hasn't been the method itself but rather a combination of accident, tenacity, and placing a high value on discovery.  Would I regret any pure, unadulterated faith that any scientists have secretly placed in the scientific method up till now?  Of course not!  Without the method, it's unlikely the scientific age would have exploded like it has in the first place!  So faith in the scientific method, as well, can be justified even if, hypothetically, the scientific method itself could not be."
Freethought,2ypem8,Tioben,2,Thu Mar 12 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. Dogma may be behind the actions but without Faith, there would be no Dogma. If Critical Thinking and evidence-based reasoning are the anti-virus software, Faith is the backdoor.   You can scrutinize the Dogma all you want but if the person values Faith, you will never get anywhere."
Freethought,2ypem8,fromkentucky,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is the biggest problem with this whole conversation. Faith is not synonomous with Religion. Religion is an entity that prays on Faith and turns faith into unquestioning belief through Dogma.  Faith is belief without proof. I simply offer the suggestion that nothing is provable beyond a shadow of a doubt. You can have faith in anything, from god to a girlfriend.  The difference here is if I have Faith I will say, I don't know why but I believe my girlfriend will never cheat on me.  If I have reasonable cause for Belief I will say, well she's never cheated on anyone before, she always tells me where she is, I know this and that, etc. etc. and I will provide a framework to hinge that belief on.  In both cases however, no matter if you have no proof or evidence, or if you have all the proof and evidence, you can still be proven wrong. That is indisputable."
Freethought,2ypem8,Owlsdoom,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:41:33 2015 UTC,"I understand faith to be a belief adopted by arbitrary choice, with no basis on evidence or reason.

Dangerous because, lacking any objective basis for this belief, people of faith tend to attribute their belief to a higher supernatural and undisputable authority from which they assume the right to act without compunction."
Freethought,2ypem8,alvarezg,-2,Fri Mar 20 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with sentiment, but I would prefer belief instead of faith.  Just as they pointed out, it's a subtle shift, but using the term belief connects religion to 'make believe'.    Faith is more akin to trust.  I have faith my significant other won't cheat on me.  I have faith my parents will always be there for me.  I have faith that god is looking over me.  That could be hard to break because it's not the removal of faith, just the faith in some things.  Belief is confidence in something with no evidence to support it.  I used to believe in Santa.  I used to believe the sun set somewhere in Arizona.  I used to believe god created us and the world without evolution.  Make believe is for children.  Don't believe anything, instead have faith in the scientific methods that have given us all the scientific knowledge and tools that we have today."
Freethought,2ypem8,audiostatic82,10,Wed Mar 11 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"No, you have that backwards.  To ""believe"" something simply means to hold an idea to be true, whether it's based on evidence or not. Your beliefs are simply your mental model of reality, your worldview.  It's faith that is held to be true regardless of the evidence.  Faith is a subset of belief."
Freethought,2ypem8,Hypersapien,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"See this is the thing I mostly disagree with.  Faith is not a certainty that you are right regardless of evidence. Faith is the giving up of conscious knowledge as an answer to a question. You may most certainly believe that you are correct regardless of evidence, but it would be more correct to say that a person with faith admits to not knowing, more than to knowing.   To say I don't know that the sun will come up, but I believe it will regardless is faith. To say I KNOW the sun will come up, even though I have no proof is not faith. That is stupidity.  Of course I understand the two are easy to confuse, especially in a religious sense. Faith is often used more in the second, where it is used at the reason to justify the irrational belief. That doesn't mean that is what it is though.  The people who use faith in the correct sense you will find identify more as agnostics, where they can say something like I don't know what's going on but I have Faith something is going on.  To be clear Faith is not absolute certainty in a belief."
Freethought,2ypem8,Owlsdoom,5,Thu Mar 12 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"As the other comment says, that's the wrong way around. Faith means belief without evidence. But belief itself can be justified or not.

If I believed the moon was made of cheese in the absence of any evidence, that would be more like faith."

Freethought,2ypem8,ianyboo,0,Wed Mar 11 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I think everybody has some faith in things. It's impossible to verify every facet of reality for yourself. There are things like faith in your loved ones or faith in yourself, or just faith that, in the grand scheme of things, the way we perceive the world is largely correct or at least adequate. It doesn't have to be blind faith, though. It doesn't have to be belief without evidence. For example, I think the existence of modern technology, that is, applied science, is a fairly good reason to have faith in the scientific method. One just has to be careful to not let that become an unjustified belief that this method is perfect or infallible. I think it's a delicate balance. If we constantly question everything, we are paralyzed and get nothing done, and it's really bad for our mental health. On the other hand, if we completely stop all questioning and have blind faith based on belief without evidence, we become fundamentalists, and no progress will ever get made, either. This is why faith must always be to a degree a personal decision."

In principle you could, but what's the point? If the application doesn't do what you want, there's another that does, unless your needs are incredibly specific.  Open source / closed source aren't inherently good or evil.  They're merely business or personal decisions.  There are personal hobby projects that are completely closed-source, and there are major corporate projects that are quite open and free with their open source licenses.

If you read a few blogs, especially of ex-muslims, or check out the clergy project you may get an idea how many questioning, unbelieving folks there may be all over the world trapped in a religious community   Sure, but that does not in any way imply that all the worlds ills are caused by religion, or that if it weren't for religion that men and women would be perfectly equal or nobody in the world would give a shit who anyone liked to rub their genitals against.  Some people are just prejudiced, and while religion can certainly help encourage and propagate prejudices:   It can also help to fight them (such as through admonishments to be charitable and generous to the poor, etc). It's not remotely necessary for prejudice to exist, since even we irreligious people are perfectly capable of being prejudiced and bigoted for cultural, social, or our own individual psychological reasons. Even where someone is explicitly using religion to excuse or encourage bigotry, that doesn't mean the religion is necessarily the cause of the bigotry - it might just as easily be a convenient excuse to indulge in bigoted, abusive, sadistic or otherwise antisocial impulses they have for quite unrelated reasons."

If you are in a place that bans the questioning of religion, and you question religion (regardless of your reasons or methods), you should not be surprised when you go to jail.  Ideally, you  do so in a way that actually moves society towards changing those laws - at the great personal cost of still being a criminal since you committed your acts when they were illegal.  If your society is not ready to make that change, then you're just ruining your life for no gain, and while I might have sympathy for you I'm not going to be outraged on your behalf.  You knew the laws and chose to violate them for no reason other than your own moral convictions.  In any country with rule of law, if you strongly believe in doing something illegal, have logical reasons why that thing should not be illegal, and do that thing, you will still be convicted if caught."

I honestly think it would be extremely difficult to say whether religion has balanced its bad effects with its good, but throughout history men have apparently insisted on some type of religious outlet, not only for their personal lives but for the societies they've constructed. When people look for meaning in their lives, religion is there as an off-the-shelf ready-made purpose that seems to do the job. I'm not saying everybody uses established religion to fill that need, but enough to make it a powerful presence in our culture, even in our secular times.  (Personally, I think the eastern religions--which seem to get a pass from most anti-religious people--are more a waste of life than the western religions.

It hangs on primarily due to the religious fervor of its members and almost no evidence supporting it's efficacy at all. Historically required of those involved in the legal system, AA has been a thinly veiled monotheistic religious effort to coerce those struggling with chemical addiction to participate in religiously based activities and beliefs (potentially against their will) and during a time when they are likely the most vulnerable.  I live in the bible belt and am the only clinician in the city I live in (that I'm aware of) who works with people who could be classified as ""chemically dependent"" to control, as opposed to completely discontinue, their use. I've been doing it for years with non-court ordered clients with exceptionally high success rates.  It's amazing what can be accomplished when people aren't coerced into treatment and get to set their own goals for their lives. That's not to say that abstinence shouldn't be an option, or isn't the best option for some clients, but either way, clients should be given choices with regards to how they approach treatment and belief in god in no way equals or predicts successful treatment outcomes."

I'm sure you'll find a positive correlation (at least to some point) between AA participation and drug use reduction.   the method is not  of  ""disempowerment, shame, and reliance on something outside yourself"", it is a method of realizing that you have no control over your addiction, that's presicly what defines an addiction, if you had control over it it would not be an addiction, just like you would not have control over being schizofrenic; that you have no control over your disease, and that yes, addiction is a disease; the last thing you want a schizofrenic or an addict to believe is that they are in control over their own mind that they know what is real and what is best. one of the main things in treating schizofrenia is presicly to make them undrestand that they cannot trust themselves cause their mind can not be trusted. same thing for addicts, 1 of the most important lessons they must understand is that they are not in control of their own mind and actions, that they know that what they are doing is detrimental to themselves and others and still continue to do it. why would anyone want to let and promote more selfreliance to someone that has proven over and over they can't rely on themselves to make the correct move?  and BTW speaking of efficacy, just like ""No experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

I have been sober for a year and a half and before that I tried therapy, counselling, etc. I don't think AA triggered any kind of epiphany I think what happened is that I became ready to stop drinking. If I had never gone to AA I might have still stopped but it was a catalyst, and it also provides me with the reference of a group of like minded individuals who can relate to my shit. I haven't done the 12 steps but I plan to go through a form of them that suits my needs. I don't see the harm in using the steps as a framework to evalute my behaviour and identify triggers. Letting go of some of the things I've done in my life and trying to be a better person. That said I do interpret them in my own way and remove all the ""god"" stuff as it's not useful.   It's too bad that the success rates are so low; perhaps it has to do with the faith based approach, or how dogmatic they are.

In my idea my idea of doing the steps it is simply trying to figure what each one means to me and then applying that principle to my life as best I can.  If it is onerous or counterproductive or cannot be explained to me by someone I trust - then out the fucking window it goes.  I have sat in meetings where some twit spent an hour expounding on what the dash in the middle of the first step really means.

I'm sure there as some groups that suck, that are too ferverous, that are too dogmatic, etc; but that is fault of the people, not the AA philosophy or program; like I said to smokeinhiseyes:  ""none is obliged to do shit, none is obliged to belief in anything; all that is offered is a method; you can try it or not, you can commit as much as you want to it or not, you don't even have to be sober to attend the meatings. it's the offering of a method, and support from other people using that method, nothing more nothing less.""  ""also it doesn't reuquire belief in god, it doesn't even require a belief in anything, only to recognize that there is a higher-power meaning a power that is greater then you, your ego; your addiction can be a higher power, the government can be a higher power, the world at large, the universe can be a higher power; your biology can be a higher power. like I said you aren't obliged to follow anything in AA, all there is are sugestions, methods; there's even the expression often used there: ""take what you like and leave the rest"". only rules is you can't speak in meetings if you're not sober for more then 24h, and you have to actually be strugling with addiction to be there, not some tourist.""  also to call it pseudoscience is wrong. it is certainly not science, neither is it pseudoscience cause it not presented as scientific in the first place."

Freethought,2y2192,harsesus,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it ""has no valid evidence"". You are missing the point. The value of this paper is in demonstrating the correct method to interpret such data. When you read other reports claiming that ""by their own figures, AA has only a 5% success rate"", they are using the exact same figures as in this paper and misinterpreting it. This paper shows the correct way to assess the numbers--whether the authors are in the program or not, the math is the same. The weak point is the numbers themselves--they are self-reported and as such as liable not to be as accurate as we would like.   Another point is AA's claim that the program works if the person ""really tries."" How to quantify whether someone is really trying is extremely difficult if not impossible, since it is a subjective judgment. However, one behavior that would be expected of a person who ""really tries"" is meeting attendance, so the authors of this paper used a three-month criterion as evidence of a person's effort. It is also difficult to define success, so the authors arbitrarily chose one year of continuous sobriety as the definition. Using these criteria, the numbers, such as we have, indicate that out of 100 people who walk through the door for any reason (voluntarily, under court order, etc.), 26 of them will attain at least one year of sobriety, and out of 100 people who attend AA for three months, 56 of them will achieve at least one year of sobriety. This translates to an overall success rate (defined as one year) of 26%, and 56% for those who ""really try"" (defined as attending AA for three months)."

I see many who were betrayed, in a sense, by religion. They can't/haven't forgiven, and it's not helped by being bashed over the head all the time with religious presence/assault and possibly having to lead a ""secret life"" of sorts in a land where asking where people go to church remains normal in many places, and answering that you're an atheist is not going to gain you much points.  By contrast the average german or swiss atheist might have gone to church a few times as a kid, but doesn't really bother with it (and isn't bothered by it), only encountering religion for baptisms, weddings and burials because that's traditional and it makes the old folks happy.

For myself, an English Antitheist now living in China I just cannot be arsed to get angry, and tbh both in the UK and China have very few reasons to do so. I don't think I've ever been confronted irl with a religious person attempting to form an argument or even respond to mine. (That said, when living in the UK I didn't live in any areas with large Muslim communities).

Freethought,2xt3fr,jediknight,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:43:56 2015 UTC,My intuition tells me that you are right. In the general population I guess that most atheists end up leaning on science more. This means that the world they see is a tiny bit more predictable than the one that the average religious sees. Predictability should correlate with less anger since the source of anger is often optimism (thinking that the world would go one way and getting angry when it goes the other way).

Not spiritually rich, not rich with friends, but money rich, and in spite of all of christ's teachings these stupid christians let guys with names like, Creflo A. Dollar(I did not make that up!) take advantage of ignorant people and their fears. Joel Osteen is also a prosperity gospel preacher, and a hilarious person to watch.

These shows gave me a little bit of hope. There was this person in the TV telling me that I was loved by a god who wanted me happy. No one around me was going to help me, so I prayed a lot and listened to these shows to keep just that little bit of hope.   When I started breaking away from the church and realized there really wasn't anyone listening, not on earth or in heaven, I almost jumped off a building. I was so lonely. So hurt. And no one cared anyway. No one would have missed me.   It's all fun and games to laugh at people who believe these things, but at least for a little while they gave me some hope. I wish anyone who actually knew me in real life had been willing to get to know me and reach out to me, talk to me, be my friend. Maybe someone would have noticed how desperate I was to be free from the abuse I was suffering.   And that's the reality. People need hope, and there isn't a lot of it in real life. God, or what passes for it, gives it to them. Maybe if we, as human beings, spent more time giving hope to others instead of arguing over weather or not the dress is blue or gold we could get somewhere."

I grew up in a very catholic family, and I was forced to attend church every sunday until the first Gulf War started(I was like 8 or 9 at the time). I began to ask my parents, the priest, and others why we were killing people when Jesus told us not to. They could not give me a satisfactory answer so I left the church.   I have as much sympathy for your story as I would if you said, ""I used heroine to get through my hard time."" In fact, I have less sympathy for you then a heroine addict. You were weak and rather than try to do the right thing you joined a group that oppresses people, and you gave it the strength of your presence.

The fact that you would suggest that being on heroin, shooting up, slowly killing myself and harming those around me is worse than quietly taking comfort in a god who cared about me... That's exactly why I turned to a god instead of to other people.   Blind hatred, loathing, and resentment are on both sides. And that's why I'm ashamed to be associated with most atheists.   For the record, all of my children have been encourage to think for themselves, not follow anything blindly. None of them care for religion. But I would support them regardless because I love them.

I call my system ""street-smart feminism"":  there is no substitute for wary vigilance and personal responsibility.   It's really refreshing to see someone who identifies as a feminist who understands there a difference between causally contributing to an incident and being morally to blame for it.  I know there are bad people in the world who will rob me given half a chance, so if I go wandering down dark alleyways and I get robbed, my decision quite clearly causally contributed to my getting mugged, even though morally it's still entirely the fault of the mugger.  And likewise, despite the fact that in an ideal world I morally should be able to wander down dark alleyways, even on my own, drunk and waving fistfuls of notes, in practice I can help to reduce the chances of being robbed by refraining from doing so.  Instead, much of modern feminist thought is so poor at differentiating between causal contribution and moral culpability (or if we're being charitable, is so concerned with other people conflating them) that all too often feminists will criticise people offering sound, pragmatic advice that will empirically help prevent attacks and keep women safe because they believe that in an ideal world it shouldn't be necessary, or that to acknowledge that such precautions are even effective might encourage people to morally blame victims who neglected to follow it and had something bad happen to them.  Of course in practice what this often leads to is a toxic, reality-denying, infantalising worldview where there's no such thing as taking personal responsibility for your own safety, and where it's more important to push the ideological party line even if it empirically leads to more women actually being victims of rape or sexual assault.  This whole idea of ""why don't we just teach rapists not to rape"" is about as native as criticising someone for advising locking your front door when you leave the house, because ""why don't we just teach robbers not to steal?""."
Freethought,2x5kyu,Shaper_pmp,6,Thu Feb 26 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a feminist, and I too have gotten tired of people not bothering to distinguish the two, but I still disagree with you. Let's see if I can't explain where I'm coming from:   criticise people offering sound, pragmatic advice that will empirically help prevent attacks and keep women safe because they believe that in an ideal world it shouldn't be necessary,   I think there's a sort of disconnect here. We don't have a time machine. there's no way to un-rape the person. Advising this person on what they should have done is useless. Additionally, I find that a lot of people use this point as a sort of smokescreen to avoid doing anything more productive. It's very easy to say to oneself 'I did my part to help people get raped less. I gave that poor girl some advice.' But that's pretty much useless. I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who isn't aware that walking down a dark alley alone is a bad idea. I mean, sure some people have no common sense, but it's not like feminists aren't aware of that. I could give you tens of different links to blogs full of tips for stuff like how to detect date rape drugs, how to disable someone significantly larger than you, recommendations for apps to automatically call the cops if something goes wrong when you're walking in a dark alley, apps for easily scanning sex offender databases, tips for how to use your car keys as a weapon, and about a million other things. I mean, I'm not going to argue that literally every female has a perfect memory for all of these tips always, but I think you'd be surprised at just how much effort a typical woman puts into not getting raped. Ask your mom sometime if you don't believe me.  People aren't criticizing the fact that the advice was offered. They're:  a.) pointing out that offering the advice wasn't particularly useful    b.) pointing out that there are other, more useful, ways to prevent rape and c.) trying to use the tragedy as a teaching moment to make people aware of other related but less dramatic problems with society, that someone could easily be contributing to without realizing it.   Of course in practice what this often leads to is a toxic, reality-denying, infantalising worldview where there's no such thing as taking personal responsibility for your own safety,   There's a difference between ""I don't want to take responsibility for my own safety given the current state of the world."" and ""I want to do everything in my power to create a world where I no longer have to take such drastic measures to protect myself"". The first, obviously, is just lazy and useless. The second, while certainly more focused on a goal and not so much the nitty gritty details of how to achieve it, is still definitely a worthwhile ideal. Identifying that ideal is the first step to working towards it.  I won't deny that there are useless teenagers who call themselves feminists and just complain about things without fixing anything, but thanks to the wonders of the internet, I can find the idiots in any group you care to name. The reason the stupid feminists get a lot more headlines is because  a.) Feminism is inherently trying to break down and change the current system of society, so people who do that poorly(either because they're corrupt, stupid, or whatever) can easily be interpreted as just smashing stuff without contributing anything.  b.) A lot of people don't like to confront the idea that they're doing something wrong, so they'll try and find excuses for why the person criticizing them is wrong instead.  c.) Alpha-male type men who are used to being on top, and believe their rightful place is at the top are naturally going to complain when people knock down their towers and do everything they can to discredit the progressives because they see the change as a net loss to their position.   This whole idea of ""why don't we just reach rapists not to rape"" is about as naive as criticizing someone for advising locking your front door when you leave the house, because ""why don't we just reach robbers not to steal?"".   This is just straight up absurd. Sure, it's a lot of work, but can anyone seriously argue that the costs of teaching people to not rape/tolerate rape outweigh the benefits? Sure, maybe our current generation of adults are too set in their ways, but that's why there's a big push in feminism to a.) teach kids to be gender inclusive, and b.) prevent other people from teaching kids to be sexist.  TL;DR It's not 'let's teach people to not rape/tolerate rape instead of teaching people to defend themselves.' Us feminists are trying to say 'teach people to not rape/tolerate rape so eventually people won't have to defend themselves, but in the meantime, here are some sources for how to defend yourself.'"

Freethought,2x5kyu,lordwafflesbane,4,Thu Feb 26 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"With respect, no, you weren't (or at least, it certainly didn't come across that way).  When I said:   all too often feminists will criticise people offering sound, pragmatic advice that will empirically help prevent attacks and keep women safe because they believe that in an ideal world it shouldn't be necessary, or that to acknowledge that such precautions   And in response you said   Advising this person on what they should have done is useless   Look at the tenses of both quotes - I'm talking about advising people of preventative measures before anything happens, so they're less likely to get attacked in the future.  You took this very plain, simple suggestion and without even mentioning (or apparently realising) changed it into a past-tense advocacy of criticising victims who have already been raped.  I appreciate this wasn't deliberate or disingenuous on your part, but it is exactly what I meant when I said:   all too often feminists will criticise people offering sound, pragmatic advice that will empirically help prevent attacks and keep women safe because they believe that... to acknowledge that such precautions are even effective might encourage people to morally blame victims who neglected to follow it and had something bad happen to them.   I made a comment advocating teaching people how to minimise their chances of being attacked, and complaining that some people criticise that approach because they conflate it with blaming victims for not taking those precautions after they've been attacked.  In response you immediately conflated the two issues, and twisted what I said into ""blaming victims for not taking those precautions after they've been attacked"".  I do agree with an awful lot of what you say in your comment, but honestly I'm not sure it's possible to provide a much stronger demonstration of my point. :-(   I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who isn't aware that walking down a dark alley alone is a bad idea.   Honestly, it's really not hard.  Given a lot of feminists (including you!) routinely mistake ""sound pre-emptive advice"" for ""post-hoc victim blaming"", it happens all the time.  I've literally lost count of how many times I've seen posters in 2XC or /r/feminisms criticise and condemn posters for even acknowledging that there's anything women can do to alter the probability they might be attacked, and defend their ""moral right to walk down a dark alleyway without being raped""... as if that has anything to do with the issue of whether walking down dark alleyways is - pragmatically - likely to increase your chances of being attacked (silly example because most rapes aren't the classic ""leap on you from a dark alleyway"" stereotype, but you get the point as a placeholder for any reasonable precaution one could take).  Another great example of this tendency to put ideology over pragmatically reducing actual numbers of women raped would be the noisy shit-flinging criticisms of anti-date-rape nail polish.  Here we have a product that's being offered as an option to women, to keep them safer, and allow them to detect someone literally attempting to rape them, and most of what it got was criticism.  Now they're right that providing products to women to protect themselves could lead to some people victim-blaming, but I think it's a much easier case to make that this product and products like it would definitely lead to at least a few women not being raped who would otherwise have been.  So we're condemning and criticising the existence of a product that would actually prevent real, actual women from actually being raped... because of  ideological considerations as regarding hypothetical second-order effects that might conflict with that ideology.  There are stunning criticisms offered, such as this one from the director of an anti-rape group - hardly ""useless teenagers"" as you claimed:   “One of the ways that rape is used as a tool to control people is by limiting their behavior... As a woman, I’m told not to go out alone at night, to watch my drink, to do all of these things. That way, rape isn’t just controlling me while I’m actually being assaulted — it controls me 24/7 because it limits my behavior. Solutions like these actually just recreate that. I don’t want to fucking test my drink when I’m at the bar. That’s not the world I want to live in.”   And there are plenty of other examples.  Can you think of a more graphic, unarguable example of what I was talking about when I said:   a... reality-denying... worldview where there's no such thing as taking personal responsibility for your own safety, and where it's more important to push the ideological party line even if it empirically leads to more women actually being victims of rape or sexual assault   ?  (And let's not even go into the questionable reasoning and special demands here - are we all ""controlled"" by theft because we lock our front doors, or ""controlled"" by dangerous drivers because we drive defensively?  By this logic we're all ""controlled"" by anything we routinely take precautions against, and the whole concept loses any negative connotation or rhetorical power at all.)  I have absolutely no problem with people who advocate taking sensible precautions against rape (just like we lock our doors against theft, and look up the reputation of e-bay sellers to avoid fraud) as well as combating rape culture, fighting against victim-blaming and educating rapists that ""no, it's not ok and it's not tacitly approved-of by society"".  However, equally there are a substantial (and not-unrepresentative) subset of feminist thinkers and advocates who slip from a reasonable, proportionate and maximally-productive ""porque no los dos?"" position like yours into a reality-denying or personal-responsibility-negating position that ignores what is in favour of what should be, and where they'll even end up arguing in favour of more actual women being raped because an effective countermeasure to a subset of attempted rapes even potentially conflicts with their ideology.  FWIW I agree that educating rapists and combating victim-blaming is an important part of reducing rape (note my last paragraph very specifically says ""just teach rapists not to rape"", as in ""only"").  However, equally I have no patience whatsoever for people rejecting the sensible advice to lock their doors when they go out because they have a ""moral right"" to not be the victim of theft.  I mean they do, sure - it's just completely irrelevant to the conversation, and fixating on that to the exclusion or dismissal of reasonable precautions is deeply irresponsible and counter-productive.  Moreover - contrary to what you claimed, and sadly - there are an awful lot of self-proclaimed feminists who take ideology entirely too far and will do exactly that given half a chance. :-("

My bad. I totally misunderstood what you were saying. But at the same time, you're misunderstanding several things that I said. I'll try and explain better below.  Now that that's cleared up, We can discuss the actual issue. (assuming we don't find any more misunderstandings :P)  Here's the thing. All the rape prevention techniques in the world short of actually reducing the number of rapists are just band-aids. As long as there are rapists, there'll be people developing new date rape drugs, better ways to manipulate people, etc. It's like an arms race. Of course, as long as we're fighting this war, we have to keep getting better weapons; that's just how arms races work.  But there's an alternate solution, one that will end this war forever. We make the other side vanish. If there's no one to fight against, we don't have to arm anyone.  Sure, a lot of these articles are full of people saying things that seem pretty dumb, but I think(of course, I don't actually know for sure, given how stupid humans are capable of being) that when they say 'let's stop fighting this arms race' they're assuming that 'and and actually do something to solve the rapist problem permanently' is obviously implied. Now, I have some experience with typical feminist ideas and goals and stuff, so I caught that implication, but many people don't have that experience.

I can see how 'let's stop this arms race' totally looks like 'Just let the rapists win because I don't want to be bothered to fight', but I'd be willing to bet actual money that that's not the intended message.   Additionally, these same people, upon seeing people fighting back against their tweets/etc, believe that they're being understood. They believe that the 'and actually do something to solve the rapist problem permanently' is the part that is being objected to.(because, to them, it's the entire point of the message) It's pretty easy to see how, when you believe someone objects to something like that, it's natural to assume they're probably sexist, and perhaps even a rapist themself.  With this alternate set of assumptions, lets break down one of the quotes:   “One of the ways that rape is used as a tool to control people is by limiting their behavior... As a woman, I’m told not to go out alone at night, to watch my drink, to do all of these things.    ""I have to protect myself from rape all the time. People keep giving me tips on how to take the next step in this arms race.""   That way, rape isn’t just controlling me while I’m actually being assaulted — it controls me 24/7 because it limits my behavior.   ""Even when I'm not directly being raped, I have to participate in this arms race with the rapists to make sure it doesn't happen in the future. I have to keep practicing these techniques. I might even incur an actual monetary cost, by signing up for a self-defense class or whatever.""   Solutions like these actually just recreate that. I don’t want to fucking test my drink when I’m at the bar. That’s not the world I want to live in.”   ""A design for the next weapon in the arms race won't end the war. I don't want to even have this arms race in the first place. Every cent that I spend on defending myself is a cent that I can't spend on something productive. Let's just stop this whole thing so I don't have to keep dumping money/time/effort into something that could be potentially completely avoided.""   I have absolutely no problem with people who advocate taking sensible precautions against rape (just like we lock our doors against theft, and look up the reputation of e-bay sellers to avoid fraud) as well as combating rape culture, fighting against victim-blaming and educating rapists that ""no, it's not ok and it's not tacitly approved-of by society"".   Because of the misunderstandings I've described above, suggesting that people take such precautions looks a whole lot like ""Go back to the front lines and stop complaining because I have no intention of helping to stop this war any time soon."" The italics are the part that's not explicitly said, but just seems to implied. I understand that it's not, but not everyone even notices that different groups communicate in different ways, let alone that someone from another group might not catch every nuance of what a speaker is saying, or intend everything they seem to imply.  I'm no linguist or social psychologist, but I can tell you that different groups have slightly different assumptions behind their words, so when a person talking from within the feminist way of thinking suggests an anti-rape device/technique/etc, it is far better understood by the average feminist. Similarly I'm sure there are nuances to what I'm saying that seem obvious to me, but you're not even noticing, and the same is almost certainly true in reverse. That's actually why I'm trying to make this post intentionally over-wordy and explaining every step of my logic, because, obviously, I can't assume you'll catch implied stuff.   However, equally there are a substantial (and not-unrepresentative) subset of feminist thinkers and advocates who slip from a reasonable, proportionate and maximally-productive ""porque no los dos?"" position like yours into a reality-denying or personal-responsibility-negating position that ignores what is in favour of what should be,   You're misunderstanding what they're saying :P It'd probably take several books to explain all the nuances of it, but the TL;DR version is more or less what I've described above.   However, equally I have no patience whatsoever for people rejecting the sensible advice to lock their doors when they go out because they have a ""moral right"" to not be the victim of theft.   They don't think they're being given sensible advice, because they're assuming you're implying different things than you actually are. Similarly, their response seems absurd because you're assuming they're implying different things than they actually are.   I mean they do[have a moral right to not be raped], sure - it's just completely irrelevant to the conversation, and fixating on that to the exclusion or dismissal of reasonable precautions is deeply irresponsible and counter-productive.   That's funny, I think it's probably the most important thing in the entire discussion. These people have a moral right to [X]. they're not getting [X], therefore, to me, it seems like the very most obvious next step is to do everything in our power to rectify that.   FWIW I agree that educating rapists and combating victim-blaming is an important part of reducing rape    I think it's the only meaningful part of reducing rape. People living in fear, devoting time and effort to anti-rape measures and stuff is just as much a symptom of the problem as the actual people getting raped are.   Moreover - contrary to what you claimed, and sadly - there are an awful lot of self-proclaimed feminists who take ideology entirely too far and will do exactly that given half a chance. :-(   [I assume you're referring to ""advocating for a women-on-top society at the expense of men"" when you say ""exactly that"". Just for clarity's sake.]  I'm not going to say that every feminist ever is sensible; there are crazy people in every group, but I believe that the perceived proportion of crazy feminists is higher than it actually is, for a few reasons(copy pasted from my other post with a few edits and additions):  a.) Feminism is inherently trying to break down and change the current system of society, so people who do that poorly(either because they're corrupt, stupid, don't understand how to effectively do that, or whatever else) can easily be interpreted as just smashing stuff without contributing anything. These same people also make really shitty ambassadors for feminism because they don't even know what it is they're trying to sell people on.  b.) A lot of people don't like to confront the idea that they're doing something wrong, so they'll try and find excuses for why the person criticizing them is wrong instead, leading them to call people with a valid criticism of them crazy.  c.) Alpha-male type men who are used to being on top, and believe their rightful place is at the top are naturally going to complain and do everything they can to discredit the progressives, because they see the change as a net loss to their position. I mean, in some respects, there are losses(Less porn stars under the current paradigm), but there are also gains(acceptable Polyamory! Probably more bisexual women willing to have threesomes with men! More pornstars who are doing it because they want to, and not because they need more drugs! Actual benefits to woman and not just hugh hefner!)  d.) As above, there's a lot of mutual misunderstanding as to what people are saying between groups, so a certain percentage of things will be misunderstood in a way that makes them look a lot dumber than they actually are. This is especially true because a certain subset of feminism is concerned with using different language, ways of speaking, etc, since a lot of society is based on the words we used to describe it, so to change society, you have to change the words used to talk about society. Naturally, some people will use the new ways of speaking when talking to people who haven't learned about them.  e.) Actual Misandrists and loonies. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised to know that mainstream feminism is fighting against them as well, but you're not seeing it since it's mostly kept within feminist circles, since that's where the Misandrists hang out."
Freethought,2x5kyu,lordwafflesbane,2,Sat Feb 28 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a comprehensive and thoughtful reply - don't worry about length, since I think clarity is extremely important (as you note, its absence is a major cause of misunderstandings and ""talking past"" each other).  Also I read your comment and I understand where you're coming from, but in order to keep the conversation manageable I'll respond to the core points where we seem to disagree, instead of every statement. ;-)   All the rape prevention techniques in the world short of actually reducing the number of rapists are just band-aids. As long as there are rapists, there'll be people developing new date rape drugs, better ways to manipulate people, etc. It's like an arms race.   Absolutely, yes.  In the same way (though arguably to a much greater degree)  as we have an ""arms race"" against theft, assault, etc.  Invent a better lock and thieves will work out better ways to pick it.  Start carrying pepper spray and muggers will invest in scarves over their faces, etc.  Develop a nail-polish to spot date-rape drugs and date-rapists will start using other, less-detectable drugs).  As an aside that I don't think the ""arms race"" is quite as direct, intentional and directly causative as the phrase implies (I don't think there are Seduction Community chemists beavering away in labs trying to perfect The Next Great Date-Rape Drug, for example!), but it's certainly a valid description at a functional level, even if not necessarily an intentional one.   But there's an alternate solution, one that will end this war forever. We make the other side vanish. If there's no one to fight against, we don't have to arm anyone.   This is where I think we disagree - my belief is that you can never eradicate rape from society... just like you can never eradicate theft or murder.  It's a war on an abstract noun, and those are notoriously unsuccessful - sometimes even actively counter-productive.  Realistically rape (like theft or murder or assault or bad taste or offensive beliefs) will always be with us, and while we can try to nudge society on one direction or another so as to reduce (even substantially reduce) its prevalence, I think any approach which starts with ""forget pragmatism - let's aim to do <impossible thing X>"" is off to a bad start.   I can see how 'let's stop this arms race' totally looks like 'Just let the rapists win because I don't want to be bothered to fight', but I'd be willing to bet actual money that that's not the intended message.   Not at all - it doesn't looks like a call to ""let the rapists win"".  Rather, it looks like ideological purity and unquestioning adherence leading to actively counter-productive advocacy that can end up hurting more people than pragmatism, even if the advocates themselves don't conceptualise it like that, and would in fact be horrified at the possibility if they seriously considered it.  It's not ""screw it - let the rapists win"" - it's more like:   Don't victim-blame Never imply rape is the fault of the victim Hence never imply there's anything they could possibly have done to even statistically influence the likelihood that they became a victim Hence anything that purports to affect that statistical likelihood is evil and wrong and inherently victim-blaming, and should not exist as a product   The first couple are absolutely fair enough, and a Really Good, Necessary IdeaTM.  The third is sticky, as it's important to acknowledge it's false, even if it shouldn't factor into our moral calculus when assigning blame for rapes or indecent assaults.  The fourth is a relatively trivial extension of 3, but it's where things go completely off the rails and you end up with groups campaigning against even effective band-aids that (while not addressing the root problem, admittedly) would still in practice lead to fewer women being raped, at least in the short/medium term.  It's not because anyone things the people criticising date-rape-drug-detecting nail polish actually want women to get raped... it's just that their adherence to ideology blinds them to the point it (like any unthinking adherence to any ideology) eventually becomes actively counterproductive.   but I think... that when they say 'let's stop fighting this arms race' they're assuming that 'and and actually do something to solve the rapist problem permanently' is obviously implied.   I see your point here, but this sounds very much like ""why are we wasting our time on researching baldness cures when there are people starving in the world, eh?"".  It would take an entire other conversation to list out all the reasons why such criticism are ill-considered, but - briefly - it's not an either-or proposition.  If the young guys who invented the nail polish didn't invent it they wouldn't have ""solved"" (or even contributed meaningfully to) the core problem of rape culture either, because that's not remotely their area of expertise.  Infinitely more likely they just would have stayed in cosmetics or chemistry and invented another type of (less-helpful) nail polish, or gone and got a job doing some other form of chemistry, contributing nothing at all.  The idea that ""society/individuals working on X"" necessarily takes away resources or attention from ""society/individuals working on Y"" is intuitively persuasive, but often factually inaccurate... and that's not even addressing the (very real) question of how difficult or possible problem Y even is (especially when it's something as nebulous and intractable and likely impossible as ""eradicating rape from society"").   You're misunderstanding what they're saying :P    Sometimes, yes.  Other times they're just idiots, as you note.  Still other times they're intelligent or reasonable advocates, but operating from seemingly-bizarre or unlikely axioms like ""it's possible to ever eradicate rape from society"" or ""if these people weren't working on this, they'd necessarily be contributing towards that (totally unrelated problem that requires a fundamentally different skill-set to work on)"".   That's funny, I think it's probably the most important thing in the entire discussion. These people have a moral right to [X]. they're not getting [X], therefore, to me, it seems like the very most obvious next step is to do everything in our power to rectify that.   True at a general-principle level, but it completely ignores the question of how reasonable the expectation of [X] is... or whether it's even achievable at all.  I mean in terms of sheer fairness I'd argue everyone on earth has a moral right to the same absolute standard of living as we enjoy in the west... only it's simply not possible because there aren't enough resources on the planet to sustain us all at that level (so we should reduce our wastefulness instead of elevating everyone to our level).  Likewise, I'd argue no human deserves to die of disease... and yet it's physically impossible to prevent any human ever dying of disease even if our entire society was dedicated to that one proposition, because ""disease"" is an ever-changing, mutating phenomenon that it's not even definitely possible to ever eradicate.  Less extremely, yes, nobody deserves to be raped... but nobody deserves to be stolen from or murdered either... and yet there isn't a single society on earth of any appreciable size that doesn't have some degree of theft, murder and, yes, rape, despite all our best efforts.  Even reducing these phenomena is difficult - they're things that (to a reasonable first approximation) everyone in society agrees are bad... and yet they still happen.  And we don't even have a lot of demonstrably good ideas how to even substantially reduce them... at least not without unreasonably infringing upon no less important moral principles like freedom of expression, freedom of action or basic human agency.  (I don't mean in a ""freeze peach"" way - I mean literally the only way we could eradicate rape right now or in the future would be outright brainwashing, or to strap everyone on earth to a bed and feed them via tubes... and even then sooner or later someone would just work out how to wriggle out of their restraints and start abusing people to their heart's content.)    Moreover - contrary to what you claimed, and sadly - there are an awful lot of self-proclaimed feminists who take ideology entirely too far and will do exactly that given half a chance. :-(   [I assume you're referring to ""advocating for a women-on-top society at the expense of men"" when you say ""exactly that"". Just for clarity's sake.]   No, not at all - I meant exactly what I said - taking an ideology that's reasonable and constructive at a basic level entirely too far, to the point it becomes destructive and counter-productive, as in my numbered list above.  I'm not talking about ""women on top"" at all - I'm talking about ""healthy is better than unhealthy, so let's ban chocolate and make vegetables mandatory, and institute the death penalty for anyone caught eating a cupcake"".  Now instead of free but sometimes (regrettably) unhealthy people you have a repressive regime where everyone's miserable and a whole lot of dead people into the bargain.   I believe that the perceived proportion of crazy feminists is higher than it actually is   Absolutely, yes.  The trouble is that like any group its public perception is defined by the thought-leaders and the noisiest fringes.  Noisy fringes are unfortunate but they're just an artifact of the way our media (and psychology) works, but often thought-leaders are made by the fact they're divisive and controversial, allowing them to acquire a group of people who subscribe to their ideology and define themselves by opposition to another faction within the umbrella term."
Freethought,2x5kyu,Shaper_pmp,1 point,Mon Mar 2 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"I too will stick to just the main points. I don't have time to write an entire essay every other day or so. I think there's more misunderstanding here, though.  Just below, I quoted a bit where you have laid out what you believe to be common feminist logic. You're incorrect on several counts. Let me explain.   Don't victim-blame   This is true. I'm all for not victim blaming.   Never imply rape is the fault of the victim   This one's a little more nuanced. I mean, no, you should never go up to some traumatized teenager and make their ptsd even worse, but at the same time, it's very important for people to make safe decisions.   Hence never imply there's anything they could possibly have done to even statistically influence the likelihood that they became a victim   This part is straight up incorrect. Sure, you can likely find some moron with a blog who says this, but as I've said before, literally no well respected(among the feminist community) feminists say this.  There's also a huge and important difference between ""in general, advising people on how to prevent rape  is never useful."" and ""in this specific case, the way you went about advising that specific person was insensitive/unneccessary/gave no new insight/etc."" The second one is definitely a lot more common.   Hence anything that purports to affect that statistical likelihood is evil and wrong and inherently victim-blaming, and should not exist as a product   No one mentioned morality. There's no flaming hundred foot tall scripture declaring this or that action universally unacceptable. To continue the 'arms race/war' analogy from before, of it this way:  if we define a feminist as 'someone who is actively trying to end the war', then some new and improved anti-rape device is not feminist because, while it helps accomplish things that every feminist wants to accomplish, it is, in and of itself, not a device that is helping work towards ending the war. Many feminists are not objecting to the existence of the device, or even the sacrifices that need to be made to use it, but rather we're objecting to the fact that people are labeling such a device as feminist, when it is not.   Still other times they're intelligent or reasonable advocates, but operating from seemingly-bizarre or unlikely axioms like ""it's possible to ever eradicate rape from society"" or ""if these people weren't working on this, they'd necessarily be contributing towards that (totally unrelated problem that requires a fundamentally different skill-set to work on)"".   I don't understand what alternate skillset you are referring to here. I was making no claims about what people are physically capable of doing at the current moment.   True at a general-principle level, but it completely ignores the question of how reasonable the expectation of [X] is... or whether it's even achievable at all.   It's not just about me, working on my lonesome to make my own life better. Basically the whole point of feminist activism(or really any activism at all) to ask you to help out. If we get enough people working on a problem, we can put a hell of a dent in it.  You're almost certainly right that it's infeasible to eliminate literally 100% of all rapes, but I think we could easily see as much as a 20 or 30% decrease within our lifetimes. We don't have to make the entire journey in one step. Hell, we don't even have to start with the first step. We could start by looking at a map and figuring out exactly where we're trying to go. Which, coincidentally, is exactly why a lot of feminist things seem super theoretical and wishy washy. We're trying to put our boots on the ground, but you would not believe how many different sects of feminism there are. Like, I call my self an intersectional feminist(basically, I not only want to fight for women's right/ black rights/mental illness rights/whatever I also am interested in figuring out the different effects overlap) Like any other large group of people, feminism comes in about a million subcultures and sub-flavors and whatnot.   Even reducing these phenomena is difficult - they're things that (to a reasonable first approximation) everyone in society agrees are bad... and yet they still happen.    Actually, not nearly as much as you'd think. Some scientists did a study where they asked various questions on morality. In one version of the questionnaire, one of the questions was 'would you rape someone?' the questionnaire was anonymous, and a few people actual said yes, but a very small amount. On the other version of the questionnaire, they replaced the question with something along the lines of 'would you force someone to have sex with you even if they didn't want to' (literally the definition of rape*), and 31.7 PERCENT of the male participants said they would. Nearly one third of the men at the University of North Dakota are personally okay with rape, and we have no reason to believe that North Carolina is an outlier in any respect.  technically, it is also rape if you're unsure whether your partner wants to have sex, but the above definition covers a large subset of rape and more importantly, doesn't cover anything besides rape.  Sure, most people are against 'rape' but when scientists start asking questions, it begins to look like they're more against the word than the actual crime.  The reason rape happens so much is because people are okay with it. People are also, often, surprisingly okay with theft and murder. The first step to getting rid of them is to make people aware how much they happen, and to make them not be okay with and complacent about it.   And we don't even have a lot of demonstrably good ideas how to even substantially reduce them... at least not without unreasonably infringing upon no less important moral principles like freedom of expression, freedom of action or basic human agency.   Well, feminists have been coming up with quite a few, but most of them consist of ways a woman can protect herself(or help protect her friends), so, since you're not a woman within feminist circles, you haven't seen them.   I'm not talking about ""women on top"" at all - I'm talking about ""healthy is better than unhealthy, so let's ban chocolate and make vegetables mandatory, and institute the death penalty for anyone caught eating a cupcake"". Now instead of free but sometimes (regrettably) unhealthy people you have a repressive regime where everyone's miserable and a whole lot of dead people into the bargain.   I'm afraid I must be misunderstanding something. To my knowledge, I never brought up such a concept for you to reply to. Probably you misunderstood me. What part was it where you thought I was talking about that?   Absolutely, yes. The trouble is that like any group its public perception is defined by the thought-leaders and the noisiest fringes. Noisy fringes are unfortunate but they're just an artifact of the way our media (and psychology) works,   I'm not talking about the noisy fringe effect. I'm talking about how even the noisy fringes of feminism get exaggerated more than they would in another, similar movement, due to the reasons I listed in my previous post.  Like, really, feminism gets such a bad rap that I bet you don't even know whether you're a feminist or not*. I've mocked up a little flow chart to boil it down to what I think are the important issues  *according to the definition of feminism as used by intersectional feminism. Other feminists may differ.  1.) Do you think all humans deserve equal rights? (whether or not they currently have them)    a.) no - go to 2    b.) yes go to 3  2.) You're not a feminist, and in fact, you're a bad person.  3.) Do you believe all humans currently have equal rights?    a.) no - go to 4    b.) yes - go to 5    4.) Do you want to personally do something about it?(whether or not you think it's feasible)    a.) no - go to 6    b.) yes - go to 7    5.) I guess I'll have to go dig up some data, but tl;dr, you're wrong. go to 4 if you're willing to play along anyway  6.) Is it because it seems too hard or like too much work?    a.) no - go to 10    b.) yes - go to 8  7.) Do you know what to do about it?     a.) no - go to 8     b.) yes - go to 9    8.) You're a feminist! I can help you get better at it if you want! I promise changing the world for the better is not as hard as it looks.  9.) You probably already knew you were a feminist, silly!  10.) Why don't you want to make the world a better place?    a.) I mean, I'd love to, it just seems impossible. - go to 8    b.) I enjoy the suffering of others. - go to 2    c.) I have bigger concerns to worry about - go to 11     11.) Please reconsider! The entire world is a terribly important thing!    a.) Fine! I'll give it a shot. - go to 8    b.) No, sorry, I've got really important things on my plate. - go to 12    12.) is that because equality is unimportant, or because something else is really hugely important?    a.) equality is unimportant - go to 2    b.) really important stuff - go to 13    13.) Well, good luck on whatever your super important thing is! Please spare some time for equality once you're done with whatever it is."

Freethought,2x5kyu,TexasRoseWood,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"(I'm really glad we've gotten past misunderstanding each other and can actually begin having a useful conversation.)  Rape jokes are a great example. Most people who joke about rape would never actually rape someone, but it's been proven time and time again that rapists believe that everyone else is either willing to rape, or is okay with other people raping people. Most people who hear a rape joke laugh because it's transgressive or taboo or whatever, but a rapist just hears more evidence that people think rape is both acceptable and funny.  Now, this is a problem. But how do we fix it. This one's easy, stop making rape jokes, and encourage others to do the same. But some problems are trickier.  Another example is the fact that in the vast majority of cases, when a divorce happens, the woman gets custody of the kids. There are a whole host of complicated societal pressures at work, but one of the biggest reasons is that women are assumed to be more fit to stay home and take care of children than men are, which is not only tied to harmful ideas about women(such as that they should stay at home rather than joining the workforce), but is also tied to harmful ideas about men(such as that men should naturally not show emotions and just become efficient business-like breadwinner machines). Now, no one subscribes to those ideas in their most extreme forms, but they show up all over the place in more subtle ways. Like, girls are steroetyped as playing with dolls and tea parties and lace and stuff, while boys are stereotyped with legos or erector sets or something mechanical.  I mean, no one will deny that different gender children actually do statistically own different toys, but far too often, that gets warped into 'different gender children SHOULD own different toys'. Just because things have been this way for a while, doesn't mean that they should stay this way.  Gendered toys are just a small part of the problem, and there are so many factors that I don't think I could reliable point to all of them, let alone most of them, but doing everything we can to resist the idea that toys have a certain gender is one way to solve the problems. Relatedly, and this one is probably so obvious that it goes over everyone's heads, is teaching children not only to not be sexist/racist/whatever, but also teach them to actively fight against such institutions.   So, you on board or not?"

Rape jokes are a terrible example. They are literally harmless. Even if a rapist made the connection that rape jokes mean that rape is somehow acceptable (which I seriously doubt). He is still a person with agency who is in control of and ultimately responsible for his own actions. Is it your contention that ending to rape jokes will lead to a significant reduction in rape?   Now, this is a problem.   I honestly don't see a problem with rape jokes. Sure, they may be in poor taste, but they are ultimately harmless.

I mean, no one will deny that different gender children actually do statistically own different toys, but far too often, that gets warped into 'different gender children SHOULD own different toys'.

I teach my kids to think for themselves and to question everything. I give them the tools to know what is real and what isn't. I believe that those tools will equip them to reject racism/sexism/whatever and see through the BS that racists/sexists promote. I don't need to indoctrinate them. Your ideals are quasi-religious. One of the things that turned me off Christianity as a young kid was the expectation that I share my faith and bring others to Christ. I was never interested in being a salesmen, nor, I suspect, are a lot of other kids. Why should we teach children to ""actively fight against such institutions""? What happens when they reject those teaching (as a lot of kids are sure to do)? What is wrong with them making the choice for themselves based upon the freethinking principles of independent thought and skepticism?   So, you on board or not?   With what? Forcing people out of gender roles? No. I'm on board with free choice and individual rights. That includes the choice to conform or reject gender roles. I have no interest in telling individuals how to live their private lives. I leave that to the religious fundamentalists."

In several college studies, an observer would track the amount of time different students spent talking during class, then ask people to estimate how much they thought each gender spoke. They found that when women spoke only 17% of the time, people percieved the gender split to be about even, and when women spoke 50% of the time, they percieved the conversation as being heavily dominated by women.  http://inthesetimes.com/article/16157/our_feminized_society  http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/more-women-but-not-nearly-enough/?_r=0   He is still a person with agency who is in control of and ultimately responsible for his own actions.

Yes, he(or she) is still in control of their actions, but believing that society as a whole condones their actions makes them a whole lot more likely to go through with them.  Your actions have effects on other people. I should hope you're doing everything in your power to make sure they're good effects.  My contention is that ending rape jokes will at leas slightly reduce rape. There are also about a million other things that would contribute to it, but rape jokes are one of them.   I agree with you here, but you should know that feminists have historically been one of the groups who push for laws favoring the mother in divorce cases.    If a feminist or subset of feminists has done something dumb, I'm not going to support what they've said, but I will admit that I haven't seen this happen. Do you have a source?   The examples that I do know of are actually generally rejected in the feminist community. Have you heard the term radfem, or Radical Feminist? There are factions within feminism. We all want to make the world a better place, but, of course, people disagree about both what constitutes better, and how to achieve it.  I know of a few feminists who are rape victims. They've been attacked, beaten, catcalled, harassed, and every other gender-based slight you can imagine. They actually want a world where women are superior to men. I think that's dumb, and will fight with every fiber of my being to make that not happen, but at the end of the day, I can understand being so tired of all the shit you go through that you start spitballing ideas for how to destroy it all.   With that said, I don't see how this is supposed to make the world safer.   It's not just about making the world safer. I'm fighting for justice. Equality. Freedom. Virtue. All those nice things that cynics say don't exist. Well, maybe they don't exist now, but they won't exist in the future, either, unless someone makes it happen.  Do you want to live in a world where loving fathers never get custody of their kids after a divorce?   I get that gendered toys are a ""problem"" for some people's ideology, but they are in no way an objective problem. Nor have they been shown to have a causal relationship to violent crime.   It's not about violent crime. Rape is just one problem with society. Gendered toys contribute to people viewing different genders as fundamentally different. One of the things that does is to bias the results of divorce cases, but there are million other effects, too.   I believe that those tools will equip them to reject racism/sexism/whatever and see through the BS that racists/sexists promote.    Do you, or do you not, believe that the racists/sexists are objectively incorrect? I do. I see no problem with teaching kids to point out to other people when those people are incorrect.  I too believe in teaching kids to think for themself, but there's just so much of society that is warping everyone's impressionable minds that the only way to get rid of it is to overcorrect in the opposite direction.  Can you honestly say that teaching kids not to be racist, sexist, etc is a bad idea? unless it's a bad idea, you've got two choices. Either let it happen, or(assuming it's a good idea) actively help teach them.   That includes the choice to conform or reject gender roles.   The fact is, because traditional gender roles are so simple and binary, almost no one completely matches them 100%. It's like we're telling kids everyone fits into bucket a or bucket b, when in fact, I've literally never met anyone who completely fits either one. I mean, sure, most people hit like 80% of one or the other, but do you know how many kids(especially young girls) hate themself because they're not 100% there? Far too many.  I don't have to make you not conform to gender roles. You already don't. I'm just saying, there's nothing shameful about it. Too long, people like me, who don't really want to do either one, have been told they're wrong, or broken, or sick, or sinners or a million other things. I'm tired of my good friends committing suicide over what gender they don't or don't present themself as. Now, you can let people do what they want, but if you really mean that, and aren't just using it to cover up lazy apathy, you have a responsibility to make other people do it too. It's not enough to do the right thing. You have to help others do the right thing as well.  The image I linked wasn't intended to be 'binary gender roles are terrible and if you try for them you're a bad person' it's honestly more along the lines of supporting queer kids who feel alone and scared in the world with a sort of 'screw those guys, they don't know what they're talking about' angle.

Anyway, thanks for wishing me luck on changing the world, but I do wish you would do more than just moral support. If you don't know where to begin, I could offer you some resources if you want."

We could fight for a world where people just are, as individuals, instead of bickering and fighting with each other.  But instead of ever getting anything done, people do what they always do. In McCarthyism, in the Salem Witch Trials, in how they crucified Jesus (supposedly?), and how they're currently still looking for some big badguy to point fingers at instead of accepting and responsibility. Men, women, children. We're raising a culture of irresponsible, immature, highly vitriolic and unstable sugar-fed and under exercised humanity that sits around complaining about everyone else's life instead of fixing their own.  Do terrible things happen? Of course! Do I or any non-sociopathic individual want terrible things to happen? Of course we don't. We just want someone else to fix it for us.

To the enimy of Jesus The Christ – Let's all watch how Jesus makes you pay for taking Him out of the Army. Your hellbound 'religious freedom FROM religion"" followers too. You all try to fool everybody and hide behind the contitution. Your afraid of the Gospel. Why is it you give a jew a chance to recrusify our Savior and he'll do it ever time. And your the worse of jews in the world. Blood thrifty for inocent Christians bringing The Word to the Army. damn you and die. And burn for youre sins against Christ Jesus. For all time.

This country was founded on the belief of God, if you and your people do not believe in the Christian God maybe you should move to Iran or Syria where your shallow thoughts will last but minutes since you will be but an infidel, soon to be stoned for your beliefs. Athiest jews are servents of satan. They do not deserve America. Mikey weinsteen does not deserve life any place but espcialy in the USA. He is THE leader of all which is wrong in America and all who fight Jesus Christ which is the only true God in the universe.

Of course a lot of people upvoted it though - that's the whole problem with circle-jerk fodder; people will read it and upvote it merely because it flatters their preconceptions, rather than because it's remotely interesting, novel or insightful.  If they didn't upvote it then circle-jerking wouldn't be a problem, and if it challenged them or introduced novel ideas then it wouldn't be circle-jerk fodder.  Upvotes don't make it good content any more than McDonalds selling billions of burgers make them haute cuisine, or Twilight selling millions of copies make it great literature.

Let's not forget that the most horrific cases of mass murder in the 20th century were committed by atheist states and their leaders -- Stalin in USSR and Mao in China. This article is picking at a symptom of a greater problem that transcends religion, but it is on the right track somewhat.  I claim that the idea that offending someone is wrong is precisely what needs to change. And offense starts with ideology. People have different beliefs. If people take their beliefs very seriously and are confronted with differing beliefs that call into question their own, often they become offended. If this offense gathers momentum in a group, it can lead to outrage and violence. If history and science teach us anything, it's that our beliefs are often wrong.  Does this mean we should abandon belief? Well, I would be fine with that. It's quite effective, but perhaps not realistic. What we need, then, is to counterbalance belief with humility. Outrage and violence come from an uncomfortable insecurity in people's ideologies that lurks beneath their ferocious support for them. If there were no insecurity, there would be no need to respond to doubters and skeptics. Where insecurity exists, if it can be acknowledged and transformed into humility, we will see much less violence in the name of belief."

Freethought,2wui3q,jim45804,1 point,Mon Feb 23 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"An incredibly naive conception of faith, perhaps. Faith that leads people to blindly follow an institution, for instance, is certainly a problem. Arguing against such blind faith is really quite easy, though. However, there is another conception of faith which is more sophisticated. Take Kierkegaard's conception of faith:   Kierkegaard thought that many Christians held an inauthentic faith that relied on doctrine and obedience. He wanted to get away from that and maintained that the movement of faith is up to each individual and his or her personal relationship with the impossible. He believed that what many people called ""faith"" was actually ""hope"" because with hope there is a probability for something to be true, whereas true faith is believing in something even though one knows it is impossible and there is no reason for one to believe in it. Hope does not have any relevance in the realm of impossibility, only faith does. There is an abandonment of reason when one chooses to have authentic faith. Kierkegaard maintained that faith was higher than reason. This means that reason has its limits and faith begins where those limits of reason are found. This choice of faith is not a one-time thing, according to Kierkegaard. One must make the movements of faith over and over again and constantly re-choose to abandon reason and believe in the impossible. This re-choosing is cyclical and no developmental progress is made, one just re-chooses the exact same thing over and over again. (source)   In a sense, we all employ a certain degree of faith in everyday life, even if we don't believe in a deity. For example, we must have faith that reason in fact works in order to use it. We cannot use reason to justify our belief that it works, as this would be circular. Instead, we must affirm it with faith.  Edit: It looks like most people in this sub aren't interested in discussion. Rather, it seems that it is yet another place where people come to affirm their already established opinions. That's unfortunate. You've discouraged me from commenting in the future, since my motivation for participating is almost exclusively to engage in discussion. Without that I can't see a point of making such an effort any longer. To those people who downvoted because they disagree with me, I hope that one day you can understand that it is a wise person who can entertain an idea without accepting it. This also allows for one to develop one's own arguments, since it is in intimately knowing our opposition that we can best argue against it. As I said above, any fool can argue against blind faith, but the lack of responses to this comment indicates to me that you are struggling to come up with an argument against the sophisticated conception. Don't feel bad, though. It's not an easy thing to do. That uncomfortable feeling you might feel when reading it tempts you to disregard it and seek out information that agrees with your beliefs. And if you think that's not as bad as blind faith, have I got news for you.  Edit 2: I should point out that I was at -5 when I made the first edit and my comment had not been replied to by anyone.

Freethought,2wui3q,BOLDTHUMB,2,Mon Feb 23 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"So I see what you are getting and I agree that people need to have a mentality that is more durable and less reactive to differing view points. Kierkegaard's definition of faith while interesting and maybe more sophisticated is just that, his definition. Adding sophistication to a concept doesn't make it more true, but can help clarify the difference between concepts a believer and nonbeliever hold true.   I still disagree with you about faith in religion not having inherent fallacies that perpetuate and breed hate and intolerance. I would also disagree that we all use faith. You believe we all use faith because you believe in a concept called faith. I believe in proof and evidence. I don't use faith to believe in proof and evidence I use the FACT that we live in a rational tangible and understandable universe to come to my conclusions, I have no room for faith. If something can be reproduced over and over using a system we call the scientific method, we believe it works, until it doesn't then we change it and alter it, until if fits with our other concepts of science, mathematics and physics. Again this is not faith this is a real tangible concept and a method of living.   Unless all religions could agree that they are using different language and concepts to describe faith as the same phenomenon of belief in existence; and that none are right or wrong, I will maintain and contend that faith as a concept is a fallible concept that only leads to dead ends because altered beliefs wont change your faith if you truly have faith. That is what faith is, believing in something despite what proof and evidence tell you.  As a man who believes in science you may think that I have faith in science but I wouldn't call it that. I have proof and evidence for science that supports my cognitive bias and until some new proof or evidence is presented I will maintain my world views. That is what people who believe in science do, we discard the junk and the information that damages us in favor of a new and more refined world view. Something most faithful religions have had a hard time doing in much of the past.  Feeling threatened many religions today have had to backpedal and change what they say ""insert religious doctrine here"" meant or means. From my limited understanding of most religions you have to believe yours is a more accurate world view than others. If you didn't think it was more correct why would you believe it?  I agree people use faith as hope and many find the two interchangeable. I however do not. Hope is all about the future which we have no idea about. I don't need faith to know the future is coming and with it change which isn't ever good or bad it simply is. Faith is all about the past and trying to adhere to it. If you are referring to nothing being inherently wrong with faith in religion as the practice of and repetition of ritualistic beliefs in honoring God or the universe and your sense of self, then that's fine as long as you don't use that understanding to intentionally cause pain and suffering. You also must understand that your religion may in fact be completely wrong and its simply an attempt to live with a positive view.   The issue here is that religion is often used as a safety blanket for the mind. People become offended because it sets fire to the dreams and beliefs that they hold true which can be quite unsettling when your world view is so utterly skewed and blinded by faith. I imagine it would be quite jarring and terrifying to see your world come crashing down and it doesn't surprise me that it causes people to lash out irrationally at what they don't understand.   So to sum it up I do believe there is something inherently wrong with keeping world views that have been proven time and time again to produce weak and small minded individuals who are easily nocked off balance. I say easily because if all it takes is some vibrations from one humans mouth to another humans ear to be the source of difference between nations and peoples that hate and intolerance breed and spawns from, that can sparks years suffering and suppression, it simply isn't a concept worth believing and keeping around because in my world view its damaging to us all. And putting it off for later generations to deal with is no more acceptable than leaving the global warming problem for later. We are all on the same rock and we will rise or fall together one way or another. Even if we have to tolerate and drag believers kicking and screaming into the future with us. Also I hope you arnt discourage from posting because a couple people don't agree with you, life is full of disagreements and communication is the key to get past them.  TLDR: We each individually have differing concepts of faith even if the source for this feeling and energy is the same.  Edit: formatting and grammar"
Freethought,2wui3q,crash988,2,Mon Feb 23 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Adding sophistication to a concept doesn't make it more true   Kierkegaard was not adding sophistication to a concept. He entirely rejected the common notion of faith as inauthentic and incompatible with Christian philosophy. His definition of faith is entirely distinct from the common conception, not simply a reworked version of something that was shit to begin with.   I still disagree with you about faith in religion not having inherent fallacies that perpetuate and breed hate and intolerance.   Let's say I create a religion right now. I write down all of the tenets and principles that are meant to serve as a guide for living well and being a good person. Among those are principles such as not harming others and all of that good stuff. What sort of inherent fallacies are there that perpetuate and breed hate and intolerance? Do you have your answer? Good. Now replace the word 'religion' above with 'self-help book/system'. Is your answer the same? Why or why not?   You believe we all use faith because you believe in a concept called faith.   That's an oversimplification. We all use faith whether we are aware of it or not because there is a limit to reason. Reason cannot be used to justify reason, since this is a circular argument. (More on this in the next section.)   I believe in proof and evidence. I don't use faith to believe in proof and evidence I use the FACT that we live in a rational tangible and understandable universe to come to my conclusions, I have no room for faith. If something can be reproduced over and over using a system we call the scientific method, we believe it works, until it doesn't then we change it and alter it, until if fits with our other concepts of science, mathematics and physics.   How did you derive this 'FACT' that we live in a rational tangible and understandable universe? I know the answer. You used reason. But you've just used reason to tell me that truth can be reached with reason. Again, this is circular. Science cannot provide proof. That's not what scientists do. Scientists test hypotheses and falsify them. When they try to falsify a theory many times and they are not able to because observations are congruent with predictions, then theory is said to be (approximately) true. (For more on this, read up on scientific realism and the problem of induction.) Proofs are within the realm of mathematics and logic. But there is a problem: ""to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible"". Tell me, what is real and tangible about mathematics that causes you to believe that it works? If mathematical logic itself establishes the inherent limitations of all but the most trivial axiomatic systems, what else have you got to justify your belief in it?   Unless all religions could agree that they are using different language and concepts to describe faith as the same phenomenon of belief in existence; and that none are right or wrong, I will maintain and contend that faith as a concept is a fallible concept that only leads to dead ends because altered beliefs wont change your faith if you truly have faith.   It is difficult for me to get a clear understanding of what you are saying here. I've already agreed that a naive blind faith is easily dismissed. The sort of faith I find more interesting is impervious to change of belief or different religion. It is a personal wisdom that cannot be taught. It cannot even be described in a sufficient way such that I could make you understand. It is something you would have to explore on your own. All I can tell you is that it is there to be found, but it is not easily obtained. Blind faith, conversely, is easy and requires no effort.   That is what faith is, believing in something despite what proof and evidence tell you. As a man who believes in science you may think that I have faith in science but I wouldn't call it that. I have proof and evidence for science that supports my cognitive bias and until some new proof or evidence is presented I will maintain my world views. That is what people who believe in science do, we discard the junk and the information that damages us in favor of a new and more refined world view.   I refer you to my earlier comments on science and the idea of proof.   Feeling threatened many religions today have had to backpedal and change what they say ""insert religious doctrine here"" meant or means. From my limited understanding of most religions you have to believe yours is a more accurate world view than others. If you didn't think it was more correct why would you believe it?   This is the most important subject you have touched on and it is precisely where the sophisticated conception of faith becomes crucial. With an understanding of faith, a person is free to choose a religion that best suits them, or not choose one at all. If they have a true understanding of faith, then they know that it is a personal matter and that not everyone must follow the same religion or even be a part of one. There are people of faith who have no religion (such as myself), who are Buddhist (which is fundamentally an atheist religion), who are Muslim (which preaches tolerance of other religions), and so on. The important thing to note is that most people who claim to have faith are not the sort of people I'm talking about. And due to this we see a lot of conflict. But this is not a problem inherent to religion. It is a problem inherent in humanity. It is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to have faith.   Hope is all about the future which we have no idea about. I don't need faith to know the future is coming and with it change which isn't ever good or bad it simply is.   This is a commendable viewpoint, and I agree with it. However, it seems to contradict other claims you have made, since you also seem to be saying that religion is a bad thing. The two positions are in contradiction with one another and you must reject one. Either you accept that there is no good or bad and reject the notion that religion is bad, or you reject the first premise and maintain that religion is bad.   Faith is all about the past and trying to adhere to it.   I don't understand this sentence.   If you are referring to nothing being inherently wrong with faith in religion as the practice of and repetition of ritualistic beliefs in honoring God or the universe and your sense of self, then that's fine as long as you don't use that understanding to intentionally cause pain and suffering.   I like what you've said here. It seems that you are actually in agreement with me that there is nothing inherently wrong with religion. What we tend not to like is, as you've stated, when people intentionally cause pain and suffering. But is this exclusive to religious people? I maintain that this is an issue that transcends religion. I brought up Stalin and Mao in an previous comment for precisely this reason.    You also must understand that your religion may in fact be completely wrong and its simply an attempt to live with a positive view.   I have no problem with this, as I am not affiliated with any religion. But I will refer you to an earlier paragraph in which I discuss the personal nature of faith.   The issue here is that religion is often used as a safety blanket for the mind. People become offended because it sets fire to the dreams and beliefs that they hold true which can be quite unsettling when your world view is so utterly skewed and blinded by faith. I imagine it would be quite jarring and terrifying to see your world come crashing down and it doesn't surprise me that it causes people to lash out irrationally at what they don't understand.   I agree that there are religious people like the ones you are describing. But then what good is their faith if all it takes for them to become unsettled is a criticism of their beliefs? This is blind faith that is not backed by wisdom and rigorous contemplation and experience.   So to sum it up I do believe there is something inherently wrong with keeping world views that have been proven time and time again to produce weak and small minded individuals who are easily nocked [sic] off balance.   Since you are so adamant about the importance of evidence, please substantiate this claim. You are making an enormous generalization. I have my doubts as to how much investigating you have done into the subject as you yourself have admitted that you have a ""limited understanding of most religions"".   I say easily because if all it takes is some vibrations from one humans mouth to another humans ear to be the source of difference between nations and peoples that hate and intolerance breed and spawns from, that can sparks years suffering and suppression, it simply isn't a concept worth believing and keeping around because in my world view its damaging to us all.   Let's say we are now talking about politics. Given that a potentially equal amount of suffering and suppression can emerge from political disagreement, should we also abandon all political ideology? I'm not saying we shouldn't. I'm just wondering how far you are willing to take this reasoning or whether it is solely confined to a criticism of religion. If it is only confined to a criticism of religion, I would have to question your premise.  (continued as a reply to this comment)  Edit: Fixed link."

It's a good sign when you start asking reasonable questions rather than making arbitrary judgements.  In any case, the ""faith"" in the statement is in reference to the ""faith"" in the definition that I am referring. This is how I see all the religious since, by the definition that I use, all religious people have what they call truths that are not based on any form of scientific evidence and, quite the contrary, the evidence often points away from things they claim are truth; and unfortunately this is often the foundation for additional assertions, deductions, and such. Therefore, while they think that their ""faith"" is something good that should be honored and should not be questioned, etc., I find faith to be a huge shortcoming in thought process preventing them from finding or even seeing any real truth, thus ""faith"" is a vice. Does that help you with understanding my point of view? FYI: This is not original. I may be able to dig up the material that might explain this better. Are you religious?

Freethought,2wui3q,oedipusanonymous,2,Tue Feb 24 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"I am not religious. I was raised in a traditionally Catholic family despite my parents being self-proclaimed atheists throughout their lives. After they divorced, my father made an effort to get me interested in church and religion, probably mostly due to pressure from my stepmother. As a preteen, I gave it a fair shot, attended mass and read the materials that were offered to me, but I didn't find it convincing, and decided to abstain from participation in the institution. My mother 'returned' to religion, as many do, in the time before her death. I understood it as her making peace with life, death, and the universe in way that was already culturally familiar to her.  Although I would never have considered myself religious, I was always fascinated by certain philosophical concepts, most notably -- nothingness. From a young age I was engrossed by the thought that there was something rather than nothing, and why that was the case. This was my starting point to the exploration of existence. I studied philosophy. I read any literary classics I could get my hands on. I became mesmerized by mathematics and science and absorbed what I could. I also became interested in spirituality and religion, and explored those topics as well, but not exclusively through texts. Most of my learning here was through traveling and engaging people as well as deep meditation and solitude in nature.  You asked me what is my perspective on religion. Well, I would have to say that any given religion is a multitude of things. A religion is an ideology. It is also an institution. But, perhaps more importantly, religions also are historical artifacts that contain a wealth of wisdom that has grown and evolved over time. Religions are stories. They are attempts at making sense of the world. What we call philosophy started out as a combination of theology and science. Perhaps we should not be surprised that creation stories are not factually accurate, as most of these were told and written long before the scientific method and modern technology were developed that could falsify those stories. Perhaps we should not be surprised if our current understanding of the big bang as a moment of creation is eventually replaced by something else.  There is something else that features prominently in religions. Some people call it faith. Some call it spirituality. Others call it mysticism. And still others call it divine providence, wisdom, or intuition. Even flow. It doesn't so much matter what we call it. What matters is that there is something that people find, time and again. It is difficult to describe but descriptions tend to be similar. It is not what most people think of when they think of faith, because what they tend to think of is a sort of perverted faith that is blind and completely opposed to the concept I am now discussing. Rather than something that has a connotation of ignorance, it is something that brings understanding. It is not belief. It is also not reason. It provides a basis for understanding why reason works, but is also fallible, and why belief is necessary, but should be tempered with humility.  Whatever it is, it is extremely valuable. It can bring a flourishing to one's life, for everything becomes easy. Fear dissolves. Fear of God. Fear of there being no God. Fear of death and of loss. It can allow one to understand that all the supposedly terrible things that happen in life are not bad things. They are simply events along a path. They are things we can allow to make us stumble, or we can choose to learn from them. We can find peace -- within ourselves and with others. A person of faith has no need of violence. Hate, revenge, malice...these are not the vices of the faithful. A faithful person is kind, understanding, and patient. It turns out that there are a lot of people like this in the world. I have met many. Some are religious. Some are not. It matters not. Faith is a personal matter and requires of us to understand that we are all unique individuals, with unique experiences, cultures, and upbringings.  But religions are also associated with much negativity. People kill and harm others over their beliefs. This is not unique to religion. I have come to understand it as a potentiality in any ideology. When a person or a group of people adhere very strongly to an ideology, they can become extremely uncomfortable with having any aspects of that ideology -- whether it is the ideology itself in name, or particular beliefs within their associated system of beliefs -- questioned or criticized. It may even be enough that people adhere to a different ideology or have different beliefs for some to become violent or oppressive. This is not exclusive to religion. Even atheism is an ideology that has shown itself to be incredibly unfriendly and intolerant to many groups, often resulting in violence. The important thing to note is that it matters not how much the people within that ideology perceive their views and actions as justified. In the end, it is just belief and there is no higher authority granting supremacy of one over another.  Ultimately, all ideologies share this same shaky foundation. They all have flaws and inconsistencies. Consider a libertarian ideology that holds liberty to the highest degree of importance. What shall a libertarian say to someone who wishes to be a slave? Shall they force him to be free? Is this liberty? I think not. Anything good in an ideology turns sour when its proponents attempt to force it on others. People who blindly follow a religion and believe anything that their institution tells them do not understand this. They are ignorant. If there is such a thing as sin, this is it. But with much effort and learning through experience one can come to shed one's ignorance. People have been doing this successfully since humans have been able to form complex beliefs. Whether your favorite example is Buddha or Jesus Christ is just a minor detail. The final lesson is the same, but people must find it within themselves in their own way."

At the very least there is absolutely no proof, nor is there even any scientific evidence for anything supernatural. How is that ""right""?

Privacy only matters to prevent unnecessary social disruptions, financial disruptions or unfairness, and legal disruptions. It is agreed to in society by law. It isn't a blanket check because there are cases where you are not entitled to privacy and where it would be unreasonable to have privacy.  Much of law enforcement is a battle between privacy and transparency. Law enforcement wants to know what you might do or did in order to prevent law breakers. To do that, they need to violate privacy and get court orders. In fact, that is exactly what a warrant and subpoena is: a violation of your privacy. An exception to your privacy.   Because no one ever... ever... ever... gave human society a blank check to ANY amount of privacy. It's always a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" not an ""unreasonable expectation"".  But really, don't fall for this crap. Greenwald cares nothing about privacy except for the fact that he can use it to preach his anti-government agenda as a libertarian who has confessed that he has never voted in any democratic elections.  Greenwald knows he can't give a TED talk about anarchy and libertarian havens of minimal/non-existent government without some people hating him, so instead he chooses a subject he knows very little about and has zero expertise about: privacy. As a stepping stone to criticize governments for ""coming after privacy and your rights."" A populist subject for many young people."

I recall tweets from recent elections from feminist friends: ""if you're a woman and you vote <conservative candidate> you must hate yourself"" as if a plan to distribute free birth control is the most important thing for every single woman when it comes to voting.

This happens often in Christianity as well, and there's no way to settle it.  Instead of labeling ISIS heretical, I think it would be much more helpful if the Muslim scholars would take the approach that Maajid Nawaz is taking - and that's identifying that there is something wrong with some core beliefs within Islam and that a reformation is necessary for it to be compatible with a modern, free society."

The movement stems from a few political factions: those who assume the ""natural"" is inherently superior, those who assume that those in power cannot be trusted as a rule, and those who are prone to follow trends. Each of these is an irrational position. Thinking something is better because it's ""natural"", even leaving aside the fact that the word no longer has any discernible meaning, is an informal fallacy, the naturalistic fallacy. Are organic eggs safer than non-organic eggs? There's no evidence to suggest they are. I know that there's nothing more natural than wild hemlock, but I won't be eating that any time soon. Thinking that because something comes from an institution, or either private or public center of power is inherently not to be trusted is also not rational. A little skepticism is fine, but there are veins of libertarians and anarchists who dismiss anything that comes from government or corporations as being automatically bad or wrong or dishonest. And, of course, those who follow trends can be dismissed outright, because they're not thinking for themselves.

At no point does Eric Posner say that students should have not free any free speech rights or sex rights, more that a college campus is not the place to exercise your free speech without control, because it is a controlled learning environment, which is very true.   This article is also very poorly written and agenda driven. The author says:   ...students shouldn't really live in constant fear that they might be raped, since it happens rarely—all too frequently, sure, but rarely.    So rape is both rare and frequent? Ok got it, that makes loads of sense.   Not that I'm defending everything said by professor Posner but when he says the following some of it makes sense:   Classroom teachers know students won’t learn anything if they blab on about their opinions. Teachers are dictators who carefully control what students say to one another. It’s not just that sincere expressions of opinion about same-sex marriage or campaign finance reform are out of place in chemistry and math class. They are out of place even in philosophy and politics classes, where the goal is to educate students (usually about academic texts and theories), not to listen to them spout off.   The way he says it comes off as overly harsh, and maybe he's a jerk or maybe he's too burnt out Or something but, I've been in too many classrooms where students really just talk about their totally biased opinions during discussions about literature we had read and their opinions often have nothing to do with the text we actually read and this is what I think he is talking about here mostly. And he's right, it's a problem and a good teacher needs to control the conversation to where it isn't just opinion based and is actually furthering the understanding of the topic at hand."

The founders were famously Dieists, believing in a creator, but not necessarily an omnipotent, omnipresent god. Being endowed does not necessarily mean by the Christian god.

Religious organizations are already recognized by the government,  because it takes as much red tape to be tax-exempt as it does to be taxed.  Not that any of that would stop them from making demands, of course."

Split religious organisation in three:   charitable organisation - they should be tax free, and possibly receive subsidy lobbying branch: the part that tries to influence laws. They should be tax, but be recognised as a polical movement. When a large group of people want to change the law on abortion or marriage, that's a political position. philosophical branch: as long as they just preach to people, and re-invest their money into the organisation, why should they pay taxes?"

I'm not saying they do or do not currently, that's a different argument. A church paying its taxes is due services and voice and other things.  The implications and results of this are not easy to foresee, kind of like how different churches push to be able to distribute literature, have bible studies in schools, and place religious effects on state property and then are pissed when people they disagree with seek the same rights in a public way. Finally, and i will feel happy to be corrected by someone in finance/more knowledgeable, there is no real differentiation between a church and any non-profit. How do you differentiate between a church and a club that meets up to watch anime in costume and character? All can pay dues, donate freely, volunteer in the name of their favorite shows/characters. I don't think it's so cut and dry as people think.  Tl;dr: it's not so simple and they're not different from similar. unreligious organizations. Also, there may be results to that action that would be negative."

You tax profit, so if a church doesn't make any profit they don't pay tax. That sorts out the problem for small churches. You set up a minimum profit before tax is incurred. e.g. profit of less than $50,000 pays no tax. You make spending on local social services (or any other service the people want to allow) deductable prior to paying tax. That way even if the church is wealthy if it spends all of it's income on the poor then it pays no tax.   I'm neither an accountant nor politician and to me this seems extremely simple. Surely with all the intelligent tax experts out there something could be arranged?  Edit: Lol, downvoting in anonymity without having the balls to explain why just underlines the fact that you have no answers to my points."

Freethought,2v8zgw,jimgatz,2,Mon Feb 9 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"Jefferson is associated directly with the term ""separation of church and state"" (created by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment) due to an exchange of letters between then President Thomas Jefferson and the Baptist Association of Danbury, Connecticut. In the letter he wrote:   Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State   In 1947, in the case Everson v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court referenced that letter when they declared,   ""The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach.""    By using the metaphor in their ruling to uphold the constitutional interpretation of the First Amendment the term entered public use associated with Jefferson.  But it's missing the point to ascribe the interpretation of The Establishment Clause to President Jefferson. The separation of church and state is part of U.S. law and policy due to the accepted interpretation of the first amendment. An interpretation that has evolved through our history and has been upheld by multiple Supreme Courts in multiple cases. That's how the constitution still works after over 200 years. It's written vaguely, so it can be widely applicable and thus has to be interpreted."
Freethought,2v8zgw,steppenwoolf,2,Mon Feb 9 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"It's also never specifically said that we have a ""right to a fair trial"" or a ""right to privacy"", but the 4th and 6th amendments both imply those rights. That's why we have a Supreme Court to interpret the constitution.  So here are 13 cases where the Supreme Court upheld the separation of church and state:  U.S. Supreme Court Decisions  (arranged by date)  Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1879)  Court finds that the federal antibigamy statute does not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of the free exercise of religion.  Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947)  Court finds that a New Jersey law which included students of Catholic schools in reimbursements to parents who sent their children to school on buses operated by the public transportation system does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948)  Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional.  Burstyn v. Wilson, 72 S. Ct. 777 (1952)  Government may not censor a motion picture because it is offensive to religious beliefs.  Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961)  Court holds that the state of Maryland cannot require applicants for public office to swear that they believed in the existence of God. The court unanimously rules that a religious test violates the Establishment Clause.  Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962)  Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion.  Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963)  Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional.  Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968)  State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971)  Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state:  1) the government action must have a secular purpose;  2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion;  3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion.  Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980)  Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional.  Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985)  State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether ""pure"" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional.  Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987)  Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of ""creation science"" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation.  Allegheny County v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573 (1989)  Court finds that a nativity scene displayed inside a government building violates the Establishment Clause.  Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992)  Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship. Court majority was particularly concerned about psychological coercion to which children, as opposed to adults, would be subjected, by having prayers that may violate their beliefs recited at their graduation ceremonies.  Church of Lukumi Babalu Ave., Inc. v. Hialeah, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993)  City's ban on killing animals for religious sacrifices, while allowing sport killing and hunting, was unconstitutional discrimination against the Santeria religion."

The idea that somebody is in charge and taking care of things and making sure that good things happen in the end is essential to a lot of otherwise sensible people.

Freethought,2v09k8,realitycheek,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Nothing new, just the recant of the same contemporary arguments.  There are still other interesting (and intelligent) arguments for a belief in God. Here are two of them:   Buddhism for example is not specifically theistic, and it teaches of ways one could attain an enhanced level of consciousness. Nowadays, we really know too little about our inner self. God or not, the belief in something else all-encompassing and beyond our current state of mind seems to help advancing in many such practices. The main argument here is similar as becoming proficient in whatever scientific (or artistic) pursuit: the need of serious, dedicated study (and practice) to become worthy to speak from a position of substantiated authority.  The ""closed system"" or ""present-day"" trap. Quoting from a previous post on a similar topic: The best ""explanation"" I subscribe to is not necessarily theistic, but an epistemic one. Many thinkers have a tendency of ""closing the system"" and inferring the unknown as more or less a projection of the already known, based on the established framework of a given age. Modern times are no different. Theism can be seen as a form of the unknown that doesn't fit current evidence and projections, but still, as a framework of thought and belief, it has given live force and purpose to countless intelligent and decent people for ages. That by itself is evidence of something."

If all those things did, by some miracle, get solved by free money, it is still assumed that a broad influx of cash to the general public wouldn't change our economic conditions.

If you skipped it, I suggest watching the TEDx video included in the article, by a doctor who started prescribing cash and is now trying to spread this practice through all of the medical profession, because it works so well.  You can call it utopian if you like, but utopia is a fixed location. It's fantasy. There's always something better. Striving to improve out world isn't utopian. I wouldn't be surprised if someone said something similar about smallpox decades ago, as such things have been said pretty much every time someone in history thinks of a way to make things better.  ""Eliminate smallpox from the Earth?? That's utopian. Silly utopian and your silly impossible fantasies.""  Yeah, we need to modify tax rates. Yeah, we need to simplify the tax code, and increase access to quality education, and increase what people earn from work, but not a single one of these solutions will help with the effects of globalization and technology.  The simple fact is that for decades, we've required less and less work, to do more and more, and these new technologies are also global, whereas people aren't.  Example: Web design. That's a new profession. Created fairly recently, people could earn a nice living from it. I should know because I was one. Now, only a handful of years later, the tech has made web design so easy almost anyone can do it. And globalization means that bids for web work are global. Good luck outbidding someone in India offering to design a site for $10.  Our labor force participation rate peaked in 2000 and has been declining ever since. Full time jobs having been getting replaced by part time jobs since before 2000. People have been replaced by hardware and software in ways we aren't really noticing, like Excel for example.  Now self-driving cars are around the corner, and we aren't prepared. Bill Gates has even said as much. People all over the world are saying as much.  You can stick your fingers in your ears if you like, and claim that everything will be fine if we just modify taxes and increase min wages, but I for one (and I'm not alone) think we've got a serious problem on our hands that we need to start preparing for right now.  And the really frustrating part is that it shouldn't be a ""problem"" at all. Human labor being replaced by our own technology? Why should that ever be a problem?

Freethought,2ubhlz,HumanePets,5,Sat Jan 31 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"I'm actually reading an article about this very topic right now:  http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1921&context=articles   Abstract:  Most group creativity research is premised on the assumption that creativity is unleashed by removing normative constraints. As work organizations become increasingly diverse in terms of gender, however, this assumption needs to be reconsidered since mixed-sex interactions carry a high risk of offense. Departing from the assumption that normative constraints necessarily stifle creativity, we develop a theoretical perspective in which creativity in mixed-sex groups is enhanced by imposing a norm to be politically correct (PC)—a norm that sets clear expectations for how men and women should interact with one another. We present evidence from two group experiments showing that the PC norm promotes rather than suppresses members’ free expression of ideas by reducing the uncertainty they experience in mixed-sex work groups. These results highlight a paradoxical consequence of the PC norm: A term that has been used to undermine  expectations to censor offensive language as a threat to free speech actually provides a normative foundation upon which demographically heterogeneous work groups can freely exchange creative ideas.   This study challenges every one of my preconceptions.    I'm going to have to dig into the research on this topic further."
Freethought,2ubhlz,kyleclements,2,Sun Feb 1 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"I have a theory on that particular study - what they found was that mixed sex groups were more ""creative"" if they were first primed with a discussion about PC topics.  My guess is that the women in the PC group were more likely to speak up (and the men more likely to listen) after discussion of those topics.  They way they determined creativity was by the number of novel / creative ideas a group came up with.  In all honestly, I think it's probably more accurate to say discussion of PC topics made them more ""productive than"" creative.  Even then, the ""ideas"" they were generating were business ideas about what to do with a particular location.  Political correctness only really hampers discussion around topics that are seen as sensitive.  What I'd like to see is how priming with PC language effects discussion of sensitive topics.  I'd imagine that people would be much less willing to offer interpretations outside of the ""acceptable"" range if they were first shown the PC norms."

Freethought,2ubhlz,kyleclements,1 point,Sun Feb 1 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting concept, but IMO it begs the question, does it work in the context of that scenario because it's a substitute for counseling in a more-productive way of conflict management?  If somebody says or does something that offends another person, there are two activities that are happening: the offender has expressed an opinion, the offended person has reacted to it.  Assuming one, both or neither are potentially at fault, and assuming that this is a potentially common occurance due to the fact that we are social creatures of diverse up-bringing with a variety of opinions and outlooks, and assuming that this potential conflict could be addressed by one of the two people altering their behavior (which is usually the case in all of these types of issues - the solution involves one person changing or adapting), which person should be the one to change?  Which of the two people, if they alter their behavior, would result in a more harmonious and productive environment?  This is where I think the PC movement goes wrong.  It seems to me, it's easier to condition people to be less aggressively reactive and defensive to potentially-provacative comments, than it is to impose upon everybody, a set of general rules, which over time seem to continually-change anyway.  (Case in point: ""little people"" vs ""midgets"", etc.  What is the current word to describe these people and why should someone who didn't mean the term in a derogatory way be considered abusive or intolerant?  Perhaps a better approach is conditioning the receiver of such langugage to recognize that intent carries much more weight than mere words?)  In the latter scenario, an ""adjusted person"" is able to not just peacefully-coexist with the other members of the study, but new people outside that bubble.  In a PC-imposed world, the harmony only exists within the bubble of those following the rules and once someone leaves that sphere, it happens again.  It seems a better way to solve the problem of offending people isn't to give people a huge list of words and phrases they can't use, but tell everybody to temper their reaction with a higher level of tolerance and understanding.   This seems to be what our ancestors did with the ""sticks and stones"" parable.

Freethought,2u86r9,fuckoffplsthankyou,2,Sat Jan 31 07:33:07 2015 UTC,"IANAL -- so forgive me for citing wikipedia's entry.  In United States v. Miller, the unanimous opinion:   In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.   This clearly establishes at the very least that the second amendment does not allow you to have whatever weapons you want.  The more recent Heller case's opinion:   Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited....Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.   It is clearly the opinion of that court that limitations of many sorts are within the interpretation of the constitution of the United States.  I don't think the meaning of ""shall not be infringed"" would imply an interpretation such as:   the right of the people to keep and bear any weapons they so deem necessary shall not be infringed.   There seem to be four clauses here, depending on where you put the commas (as I understand this has been a problem in interpreting). The first two being not overly important for this discussion, and the two of interest being ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" and ""shall not be infringed"". What the meaning of the first one of interest seems to be at issue in the courts — not necessarily the latter."

Even tho the 2nd says exactly that. It's not surprising that the govt would seek to restrict the rights that restrict the govt.   This clearly establishes at the very least that the second amendment does not allow you to have whatever weapons you want.   Except that the 2nd makes no distinction or restriction.  Only SCOTUS seems to have found that in the words ""shall not be infringed"".  Its a bad decision on SCOTUS part.   Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited..

Hence those shitty laws on drugs/alcohol.  On the other hand, on a similar topic, the constitution does have a section on armament rights, which includes body armor, guns, and ammunition. It successfully stopped prohibition on that in many states and time periods of the US. So the constitution has always been anti-prohibition, even if it doesn't have a section on everything.

I feel like saying ""civilians need access to body armour because police"" is a bit of a non sequitur. I really don't see it as a justification. Normal every day citizens are the victims of accidental gun deaths, a teenager being shot by a police officer, a mother being accidentally shot by her own child. Is it really reasonable to suggest that ""if we could only wear body armour to protect ourselves"" these deaths would have been avoided? I would argue that no, they would not. Non-criminal gun deaths are outliers to the norm, and preventing them with body armour would require everyone to wear it at all times (just in case) which is totally impractical and unnecessary at best."

I'll tell you the truth, I've been shot at twice in my life, both times by criminals and once they had a badge.   Let's say I'm going to Whole Foods to buy some spices, is that an occasion to don a bullet proof vest?   Personally I wouldn't but I've had co-workers show up for jobs wearing a bullet proof vest.  They left late at night in downtown and nobody ever thought less of them for it.  Me personally, I fully intend to kit out 3 sets of armor, one for me, one for the SO, one for the kid.  They can sit in the back of my closet and if they never get used, that's awesome.  I will go to my deathbed smiling that my grandchildren or great grandchildren will have it if they need it.  There are people who get their doors kicked in and have to engage in gun fights in their home.  It may never happen to me but it's my job as a human to prepare for the things I can prepare for and the nice thing is that investments like guns, ammo, vests, they keep their value and even go up in value outside of their intended purpose.   So every gun I own I think of as something that will be passed down to my son, so he'll have it if need be.   I understand the concept of self-defense but I'm having a hard time getting to the practical necessity.    Well, I guess it just depends on how big of a problem you want to be.

It's unfathomable that someone would have the practical necessity to use body armour. If someone breaks into my house with a gun, they can take whatever they like. I'm not going to add fuel to the fire by trying to fight back. Having body armour stored for a situation such as this seems to demonstrate a legitimate application. If my house was broken into and I had the option and/or ability to respond by having wife/kids/whoever put on body armour and go hide then I would.

I may have to go re-read my comments but I hope they weren't posed as the sweeping generalization you seem to have taken them as. When I say legitimate I mean peaceful and legal and I'm thinking about consequence. Say there is a product that fails to operate in the hands of someone with a strict moral compass who doesn't have the capacity to cause harm. It's as innocuous as a coaster, but that very same product works too well in the hands of someone malicious and it is certain to cause harm to someone innocent. Should that product be available to the public just for the sake of protecting your rights to keep and bear it? Knowing unquestionably that it's use can only be to cause harm? Society, and human empathy should force us to filter out such a product because it is lacking a legitimate use. This is the sense in which I use the term. Is body armour a product like the one I mentioned above or is it not? That is the part of the discussion I'm trying to take part in. I've had one good example so far and I'm grateful for it as it is an opportunity to gain some insight I didn't previously have."
Freethought,2u86r9,Laksm,2,Sat Jan 31 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"I think that the right reason to ban something is based in the potential to harm other persons. Not in asking 'what is the legitimate reson for owning it'.  In the case of body armour, it's pretty problematic since body armour in itself, doesn't have a potential to harm other people. The combination of guns and body armour might, but wouldn't you agree that the guns is the problem in that equation? Don't you think that a ban against clothing of a specific material interferes with essential liberty?  I might be inclined to agree with you about a theoretical product, who can only cause harm to society. But I don't think thats the case for body armour.

By asking what legitimate purpose the armour had I was essentially trying to find out what, aside from harm, could it be used for. I've been given some solid examples (your Salman Rushdie example being the most salient) and have now shifted my initial view. I'm very pleased that there is a forum for this type of conversation, where I can pose questions like this and get answers that allow me to gain understanding, and insight.

Freethought,2u86r9,autowikibot,2,Sat Jan 31 05:51:25 2015 UTC,"North Hollywood shootout:       The North Hollywood shootout was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers and officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles on February 28, 1997. Both robbers were killed, eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police.   At 9:17 AM, Larry Phillips, Jr. and Emil Mătăsăreanu entered and robbed the North Hollywood Bank of America branch. Phillips and Mătăsăreanu were confronted by LAPD officers when they exited the bank and a shootout between the officers and robbers ensued. The two robbers attempted to flee the scene, Phillips on foot and Mătăsăreanu in their getaway vehicle, while continuing to engage the officers. The shootout continued onto a residential street adjacent to the bank until Phillips was mortally wounded, including by a self-inflicted gunshot wound; Mătăsăreanu was killed by officers three blocks away. Phillips and Mătăsăreanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using virtually identical methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing automatic weapons chambered with intermediate cartridges for control and entry past 'bullet-proof' security doors, and are possible suspects in two armored vehicle robberies.   Local patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue 9 mm or .38 Special pistols, with some having a 12-gauge shotgun available in their cars. Phillips and Mătăsăreanu carried illegally modified fully automatic Norinco Type 56 S-1s (an AK-47-style weapon), a Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator, and a HK-91 rifle with high capacity drum magazines and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. The bank robbers wore body armor which successfully protected them from bullets and shotgun pellets fired by the responding patrolmen. A SWAT eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower, and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded. Several officers also appropriated AR-15 rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to upgrade their firepower in similar situations in the future.

But this is a private school, and they should be allowed to maintain whatever admissions criteria they want.  If ""no gay parents"" is one of the criteria, then I hope the world sees this school for the bigoted shitbirds they are, but I don't think the government should force them to admit students they don't want to admit.  And actually, this is more or less the view the Supreme Court has developed over the years.  The Court has prohibited racial discrimination with respect to motels and restaurants (although they've never addressed this question with regard to sexual orientation).

Freethought,2u3ri7,voidgazing,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, there is really an elephant headed god, Ganesh, because Ganesh is an idea.  Gods in Hinduism are representations of concepts- the more important gods embody more than one and have a lot of aspects and forms.  Kali is change, for example (at least in some of her forms) and also the dark mother, harsh teacher and protector.  Saraswati is knowledge and learning.  Ganesh is the remover of obstacles.  Each of these gods also has many aspects- for example, Chinnamasta (IRRC) the self decapitating goddess is seen as an aspect of Kali representing the sacrifice every mother makes for her children.  The usefulness of these concepts and ways of thinking and modeling the world is not impacted in the least by whether or not you believe there is some other dimension where you could see and touch them.  There are plenty of Hindus who do believe in that and plenty who don't.  Your view of religions seems to lack any such subtleties, because of course you have dismissed it without attempting to understand it.  Tell me something you believe that isn't made up."

That fact that we are conversing on reddit isnt made up. Its real.

That is what a spirit, god, or whatnot is- it is a thing that exists in a different way than other things, but don't say it isn't real.  It drives behavior and affects perception, and if you don't think it matters you haven't thought it through.  In general, religious thought posits that the realm of ideas exists on a different layer of reality- my favorite word for that layer is metaphysical.  My interaction with Ganesh, should I have such an interaction, takes place on that layer of reality and has affects on the physical through the mediating agency of my consciousness."
Freethought,2u3ri7,Shaper_pmp,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:16:43 2015 UTC,ganesh never existed like a given person or animal or object. It is an idea and the interaction with this idea is solely in your imagination. Your play on words that it ever existed and is real is fantasy and I suspect u know it You call it metaphysical and mediated by your consciousness. It doesnt exist except as an idea in your own head. Thats not real. If ideas in your head do map onto actual entities in the external world like Barack Obama or the Himalayas experience of which that we all can share and verify then you can use the term real.
Freethought,2u3ri7,voidgazing,1 point,Fri Feb 13 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"I quite agree Ganesh never existed the same way the Himalayas do.  That does not mean that he doesn't exist, it means the nature of his existence is different.  Think in terms of Flatland.  Part of Ganesh's dimension intersects with our own.  You can model that as social psychological (a shared meme) or metaphysical- it doesn't much matter.  To say that an idea is not a real thing is to have a definition of real that does not account for the entity using the definition, which is hilarious.  I submit to you again, that ideas drive behavior.  If Ganesh had no reality we wouldn't be discussing him.  You cannot put him in a bucket.

The core of Buddhist thought is very different in spirit (as are two of the major branches of Hinduism) than what that quote portrays.  While it is true that as it spread it adapted and adopted ideas and traditions from the areas it reached, the basic idea of responsibility for one's own enlightenment and the need to practice to get there is very different from the contractual relationship with the divine found in Judaism and its offshoots*. There is also a tendency towards inclusivity regarding new ideas and practices to be found in sharp contrast to Judeo-Christian thought.    To see all of those pictured with such a quote gives me the impression that whoever did so has either not studied those belief systems to any meaningful extent, or is being  disingenuous.  While I have a great deal of personal distaste for Judeo-Christian spirituality and ideology precisely for the same reasons the site seems to be indicating, if it ignores nuances such as these then it becomes nothing more than one more meaningless bandwagon, a religion of anti-religion ignoring facts that don't agree with its thesis.  More noise and less signal in the world.  *There were instances of similar practices- pay the monk to take your bad karma- but they are not 'core' but rather additive.

Furthermore, most people who don't believe in a god are that way because they've more-or-less logically evaluated some evidence and decided that the evidence doesn't indicate the existence of a deity.  If you are this way, then you'll probably never be as sure that there isn't a god as religious people are sure that there is a god.  After all, if you're using logic, then there could always be new evidence that changes your mind.  This might be very unlikely, but the possibility is still there.  In a way, this is the beauty of the process.  You could probably be 99.9% sure (or more) that there isn't a god.  Is this enough to be ""positive of your beliefs""?

Freethought,2tm5or,Lightfiend,7,Sun Jan 25 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"This is a very well-reasoned and thorough rebuttal to Leslie et al., and is a good submission for this subreddit. I do have one objection to the author's conclusion, though. I'm going to use an anecdote to illustrate something that his analysis did not take into consideration suggesting a role for something other than innate ability in STEM gender gaps.  In grad school, I used to tutor grade-school kids in math. One of the clearest differences that I observed between girls and boys was not aptitude, but failure mode. To explain what I mean, take as an example the very first girl I tutored, a quiet kid with a D average. Our session would begin with me reviewing the core concepts, and asking simple direct questions to try to tease out where the gaps in her knowledge were. At the beginning, to my surprise, there were hardly any gaps; every question I asked got the right answer. Next, we'd walk through problems, which were mostly word problems. Here was where she would shut down; I figured out by the second or third session what the problem was. She would take a single look at the dauntingly long and complex word problem, and assume she couldn't do it, and wouldn't try at all. So I would step her into it with encouragement at each step: ""You need rate to solve this problem, right? How do you get rate if you are given distance and time? You know this, you just told me how to do that,"" etc.  After a few weeks, my ""tutoring"" became simply skipping to the problems, waiting for her to say ""I don't know how to do this one,"" me answering ""Yes you do"" and then letting her go ahead and get the right answer. Her grades rose with her confidence, and I ended up giving her mom back my last paycheck because I felt like I was no longer actually doing anything to earn it. When the student came to me at first, she would describe herself as ""not a good math student"" and smile charmingly, which I told her never to do again. I figured out where that attitude came from one day after class, when I was chatting with her mom who said the exact same thing, with identical inflection, and the same self-deprecating smile.  The first boy I tutored was about a C average, and his problem was completely different. He would read the word problem and immediately come up with an answer. It would be right maybe 25% of the time. After asking the same, simple questions at the beginning of the session, I would find a few small but important gaps in his knowledge base, and we'd work through those. His grades rose to an A as well, but much more quickly. I never once heard him say he was a bad math student.  I would say these two examples, with a few exceptions, were representative of the attitudes of male and female teenagers that I interacted with. While that's anecdotal, the difference in confidence level between girls and boys is well-documented. Assuming I'd never interacted with either the boy or the girl in my two examples, the boy would have clearly gotten better scores on his SATs and GREs because he would have guessed at answers, where the girl would have gotten a much lower score, despite a better understanding of the material.   To give credit where it's due, the author of this piece acknowledges that his definition of ""innate ability"" includes stereotypes and societally-determined bounds to mathmatical aptitude. I think that definition can be misleading, however, because externally-driven variables like confidence can be addressed and changed if educators are aware of the problem (as in my example above, for instance). The author's argument seems to suggest that there is no solution necessary if measurements of aptitude accurately correlate with gender ratios, when in reality, slight changes in how ability is measured (that downplay weighting scores in favor of confidence) or in how girls are taught to think about math, would easily bring more girls into STEM fields."
Freethought,2tm5or,Wild_type,4,Sun Jan 25 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent observation.  My sister teaches high school physics, and has mentioned that capable students will frequently shut down rather than attempting to reason through more complicated, multi-step problems.  She's never mentioned thinking that girls are more likely to shut down, but I think it's a reasonable hypothesis.  I observed a similar phenomenon as well during my undergraduate degree in engineering.  Specifically, men and women appeared to ""fail"" in different ways.  Generally I would do my work in the engineering computer lab, where people would congregate to work together on problems sets. It was much more common for struggling women to ask me for help than struggling men.  Women would get part of the way into a question, fail to see the path through to the end, and disengage and try to ask for help.    Meanwhile, the guys would independently work, and come up with answers that were creative...but often incorrect.  When guys needed help, it was usually a matter of pointing out a flaw in their reasoning / calculations, which would allow them to proceed again along the correct track.  Related to this, women often seemed to be more stressed out in general about problem sets.  I think many of the women had a fear of failure that may have hampered them; they didn't even want to engage in a problem if they would start of taking the wrong approach.    You mention that studies have shown that men are often more confident than women, and it's absolutely true. I read a recent article about the relationship between gender and grades at Harvard Business School.  They found that the sexes tended to have similar test scores; however, men had much higher grades when it came to class participation (which is a large component of class grades at HBS).  HBS then undertook a program to increase the confidence of women, specifically by encouraging them to contribute more to classroom discussions.  After a few years, the gender gap in grades had basically disappeared.    If the confidence gap really is one of the main contributors to the gap in grades, it should be reasonably easy to correct.  A small investment in teaching women to be confident and take intellectual risks could have huge payoffs by increasing the number of women capable of performing in STEM careers."

The lawsuit was brought by parents, clergy, scientists and educators who argued that the Arkansas state law known as the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act 590), which mandated the teaching of ""creation science"" in Arkansas public schools, was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  In the final opinion was the following:   The approach to teaching ‘creation science’ and ‘evolution science’ . . . is identical to the two-model approach espoused by the Institute for Creation Research and is taken almost verbatim from ICR writings. It is an extension of Fundamentalists’ view that one must either accept the literal interpretation of Genesis or else believe in the godless system of evolution. The two model approach of creationists is simply a contrived dualism which has no scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose. It assumes only two explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Application of these two models, according to creationists, and the defendants, dictates that all scientific evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism and is, therefore, creation science ‘evidence.’"

Not to promote anything or one over another. But that we should have the ability to discuss.”   The senators are obviously unaware of the meaning of the term ""scientific theory"".  Wikipedia defines it as follows: ""A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.""   Because proper scientific theories are well substantiated and repeatedly tested and confirmed one simply cannot have ""competing theories"" ... either the facts substantiate one and not the other, or they substantiate neither one. ""Competing theories"" cannot both be substantiated and confirmed by the facts. Ergo the phrase ""competing theories"" is an oxymoron.

Freethought,2t8suc,RhomboidStorm,1 point,Thu Jan 22 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"Well, they can have competing theories   No, they cannot.   but those competing theories need to be backed by facts and observations   The facts and observations can only confirm one theory. In the case where there is ambiguity and there are two competing explanations they are called ""hypotheses"", not theories. In this case scientists gather further facts and observations which can distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Once those are obtained these further facts and observations will either confirm neither hypotheis, or they will confirm one or the other. The one which is confirmed becomes a theory, and the one which is refuted is discarded.   There are numerous competing theories about the big bang   No there aren't. When an explanation for an aspect of the Big Bang is called a theory it is the only explanation which is not refuted. Any aspect of the Big Bang which has multiple proposed explanations, those competing proposed explanations are called hypotheses.  Read the definitions of ""scientific hypothesis"" and ""scientific theory"" once again and it should become clear to you.  Edit: Wikipedia defines a hypothesis as: ""A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it."" Note that since one cannot test the idea of ""Intelligent Design"" it doesn't even make the grade as a scientific hypothesis. Note also that since there is an enormous amount of facts and evidence supporting and confirming the Theory of Evolution, it is indeed a proper scientific theory. There are no ""competing theories"" to the theory of evolution. The phrase ""competing theories"" is an oxymoron."
Freethought,2t8suc,hal2k1,4,Thu Jan 22 04:58:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  In some areas of science there are indeed multiple competing theories, all which use the same data.  Here is an article on string theory.  Note the section about competing theories in this case.    And while the big bang is leader in explaining the beginning of the universe, it is not alone.  We do not know what happened.  In any of these theories we use the knowledge we have to create a theory about what happened.  When we get new information, we change the theory.  In may cases we have gaps in knowledge.  This is not to say that a given theory is wrong, just that alternative solutions are possible.   While there are no commonly accepted, scientific, competing theories to evolution, does not mean there could not be.  You seem to have this idea that scientist are able to magically determine the ""correct"" theory after a few experiments.  Theories are tossed aside when new theories that better fit the data are created.  The idea of Newtonian physics was the predominant theory until Einstein introduced relatively.  Even after his introduction, it was not universally accepted right away.  We just happen to see this as the ""generally accepted theory"" But even now physicist are looking at new theories that refute parts of Einstein's work.    tl:dr - you rely on wikipedia way too much for your information."
Freethought,2t8suc,RhomboidStorm,0,Thu Jan 22 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"You seem to have this idea that scientist are able to magically determine the ""correct"" theory after a few experiments.   No, that is not it at all. Read the definitions. If there is only one explanation that is not contradicted by the facts (observations) or results from experiments, then it is properly called the current theory. This does not mean it is necessarily correct, it merely means (when the term is correctly applied) it is the only explanation we have that (a) explains the data, observations and results we have, and (b) is not contradicted by any known data, observations and results.  If there is more than one proposed explanation that fits all the known data, observations and results then we do not have multiple theories we have only multiple hypotheses. This is because in order to be a theory an explanation must be well supported and confirmed, and it cannot be so if another different explanation is also still viable. Unfortunately this is sometimes ignored, the term theory is often abused (especially by people like yourself who do not know what the term means), and we do get things such as string ""theory"" being labelled as a theory when they do not fit the definition of a scientific theory.   I disagree.   I couldn't care less if you disagree or not ... the definition of ""scientific theory"" is what it is, and it is not what you thought it is, and it is not what the Republican state senators apparently think it is.  Just to remind you ... from Wikipedia: ""A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.""  Plainly stated: String theory does not fit this definition. Intelligent Design does not fit this definition. The Theory of Evolution does fit this definition.  Edit: Since you apparently distrust Wikipedia on this matter, read further support from Rational Wiki: """"Theory"" is a Jekyll-and-Hyde term that means different things depending on the context and who is using it. While in everyday speech anything that attempts to provide an explanation for a cause can be dubbed a ""theory"", a scientific theory has a much more specific meaning. Scientific theory is far more than just a casual conjecture or some Joe's guesswork. A theory in this context is a well-substantiated explanation for a series of facts and observations that is testable and can be used to predict future observations. ""  Support from LiveScience: ""A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next step—known as a theory—in the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon.  When used in non-scientific context, the word “theory” implies that something is unproven or speculative. As used in science, however, a theory is an explanation or model based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning, especially one that has been tested and confirmed as a general principle helping to explain and predict natural phenomena.""  Support from the National Academic Press: ""In everyday usage, “theory” often refers to a hunch or a speculation. When people say, “I have a theory about why that happened,” they are often drawing a conclusion based on fragmentary or inconclusive evidence. The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially."""

In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine circles of suffering located within the Earth.

If theists want to argue that no atheists exist, and that people who claim they're atheists are just agnostics who are strongly leaning toward the conclusion that there is no god, that's fine by me.  This difficulty in terminology exists because rational thought and religious convictions exist in two separate arenas.  Rational thought develops conclusions with the knowledge that, if contrary evidence is later discovered, the conclusions are subject to change.  Religious convictions, on the other hand, need to be presented as incontrovertible truth not subject to change, since they're not based on empirical facts in the first place (if a conviction isn't based on facts, why would it be modified by other facts?).  So when a theist points out that no one can be conclusively sure that there is no god, well, yeah - that's the point."

This strong atheism very easy because (so far) any concept of any god i could come across is fallacious, self-contradictionary, laughable, nonsensical, irrational, illogical, impossible and most of all, IRRELEVANT in regards to progress within, reality AND fiction.  Its much simpler than that. all gods are made up fiction, and they are harmfull fiction for our modern society with real negatively acting impersonators. not only are they made up, they are made up VERY POORLY. not only are they made up very poorly. even the most gamous religions manage do refute their fundamental claims of the existance of a god (or anything supernatural or praiseworthy attached to that character) within the first 2 sentences of their ""holy texts"".  if THATS the best you can do, its like talking to a 1 year old. therefore strong atheism.    if you argue about differences between strong atheism and ""weak atheism"" you already lost to wordplays of theists that were invented with the sole purpose to confuse and exploit people.    meanwhile the pope orders police forces to wear diapers. i wish i just made the last sentence up, but its actually happening."

Freethought,2sf8kd,TheBobMcCormick,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"For a child yes. Your argument is moot however, an adult with a logical functioning mind can say santa claus does not exist in the paramaters we were told when we were children. Not only is there a lack of evidence to prove santa exists, there is evidence he does not exist (i.e. your parents admitting to lying to you for all those years). If the same person were to try to disprove gods existence they (hopefully) might come to a conclusion that lack of evidence is not proof of absence. The problem lies in humans believing their experience and perceptions are absolute, that there is no way anything can exist outside of the range of our senses, or the senses of the machines we create to give us data on what we cannot percieve. Best to try not to be narrow-minded."
Freethought,2sf8kd,gnosticlava,2,Thu Jan 15 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're talking about the classic logical fallacy of a ""Negative Proof"".     The lack of evidence that god doesn't exist is not evidence he/she does exist.  Just like the lack of evidence of the non-existence of unicorns, elves, or Jedi does not constitute evidence that unicorns, elves, or Jedi exist."

Freethought,2sf8kd,gnosticlava,2,Fri Jan 16 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry.  What you said was that ""lack of evidence is not proof of absence"".   Regardless of what we call that argument, I still don't see how that is a more persuasive argument for gods existence than it would be for the existence of Thor or unicorns.  How is it different?    While it is true that human experience and perceptions are not absolute, how is this evidence for the existence of god, if it's not also equally evidence for the existence of bigfoot?"
Freethought,2sf8kd,TheBobMcCormick,0,Fri Jan 16 04:08:46 2015 UTC,"Im not trying to prove god exists. None of my arguments are to convince anyone of gods existence.  My argument is that absolute denial of a concept that is unprovable is just as narrow minded as absolute belief in said concept.  Lets hypothesize that one possibility of our evolution is into extradimensional beings that are able to travel time in the form they are accustomed to. When these extradimensional beings enter into the third dimension they become beings with a form because they are impercievable to third dimensional beings in the form they move through other dimensions in. How could one possibly prove they were anything other than a crazy person with a tall tale? To me, not being able to prove something does exist,  does not mean it doesn't exist. Schroedingers god."
Freethought,2sf8kd,gnosticlava,2,Fri Jan 16 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"True, you can never prove 100% absolutely that something doesn't exist, whether that something is unicorns, Wookies, or god.  But in all three cases the likelihood of those things existing is so incredibly low that it might as well be 0% probability.     There certainly could be impercievable aliens all around us (HP Lovecraft has some awesome stories around just that idea).  There could be invisible fairies in my garden as well. But generally we don't waste a lot of time debating about those ideas like we do about the existence or non existence of this idea people call god.  Why is that? If I say I doubt the existence of fairies in my garden most people wouldn't bat an eye.  But if I say I doubt the existence of god people freak out.  Why is one different than the other?   absolute denial of a concept that is unprovable   Just to be clear, while I'm sure you can find atheists (probably here on reddit) who have an absolute faith that no god exists, that certainly is not my belief or the belief of any of the atheists I know in real life.  I disbelieve in God in much the same way I disbelieve in UFO's, bigfoot, or invisible fairies in my garden.  All of the above seem so improbable and silly that I simply don't waste a significant amount of time thinking about them.  Except when I get into discussions with friendly internet strangers of course.  :-)"
Freethought,2sf8kd,TheBobMcCormick,0,Fri Jan 16 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Narwhales bro. Unicorns did exist. During the great flood they used their magic to evolve into sea creatures because noah left them behind. Fairys and aliens are real and they are the same thing. And i think that philosophical debates on the nature of existence are as important to the development of our society and selves as the scientific pursuit of medicine or anything else. I dont like that you bundle all these concepts into the same disposable pile, but I understand why you do it. Essentially your argument is that any of these concepts are silly to even think about. By doing that you may not be intentionally doing so, but you leave the impression that anyone with faith is worthy of being mocked as believing in a silly children's book or fairy tale, and I dont believe that.  I think that, for many people, having faith is a way of being grateful for the inexplicable gift of existence. Personally I dont think fanaticism is an acceptable expression of faith, and most people with any barometer for sanity would recognize lunacy for what it is. Unfortunately those who scream the loudest are heard the most. I also dont believe the idea of faith should be discarded as so ridiculous as not to be considered anymore."

I foresee it only changing if there's a revolt and they're executed for crimes against humanity, or if the population's support for Western values grows over generations to such a point that there's no way to politically sustain the fundamentalist control.

I would word it more like I'm reminding you to approach this things critically. It's pretty difficult to explain the actually very intelligent reasoning behind this rule without proper context and background in the teachings of Judaism, but I'll give it my best shot. I'll start with the concept of God. God>man in every way and is much much smarter, understands the way the world works much (infinitely?) better etc. Next concept: the receiving of the Torah. It happened directly between Moses and God with ~600,000 people looking on. God gave us instructions that fall into 2 categories: rules that can be logically determined and therefore logically augmented (mostly everything) and rules that are there because God says so. The rationally driven western mind naturally recoils at this idea, but the reason for this is that these laws are in place to accomplish things that a human being simply doesn't and never will have the ability to comprehend (keeping kosher for example: there's plenty of logical benefits to it, but the true reason for it is divine). The Torah (both written and oral) have guidelines regarding the maintenance of sexual \spiritual purity that don't quite go as far as what is practiced. Break. New relevant concept: there is a commandment in the Torah to listen to the rabbis for new laws (only applicable when the holy Temple is erect, each member of this rabbinic council is the greatest of the generation, prophets almost always counted among them). This is exemplified in the celebration of Chanukah. When lighting the candles we say ""Blessed be god, ruler of the universe who gave us the commandment to light the chanukah candles."" What? God commanded us to light the chanukah candles? All that business happened way after the giving of the Torah!?!? How did god make that call? Well the rabbis who's word we are obligated to heed did, so God did. Moving on. Prohibitions from doing things in the Torah are almost always insulated by rabbinic laws. For keeping the sabbath it is a breach if you create fire (electronics). Rabbinic laws make it so you can't even touch that object so you won't accidentally come to use it. The same has been done with the laws for the guarding of ones purity. The law was never stated in the Torah that you can't look at women, but rabbinic dictums make that so. Or maybe not. I know for sure giant rabbis that didn't have any true legal say have stated this level of guard is necessary, and their word is accepted in certain very religious communities. I'll have to look into that. But yeah I hope that sums it up. Feel free to inquire deeper!!"

Bill Maher is ""openly secular"", but why hasn't he professed his disbelief in goblins and fairies as well?  It's because people who believe in goblins don't use the violence of government against people.  So Maher has missed the point.  Religious people are only a problem because of government.  We should be opposed to the initiation of force, whatever the source, be in religious, unions, corporations, gangs, the majority, or whatever.  Scientists using violence to control my life is no better than priests doing the same.

Freethought,2s8owy,TheAethereal,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"The Somolia example shows that, in the absence of a government capable of using force to control the bad elements in society, those elements take over and make the community even more chaotic and violent.   No, it really doesn't.  First , I'm arguing against violence, and Somalia has tons of it.  Second, Somalia is a failed communist state.  Third, conditions improved in Somalia following the collapse of the state.  Somalia is a hell hole because of the culture, not the lack of government.  Lack of government doesn't equal a lack of violence.  But the presence of government guarantees the presence of violence.   The fact remains that the minimalist-government model promoted by many modern libertarians has absolutely zero examples of working in any sufficiently-sized community in the history of mankind.   I'm not arguing for a minimalist-government model.  I'm arguing for peace.  You seem to be thinking of the absence of government as a type of government, that can be forced on people.  It doesn't work that way.  It requires a sufficiently large number of people to be devoted to the idea that you shouldn't initiate force.  I don't know what the ratio is, but it would have to be high enough that those people could defend themselves.  Likely 50% or greater.  But you are right, it hasn't been done for something like 1000 years, so what are all these examples of ""private interests exploiting the populace and natural resources"" in such societies?   government is the problem   Government doesn't exist.  It's an abstraction.  Government is people using violence.  Give me one example of where a religious person has harmed you (other than maybe the vaccine example I gave previously) that didn't involve the initiation of force.

Just don't send your kids to those schools.  Don't even associate with them if you don't want to.  It's when they try and use guns to extract funding from you that it becomes a problem.  That's where government comes into play.  Edit: I didn't mean to suggest religion wasn't a personal mistake.

And others have, like Reza Azlan, whom I don't necessarily always agree with either.   It's a complicated situation.  Christopher Hitchens was the same way.  He had double the ire against Muslims as he did against other religions when an objective examination would likely reveal they're both neck-in-neck in terms of historical atrocities (if not the Christians in the lead on that).  But these are the secular icons we have.  I don't know of many who have any notoriety and are willing to face down all the prominent demons of our time simultaneously.   So I'll take what I can get.. for now.  And hope for more later.  This illustrates one of the fundamental problems with modern-day progressives, leftists and liberals.  They have the ""sacred shaft of idealism"" shoved so far up their ass, they can't bend in any direction.  But reality never happens in monumentally-universally-recognized increments.  Liberals wanted single payer.  Obama compromised with the ACA.  Now both sides hate it.  But it's a helluva lot better than ""dont-get-fucking-sick-or-youre-gonna-die-CARE"" that the other side thought was peachy.

Freethought,2rqxn4,murraybiscuit,5,Thu Jan 8 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"My Canadian rage subsided a bit.   It shouldn't, the mere existence of a blasphemy law is harmful to free speech. We had one too until recently when it was simply removed. It hadn't been used in court since the 50's, and it was deemed irrelevant because it was contrary to our constitution.  Yet it can be used as a legal threat and silence those who don't want to go through that kind of bullocks, and especially those who are unaware the law can't be used against anyone anymore. At a minimum you need a lawyer to advice on the merit of a legal notice no matter how bogus it seems.  This is why those laws need to be completely removed, so they can't threaten freedom of expression and freedom speech anymore.  The law should have been removed at least in 1980 when there was an actual case, same could very likely be said here, with the only difference being that we finally got rid of it last year.  Blasphemy laws are an affront to everything democracy is supposed to represent. It signifies special treatment to religion that is completely unwarranted. Even if it was  introduced originally to protect religious minorities, it must be removed, because while religious freedom is protected along with other freedoms, it doesn't justify this level of special treatment.  Just as religions particular privileged tax exemption isn't justified, but should be treated as every other kind of non profit activity."
Freethought,2rqxn4,Buffalox,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"It probably doesn't need to be bothered with.  The failed 1980's attempt is probably enough of a precedent to prevent any future enforcement, and it's likely that any case wouldn't survive a charter challenge on free speech grounds, so unless someone wants to strike it as part of an omnibus bill, or throw up a private members bill for the sole purpose of striking a defunct law then they're free to do so, but it's really not that important or on anyone's list of priorities and it wouldn't really do anyone any service.    It's not as though the Charter is going to get weaker in the future, we've seen the exact opposite play out in courts (how many times did the supreme court rule against the government just last year, and how many of those times were for laws that were found inconsistent under the Charter?) so it's a certainty that any future attempts at using the blasphemy law would be impossible, even if we somehow elected literally the Taliban Party.  But we aren't going to elect any such radicals.  About as far out as you could get are the Parti Quebecois (provincial) on that front, and look how well that turned out for them in  their last election, even before the Supreme Court could have a chance to review the bullshit they tried to put through.  So while it perhaps should be, there's really no need to strike it, and there's no one pushing to."

Freethought,2rqxn4,gmule,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"I have to believe that as in Europe, there are Canadians on the conservative and religious side of things, particularly in the West as well as in Quebec, who see the value in having a blasphemy law on the books.  Just last year Quebec tried to pass its 'Charter of Values' which seemed to be a law to support secularism, yet elevated Christianity by giving exceptions to a few Christian symbols (the large crucifix in the National Assembly for one) and holiday celebrations while it suppressed others, ultimately making the law an ethnocentric one that wouldn't have benefited secularism in the slightest.    There's the 'Barbaric Cultural Practices' law that's essentially nothing but a provocation against non-Christians, specifically Muslims that makes nothing a crime that already isn't one.  Its name alone is the whole purpose of the bill.  To call those Muslims 'barbarians,' a reminder that they're 'others,' and lump all of them in with the ones who commit crimes under the guise of their heritage and religion.    These kinds of bills and laws come from a political base that does believe that Canada is a Christian nation, and that Christianity should be elevated above other religions.  So I don't have any trouble believing that some of these folks might like that there's a blasphemy law on the books, even if it can't ever be used.    Then by extension, if a Conservative government wants to strike that law, then they need to be aware of the fact that while it makes them look good to the progressives(who probably won't vote for them anyways), it doesn't make them look that good to that small group of people that's virtually guaranteed to vote for them.  Religious conservatives might not be a big group in Canada, but they vote, and they don't vote for the Liberals.  Essentially, they risk maybe losing some hardcore supporters in exchange for some good will that probably won't translate into actual votes from the progressives.  There's not really any upside, and as far as I can tell, Canada's never been particularly motivated by those kinds of issues.  Stirring the religious pot in Canada tends to be bad for those that do(The PQ last election and John Tory's failed Ontario bid are some recent examples of stirring that pot with bad results), leaving it alone and letting the courts keep the state and church separate is probably the most politically sound move for any leader in any time leading up to an election."

It's not free from violence - absolutely no organized religion has what I'd call progressive scripture - but the broader message is substantially rosier than we tend to give it credit for, especially when taken in context with its authorship.  The overriding message in Judaism is to strive to be moral and productive. By the first century CE, Hebrew society had come to resemble (somewhat) life in medieval Roman Catholic Europe; the priesthood completely dominated society. And lineage was substantially more of a concern for mainstream Judaism than it is today, which is saying something; it could be very difficult to join the priesthood if you weren't supposed to be descended from Aaron.  Furthermore, the Hebrew language was already (mostly) reserved for religious use, the citizens of ancient Judea speaking mainly Aramaic. So there was just this huge divide between the priest caste/class/call-it-whatever and the rest of the populace.  The overriding message of Christianity, then, was along the lines of, ""Hey, guys, this is pretty fucked up."" Return to the pursuit of a moral and productive life; make your worship about your personal relationship with God, rather than your adherence to the rituals and rulings of your local synagogue.  Of course, people have been twisting and manipulating it for as long, now, as they'd been doing the same to ancient Judaism (possibly even longer, and certainly for longer than the Torah/Pentateuch had existed when all this was going on).  It's not that Christianity is a violent religion. It's that some people are violent, and some of those people are powerful, and organized religion represents a very consistent avenue for controlling the populace."

The problem with religious fundamentalists is that the fundamentals in their book are so ignorant, violent and intolerant.  You are very close when you say that insane people fail to cherrypick their religious beliefs.  But this is the point, if you consciously choose to not do what is spelled out in the book, in what sense are you really practicing the religion?

We don't hold environmentalists, Republicans, Iraqi nationalists, or the mentally ill at large accountable for any of these actions.  Religious extremism is no different from any other form of extremism, and should be combated wherever it occurs. The use of organized religion to manipulate adherents is also a Bad Thing, and it should also be combated whenever possible, but they aren't usually the same thing, and they shouldn't be conflated.  Westerners are especially keen to blame Muslims because, for the first time in over a hundred years, we aren't at war with another major power.

They have an agenda and nothing will change their mind that women are oppressed.  There are many reasons why I'm not a feminist, believing that women are inferior to men is not one of them. As a short list, among those reasons:  No matter how many times they are shown to have bogus statistics, they just keep rehashing the same numbers.  Rape hysteria.  Victimhood complex.  The denial of male victims of pretty much anything.  Unfalsifiable patriarchy theory.  Unfalsifiable, nonsensical rape culture.  The (widespread) demonization of males.

It's this exact type of reasoning which is why I can't get behind feminism. Even when something is biased against men, it's still framed as ultimately a prejudice against women.  But you're only looking at it from one perspective. You see ""women are seen as the caretakers,"" and that's oppressive toward women. But the flip-side of that is ""men are seen as bad caretakers.""   It's the same set of gender roles, but it's equally restrictive toward both sexes. So why is it that it's ultimately a ""prejudiced view of women?"" It's not.   Yes, traditional gender roles can be restrictive. Yes, we should try to break traditional gender roles, especially the ones that are useless and out-dated. I agree with feminists on that.  However, despite what feminists say, traditional gender roles didn't come into existence to solely benefit men at the expense of women. Traditional gender roles (as imperfect and outdated as they are) were ultimately designed to be complementary. Both men and women have benefited from them - and paid costs too.  I'm all for breaking through traditional gender roles, but I greatly disagree with how feminism often frames the issues, and seems to almost exclusively focus on how these traditional gender roles hurt women.   (Sure, feminists will admit these gender roles can hurt men too. But it's never to a significant degree. And when they do admit a gender role hurts men, it's almost always turned into an argument for ""but this is ultimately oppressive toward women."" As you just demonstrated.)"

If a woman gets drunk and has sex she's not responsible for her actions; she was raped.  If a man gets drunk and has sex he's responsible for his actions and he's the rapist.  If a woman commits a crime she gets half the sentence or less than a man for the same crime.  Women can cheat on deployed military husbands, partying on his paycheck, and when he comes home divorce him and marry her boyfriend and people will cheer her on because the guy ""probably deserved it"".  If a girl walks alone in a bad neighborhood at night and gets raped then trying to say anything about precautions is ""victim blaming"" and rape culture and means all men need to be taught not to rape.  If a man does the same and gets robbed then everyone is quick to point out that it's his fault.  Feminism regularly perpetuates lies (like the 76 cents on the dollar myth or whatever number is going around these days).  Even Obama repeated the lie.  Except if women were really worth less every company would fire men and hire cheaper women instead.  The difference accounts for career choices where women chose safe easy jobs with less hours while men choose the jobs that will get them killed at a 10:1 ratio to women.  Women regularly misuse statistics to try and achieve equal outcomes at the top (STEM majors) despite already having equal opportunity.  Western feminism is toxic and people are waking up to that.

Freethought,2r1vpf,carutsu,3,Sat Jan 3 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"I don't like the word oppression, rather males and females have different issues and privileges. In the US males are routinely circumcised, in Mexico thankful we are not, you guys need to fix that. That's a systematic issue, boys should be protected. Males are falling behind, way, way behind girls in education from kindergarten to university, we need to fix that. Rape victims are routinely ignored (even in war zones), we need to fix that. There are very vocal feminist who insist males are not necessary or even harmful, we need to fix that. The framing of rape and domestic violence as inherently gendered is flawed and demonizing, we need to fix that. Some feminist insist that an accusation of rape is pretty much enough for a conviction or at the very least a public lynching, we need to fix that. Some feminist just love vilifying male sexuality, we need to fix that. Feminists need to accept that females do have privileges, for example, females are inherently valuable while males are valued as what they do, other privilege is that women are given much, much lesser sentences for the same crimes, we need to fix that. Men die at many more times than women on the work, we need to fix that (would you imagine what would happen if it were the reverse.)   We have a lot of work to do and a lot of fixing to do for both males and females; the problem is that feminists insist that the source of all evil is males and masculinity and if we only let them have more resources, more power and their ideas everything would be fine; all while at the same time continuing to ignore or vilify males."

Freethought,2r1vpf,diesel_stinks_,12,Fri Jan 2 10:08:36 2015 UTC,"All of them... I don't know what you're expecting me to say. Men don't have any rights concerning reproduction except the right to remain celibate. We only have one birth control option and it's a poor one, we can't choose to have abortions, or put our children up for adoption, or abandon our children.    Edit: Distracted, can't write."
Freethought,2r1vpf,zombiesingularity,-5,Fri Jan 2 10:13:46 2015 UTC,Men can't have abortions and take birth control? No shit. Looks like your argument lies with biology and not reproductive rights. Men can't adopt? What? What are you even talking about? This is hilarious.
Freethought,2r1vpf,diesel_stinks_,8,Fri Jan 2 10:17:56 2015 UTC,"Men can't have abortions and take birth control? No shit.    Men are expected to take care of their offspring, but they have no say over what happens to that offspring. This is not difficult to understand.   Read my edit."

Freethought,2r1vpf,carutsu,2,Fri Jan 2 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"Nop, I'm not persecuted. I don't even live in the US. But whenever you try to raise a problem with how men are treated usually you get a backlash as ""but won't anybody think of the women."" Also, you have to do it in a feminism perspective or you are being misogynist (do look up for some MRA conferences, seriously, they are quite fun.) That's what I mean about asking permission. Either you agree with them on every single issue and promise to never ever think otherwise again or you are a horrible misogynist rape supporter patriarchy enforcer.  Regarding MRA conferences, have you seen the backlash in Toronto?, it got kind of violent so yeah some very vocal faction of feminism does behave like a cult from which you have to ask for thought permission. Very McCarty."

Things maybe slanted to one side, possibly even heavily, but it's not as though the media contains nothing on the subject or ""permission"" is in any way granted for these topics to be discussed.  Hitchens wrote an article called ""why women aren't funny"" that explored the nature of female attraction and the male desire to appeal, instead of it being shut down he was rewarded with a lot of airtime and series of follow up articles."
Freethought,2r1vpf,yourpants,2,Fri Jan 2 12:13:14 2015 UTC,You don't think he was highly criticized? The backlash was immense but he kept getting airtime because he stood firm in his controversial views. News outlets prop this stuff up all the time to gain viewers regardless of how its perceived.
Freethought,2r1vpf,orwellsocietyguy,0,Fri Jan 2 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"Then how and where is he ""getting permission"" to speak about it? He got the sort of criticism you'd expect from a deliberately obtuse headline like that. The media is there to air the debate and they did. There was no ""propping up"" of his journalism - that in itself in an insult to Hitchens talent. It was an incredibly well positioned and ironically humorous piece that achieved its aim."
Freethought,2r1vpf,carutsu,0,Fri Jan 2 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Well Hitch could argue with whomever he wanted, but have you seen what has been happening in the recent times? you are ""either a feminist or a sexist, there's nothing in between"". Overall is a horrible movement, honestly. I said some reasons why I think so in another, previuos comment."
Freethought,2r1vpf,orwellsocietyguy,1 point,Fri Jan 2 23:40:32 2015 UTC,So simply having an opinion on the matter is all the evidence that's required? If people are not allowed to debate and be wrong about something how is society to ever progress? It's ironic that you would simply offer an opinion as evidence whilst labelling yourself a 'freethinker'.   The initial suffragettes movement was fought publicly by both sexist patriarchs and internally by political radicals who felt the movement didn't go far enough. The first lot were wrong the second lot were counter productive because they were opinionated.
Freethought,2r1vpf,carutsu,1 point,Sat Jan 3 09:58:37 2015 UTC,"So, all of a sudden the same side who always says just ""listen to women"", ""listen to other people's experiences"" feels free to shun ours? By ours I mean a growing group of people who are honestly tired of their bully tactics and their mob mentality  Also I have no idea what does the suffragette movement has to do with this conversation."
Freethought,2r1vpf,orwellsocietyguy,1 point,Sat Jan 3 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"If the debate is shut down then you have a case. But it's not so you don't. The Hitch article is a prime example. If your upset by being ""shunned"" by a vocal minority then maybe you should grow some balls and stop being so precious.  The Original suffragettes movement only wanted equal rights for married women of status. Ethnic minorities, working class and divorcees were quite frankly unacceptable as members of society - let alone worth of voting rights. Is that something you would support? I doubt it. But it was the movement that won over because it was the most dedicated to the debate."
Freethought,2r1vpf,carutsu,0,Sun Jan 4 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"If the debate is shut down then you have a case.   Could you clarify this? I'm sorry, I don't quite follow, perhaps permission was kind of a strong word. However, many MRA conferences have been stopped because of violent protest by feminist, others also because of interruptions by feminist and in at least one instance threatens of violence in the name of feminism; many persons have had their livelihood compromised because they dared to present a narrative other than that of feminism. Worse still, there have been people who were labeled as sexist (with the usual media lynching) for simply disagreeing with a feminist. So a lot of feminism are really trying to shut down the discussion.  And before you get the wrong idea, no I'm not saying it is fascism, but it has a vein of a very repressive tendencies. A taste of Marxist, if you will.   If your upset by being ""shunned"" by a vocal minority then maybe you should grow some balls and stop being so precious.   Somehow I would believe you wouldn't ever dare say that if you were talking to a woman. That's a double standard in your part. Perhaps you need to be a woman to get your issues considered important? And why do you think I'm still having these kinds of discussions?    The Original suffragettes movement only wanted equal rights for married women of status. Ethnic minorities, working class and divorcees were quite frankly unacceptable as members of society - let alone worth of voting rights. Is that something you would support? I doubt it. But it was the movement that won over because it was the most dedicated to the debate.   So what? I don't get your point, so just because feminism now has a lot of institutional power and popularity we should not speak of its numerous flaws? believe me it has many, a lot of vitriol and victim complex runs through it and as such I cannot call myself a feminist."

And most of these examples aren't origin myths anyway. And in a few of them consent is given.  Also in the Jesus myth, the Holy Spirit/angel/whatever it was tells Mary what's up and she basically says ""Sure I'm your humble servant"" and only questions it because she's not sure she's worthy to be the mother of god. All in all, she seems pretty happy to be carrying the son of god.  It's an interesting thought experiment, but I think it's really reaching. There are plenty of examples of how different religions are unfair to women; we don't need to invent more."
Freethought,2q7fv2,danaofdoom,6,Tue Dec 23 21:52:18 2014 UTC,">90% of the examples in the article are not related to religions origins. The virgin mary? Sure, there'd be no Jesus without that, that's a pretty important rape (if you consider it a rape). A lesser greek god banging some human is not an origin story though, it's just a story of someone raping someone else. They also seem to consider 'most religions' to be about 4 or 5 religions, and many of these cases are not even presented as rape in context of the stories. If I have a dream about having sex with some guy and then discover I'm pregnant some weeks later that's not a rape unless I felt some sort of aversion to the sex during the dream, it's just sex."
Freethought,2q7fv2,kryptobs2000,7,Tue Dec 23 21:37:21 2014 UTC,"I don't even think the Mary story was rape, since in the story an angel or the holy spirit or whatever comes along and tells her she's been chosen, and she seems pretty happy about it."

Freethought,2q7fv2,kryptobs2000,4,Tue Dec 23 21:58:17 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah I missed the parenthesis there.   Also, you make a good point about it being 4 or 5 religions. How many of these are Greek/Roman mythology? They just listed a bunch of myths from the same religion (Romans adopted Greek gods/myths and renamed them, so they barely count as a separate religion) and acted like this was some exhaustive list.   It's true that a lot of religions have viewed sex as an analogy for creation, but I don't think rape is really a dominant theme in most of them. I did a lot of my senior thesis research on pre-Columbian cultures in the Peruvian Andes, and a lot of those cultures had this whole idea of exchanges going on between the earth and the gods. There were a lot of analogies between planting (male) seeds into the (female) earth, and a male ejaculating into a female. In my opinion, these ideas are really coming out of the observable phenomena that exist in nature, but can't necessarily be explained. It's easy to see how a woman becoming pregnant and giving birth could be considered mysterious and magical, and could be seen as the only logical way that the earth could be formed. Rape isn't really part of that. Sure, in a lot of myths there are gods forcing themselves sexually on human women, or impregnating them without asking (but not necessarily by having sex with them). But I don't think this is as much about a low regard for women as it is about a view that the gods are cruel and do what they want with mortals. The gods are pretty damn cruel to men in these stories too. A lot of cultures just view humans as pawns in the cosmic power struggle of the gods, or view gods as moody, cruel beings that need to be pacified with endless sacrifices and prayers in order to keep them from losing their shit and causing disease, famine, and natural disasters. Why would such a being ask permission before impregnating a woman? The whole point of the story is to demonstrate that the gods are powerful and we need to keep them happy or else.  And actually, I quite like those types of creation myths. I think they give women a lot more credit than our current Abrahamic versions, which just have a male god doing all the creating on his own, or taking male body parts (Adam's rib) and using them to create women (Eve). And why is he male anyway? What is the point in god having a gender if he's creating the world asexually?"

Freethought,2q7fv2,danaofdoom,4,Tue Dec 23 22:45:20 2014 UTC,Couldn't it be argued that it's an abuse of power?  Who's going to say no to god?

I can't believe people take this stuff seriously.
Freethought,2q7fv2,dregofsociety,7,Tue Dec 23 23:34:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you could say it's an abuse of power, but only if you believe that a god's power can be abused. The real issue I'm taking with this article is that it's looking at these mythologies from a purely modern-day, Western mindset. It isn't putting these stories into the cultural context in which they were developed. The people in these cultures probably saw gods as forces of nature. It was their way of explaining why things were the way they were. There wasn't much question of whether or not it was moral, because the gods either set the rules for what was moral, or else were exempt from human ideas about morals. Asking if a god impregnating a woman against her will is abusing his power would be like asking if a hurricane is abusing its power by knocking over your house.  Edit to add: Also, I only take it seriously because I have a B.A. in Anthropology. Creation myths are really interesting windows into how a culture understands the universe around it. There is so much more going on than what's at the surface, and I don't think it's very fair to judge how a culture treats women based on creation mythology. Every culture has mythology. It helps ground people in their history, helps explain why a culture is the way it is. Once upon a time, it helped people explain the world around them. But what's far more relevant is what people do with that today. Fundamentalists using the Bible/Quran/Torah/whatever to oppress people? Clearly a bad thing. But that's more a problem with the people using those stories to support their hatred than with the stories themselves. There are plenty of people out there who read the same stories and take completely different messages from them."

Freethought,2q7fv2,rhombic_pentameter,2,Wed Dec 24 17:59:46 2014 UTC,"The whole concept was different back then. Rape was what you did to your enemies women so they would give birth to your children and thus end their bloodlines.  Consider the Biblical tale of ""The Woman at the Well"". The reason this story was told was because of the fact that the woman was alone at the well. According to tradition of the time, her being alone meant she was hoping for some man to come along and claim her, as this is what happened to unaccompanied females back then. Women were considered property, like a cow or a house. Any lone female was considered fair game for anyone willing to pick her up, as a woman back then had few rights not allotted her by some man.  This was the prevailing attitude regarding women, thus their being raped was considered nothing more than a dramatic trope to the Bible's writers."

Pantheists thus do not believe in a distinct personal or anthropomorphic god.  Some Eastern religions are considered to be pantheistically inclined.  Pantheism was popularised in the West as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza,  :p.7 whose book Ethics was an answer to Descartes' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.  Spinoza held the monist view that the two are the same, and monism is a fundamental part of his philosophy. He was described as a ""God-intoxicated man,"" and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.  Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.

Freethought,2q9cdd,Long_dan,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:57:08 2015 UTC,"But my biggest hookup is that everything happens for a reason   You don't need the umbrella of ""religion"" to explain your world view.  Science can do it very well.  Everything does happen for a reason.  Everything that happens has an explanation.  And the universe will ""take care of you.""  However, the definition of ""take care of you"" might vary a bit.  The atomic particles that make up your being will always exist and always be in use in one form or another.   But the fact remains that there is no evidence that any higher power that has a personal interest in any of us exists.  It makes people feel good to believe otherwise, but the problem with this belief is that it has to be continually reconciled with reality, which more-often-than-not doesn't act in accordance.  And this is the paradox of religion.  A short-term answer that results in more long-term questions."

The notion that socialism and communism are ""evil"" is highly subjective, and certainly not any type of objective truth.   And based on recent events such as the torture of people held without being charged crimes and our primary head of state calling for the promotion of a movie whose plot centers around our administration ordering the murder of an autonomous head of state, America is clearly proving that a ""democratic republic"" is quite capable of perpetrating plenty of evil as well."

If the application is that easy, I think that what would be even more effective would be a rush to flood the capitol with as many different displays as possible.  Have 50 or 100 people each apply for a display, ideally on the first day that applications are accepted.  Maybe when the floor of the rotunda is so crowded as to be impassable, lawmakers will finally realize the folly of making it a forum for display of religious symbols.  Alternatively, if they cease taking applications at a certain point, then the nonsense displays will crowd out the Christian displays that this policy is obviously designed to accommodate.  And if they turn down a nonsense application in favor of a later application for a Christian display, then they're discriminating on the basis of content or viewpoint, and subject to a slam-dunk lawsuit."

A religious display in the capitol is a display of culture by some of the voters for which the building is erected, but what about the others?  Throughout history, religious symbols have been used to mark territory as favored toward (or biased against) one religion or another.

This claim can only be borne out of an ignorance of ML/Judaism and of Christianity.  My feelings about GSMs and modern sexual ethics in general are utterly irrelevant to the matter.  What Christian theology says is the entirety of the matter.  Christianity does not follow Mosaic Law (with the exception of a very few very modern small outlier groups).  This has been true since at least approximately AD50 when the Council of Jerusalem was held by the Apostles, as detailed in Acts 15.  This is right around the time that the word ""Christian"" first was coined.  The relationship is more complex than this, but the general statement I make is held true by every major denomination.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_the_Old_Covenant would be a good thing to read through for some more details.  You may wish to try to prooftext Matthew 5:17 here, but that won't help the matter since the usual atheist understanding of the saying doesn't match the Christian understanding of the last two millennia.  The Mosaic Law is for Jews, as Jews and Christian theologians will both tell you.  Christians do not become Jews upon becoming Christian (also detailed in the New Testament), so the ML doesn't ever apply to them as a whole.  Even if it did, the ML relies upon having a Jewish State (hasn't happened since AD132ish) and having the Sanhedrin around, which hasn't happened since  ~AD360.  Without the Courts, there simply is no enforcement of the ML.  In general, when talking about a religion (any religion), being able to prooftext a verse is insufficient.  They are complex systems of belief each with a large corpus of scripture which needs to be read and understood as a whole.  Without that, you're bound to be wrong, as we see in this thread."

He still doesn't quite get why all people simply don't choose the RIGHT brand of Christianity (his, of course), but the fact that there is a plurality of Roman Catholics in the US who would put the country in the hands of the Vatican put the fear of God into him.

It was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history, and one of the longest.  Initially a war between Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmenting Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers of Europe,  becoming less about religion and more a continuation of the France–Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence.   The Thirty Years' War saw the devastation of entire regions, with famine and disease significantly decreasing the population of the German and Italian states, the Kingdom of Bohemia, and the Low Countries. The war also bankrupted most of the combatant powers. Both mercenaries and soldiers in armies were expected to fund themselves by looting or extorting tribute, which imposed severe hardships on the inhabitants of occupied territories.  The Thirty Years' War ended with the treaties of Osnabrück and Münster, part of the wider Peace of Westphalia.

For example, I think the second amendment is important, and like all other amendments (unless repealed) should be treated fully as a part of the constitution. I shoot guns as a (perfectly peaceful & technical) hobby, and I think our current efforts at curtailing gun availability is sadly misguided. Not because gun control is wrong, but because we're going after straw men - guns that are rarely used in crimes, but that cosmetically look more dangerous. I'd like to see a lot more science and a lot less populism in our lawmaking.  Yet, I consider myself left-wing liberal, and I'm for government regulation. And I know many people like myself. Many so called ""gun nuts"" aren't nuts at all. But by labeling all pro-gun people that way, it becomes us vs. them, and the tone of the discussion becomes less respectful. That goes both ways (""bleeding-heart liberal gun-grabber""), and it's been going on for far too long.  By now, the fronts have hardened.

The ones who believe that there should be no regulation whatsoever of gun ownership (or the ammo supply). These are the people who think they're someday going to prevent an Orwellian crackdown by coming at the US Army with shotguns.  I don't want to take away your hobby, to say nothing of your ability to defend yourself. I'd just like to have a conversation about whether we want to continue living in a society that regards the ability to kill as a fundamental right, and access to medicine a privilege.  Half the population has no interest in having that conversation, though. They shout and cover their ears when we say ""rein in gun violence"", and they do the same when we say ""public healthcare"". So our reactionary elements draft half-assed, backward legislation that exacerbates the problem, and their reactionary elements go on television to complain about how we're ramming our ideology down their throats.  You didn't contradict anything I've just said, of course. I just wanted to be sure you understood that most of the people bitching about ""gun nuts"" are not talking about ""all pro-gun people"".

Yeah, we're all humans, that's obvious, but thousands of years of racism doesn't get wiped clean overnight.

I try to consider myself a fairly colorblind person, but I still catch myself being racist in subtle ways. Even if I find myself simply treating someone unusually nicer because they are a certain race, I get upset at myself, because I realize I'm treating this person differently solely based on their skin color.  Trying to be more colorblind is a process. And it's certainly not easy, because as you said we have preconceived notions ingrained in us through culture. It doesn't just instantaneously happen one day when you decide, ""I'm going to stop seeing race."" It requires self-reflection and self-awareness.

Freethought,2oro5x,theodorechodesevelt,3,Tue Dec 9 19:28:36 2014 UTC,"Firstly, it was a joke. Hence The Onion. You knew it well enough for it to know it to be satire, and I'm pretty sure most of the people did as well. So, please, spare the waterworks about how everyone else upvoted in the joke I made about the stupidity of playing devil's advocate. In my personal opinion, someone who does not hold opposing views, but insists on playing devil's advocate is someone who wastes everyone's time, but I digress, and I'll play along with you for a bit.  Everyone cares about themselves. It's just how it is. You care about your experiences, your successes, your failures, and your life. You care about what happens to you and your individual experiences. When we look on a national scale (We'll just focus on American life for now because while racism is a world-wide issue, I think the focus of intense police brutality and the idea of a police state is more prominent in America.) America's people are so diverse that no two people have exactly the same experiences, successes, or failures. They can have similar ones, but not the same. Those similar experiences is what typically bonds people together because they know how the other feels. So when you have someone who is black and has experienced racism, you feel a connection and solidarity with others who have experienced it. I am a white-passing Native American-Mexican. I have experienced only the same sort of specific prejudices that other white-passing, people of color face. This is why many other races feel solidarity to each other when it comes to racism. Similar, shared experiences.   Now, these shared experiences, they are something a white person, who is perceived as white and has no immediate family members who are descended from anywhere but West Europe, has with anyone else. There is no coalition of hate groups against white people, there are no white people being told they are too lazy to work at a corporation, there are no white people fearing being shot down in the street and having their killer get praised for doing so. Because of this, there are just certain experiences that people need to pay attention to and the struggles communities face because if we don't, we start to think everyone is the same. Everyone one is not the same, and it leads to an unjust system. Hundreds of years of systematic racism doesn't go away by stating ""you don't see race"" THAT is why you need to care. If you don't care about the unjust experiences others have faced, you lose your humanity, and you might as well not even be apart of the ""human race""   I think that's an idiotic way to look at things. Just because you do not feel that way, does not mean everyone else does. Just because your feelings on your experiences deviate from someone else's does not mean that no one else has had these feelings from the experiences.  In America, there are communities people of color have. People with shared experiences and cultures tend to stick to each other. However, most of the power in America is made up of white, Anglo-Saxon males, who have no immediate ties to other countries. When their interests and experiences are seen as the norm, it is easy to effectively ignore racism, justify their current social order, and still benefit from the privilege of their skin color. Colorblindness creates a society that ignores the negative experiences, and invalidates their suffering. That itself is racist.   It's not even historical injustices that we're ignoring. It's the racism that is still absolutely prevalent today. People look back at the 60's and figure we've come such a long way, and while that's true in a sense, we're not living in a post-racial society. There needs to be steps and measures to reach a point where race isn't a defining factor in how you look at someone. How the injustices are severely skewed against people of color. But we are not at that point and we won't be for a very long time, especially when we have people like you wanting to play devil's advocate and take an opposing stance on a topic like racism. Something that is, well frankly, a clear, black and white issue. (I mean that as in there's no morally grey area, not in a black vs. whites issue)   Instead of being colorblind, we need to celebrate multicultural. We need to effectively recognize and value the differences we all have, teach others about these differences, foster friendships and organizations that focus on these issues. Why would anyone who isn't a white supremacist be against that?"

That's dangerous, as activist groups by necessity are temporarily abrogating the normal legal status quo. This is why MLK emphasized non-violence: Our psychological make-up demands we take such a stance, or else we tend to devolve into jingoistic vigilante gangs. Unfortunately, I see more and more young people who are very ""soft"" on the moral philosophy of activism, and are all too willing to lump opponents together and engage in personal attacks.   When activist groups are not harnessing the psychology of groups in the service of philosophy, but instead are warping their philosophy in service of group psychology, then the activist group becomes something else flying under the flag of activism. I call this Hateivism.   We as a general society and culture do not have the mental tools to recognize this, in large part because social organizations all use  the psychology of group cohesion to their advantage. We are largely taught not to think of our own circles in this way. Even when we are taught about such psychological phenomena, we tend to reflexively apply them only to other groups.   I'm finding more and more that groups that are largely or primarily motivated by hate all tend to engage in the same kinds of activities. Their dogmas change in the same ways. They experience the same distortions of groupthink, all of which fall into the well-known patterns of in-group/out-group psychology.
