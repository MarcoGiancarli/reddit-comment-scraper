The bomb buries itself in the ground, then detonates destroying or catastrophically damaging underground structures. The Russians are extremely fond of underground command and control structures.   The B83 and B61 are part of the primary nuclear arsenal, but the B83 is more of a strategic weapon then the B61. They're both variable yield. B61 from .3 to 340 kT and the B83 is from low Kt to 1.2 Mt.  The most likely candidate to carry some sort of tactical nuclear warhead would be the ALCM until its replacement anyway."

MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,backporch4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:15 2015 UTC,These are thermonuclear devices. They use a fission detonation to jumpstart a fission reaction in a fissile fuse that then rapidly turns a generally lithium-6 deuteride fuel source which rapidly turns into tritium and deuterium and is compressed by the fissile fuse into a full fusion reaction which also consumes a uranium tamper around the fusion fuel.   The design is obviously more intricate then that but the gist it's there.

MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,misunderstandgap,17,Tue Jul 21 16:02:28 2015 UTC,Not..really...  Just because I can fly at 40k feet doesn't mean I can fly at 20k.   SAM systems aren't infallible death machines contrary to what Russian internet dwellers might have you believe.   The gravity bomb can be carried by aircraft like the F-35 or B-2 as well which increases usage possibilities in the warzone.
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,backporch4lyfe,-7,Tue Jul 21 16:06:44 2015 UTC,The Russians shot down US aircraft flying above 40k feet in the 50s.
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,misunderstandgap,6,Tue Jul 21 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"Since you don't seem to get it...   When you drop a bomb from a plane flying high and fast (F-35 at 50k feet flying mach 1.5), it will glide for many, many miles. JDAMs routinely fly almost 30 km when dropped from legacy fighters, and the F-35 flies higher and faster with bombs than the F-16 and F-15 can (the latter are faster when unloaded, I believe). Big SAMs are big. An S-300 is very potent, but it's easy to see, needs a big site to set up, and is slow to move. It's also very expensive; you can't build too many. In other words, it's easy to find, easy to take out, and easy to avoid. You need several support vehicles for good performance, and typically several launchers. Older missiles, like the SA-3, are even less mobile. You can hit the fixed site with HARMs, or jam it to make the radar less effective. In the Gulf War and in the Balkans, NATO found that avoiding or killing big missile sites wasn't too difficult. Little missiles, like MANPADS or vehicles like Pantsir, are hard to find and deadly at low altitude. If you kill the big sites, you want to fly high, because smaller missiles are everywhere. But Pantsir, a very capable system, can only fire missiles to 20km range or 15km altitude--but can't reach 15km altitude at 20km. It is very easy to toss a nuke into this envelope from long range--and the F-35 can fly higher than 15km, anyway. Sometimes you get unlucky and get shot down anyway. The U-2 was shot down because the CIA was ok with the risk and decided to fly over areas with potential SAMs. In a nuclear, NATO planes wouldn't be casually overflying SAM sites; they would be avoiding, jamming, or attacking those sites. If you're willing to use a B-61, an SA-2 is pretty easy to fight. The B-61 glides further than the SA-2's range, if you launch at altitude and run as soon as you launch. At 30km, Mach 2 and 40,000 feet, the SA-2 won't catch you before it runs out of energy. You don't even need to jam your target."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,backporch4lyfe,5,Tue Jul 21 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"In both the Gulf War and Yugoslavia, the USA didn't have to face anything more advanced than an S-125. No, you can't just HARM your way into it with impunity - most of the S-300 variants have more range than your missile, and it's going to be working with ground-based passive and active radars, and AWACS if they have it in the area. Oh, and every S-300 battery comes with pretty potent ECM by default. You simply won't get close enough to take out the site, and if you do - odds are you still won't do anything. SEAD missions are notoriously hard - in Yugoslavia, something like 10% of all launches actually managed to reach the target, and most of those ended up hitting decoys. And that was in Yugoslavia with an ancient air defence.   Big SAMs are big. An S-300 is very potent, but it's easy to see, needs a big site to set up, and is slow to move.   The S-300 has a 5-minute deploy and pack up time, you must be  confusing it with the Patriot complex. It's pretty mobile.   But Pantsir, a very capable system, can only fire missiles to 20km range or 15km altitude--but can't reach 15km altitude at 20km. It is very easy to toss a nuke into this envelope from long range--and the F-35 can fly higher than 15km, anyway.   Pantsir has configurations to handle the nuke, though, so unless you burst it at 15km range...   In a nuclear, NATO planes wouldn't be casually overflying SAM sites; they would be avoiding, jamming, or attacking those sites. If you're willing to use a B-61, an SA-2 is pretty easy to fight.    Except Russia phased the SA-2 (and the SA3) out 20 years ago, and the S-300 is more than capable of engagement at that range. You also probably won't be able to jam your target, since Russia is pretty proficient in ECM itself and its AA systems are notoriously networked."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,backporch4lyfe,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"Of course, the B-61 predated the S-300 by a decade or so, and Pantsir by a long time. I wasn't trying to make some sort of accurate mission plan--I was trying to dissuade the notion that ""bombs are obsolete"". SEAD is very difficult, the S-300 is somewhat mobile, etc., etc., but it would take a lot of S-300s for me to be comfortable with someone lobbing B-61s at me, and the person I was arguing with seemed to believe that bombs fell straight down, cruise missiles always got through, and SAMs magically neutralized all aircraft immediately."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,misunderstandgap,0,Tue Jul 21 20:17:47 2015 UTC,Doing all that requires the resources of waging an outright war and if you are successful at degrading air defence capabilities that advanced then do you really still need to nuke them? If so wouldn't you do it from space in the first place?
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,Doofe_N7,4,Tue Jul 21 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"You hit an S-300 site (probably $50m right there) with a HARM. That S-300 was guarding an important road junction/depot/headquarters/secondary tank echelon. Now you can get close enough to hit it with a B-61. Took two missions. Everything the S-300 was guarding is now dead.  Ok, so why not use an ICBM? Because your Colonel now has to call all the way back to the joint chiefs ,who are flying in an E-4, or the president, and authorize a launch from the CONUS. Also the Russians might think this missile is coming for Moscow, hope they don't launch at Washington.  Ok, so why not use a Pershing? It's an in-theatre weapon. Good question-that's what the Pershings are there for, right? Well, you can use a Pershing. It's easier.  What if you're shooting at tanks, though? They can drive off before the Pershing hits. An F-15 can turn around and chase them down. An F-15 is also less obvious--a Pershing can only be a nuke, but most F-15s are air-superiority. There are a lot of them overhead, since WP forces are losing the air war.   So you're a WP ground commander, you have an overwhelming number of tanks and ComIntern just said drive until you hit France. The Migs and Sukhois are getting fucked by an uncomfortable number of AMRAAMs, but tanks are hard to hit from a plane, and that takes time. You've got a space-tracking radar--well, had, it just got hit by a HARM. The Americans are retreating on the ground, because you have so many tanks, and your really big SAMs are left behind, and also on fire.   They could hit your tanks with hundreds of sorties from dozens of planes, and that would work, but your smaller SAMs will whittle them down. That also takes a lot of time--if they kill 200 tanks a day, you can do a lot of damage with 2000 tanks. Or they could send the same number of planes in, and three of the planes have B-61s, and now you are all dead and their planes can go back to shooting up Migs and Sukhois."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,catsfive,13,Tue Jul 21 19:03:25 2015 UTC,That's not the point I was trying to make.   The point is that the capabilities are highly dependent on the environment they're used in.

The Americans had air superiority over Japan in WWII, but still used their nukes anyway. Why? Because their war aim required Japan's surrender, which could only be done either through invasion or, as they found out, by dropping nuclear weapons.    Today, nuclear weapons are used mainly for deterrence - i.e. their utility is in NOT being used. If you can convince the enemy that you have hundreds of deadly-accurate underground-busters, and if you can convince them that you are willing to use them, then you have a decent chance of convincing the enemy to stop doing what they're doing. I'm thinking, in this case, less of a full-out war between US and Russia or China, but more about versus ""rogue"" nuclear programs like North Korea and Iran."

MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,drcalmeacham,20,Tue Jul 21 14:40:56 2015 UTC,This was only a test drop. The last nuclear test the united states performed was in 1992.   The test drops are done to verify bomb functionality and test modifications. The B61 Mod 12s are going to be fitted with JDAM tail guidance kits to increase accuracy.

There's a datalink capability with the AA/AAQ-28 which can allow for in-flight guidance changes but it's not the same as having a live link like TV or IR.

MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,SmokeyUnicycle,5,Tue Jul 21 21:08:07 2015 UTC,The two bombs in Japan were dropped from a plane that was flying over the target.
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,SmokeyUnicycle,8,Tue Jul 21 14:23:27 2015 UTC,The planes in those instances had to execute a 105-degree turn (IIRC) immediately after dropping their payloads to ensure they wouldn't be damaged by the blasts. It was a pretty extreme maneuver for a large bomber.
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,Whitechocolatekrispi,17,Tue Jul 21 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"And I'm sure an F15 can nope out of the area a lot faster than one of those bombers ever could have so I'm sure such an extreme maneuver isn't as necessary, even if it was it wouldn't be nearly as difficult or urgent with a modern fighter over an old bomber."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,Whitechocolatekrispi,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm sure, compared to a B-29, a modern fighter turns on the head of a pin.

MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,Boonaki,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. There was sort of an understanding between the US and the USSR, as misguided as it was, that urban areas were not primary targets for a nuclear exchange.   Side note: Up until the mid-1980s there was a reason that we were incredibly reluctant to rely more heavily on a submarine deterrent force, not just because one leg of a triad is weaker then three, but SLBMs up until then had relatively big CEPs and were unsuitable for taking out hardened military targets like silos and aircraft shelters and were only suited for large unprotected targets like cities, military and airbases.   Almost all ICBMs were aimed at strategic military targets."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,rossiFan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"What understanding?   According to the JCS, if the full U.S. nuclear force assigned to the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) struck the Soviet Union, 54 percent of the total population would be killed, that is some 108 million of a total population of 217 million.   The target list also included almost all Soviet cities with populations of 50,000 or greater.   https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/u-s-war-plans-would-kill-an-estimated-108-million-soviets-104-million-chinese-and-2-3-million-poles-more-evidence-on-siop-62-and-the-origins-of-overkill/  These plans were later revised, but major Soviet economic and population centers remained on the list."
MilitaryGfys,3e29qu,manwithfaceofbird,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"The primary targets for strategic nuclear weapons were not cities.   Unfortunately, military infrastructure in the Soviet Union was closely tied to urban centers.  The SIOP preferred Nuclear missile sites, hardened military sites, and military and military supporting targets not near cities.    Some targets and target classes should not be struck, at least at first, to give the opponent a rational reason to terminate the conflict. Reduced collateral damage was another benefit of this ""withhold"" method   The US preferred to hit as many critical military targets as possible away from civillian population centers as a recourse option for the Soviets.    In any case, given that the majority of Soviet nuclear airfields and missile sites were located west of the Ural mountains, many in major population centers, the analysis concluded that the American plans for flexible use of force were meaningless. The author was also skeptical of whether communications to manage escalation—whether on the Moscow–Washington hotline, or between command authorities and their deployed nuclear submarines and bombers—could be maintained, and observed that use of nuclear weapons ""are not suited to signalling any precise and unambiguous message"".   The preference was essentially useless though since the Soviets mixed population centers with military targets of importance.   Also this excerpt from Sec of Def.

MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,zippotato,3,Tue Jul 21 04:23:55 2015 UTC,Same caliber. Kord fires 12.7x108mm which is slightly longer and considerably more powerful than .50 BMG(12.7x99mm).
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,thehumungus,2,Tue Jul 21 05:50:53 2015 UTC,whoopsie.  I was thinking of the 14.5mm

MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,GIassHalfFull,9,Tue Jul 21 04:26:22 2015 UTC,M2 Browning is similar
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,lerdy_terdy,7,Tue Jul 21 00:27:55 2015 UTC,.50 cal ~= 12.7mm
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,Jack_Attack519,14,Tue Jul 21 00:45:44 2015 UTC,".50 inches is exactly 12.7mm, no ~ needed  edit: sorry, fuck I checked Wikipedia and the actual bullet itself is .510 which is 12.954mm  edit: Fucking shit, .223 rem/5.56 NATO is actually .224 which is actually 5.7mm, 7.62 NATO is actually .308 which is actually 7.82... What the fuck? I guess on the scale of hundredths of a milimetre it doesn't really matter but still, can someone please explain to a poor gun plebian?"
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,thompson45,12,Tue Jul 21 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"First, you have to remember that the nomenclature for ammo is pretty much all over the place, just look at the differences in some of these old .44 rounds.   Next, you have to consider the barrel inner diameter, and remember that the bullet will need to be a very tight fit to the bore in order to ensure a good seal that will build the amount of pressure needed for the bullet to fire out of the barrel.  So making the bullet diameter a little oversized is a good idea to ensure a tight fit, rather than make the diameters the exact same and risk having the bullet get stuck in the barrel or barely making it out of the barrel."
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,Jack_Attack519,5,Tue Jul 21 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that makes a lot of sense. I didn't realize the name (12.7x99mm, 5.56x45mm, etc.) was the inner diameter of the barrel. Probably because the case length is there too. Thanks for the answer."
MilitaryGfys,3dzthj,downvotemeufags,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"It goes even deeper.  Sometimes the measurement goes into the grooves of the rifling for diameter, and sometimes it doesn't."

MilitaryGfys,3dzdcu,Beli_Mawrr,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:24 2015 UTC,That is an awesome sound when they hit.  how high were these dropped? It took like 90 seconds from release to impact
MilitaryGfys,3dzdcu,Murzac,4,Mon Jul 20 21:18:36 2015 UTC,A 90 second drop from something as aerodynamic as a JDAM would mean that it was dropped way up from the stratosphere. I'm seeing numbers around 250-350 m/s for the terminal velocity of a bomb when googling around which gives out numbers somewhere around 20-30 km. Personally makes me doubt that it was actually dropped at the 90 second mark....
MilitaryGfys,3dzdcu,Beli_Mawrr,0,Mon Jul 20 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"watch the video... he calls for the drop, then they say ""Yeah 1 min 30 till impact"" and then boom and boom."

MilitaryGfys,3dxtll,JCPenis,15,Mon Jul 20 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"The aft rotor is placed higher than the fore rotor which helps but there is a central combining gearbox which is powered by the two engines, from there the synchronization is accomplished by a shaft that runs between the fore and aft transmissions. Both heads rotate together at the same speed and stay meshed due to this synch shaft. When it fails, it can be catastrophic."
MilitaryGfys,3dxtll,MartiPanda,5,Mon Jul 20 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"When it fails, it can be catastrophic.  The aft rotor is placed higher than the fore rotor which helps.   So.. it doesn't help?"
MilitaryGfys,3dxtll,CircumcisedSpine,12,Mon Jul 20 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"What I was getting at was even though the rotors aren't actually on the same level (see here), which means they don't pass through each other when they are rotating level but you still need to syncronise the meshing of the rotors since they will need to pass through each other in certain phases of flight like this."

Almost no one dies a clean death and injuries are horiffic. Hollywood has desensitised people to the point where people believe if the good guy gets shot he just shrugs it off and kills the bad guys. People really do need to know that that never happens. The very few (thankfully) people I know who have been injured in combat all tell the same story.

There was even a ban on photographing the returning caskets of US military personnel for a long time.

Melting through plastic and metal requires high-powered pulses, probably more in the kilowatt range.

MilitaryGfys,3dw6yy,irishjihad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:14 2015 UTC,"Here's a simplified version  I actually misunderstood the measurement. This pdf from the FAA website states that :  'The FAA permits aircraft operations below 500 feet when flown over open water and in sparsely populated areas. 14 CFR 91.119(c). Such operations may not be conducted “closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.”'"
MilitaryGfys,3dw6yy,kramnelladoow,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:42 2015 UTC,Sheesh.  500' would knock out almost everywhere in the northeast.  I know there are RC airplane fields that are definitely within 500' of structures and roadways.  I can't actually think of one that isn't.
MilitaryGfys,3dw6yy,MAD_JIHAD,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:04 2015 UTC,That was an auxiliary point I should make too.   Its much MUCH cheaper to be a pervert/stalker with a trip to any Wal-Mart electronics department. Many of the really good quality cameras are cheaper than the medium quality cameras on the expensive quads.
MilitaryGfys,3dw6yy,kramnelladoow,4,Mon Jul 20 16:30:56 2015 UTC,Yeah getting a quad copter with some kind of camera that's stable enough and light enough with the proper zoom seems like a really overly complicated way of being a pervert. A cheap mirror/catadioptric camera lens will be able to see the lice in someones hair from far enough away that they cant see you (easily usable at ~500+ meters). 500mm - 1000mm focal length with a small sensor in a used dslr will get you way more than any quad with a camera shaking around and for very cheap...

MilitaryGfys,3dshze,kosmologi,4,Sun Jul 19 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Fun fact:   Many of the CIS states have this in their school program.   It's generally called PCT - pre-conscription training, as many of the former Soviet states have drafts in their military.  The class is usually taught to seniors and juniors. Most schools only have it for boys.   It also includes - some basics of tactics, trench digging (luckily we had no practice on this one in my school), tech classes (particular types of grenades and AKs and how they work), practical lessons - like in this video. Live range fire (rarely due to cost associated) - most of the time this kind of stuff is substituted with BB guns.   It's also not really an important class - many of the guys don't go to the army after all, so it's one of the most relaxed classes (at least it was like this during my time in high school).   I remember one time our teacher came in drunk and made us do the stuff in the video blink folded.   Next time, probably to avoid embarrassment, he said that it was his plan all along and made us do this blind folded all the time:)   P.S. I'm from Ukraine and can only say that the situation with this class is now more serious (I graduated 10 years ago). I know guys that actually went to live fires this year and were given plenty of ammo to test (2-3 mags for AKs - to each one of them and a belt for RPK for the whole class to waste)."

MilitaryGfys,3dibv9,Sha-WING,3,Thu Jul 16 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you categorize as modern, but look at a Eurofighter Typhoon.  Then an F-117 Nighthawk.  Then an SR-71 Blackbird.  Now look at an F-18 Hornet.  Now you compare to some of the Russian fighters like the enormous Su-27 Flanker and similar looking MiG-29 Fulcrum.  All share basically no traits other than having at least one jet engine."
MilitaryGfys,3dibv9,TehRoot,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:02 2015 UTC,Well the MiG-29 and Su-27 are similar because share design features because the MiG-29 was developed from the Mikoyan proposal for the heavy fighter competition with Sukhoi and Yakolev. They decided to do the same thing the Americans did with the F-15 and F-16 and put Mikoyan in charge of developing the medium fighter analogue for the F-16 while using Sukhois design to build the heavy fighter analogue to the F-15.   They borrowed the merged wing/fuselage idea from Sukhoi.

MilitaryGfys,3dh456,dziban303,23,Thu Jul 16 05:50:43 2015 UTC,"This video is a composite of several ships.   The first part where you see the bombs dropping is USS Indiana (BB-1) which was sunk by the Navy in Chesapeake Bay in 1920.  The second part showing the ship capsizing is USS New Jersey (BB-16). As /u/TL_DRead_it said, it was sunk by Billy Mitchell in Billy Mitchell's operation off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 1923. Here's what would be a better video of the operation if it weren't for the goddamn watermark.  You can tell it's New Jersey and not her sister Virginia (sunk on the same day) because Virginia was scooped out like an avocado, as you can see in this video.  The lesson the Navy took away from these tests was that battleships were basically invulnerable from air attack, despite these three battleships (and others, like the German war-prize Ostfriesland) being, you know, destroyed by, you know, air attack."

MilitaryGfys,3dfod9,Fireproofspider,3,Thu Jul 16 05:32:06 2015 UTC,The B-52's are really old so the cost of operation isn't a big surprise. The B-1B doesn't carry its full payload under most circumstances either.

MilitaryGfys,3dfod9,backporch4lyfe,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The low-low profile was really based on coming in, blasting radars on the way with AGM-69 SRAMs, and continuing to your target through the path you'd made.  With conventional munitions against a modern foe, sending anything either not stealth or supported by clouds of jammers and HARMs is suicide."
MilitaryGfys,3dfod9,der_zipfelklatscher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:42:12 2015 UTC,Also wasn't its mission profile changed to low altitude during development because they realized that high-speed high-altitude would just be target practice for Soviet SAMs?

In other situations, if an aircraft is going down due to engine failure or something, he'll talk his whole way before he punches out.

MilitaryGfys,3d8u4k,PolarWalrus,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:02 2015 UTC,Yup. The is a targeting computer. The calculated drop location on the ground is projected on the HUD.   Someone with more experience can shed more details about it.
MilitaryGfys,3d8u4k,Competence-Yenz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:37 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. My only experience with that is from Battlefield 1942 and there it was super hard to hit stuff with bombs.
MilitaryGfys,3d8u4k,nspectre,3,Tue Jul 14 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Very generally speaking, once a target has been designated, a vertical line will be displayed on the HUD representing the Projected Bomb Impact Line (the bomb fall-path). There will also be designators for a Continuously Computed Impact Point and a Continuously Computed Release Point.  If you can manage to fly the aircraft in a manner that brings the two designators together and release (pickle) the bombs right when they intersect... the bombs should land in the proper zip code.  :)"
MilitaryGfys,3d8u4k,large_butt,2,Tue Jul 14 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"For most aircraft I'm aware of, you can instead hold the pickle button for some period of time at the appopriate point given the CCRP release cue. CCIP is a separate thing; instead of flying the PBIL to the cue, you see the bomb's projected impact point and pickle to hit it. This is generally more accurate with iron bombs because they spend less time getting fucked around by the air in typical CCIP release profiles -- to actually see the impact point, you need to dive, which imparts your vertical velocity to the bombs.  It's also usually possible to use a mix of the two: the CCIP impact cue may be displayed in the bottom of the HUD even if it's actually below the HUD, at which point you can hold the pickle button to begin a CCRP drop on that point. If the projected impact point is actually on the HUD, though, you'll just drop as in CCIP."

MilitaryGfys,3d64og,LPFJII,2,Mon Jul 13 21:47:28 2015 UTC,It seems like such a waste to carry four a2a missiles in a bombing run against ISIS...does anyone seriously think that the Syrian Air Force would risk engaging coalition forces at this point?

Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are still being built for export customers. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation,  which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.

MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,SenpaiPhantom,9,Sun Jul 12 12:23:05 2015 UTC,"That would be our Winkle Brown at the controls. Not his style.  Some favourite Winkle incidents:   In January 1952, it was while here that Brown demonstrated the steam catapult to the Americans, flying a Grumman Panther off the carrier HMS Perseus while the ship was still tied up to the dock at the Philadelphia Naval Yard. It had been planned for Brown to make the first catapult launch with the ship under way and steaming into any wind; however, the wind on the day was so slight that British officials decided that, as the new steam catapult was capable of launching an aircraft without any wind, they would risk their pilot (Brown) if the Americans would risk their aircraft.    ,   In February 1945, Brown learned that the Aerodynamics Flight had been allocated three Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly/Gadfly helicopters. He had never seen one of these tail-rotor machines, so a trip to Farnborough was arranged and Brown had a short flight as a passenger in one. A few days later, Brown and Martindale were sent to RAF Speke to collect two new R-4Bs. On arrival, they found the American mechanics assembling the machines, and when Brown asked the Master Sergeant in charge about himself and Martindale being taught to fly them, he was handed a ""large orange-coloured booklet"" with the retort; ""Whaddya mean, bud? - Here's your instructor"". Brown and Martindale examined the booklet and after several practice attempts at hovering and controlling the craft, followed by a stiff drink, they set off for Farnborough.    and   On 4 April, Brown added another ""first"" to his logbook when engaged in trials in relation to the flexible deck concept with HMS Pretoria Castle, in which he was supposed to make a number of landing approaches to the escort carrier in a Bell Airacobra, which had coincidentally been modified with a tail hook. During one of these passes, brown declared an emergency and was given permission to make a deck landing; a ruse which had previously been agreed with the carrier's captain, Caspar John. Although the landing was achieved without difficulty, the long take off run required for the Airacobra meant that even with the ship steaming at full speed, there was little margin of error. This was the first carrier landing and take off for any aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage.   Favourite quote (on the poor US pilot assigned to attempt to break Brown's carrier landing record):    ""To his everlasting credit he got up to 1,600 and then had a nervous breakdown,"""

MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,ComradeMV,11,Sun Jul 12 02:18:51 2015 UTC,The source says it was an attempt to remove landing gear from aircraft in order to improve their performance. It was actually found to be a feasible setup they say.
MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,heya_corknut,3,Sun Jul 12 02:24:18 2015 UTC,Stress on the airframe... stall potential from a touch and go... feasible they said...
MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,ComradeMV,4,Sun Jul 12 02:32:00 2015 UTC,What? Where are you getting touch and goes? It's an aircraft with no landing gear on a rubber deck.
MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,heya_corknut,7,Sun Jul 12 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"Watch the video again. There is still a wire to catch. If you overshoot it on a fast descent, you're going to hit a rubberized deck with no roll. So either it's going to crumple or it's going to flip. 10,000lb going forward at 150 kmph, where do you think the energy is going to go? Magic?"
MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,ComradeMV,4,Sun Jul 12 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think you confused yourself reading my last comment.  You said that an aircraft with no landing gear would have issues with stalling while doing touch and goes from a rubber deck. So yes, I suppose you would need magic to pull off a touch and go..."
MilitaryGfys,3cxpa0,fishbedc,2,Sun Jul 12 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"From the video, catching the wire is what dumps you on the deck, if you miss the wire you are still airborne, albeit at roughly the altitude you would have had if your undercarriage was rolling on the deck. So a 'didn't-quite-touch and go' (or 'bolter') should have been possible for an alert pilot if you missed the wire, you still had as much airspeed as a conventional landing.   This assumes two things:   That early jets had sufficient acceleration to do a conventional bolter anyway. That these trials were on an angled flight deck. The were in 1948 so this is unlikely, instead a failed landing ended up in a crash barrier, bolters were not usually possible due to the front end of the deck being used for take-off.   But to be fair one of the reasons given for abandoning the idea was that mere 'average' pilots would struggle with it."

When you have hot brakes, your better off hovering into the parking spot that way you are not causing more friction with the wheel and brakes.   Source: I was a Plane Captain in the Navy"
MilitaryGfys,3cw6xk,stupe,3,Sat Jul 11 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"I was a Black Hawk crewchief for 6 years and I've never heard of this. The brake system on the UH-60 is nothing more than small disks pressing on a rotor. I can't imagine a scenario where the brakes would get hot enough to blow.  As to why they were doing a hover taxi, it could be as simple a pilots preference or it could be a stuck tail wheel lock pin. Those are easy to break or jam which would require the pilot to hover taxi."
MilitaryGfys,3cw6xk,JJ_Triplestix,2,Sun Jul 12 00:21:01 2015 UTC,The actual brakes don't explode lol. If they get to hot they can trigger the tire to explode. We would have the pilot put the bird in a power hover to allow the draft from the props to cool down the brakes.

MilitaryGfys,3cw6xk,dietbroccoli,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"In the two examples below it's the brake rotor that explodes, so I assumed it was the same as what you were talking about.  That may be true in a plane, but I'm still certain that a black hawk cannot reach the ground speeds possible for that to happen. Those wheels rarely spin more than ground taxi speeds."
MilitaryGfys,3cw6xk,stupe,2,Sun Jul 12 13:00:44 2015 UTC,I know the difference between the rotor-brake and wheel brakes lol. It's honestly fine if you don't believe me.

MilitaryGfys,3cxlaa,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"Rolls-Royce Merlin:       The Rolls-Royce Merlin is a British liquid-cooled, V-12, piston aero engine, of 27-litre (1,650 cu in) capacity. Rolls-Royce Limited designed and built the engine as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey.  The PV-12 first ran in 1933 and, after several modifications, the first production variants were built in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. More Merlins were made for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber than for any other aircraft; however, the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire, starting with the Spitfire's maiden flight in 1936. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability.  Considered a British icon,  the Merlin was one of the most successful aircraft engines of the World War II era, and many variants were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow,  as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester.  The Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States. Production ceased in 1950 after a total of almost 150,000 engines had been delivered, the later variants being used for airliners and military transport aircraft.

The GPU-5/A was intended for carriage on a wide range of U.S. tactical aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. In the mid-1980s the USAF considered a specialized variant of the F-16 for the close air support (CAS) mission, using the GPU-5, as a substitute to or adjunct for the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The GPU-5 pod, however, proved unsatisfactory in service. It was briefly tried on some Air National Guard F-16 Fighting Falcons during the 1991 Gulf War, but was removed from service after barely a day of combat use because of its very poor accuracy. Despite the cannon's impressive ballistic characteristics, the pylon mounting was not sufficiently rigid to prevent deflection, and the weapon's heavy recoil exacerbated the problem by causing pylon misalignment. Further, the GPU-5 was not integrated into the F-16's sighting system."

Týr is the second biggest ship in the Icelandic Coast Guard and participated in the last Cod War. In May 1976 she survived being rammed twice by HMS Falmouth, which led Captain Guðmundur Kjærnested to give the order to man the guns against the much more powerful warship to deter further rammings.  Týr was originally armed with a manually loaded 57 mm M1898 Hotchkiss cannon which was replaced in 1990 with the current Bofors 40 mm cannon. In 1994 a large crane was added on the starboard side of the flight deck and in 1997 the flight deck was extended. In 2001, the ship was sent to Poland for modification and received a second rudder. In 2006 she was sent to Poland again for replacement of her bridge and other renovations.

MilitaryGfys,3csvoc,TheMichelotti,15,Fri Jul 10 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"Looks like the bank was too high.

MilitaryGfys,3csvoc,rossiFan,4,Fri Jul 10 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much solely related to bank angle. The vortex ring you're talking about can be related to speed, but has more to do with rate of descent. In a vortex ring scenario the helo is descending into it's own downwash. This is typically most severe when the collective is full up, and the rotors are generating the most lift. More lift increases the vortex strength. Speed in the horizontal direction can mitigate this effect, but doesn't seem to be too much of a factor in this case. Bank angle though, definitely too much bank angle. Vertical lift is severely hindered the more bank angle is increased.    Source: AF pilot trainee/aerospace engineer"

It has been upgraded a number of times, most recently to the M109A7. The M109 family is the most common Western indirect-fire support weapon of maneuver brigades of armored and mechanized infantry divisions.  The M109 has a crew of six: the section chief, the driver, the gunner, the assistant gunner and two ammunition handlers. The gunner aims the cannon left or right (deflection), the assistant gunner aims the cannon up and down (quadrant). The M109A6 Paladin needs only a crew of four: the commander, driver, gunner and an ammunition loader.  The British Army replaced its M109s with the AS-90. Several European armed forces have or are currently replacing older M109s with the German PzH 2000. Upgrades to the M109 were introduced by the U.S. (see variants below) and by Switzerland (KAWEST). With the cancellation of the U.S. Crusader and Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon, the Paladin will remain the principal self-propelled howitzer for the U.S. for the foreseeable future.

MilitaryGfys,3co4av,Altair1371,4,Thu Jul 9 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"70 miles.. that's scary to even think about.  That'd give the bad guys something to think about though... get a dozen or two tanks lined up on some ramps, and then have them let off a half dozen rounds each at some encampment 50 miles away. It probably wouldn't do much damage, but the random 10lb metal rain over presumably a pretty wide range would be surprising to say the least.  After that much distance though i bet the rounds would diverge so much that people might not even notice more than one or two."
MilitaryGfys,3co4av,QuerulousPanda,11,Thu Jul 9 19:39:39 2015 UTC,It probably wouldn't do much damage   It wouldn't do any damage since the likelihood of the darts actually hitting anything smaller than a town at that range is miniscule.

Although I doubt if any of those cans in the video was actually filled with diesel, some 'add-on' armor wouldn't hurt much."
MilitaryGfys,3co2s7,zippotato,5,Thu Jul 9 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"providing much better protection against shaped charges compared to steel of same weight.

MilitaryGfys,3co2s7,animalsafari,15,Thu Jul 9 13:22:22 2015 UTC,"Of course the diesel fuel is lot less dense and gives less protection compared to the steel of same volume. It is natural to be unable to find any AFV with fuel tanks mounted everywhere. The key is 'doubling', as the fuel tanks should be somewhere anyway.  For the effectiveness of the diesel fuel as protection, refer to Richard Ogorkiewicz's Technology of Tanks:   Some liquids are very effective, in relation to their mass, in resisting the penetration of shaped charge jets. One of them is diesel fuel which, typically, has a density of 820 kg/m3. In theory, therefore, its mass efficiency is 3.09 but experiments show that in practice it can be more than that. This indicates that fuel cells can be used to increase significantly the protection of tanks against shaped charges.   Mass effeciency of 3 means that the diesel fuel is about three times better than the steel of same weight against shaped charge. The number is theorical, but I think I've seen actual experiments with similar context."

MilitaryGfys,3cj36c,downvotemeufags,5,Wed Jul 8 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that .22s were nonexistent, but you rarely see them used in combat.  A .22 round is just about the weakest bullet you can fire, and is nearly useless in combat.  It doesn't have stopping power, it can't penetrate armor, and there's a whole bunch of other reasons why soldiers use 5.56 and 7.62 mm.  I'm sure there's specific cases where the military does use .22s, but like I said those scenarios are very rare."
MilitaryGfys,3cj36c,Altair1371,5,Wed Jul 8 17:46:14 2015 UTC,I think the main use for .22 that I can think of was for spotting rounds on tanks. Can't remember the specific tanks that used it but can remember they did. Yeah even a .22 magnum is going to be pretty crap although you could certainly get some very accurate .22 rifles. My old man was a commonwealth games shooter with a .22 before I was born and he can hit very small things very far away with his rifle. I'll never be as good as him but I could hit the 10 easily with it every time at 50m. Not far or anything but it's competition distance. Rifle was bloody heavy though.

MilitaryGfys,3cj441,S3blapin,5,Wed Jul 8 13:18:43 2015 UTC,The direct opponent of the F35 during the JSF contest. Apparently tit had better performance than the F35 at the time of the test.  That's a really nice plane
MilitaryGfys,3cj441,TehRoot,11,Wed Jul 8 09:12:35 2015 UTC,"The X-32 lost because it was not capable of transitioning between STOVL and normal supersonic flight without re-designing the tail configuration.   The X-32 used traditional thrust vectoring approach to STOVL like the Harrier, rather then the riskier F119 and drive-shaft liftfan, but allowed the F-35 to retain a much higher STOVL takeoff weight then the X-32 and greater overall range.  The large mid-section engine like the harrier required that huge engine intake to provide sufficient airflow, and directly exposed turbine blades to radar, reducing stealth.   edit: the mid-section engine also significantly changed the centre of gravity and plane handling unlike how traditional fighters with rear-mounted engines handled, which was seen partly as unacceptable since it would comprise a majority of the aircraft of the US"
MilitaryGfys,3cj441,LordoftheLemmings,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:02:46 2015 UTC,"The tail was redesigned to save weight, I've never heard of it having problems with transitioning.  The direct thrust method while not able to lift as much weight, would have had much less difference between the a b and c models which probably would have saved a lot of money.  In the end both designs would have worked.  But a part of me can't help but wondering if the F-32 would have been cheaper."
MilitaryGfys,3cj441,TehRoot,2,Thu Jul 9 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"Well considering the flyaway cost of the F-35 is going to be about 90 million at Full rate production, I say that's pretty good for a 5th generation fighter.    Due to the heavy delta wing design of the prototypes, Boeing demonstrated STOVL and supersonic flight in separate configurations, with the STOVL configuration requiring that some parts be removed from the fighter. The company promised that their conventional tail design for production models would not require separate configurations. By contrast, the Lockheed Martin X-35 prototypes were capable of transitioning between their STOVL and supersonic configurations in mid-flight."
MilitaryGfys,3cj441,LordoftheLemmings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"Ah I misunderstood, I thought you meant it had trouble transitioning to forward flight.  And 90 million seems cheap except when you consider that the joint strike fighter was supposed to cost 38 million per plane, which would be about 50 million in today’s dollars.  The main goal of the joint strike fighter was a plane cheap enough that we wouldn't have to buy less planes.  It failed miserably at that, which isn't too surprising.  Most of us that criticized the JSF program when it first came out, pointed out that we wouldn't get the cost savings the military projected we would."

MilitaryGfys,3cj441,S3blapin,8,Wed Jul 8 09:21:24 2015 UTC,Not when you go back and look at the track record of every other plane put into service.  The only reason why the F-16 is the effective platform it is today is because it's had close to 30 years of experience.

MilitaryGfys,3cj441,LordoftheLemmings,7,Wed Jul 8 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Every weapon system introduced needs time to get the bugs worked out. People complaining about the F-35 have forgotten about the controversies surrounding the F-16 when it was rolled out in the 70's.   Examples:   The entire F-15 fleet was grounded a few years ago when catastrophic structural defects were found.   The B-52 didn't see active military service until the B-52B was developed.   The B-1 suffered from rapidly changing priorities in bomber design, and progressed to the B-1A during the Reagan years, was cancelled, then came back as the B-1B in the 80's.   The early F/A-18's suffered from limited range due to aerodynamic design of the fuselage. Early attempts to rectify these issues resulted in an increased occurrence of fatigue fractures leading to a temporary grounding of the entire fleet."

Each submunition contains four hockey-puck-shaped sensor-fused projectiles called Skeets.    There is an IR sensor in the skeet that detects heat from a source and explodes the skeet. The skeet forms a copper penetrator that then races towards the target, for armoured vehicles this will mean the skeet hits the least armoured place on the tank, the engine deck, knocking the tank out of action."

They were originally used as assault craft, able to travel long distance with a full company on board at very high speeds. At the time the best any other country had was very slow assault craft that could perhaps carry a platoon.

MilitaryGfys,3chlzu,hankjmoody,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the problem with that?   It can't fly higher since it's too heavy. It's basically a VERY low resistance boat. Which solves the biggest problems with boats.   The downside to that is probably that it uses a lot more fuel. Idk. Just guessing here tbh.     I feel like it should be treated like a boat rather than a plane, so that it can't go above 5 meters IMO shouldn't be an issue. There's has to be more to it than that."

MilitaryGfys,3cez56,zippotato,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:37:52 2015 UTC,Not really. Rudder drag from tacking I to a loitered engine is not much worse than tacking into a crosswind to maintain course.
MilitaryGfys,3cez56,autowikibot,6,Thu Jul 9 02:47:10 2015 UTC,"I fly a P-3 Orion and we do the same thing. It's called loitering an engine. It's just for fuel consumption. The noise isn't really reduced at all. We'll loiter one or two engines at altitude for transit. The extra thrust from engines 1 and 4 is only needed to climb, accelerate, or low (like below 10k-ish) altitude maneuvers.   It's like shifting into fifth gear on the interstate. You can't efficiently go from 65mph to 75mph in fifth, but it's by far the most fuel efficient gear once you're to a speed you want to maintain."

It has a shorter effective range and lower engagement altitude than either of its predecessors and also flies slower, but due to its two-stage design it is more effective against more maneuverable targets. It is also able to engage lower flying targets than the previous systems, and being more modern it is much more resistant to ECM than the S-75. The 5V24 (V-600) missiles reach around Mach 3 to 3.5 in flight, both stages powered by solid fuel rocket motors. The S-125, like the S-75, uses radio command guidance. The naval version of this system has the NATO reporting name SA-N-1 Goa and original designation M-1 Volna (Russian Волна – wave).

It fought in North Africa and the Rhineland, spreading terror amongst the Nazis as it tore through concertina wire and rolled over German trenches and past burning Panzers, leaving terror and burning treadmarks in its wake.  (Ghost Rider VI#33 (fb)) - During one battle as the German infantry fled in horror at the sight of the hellish Tank 666 rolling towards them, Tank 666's commander noticed a German Panzer division heading their way and calmly told his crew to load another Hellfire shell.   (Ghost Rider: Heaven's on Fire#6) - Like all past Ghost Riders, Tank 666's crew was revived to take part in defending Heaven from both the rogue angel Zadkiel and then Kid Blackheart's demon army.  Comments: Created by Jason Aaron and Tony Moore.  Like all the other Ghost Riders depicted in the flashbacks in Ghost Rider VI#33, there is limited information given about this character. The script confirms the make of tank and its name (which is also visible on the side of the tank), and this was in turn given in the Ghost Rider Index. The script also reveals that the two crewmen loading the shell are G.I.s.  It is uncertain whether each crewman had his own Spirit of Vengeance, or whether the tank itself housed a single Spirit who empowered all four men. If the Spirit(s) were in the crew, then presumably they could have utilized other vehicles, though possibly any tank they took command of would become Tank 666.   http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/tank666gr.htm"

MilitaryGfys,3cakt0,TWDSC,5,Tue Jul 7 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"They do, over 400 Abrams... presumably they're keeping them away from the troubles at their borders for the time being.  That being said, the M60s they do have are technically able to counter Soviet types in the region, they did well during the Gulf War, from wikipedia:   The M60A1/A3s performed well against opposing tanks such as T-55s, T-62s, Type 69s and T-72s in various conflicts including the Yom Kippur War, Lebanon and the battle for the Kuwait airport during the Gulf war. The US Marines exclusively used the M60 during the conflict. In early February 1991, two hundred USMC M60A1s of the 2nd Battalion drove north from Khafji, Saudi Arabia into Kuwait. In Kuwait they encountered an Iraqi force of T-54/55, Type 69, and T-72 tanks at Kuwait City International Airport. This was the largest tank battle for the Marines since World War II. The Marines won this battle, destroying almost nine dozen Iraqi tanks with only a single M60A1 lost. The defeat of the Iraqi force was not only humiliating to Iraq but also to the USSR’s arms export effort. This was in part due to the fact that some of the tanks destroyed were the newer T-72 which the Soviets claimed was superior to the M60.   While technically capable, the training and motivation of their crews is however questioned by many."

MilitaryGfys,3c8mxx,KonigTX,24,Mon Jul 6 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"From the looks of the image it was probably shot with a very long telephoto lens, which would also be common for a serious photographer catching an air show.   Telephoto lenses, especially at longer lengths, tend to ""compress"" the image taken. Everything is compressed to a tight depth. This effect is increased when the aperture is stopped down enough to reduce the light coming into the lens which also eliminates 'depth of field' blur. Depth of field blur is the result of a large aperture letting in more light, and therefore more blur from the unfocused regions of the foreground and background.   Telephoto compression is also commonly used in movies to cause various effects, such as zooming in a hallway and giving the appearance that the hallway is somehow getting shorter without losing any of the doors along the walls."

H-70 does not work like a conventional propellant in single engine aircraft, meaning they do not burn it to provide energy. Instead it is passed over a catalyst bed which causes the hydrazine to decompose into gaseous nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia. The presence of the water acts to modify the decomposition temperature in order to prevent thermal damage to the catalyst bed and to the turbine parts. As the water removes heat, it is turned into steam which aids in powering the EPU."

Earlier battles of the war like at the Marne were turned into utter bloodbaths by the combination of accurate, fast firing field guns with modern recoil dampeners (such as the Canon de 75 modèle 1897) firing shrapnel shells at unheard of rates of fire, which made infantry attacks suicidal and led to the balance of the war swinging to the defensive stalemate. This static war allowed the machine gun to come into its own, as previously they were regarded as bulky and vulnerable on a modern battlefield and unsuited to maneuver warfare, and best suited to dealing with so-called ""savage"" enemies in colonial conflicts. The vast majority of casualties in the Great war were caused by artillery, as was the same for the second world war, and indeed most conventional wars afterwards."

Initially, the French 75 had been designed as an anti-personnel weapon system for delivering large volumes of time-fused shrapnel shells on enemy troops advancing in the open. After 1915 and the onset of trench warfare, other types of battlefield missions demanding impact detonated high-explosive shells prevailed. By 1918 the 75s became the main agents of delivery for toxic gas shells. The 75s also became widely used as truck mounted anti-aircraft artillery. They were also the main armament of the Saint-Chamond tank in 1918.

Chicago manual of style; hard to get more authoritative:   Use of the definite article is never used before a ship's prefix, and not recommended when referring to a ship's name.   I can't find my AP Manual of Style, but I bet it says something similar.    Wikipedia:    Note that while calling a US ship ""the USS Flattop"" may make grammatical sense, the preliminary article ""the"" is discouraged by nearly all style guides, and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy uses ship names without article, except for USS The Sullivans.      Generally, a definite article is not needed before a ship's name, although its use is not technically wrong: Victory was Nelson's flagship ... (preferred) The Victory was Nelson's flagship ... (not recommended)   Well, not technically wrong per that article."

MilitaryGfys,3c3fgr,NikkoJT,4,Sat Jul 4 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"That's the glacis. You might also see it referred to as the UFP (Upper Frontal Plate) and LFP (Lower Frontal Plate).  As for why it's angled like that, well...because they wanted to, I guess. Armour sloping doesn't make much difference against modern anti-tank munitions, so they presumably just went with a shape based on other concerns, like internal space (or aesthetics, you never know)."
MilitaryGfys,3c3fgr,scufferQPD,6,Sat Jul 4 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"Armor sloping increases the entire armor distance that a penetrator needs to go through relative to the actual thickness of the armor. example  It is very much in play in modern tanks since it's very easy gains to armor performance for minimal engineering and material expenditure versus using larger amounts of composite armor or DU armor and needing to sacrifice other parts like ammunition or fuel carried, or using larger heavier, more fuel-consuming engines for more power.   The reason the lower glacis plate is most likely at a shallow angle is because the odds of an opposing tank landing a successful hit are very low, so the slope is decreased to increase room for the driver. This is evident since an upgrade is available for the Chally 2 LFP to increase overall armor thickness with ERA and additional chobham armor."

MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,ShaidarHaran2,3,Fri Jul 3 14:58:41 2015 UTC,What makes it the best next Gen fighter?
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,OmniaMors,43,Fri Jul 3 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"a lot of next gen fighters are based on old tactics, close quarters dog fighting. see the super maneuverable gen 5s like the F-22 and the SU-37.  but todays guided missiles are worlds a head of any amount of maneuvering you do. so the more apt strategy is to stay hidden from radar, find the other plane and knock them out with a guided munition before they can see you.  Think of it like the sniper of the sky. yeah, its not going to go door to door and clear houses. but it can stay on the hill and pop your head off the moment you step into a room with a window.  its insane stealth tech, and cutting edge detection will make it the best gen 5 aircraft. but if thats not enough, it also carries triple the payload of an F-16, more than even the F/A-18. so not only is it a better fighter, but a better bomber than any multi-role aircraft in the sky.  which means it gets another advantage. Lets say you need to bomb a target after getting air superiority. Using F-22s or F/A-18s youll need a squadron of bombers because of their low pay load. But using F-35s you would need few, if any, bombers since it can fill that position decently. So if you can only hold 10 planes, while with the F-22 or F/A-18 you can only have 4 or 5 so you can fit bombers, with the F-35 you could have 8-10 since its multirole.   so when comparing it in air to air, its important to remember it allows for a strategy where instead of 1 on 1, its more like 1.5 on 1 or even 2 on 1. Yeah an F-22 might beat an F-35, but how well do you think it would do double teamed? Probably get its shit wrecked."

Actually, since the F35 uses an evolved version of the F22s radar, it's actually capable of jamming the F22 radar! It has a higher radar cross section though, so it would be interesting to see which would win.     but todays guided missiles are worlds a head of any amount of maneuvering you do. so the more apt strategy is to stay hidden from radar,    see the super maneuverable gen 5s like the F-22 and the SU-37.

MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,MyOtherAltIsAHuman,2,Sat Jul 4 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Any numeric number you hear for stealth aircraft is a rough estimate, generally derived from this article back from 2005 (before the first F-35 was built):   November 25, 2005: The U.S. Air Force, in it's effort to get money to build more F-22s, has revealed just how ""stealthy"" the F-22 is. It's RCS (Radar Cross Section) is the equivalent, for a radar, to a metal marble. The less stealthy (and much cheaper) F-35, is equal to a metal golf ball. The F-35 stealthiness is a bit better than the B-2 bomber, which, in turn, was twice as good as that on the even older F-117. Much older aircraft, like the B-52, have a huge RCS, which makes them very easy to spot on radar. But with a smaller RCS, it's more likely that the aircraft won't be detected at all.   http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20051125.aspx  In addition, the RCS of stealth aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 is highest from the side (and top and bottom), not the rear; the F-22 and F-35 actually both feature radar blockers inside their engines (just aft of the HPT) to limit their rear signature.  Here's an excerpt from a lecture by Dr Paul Bevilaqua (previously the Chief Engineer for Skunk Works) where he talks about how / why modern stealth aircraft are designed to have a low RCS from the front & rear."

I'm not saying the F-35 isn't better than any other comparable aircraft, but half your argument seems to be based on something that isn't true.  The F-35 does everything the F/A-18 does, but it only has one engine (like the smaller F-16), and a much larger combat radius than either.

Comparing the F-35 to the F-16 at all is just silly. The F-16 is much smaller. It has a 42k lb MTOW compared to 66k and 70k for the F/A-18 and F-35; it has 28k lbf of thrust, vs. 44k and 43k.

MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,Schuultz,4,Fri Jul 3 17:38:03 2015 UTC,People act like it loses its entire stealth advantage the moment it puts on external weapons. That's not true. It will still be way stealthier than any 4th or 4.5th gen fighter even w/ external weapons.

MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,getsfistedbyhorses,18,Fri Jul 3 18:25:57 2015 UTC,None
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,sunggamemaster23,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Fair point - but the F-16/F-18's main selling feature isn't their stealth.   You can't go ""aerodynamics don't matter because stealth"" and then turn around and go ""payload is better if we sacrifice stealth"" without acknowledging that in that case, the aerodynamic shortfalls come back into play.  Quite frankly, my biggest issue with the whole ""dogfighting doesn't matter because BvR"" discussion that surrounds the F-35 is one big logical gap:   If dogfighting ability and aerodynamics are made irrelevant by the combination of stealth + BvR -- shouldn't the logical next step be to just use stealth drones with excellent BvR?   I mean, what's the whole argument against drones vs (manned) fighters? Lack of reaction time, jamming, situational awareness, right? But the F35 has aerodynamic shortfalls that even reaction time can't overcome; it's also highly computer & AWACs dependent (hence vulnerable to jamming); and apparently the cockpit is too small to provide proper situational awareness with the helmet given the latter's current size!"
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,eidetic,3,Fri Jul 3 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"The F-35 won't lose it's entire stealth advantage if it puts on external weapons...it will still be way stealthier than an F-18, F-16, or even a Super Hornet which incorporates significant stealth features. IF the F-35 loaded external weapons it would still be at a significant detection advantage.   Moreover, the point people are making with regards to payload is that the F-35 will be able to truck large quantities of munitions AFTER air-superiority has been achieved, which will make it more efficient as a strike/CAS platform. At that point, aerodynamics/speed/maneuverability/stealth don't matter very much at all.   Aerodynamics obviously matter; nobody's saying they don't. The point is just that it isn't incredibly important who has the most maneuverable plane anymore. There is no logical gap. Stealth is relatively more important now"

Seems crazy to put so few rounds in a cannon that can get rid of them in seconds but I guess old school gun dogfights probably don't happen much anymore.
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,Yuktobania,10,Fri Jul 3 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"With digital gunsights that account for atmospherics and motion, and how accurate the guns are on the A-10, F-35 and the cannons / revolver cannons of the Euro / Russian fighters; if you get your pipper on the enemy, it's fairly certain you'll hit your target with just a short burst (and it only takes one round to an engine or cockpit to take the enemy out of the fight; each round is practically a fragmentation grenade)."
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,eidetic,5,Fri Jul 3 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"You'll also see less need for a gun, with smaller and more precise air to ground weapons like the SDB/SDB II and their successors becoming more prevalent.  Some of the newer explosives too also carry both a greater punch but also limit collateral damage.  That is to say, they have a smaller lethal radius, but within that lethal radius, they are even more lethal than the current common explosives (such as by using inert fillers).    And even with the guns being as accurate as they are, the gun on the A-10 for example will saturate an area about the size of a tennis court or so when fired from typical ranges.  Only against personnel, you need to score a direct hit or very, very close.  So you aren't guaranteed a kill when you make that gun run.  Newer, smaller, and more precise weapons will be able to kill everything in that tennis court sized area more reliably, and just as accurately, making a kill much more likely.  It also had the benefit of keeping the aircraft further from harm's way.  In other words, the gun will turn that area from regular cheese to swiss cheese, but unless the target happens to be either directly on the holes or very very close by, they may walk away just fine.  The bomb will turn that cheese into the powder in your Kraft and Mac Cheese packaging."

MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,3rdweal,16,Fri Jul 3 11:14:27 2015 UTC,"You see stuff like this and wonder if that last resort will ever be used in actual combat, but then again it's better to have it and not need it..."
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,pineconez,14,Fri Jul 3 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"It only carries 180 rounds, which at a 4,000rd/min firing rate puts him at just under 3 seconds of actual trigger time. Which makes sense, considering what this plane is actually made to do: get in and fuck things up before they know it's even there. Something has gone really wrong if it gets into a fight at gun-range, but it's a good idea to have at least something in the event that it's needed.  A ton of people compare this to the F-4, although it's not exactly a fair comparison. The F-4 initially had no main gun; it only had missiles for air-to-air combat, and this tends to be the cited reason why they now include guns on every fighter. The problem is that the rules of engagement in Vietnam meant that they had to visually identify the aircraft before shooting at it, and by the time they could actually tell it was an enemy aircraft, it was oftentimes too close to use missiles. Along with that, the F-4 was still a pretty new fighter, so the military hadn't nailed down the optimal tactics for it yet. Once they hammered down its tactics, it had an awesome kill/death ratio. They also made a gunpod that could be mounted to the plane, but most of the kills it made were by missile."
MilitaryGfys,3bzaox,3rdweal,6,Fri Jul 3 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"This is kind of neither here nor there, but another problem the F-4s suffered, at least during part of Rolling Thunder, was that they weren't even allowed in certain areas to escort the F-105s into certain air defense corridors.  At first, the F-105s were suffering high attrition rates due to SAMs - specifically the SA-2. The adoption of the QRC-160 on the F-105s virtually erased the threat of the SA-2s completely.  Only problem was, the North Vietnamese began targetting the Phantoms instead, which resulted in an increased number of Phantom airframe and aircrew being lost.  So much so in fact, that the Phantoms saw another restriction of their rules of engagement, which saw them being forced to avoid the aforementioned corridors of air space that were heavily defended by the increasing numbers of SA-2s.  Well, as we know, the North Vietnamese were no dummies, and with a very limited number of MiG-21s available (their most advanced fighter in their arsenal), they soon started waiting for the F-105s to be abandoned by their Phantom escorts, and would then engage the now vulnerable F-105s in these corridors, and bug out before the F-105s were able to return to ""Phantom friendly"" airspace and pick their escorts back up.  (This is what ultimately lead to the famous Operation Bolo, where Phantoms were equipped with the QRC-160 jamming pods, and flew the same flight profiles as the F-105s, thus luring the North Vietnamese into a trap wherein they thought they were about to intercept a flight of vulnerable F-105s, but ended up encountering a flight of Phantoms looking for a fight.  The North Vietnamese lost I believe 7 of their precious and limited MiG-21s that day).  But to kind of bring this back on point, I mention this in part because the F-35 has been compared to the F-105, but also because having the gun also gives the F-35 just one more option for defending itself should the need arise in close combat.  With more advanced sensors, and computing power, the gun in theory should also be much more accurate, meaning you won't need as many pulls of the trigger to score a kill.  Further, as I mentioned elsewhere, the larger caliber means not only that a greater amount of kinetic energy will be imparted on the target, but the larger volume means you can pack more explosive, incendiaries, and even armor piercing components into the shell, making it that much more destructive than 20mm rounds.  There's also some rather high tech rounds being developed, and even in limited service, that combine all three aspects into one round, and are well suited for a wide variety of targets including aircraft.  Basically, this boils down to being able to take out a target with fewer rounds.  Now ideally, the F-35 will never be in a situation where the gun is the last remaining option to defend itself against other aircraft.  Dealing with other aircraft with the gun will mean something has gone very, very, wrong, but leave it to Washington to set up such conditions where such situations could potentially occur. But should the pilots find themselves in such an unlikely and undesirable situation, the gun will - in theory - require fewer rounds to deal with a threat, meaning you don't have to carry as much ammo, and it's probably better to have that safety net of the gun - even if it may seem like it carries a low number of rounds. Hopefully we'll never find ourselves in a Rolling Thunder type situation where Operation Bolos are needed, but should the F-35 find itself fighting its way into and out of a target area, the gun equipped versions will at least have that safety net.   Naturally, a lot of this also applies to engaging a variety of types of ground targets as well.  And in situations like we see currently, with complete control of the skies, it may not hurt to have that cannon for a few extra kicks in the CAS role when all the other munitions are expended.  Maybe it's just for a little bit of comfort for the boots on the ground to call in a quick strafing run on the enemy before the F-35 heads home, or maybe it just allows the F-35 to take out a random target of opportunity such as a technical on the way home, but again, better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it."

The airframe vibration led to fatigue cracks in fuel tanks, numerous radio and avionics failures, the necessity of using runways with floodlights for night flights (as the landing lights would often be destroyed), tearing or jamming of the forward landing gear doors (leading to at least three crash landings), cracking of the reflector gunsight, an accidental jettisoning of the cockpit canopy and at least one case of the instrument panel falling off in flight.

The US Navy didn't bother adding a gun to their F-4s, but instead implemented a training program which focused on the maintenance of missiles and their implementation in combat. The end result of that was Topgun.   For the USAF, their kill-to-loss ratio actually decreased over time.  For the Navy, their kill-to-loss ratio skyrocketed from 2:1 to 13:1.  The F-35B used by the US Marines and the F-35C used by the US Navy will not have an internal gun.

The HMD/Archer combination gave the MiG-29 and Su-27 a significantly improved close combat capability and quickly became the most widely deployed HMD in the world.[9][10]   And   The R-73 is a highly maneuverable missile and mock dogfights between USAF and German Air Force MiG-29s (inherited from the former Air Forces of the National People's Army) equipped with the R-73/helmet mounted cueing have indicated that the high degree of ""off-boresight"" capability of the R-73 would make a significant difference in combat. The missile also has a mechanically simple but effective system for thrust-vectoring. The R-73 prompted the development of a number of western air-to-air missiles including the AIM-132 ASRAAM, IRIS-T, MICA IR, Python IV and the latest Sidewinder variant, the AIM-9X which entered squadron service in 2003.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-73_(missile)  Entered service in 1984."

These rudimentary devices were better described as Helmet-Mounted Sights. Mirage F1AZ of the SAAF (South African Air Force) used a locally developed helmet-mounted sight. This enables the pilot to make bore attacks, without having to maneuver to the optimum firing position.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet-mounted_display#History"

And the air to air missiles available for the Mirage (AIM-9 Sidewinders OR Matra R550 Magics) didn't have the slewing seeker heads that make the whole off-boresight thing work.  F1AZ is famous for its laser rangefinder system and great bombing accuracy, maybe that's what you're thinking about. And South Africans were always extremely advanced."

Missile tech is pretty insane.  EDIT: source   During our assessments, we performed BVR and WVR engagements with the Mirage 2000 C RDI (analyzed in more detail in Part 3 of this test), where we had the opportunity to confirm the combination of the sensibility of SPECTRA EW with the all-aspect launching and target acquisition of MICA IR. This allowed us to designate the target from any source (EM / IR / Laser Threat Detection - Electromagnetic Threat Detection / Infrared / Laser), when the security bubble around the Rafale was invad-ed, and to execute the missile launch “over the shoulder.”  Over the shoulder means that a MICA can be fired at a target located at position six o’clock (behind the aircraft) without changing flight direction."

The fragments from the Hawk warhead would have almost 12,000 ft-lbs of energy - each!  That's .50 BMG at the muzzle territory in terms of kinetic energy.  At that velocity, it would zip through virtually any part of the aircraft structure in its path, while at the same time turning anything that it hits into a secondary projectile which would go on to cause damage beyond the track of the fragment itself.  In a nutshell, the effect on target is roughly equal 4000 guys with Barrett M82 rifles walking up to the aircraft and all shooting at the same time.  Many of them won't hit it, but enough do to cause it to disintegrate as we see in the clip."

MilitaryGfys,3bi1p3,3rdweal,13,Mon Jun 29 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"source  from wikipedia:   The original Mk 4 FFAR was about 4 ft (1.2 m) long and weighed 18.5 lb (8.4 kg), with a high-explosive warhead of about 6 lb (2.7 kg). Like the Third Reich Luftwaffe's R4M projectile of World War II, it had folding fins that flipped out on launch to spin-stabilize the rocket, with the FFAR using half the number (four) of fins in comparison to the R4M's set of eight folding fins. Its maximum effective range was about 3,700 yards (3,400 m). Because of its low intrinsic accuracy, it was generally fired in large volleys, some aircraft carrying as many as 104 rockets.  FFARs were the primary armament of many NATO interceptor aircraft in the early 1950s, including the F-86D, F-89, F-94C, and the CF-100. They were also carried by the F-102 Delta Dagger to supplement its guided missile armament."

MilitaryGfys,3bewn3,SamTheGeek,2,Mon Jun 29 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:    Upon launch the missile is shot out of the tube, mortar-fashion, by a piston, driven by the expansion of gases from a slow-burning black powder charge inside the piston. The missile's main engine is ignited tens of metres above the ground, preventing any damage to the internal equipment of the silo itself from the rocket engine's exhaust.   You're looking at the piston (protecting the rocket motor), which is discarded after leaving the silo. The reason it's shot sideways is just control – it could potentially interfere with the rocket firing, or reflect the exhaust upwards and damage components."

It is a predicted point of impact found from the launch platform's movement, the target's movement, gravity, projectile launch velocity, projectile drag, and other factors that can be entered. It is usually displayed on the Heads Up Display (HUD).  The HUD crosshairs will move around dependent on where the computer predicts the selected rocket, bullet or bomb will hit. Normally a radar lock is necessary, but when strafing or bombing a ground target (A/G mode; A/A mode will simply put the hairs in the centre of the HUD), the crosshairs will move along the ground.  This system is normally used in aircraft, other large vehicles, or large static weapons, but it is in principle possible for such a system to be miniaturized for a man-portable firearm.

Idea: Someone needs to edit a whole bunch of these films together in completely ridiculous ways. Splice together commentary in a nonsensical manner and have sequences like: a battleship broadside cuts to the drone getting its tail fin shot off; infantry fires off a mortar and it cuts to HMS Barham rolling over and her magazine exploding; a soldier demonstrates firing a 1911 and it cuts to a desert atomic bomb test. One non sequitur after another.  :D"

MilitaryGfys,3b3o4t,dubdubdubdot,0,Fri Jun 26 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"2003 Iraq War  The RPG-29 is believed to have been used in skirmishes against U.S. and British mobilized forces during the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq.[7]  In August 2006, an RPG-29 round was reported to have penetrated the frontal ERA of a Challenger 2 tank during an engagement in al-Amarah, Iraq, maiming one and wounding several other crew members, but only lightly damaging the tank, which drove home under its own power.[8]  On August 25, 2007 a PG-29V hit a passing M1 in the hull rear wounding 3 crew members.[9] On September 5, 2007, a PG-29V hit the side turret of an M1 tank in Baghdad, killing 2 of the crew and wounding 1, and the tank was seriously damaged.[10]  In May 2008, The New York Times disclosed that another M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq.[7][11] The US Army ranks the RPG-29 threat to armor so high that they refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into insurgent hands.[12]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG-29  Considering its already penned the the frontal armour of Challenger 2 with ERA blocks, and the side armour of a M1A2 turret, I don't think it would have a problem with the frontal turret armour. Why do you think range has something to do with HEAT warheads or what does your 85 denote?  Here's the video of the side turret penetration. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c1e_1263769845  Also good to see you still speaking with your down votes like a big boy."

On August 25, 2007 a PG-29V hit a passing M1 in the hull rear wounding 3 crew members.[9] On September 5, 2007, a PG-29V hit the side turret of an M1 tank in Baghdad, killing 2 of the crew and wounding 1, and the tank was seriously damaged.   I wasn't aware that ""side of an unnamed M1 model"" meant ""front of an m1A2""   In May 2008, The New York Times disclosed that another M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq.   Another really good example of frontal penetration of an M1A2.   Here's the video of the side turret penetration   Wow, a hit on the rear of an MBT is effective?   Who would have known?   http://btvt.narod.ru/raznoe/leopard2/Leopard-2-koncpecja.jpg  Here's the turret design of the Leopard 2A4, (and the rear sides are not changed on the 2A5, face and front side are) note how the armor on the sides of the turret is a small fraction of that on the face?   That's how MBTs work, and why light anti tank weapons like the RPG-29 are effective against their sides and rear.    Considering its already penned the the frontal armour of Challenger 2 with ERA blocks   Which was known to be far weaker than the rest of that tank's armor and shored up with ERA as a stopgap measure...    and the side armour of a M1A2    Only the liveleak description says M1A2, but assuming its true that's the rear of the turret... not... the front...    Why do you think range has something to do with HEAT warheads or what does your 85 denote?   Year, the bog standard M1A1, not the HA with the much improved protection package.

MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,QuerulousPanda,29,Thu Jun 25 12:07:01 2015 UTC,"What would be the legality of shooting at a pirate ship like that? Obviously if the pirates are engaging in piracy that's an issue for them, but what about the men on the freighter being armed and shooting back?  Is it a grey area, or is it basically if someone fucks with you at sea you can do whatever you need to do?"
MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,AnAngryPirate,51,Thu Jun 25 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"I believe if you can prove that it was an armed attack you're in the clear. I know that vessels have issues carrying firearms on board because of security at ports but if you see pirates and they are armed, you can defend yourself.  On a less serious note, who are the pirates going to run to anyway if they do get shot? The Somali government?"

MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,AnAngryPirate,12,Thu Jun 25 21:04:56 2015 UTC,I was more commenting on how the pirates wouldn't exactly have any legal action to take if they were shot taking a ship. So in that regard there shouldn't be a legal problem defending yourself against the pirates with firearms.

MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,nspectre,9,Thu Jun 25 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"If you are actually in International waters then you are governed by the laws of the country who's flag you fly. You are a floating autonomous piece of that country.  If you are within territorial waters of a country, you are bound by their laws.  This creates major problems with carrying arms on board. Every time you enter new waters you're subject to boarding and search by that countries law enforcement or military. Every time you arrive at a port o' call they must board and ensure you're following local law. Many countries that ban guns outright won't let you into territorial waters.  Some shipping areas, like straits or the Gulf of Aden/Red Sea or the Persian Gulf never see you outside of someones territorial waters. For example, the Gulf of Aden forces you to squeeze by Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Yemen, etc."

MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,andygood,2,Fri Jun 26 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"Honest question : If this is the case, where do they get replacement weapons for the next leg of their journey? Do they smuggle weapons aboard in port? If they can get a legal resupply in port, then why would they dump before docking? Is there some floating ammu-nation store waiting offshore to re-arm them once they leave? In which case, why dump the weapons instead of transferring them to the offshore 'store' on the way in to port? Is it simply a case that they have passed the dangerous section of coast and arms are not required for the rest of the route?"
MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,hawken50,3,Fri Jun 26 09:49:57 2015 UTC,"I have no personal experience with it, just reading and hearsay, but it all boils down to the fact that its easier, faster, cheaper, and legal-er to simply buy a new gun than it is to take the gun you already have through customs (not simply docking, but bringing the gun off the ship and through customs).   Most times, if the gun isn't leaving the ship, it doesn't have to go through customs so it's not a problem.  But if you wanted to take the gun off the ship, it's gotta go through customs, is subject to importation laws, red tape, etc."
MilitaryGfys,3b27ly,irishjihad,2,Fri Jun 26 11:50:48 2015 UTC,It's definitely still a problem with customs if it's still on the ship.  The onboard inspections are often ridiculously thorough.

MilitaryGfys,3avhj3,Peanutbutterdildo,9,Tue Jun 23 23:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, as the other poster noted, the ramp allows for less energy required for takeoff, allowing more stores. The US LHDs and LHAs don't have this, preferring to have more usable deckspace instead."

Neither of the carriers has catapult systems installed (although they have the space made for it during the build). Also, British pilots who are used to carrier operations have used the ski jump for the harriers.

MilitaryGfys,3avhj3,Whitechocolatekrispi,23,Tue Jun 23 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"The AV-8B Harrier II's unit cost was apparently 30million in 1996 dollars (according to Wiki's source), which is around 45m today. The current cost figures for the F-35 does not include economies-of-scale from full-rate production, so we can probably expect a further, eventual, reduction of cost down to 90million in today's dollars. So it'll still cost twice as much as the Harrier.  So the question becomes, is the F-35B twice ""as good"" as the Harrier? I'll leave that up for your, and other's, consideration."
MilitaryGfys,3avhj3,ckfinite,30,Tue Jun 23 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Well, F-35B is about twice as fast, carries 15,000lbs (vs 9,200lbs for the AV-8B), can fly about twice as far, has an AESA radar, has an IRST, can fire AMRAAM (and AIM-9X), is easier to operate, and is more maneuverable. I think it's worth easily that much, and the fact that every AV-8B operator plans to replace their Harrier IIs with F-35Bs should say something."

Pretty much our only foes are running very antiquated hardware in which the F35s stealth is still extremely effective. For example bombing runs on Syria, the US sent F22's to clear keep the airspace clear.   Yes, I agree, and stealth is going to be effective more or less forever (since it's physically motivated). I think that literally everyone who can afford it adding it to their aircraft really says something about how good it is."

MilitaryGfys,3avhj3,Mister-C,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"Also, the demand for close air support and fighters are not nearly as high as they were a few decades ago. We just don't need as many jets to have the same amount of strategic capability. So if you only need a few anyways, might as well make them higher quality. There isn't necessarily that much more capability and use you get out of having two decent jets than you get out of one higher functioning one."
MilitaryGfys,3avhj3,Mister-C,5,Wed Jun 24 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, and that purchase price in 1996 was for a very mature air-frame and technology set. Want a proper comparison? Check back on the full rate production costs of the F-35 in 10-20 years time, then compare the airframe costs and capabilities.  Not to mention, as demonstrated below by /u/ckfinite the F-35 comes with a significant capability jump over the Harrier."

MilitaryGfys,3arbsn,RaginAsian215,13,Tue Jun 23 02:20:57 2015 UTC,"Large operations like that, they don't drop you into a combat zone. You drop at a safe LZ and then walk to the enemy, sometimes quite a long way.  I've noticed that there's this weird supposition on the internet that an enemy having MANPADS in it's TOE means every place on the battlefield is therefore instant death to anything that's not a high-flying multi-million dollar stealth aircraft. The reality is, creating an effective air defense network is hard. It'll have blind spots and ill-equipped operators  even when it's a static emplacement they've had time to set up. If it's an enemy on the move, their air defense is going to be half-assed at best. Yeah, you can shoot down a UH-60 with an SA-16, but that requires that the operator be in a clear area with a view of the target with it up on his shoulder when you fly by. Likewise larger SAM and AAA equipment. Can't shoot with a ZSU if you're driving it down a dirt road through the forest.  SOURCE: was in 101st"

MilitaryGfys,3arbsn,SirNoName,9,Tue Jun 23 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"I think the general idea is to fly low. Enough so you're under radar for many missiles and also harder to target on the ground because you're moving so fast relative to the distance between. Ideally you conduct air assault movements in hilly terrain where it's easier for the heli to duck in and out of cover as necessary. Combine with sweeping the area first with whatever CAS or attack helicopters you can and electronic/flare avoidance systems.  That said, yeah, against a modern army I doubt you want them coming in a very active battleground, but at least at near as possible. It's faster than most other methods for moving boots and unlike airborne, you can also extract."

Here's an image from a successful test drop.  I'm still looking for a gif.  The mission resulted in 10 DFCs, 5 DSOs, and 1 Victoria Cross.  Also, since the bombers had to be locked in on an attack profile to get the skip just right, they were subject to pretty intense flak.  George Lucas is reported to have used this scene from the 1955 film Dam Busters as the inspiration for the iconic attack on the death star sequence in Star Wars.  edit: found a clip of a trio of Lancasters Mosquitoes dropping their Upkeep in a test.  I apologize for the quality, I'm new-ish to the gif-ing thing. Note that the actual raid used Lancasters, not Mosquitoes ...

MilitaryGfys,3ap9my,AleccMG,15,Mon Jun 22 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering why it looked as though the dam didn't break even though we know it did, it's because the way the bomb works is that it sinks to the bottom of the dam and (afaik) does a lot of structural damage at the bottom, which breaches the dam below the waterline and only later did the top of the dam collapse once it had already lost it's support, as shown in this gif from the Operation Chastise wikipedia page."
MilitaryGfys,3ap9my,fractalisimo,6,Mon Jun 22 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"Very good point on how the upkeep actually damaged the dams.

I.e. burst in guns blazing right after an arty strike to disembark a load of infantry and then retreat until the infantry can pacify the area.  They should be treated like glorified up-armored trucks that have better terrain maneuverability. Their main task should be to keep their cargo safe from small arms fire between points A and B.

MilitaryGfys,3ahune,Poopskien,2,Tue Jun 23 13:01:32 2015 UTC,A few aircraft have armour against ground fire or missile shrapnel around the cockpit (known as an armoured bathtub) to protect the pilot and sometimes around sensitive equipment like the engines or fuel lines. It's less common amongst high altitude or fighter aircraft and more common amongst ground attack aircraft.  Most attack helicopters are armoured throughout against small arms and against heavier threats around the cockpits and engines.

MilitaryGfys,3afns1,idontknowhatimdoing2,8,Fri Jun 19 23:38:49 2015 UTC,"In short, they clipped the wings for agility. Larger wings meant you could climb better but when turning the large wings had more resistance. With clipped wings there is less resistance, thus increasing the turning capabilities and roll rate. Hope this helped enlighten you a bit:)"

MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,ordo259,2,Fri Jun 19 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"For one thing, the IS-2 used split ammo back in WWII."
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,McDutchy,3,Fri Jun 19 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, the shells were too big to store so they had to assemble them in the tank and get them in the loader. Here you see the shells and charge being loaded as separate."

It only had the latter because higher command liked it as a fortification buster, an artillery role.  In that respect the IS-2 was more akin to the 105mm howitzer armed M4. A tank mounting a field gun."
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,spudicous,2,Fri Jun 19 12:57:11 2015 UTC,I think the chally 2 uses split ammo.
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,pavester,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:37:18 2015 UTC,Most of the T-** tanks use a autoloader and split ammo. That's the reason we see the tanks turn into a furnace and/or blown to pieces in a violent explosion as the split ammo is detonated.
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,zippotato,5,Thu Jun 18 23:27:22 2015 UTC,And pretty much every other western tanks except minorities like M1 or some other autoloader-equipped ones will do the same when the ammunition storage is penetrated. It's just we practically can't see any modern tanks in combat being destroyed these days other than old Soviet export model tanks.
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,pavester,3,Fri Jun 19 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"you don't see them because modern MBTs, like the Abrams,challenger etc feature different safety  features like blowout panels,enclosed ammo storage,and water jackets."
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,TehRoot,2,Fri Jun 19 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"The T-90 and T-80 both have catastrophic ammunition failures. The ammo is still stored within the ring for the autoloader.   The T-14 is the only Russian tank where penetration of ammunition storage does not equal crew death.   All modern western tanks segregate ammunition from crew. All M1 series, all Leopard 2 series and all Challenger series do."
MilitaryGfys,3aaqmj,zippotato,5,Fri Jun 19 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a picture of the hull ammunition stowage of Leopard 2A6. Right next to it is the driver's seat.  And here's a picture of Challenger 2 loader. Those things on the left with metal bands are L32A6 training HESH rounds.  So no. Both Leopard 2 and Challenger 2 have their crews pretty much exposed to the ammunition. Leopard 2 sure has separated bustle rack with blowout panels, but Russian tanks tend to not have a bustle at all.  Lastly, here's a picture of a Challenger 2 after the flame from a friendly fire found its way into the hatch and then the ammunition. You can easily guess what happened afterwards. Too bad none of the crew in the vehicle was able to escape before the tank brew up."

MilitaryGfys,3ab650,forte2,8,Thu Jun 18 17:58:32 2015 UTC,The loss of the 'Mighty' HMS Hood as it was known was one of the most bitter and humiliating losses of WWII for the British.  It went up against the German Schlachtschiff Bismarck and the Heavy Cruiser Prinz Eugen and suffered a horrible defeat as Prinz Eugen landed a shell near the Hood's ammo storage.  The Hood sank with 1418 sailors aboard due to a catastrophic fire and explosion that could in part be attributed to the ship's shitty design. Only three sailors survived.  Truly R.I.P for the sailors as reading about the German's eyewitness reports of the aftermath makes your gut turn.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Denmark_Strait#Sinking_of_Hood  Edit: I urge you to read about the magnificent sisterships Bismarck and Tirpitz. Such amazing seafaring vessels and beautiful to boot.
MilitaryGfys,3ab650,BhmDhn,7,Thu Jun 18 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"explosion that could in part be attributed to the ship's shitty design.   Well, the ships design wasn't shitty so much as outdated. It still had wooden decks, though they were due to be updated with whatever was the current material used. Being an older ship, things had just changed and once acceptable materials were now useless. Unfortunately, war broke out and it had to be called to duty before being fit with new decks. Definitely a bad decision as this lead to its demise against the Bismarck  As the HMS Hood slipped under the water, in the men in the front cannon, rather than abandon ship, fired one last volley at the Bismarck in defiance. An action that had an emotional affect on not only the nearby British ships, but the crew of the Bismarck as well.  In retaliation, all ships and planes within the area were called in to avenge the HMS Hood. After a long battle, the Bismarck was either heavily damaged or scuttled (this has been argued by those familiar with the battle) and eventually sank. The HMS Hood was avenged, and the pride of the German fleet was destroyed in its second battle."
MilitaryGfys,3ab650,Centurion87,3,Fri Jun 19 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"wasn't shitty so much as outdated.    No, it was shitty.   More armor was put on than she was designed for, which lead directly to the atrocious handling evident in the gfy. She was called ""the largest submarine in the Royal Navy.""  And the armor obviously didn't do it's job.   Battle cruisers were deeply flawed ideas, as was shown with Hood and Jutland."

MilitaryGfys,3ab650,tatch,2,Fri Jun 19 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were going to attack the Bismarck anyways, but after the Hood was sunk, they called in all ships and planes in a much larger radius than before. They even had biplanes attacking the Bismarck."
MilitaryGfys,3ab650,Centurion87,2,Sat Jun 20 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"I read many books on the Bismarck as a kid, I found it a fascinating story.   The Hood was a battle cruiser, not a true battleship. These types of ships were in fashion in WW1 as a new theory, and a way to have battleship firepower but save money.   Basically a battle cruiser has the guns and size of a battleship but the (lack of) armor and speed of a cruiser. Basically they sacrificed armor thickness all over the ship and pinned their hopes on using its speed to out-position the enemy and sink them with the heavy guns.   This sounds like a great theory, but in practice,  your battle cruisers start going up against true battleships, and they can't take the punishment due to the lack of armor, and you get what happened to the Hood."

MilitaryGfys,3a8y34,M4ST3R_BL4ST3R,3,Thu Jun 18 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"I assume you're referring to the report created when the gun was fired.  If that's the case, he would only have been able to hear the report if the projectile was traveling at subsonic speeds.  Otherwise the projectile would have passed him before he heard the noise created when the round was fired.  I think a more likely scenario would be that he saw the muzzle flash and the shooter was far enough away that he had an opportunity to start reacting as the projectile closed the distance."

MilitaryGfys,3a8y34,ICweiner94,32,Thu Jun 18 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"The reason why he left the position shortly after firing is that the back blast of a recoilless rifle is quite large. Such black blast usually gives away the shooters position to enemy forces so even if it seems unwise to leave the gun out in the open like that, in the end it is a life or a couple of pieces of metal that get shot at. Also the weapon is in a pretty exposed position. if it was in a sandbag fortified area or behind some cover then maybe the gunner could stay with the system."
MilitaryGfys,3a8y34,Todda468,12,Thu Jun 18 05:54:18 2015 UTC,And maybe come back for it later. But I'm guessing at this stage in the war with the constant attrition ammunition and men are becoming more important than equipment.

The capabilities and equipment of the Absalon class support ship, poster child of successful military procurement, harbinger of LCS discussions and certified swiss army knife of the high seas.   Some notes:    Here is an album with all the individual frames in their original 7680x2400 resolution.   No Gfy version this time, the 15 second time limit is a deal breaker. Edit: turns out Twitter has no time limit and does HTML5 as well.  The various helicopters and payloads in the flexdeck are of course alternatives, the Absalon obviously can't carry them all at the same time.  The ranges next to the SMART-S are the detection ranges for sea skimming AShM and maritime patrol aircraft respectively, as given by the manufacturer.  The missile and gun loadout also only reflects a possibility. I didn't want to get too deep in the whole StanFlex topic but let's just say that the configuration as shown in the graphic is not fixed. There are 5 StanFlex wells in the weapon deck area that could all be filled with either missiles for a theoretical maximum of 20 Harpoon or 60 ESSM.  The Royal Danish Navy doesn't actually own all the equipment that could fit into the Flexdeck, AFAIK there is no hospital or minehunting equipment available at this moment."

They found out after this test that a person can take more negative G's than positive ones.   Oh, and as a result of this test, the Colonel's retinas detached and he had some internal bleeding, too."

MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,LeiningensAnts,17,Wed Jun 17 18:03:41 2015 UTC,So slowing down is negative G and accelerating is positive G?
MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,turdovski,23,Thu Jun 18 05:02:45 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really tell the whole story. In a heavily banked turn in a jet fighter, the plane is rapidly decelerating yet the pilot is experiencing +G as they are pushed into the seat.  -G and +G has more to do with the relative direction of force change to the orientation of the craft. If the force is ""pulling"" up or forward it's typically referred to as -G. If it's ""pushing"" rearward or down it's +G, and lateral G is left/right. These relative forces can be experienced from either acceleration OR deceleration depending on the orientation and vector of the craft.  G is G. We only give it a +,- or lateral designation RELATIVE to the person or craft experiencing it.  To expand on this: if you pull straight back on the stick from level flight, you gain alt. and experience +G as the craft decelerates (assuming constant power output.) If you do the same maneuver but start inverted, you'll lose alt., experience almost the same +G, as the craft accelerates because gravity is assisting instead of retarding. In this example the plane is going in completely opposite directions, one is accelerating while the other is decelerating, yet +G is experienced in both maneuvers as it relates to engineering and physiology.  TL;DR: Its all relative to the person/craft based on their 6 axes of orientation. A change in G is the consequence of inertia. It's about where you were going a second ago affecting where you are going now."
MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,Rashaverak,3,Wed Jun 17 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but it doesn't tell me why we can take more -G, seeing as they are equivalent forces."
MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,Obscene_farmer,6,Wed Jun 17 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"If I had to hazard a guess, it would have to do with how G forces affect blood flow in the body. In a -G scenario, blood is being ""pushed"" into your brain and in a +G scenario it's being ""pulled"" from it. It's why pilots wear G suits and clench their legs and abdominal muscles to keep the blood in the upper half of their body."
MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,Klenth,2,Wed Jun 17 21:18:00 2015 UTC,That's probably right on the money. Low O2 in the brain is the start of many many terrible things.
MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,Rashaverak,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the orientation of the force with respect to the human body, then. Although I couldn't tell you why."

MilitaryGfys,3a5hxm,Frequent-Flyer,0,Thu Jun 18 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. Essentially you can think about it as speed change. Negative speed change (breaking, reversing) is -G, while positive speed change (accelerating) is +G."

MilitaryGfys,3a0z6c,tankfox,35,Tue Jun 16 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"Why, are the zombies driving technicals?  You wouldn't get a very high kill/ammo ratio firing at an unarmored horde, especially zombies who won't really care about minor piercing damage.  This got me brainstorming though, what would be an effective zombie defense solution? How about a set of looped cables with big blunt hooks on them, strung in runs parallel to the ground. Zombs walk into the moving cables, get tangled up in them and are pulled along to be dropped into a biomass incinerator, which, once up to temps, becomes self-fueling as long as new biomass keeps being fed into it. It could likely produce enough power to keep the whole thing running indefinitely assuming the ashes could be cleared away without turning the incinerator off.   Might smell a bit bad though."
MilitaryGfys,3a0z6c,mykro76,12,Tue Jun 16 19:53:11 2015 UTC,Personally I'd just go for a Temple Grandin style spiral fence where they just walk themselves straight into the biomass incinerator.

MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,clee-saan,22,Mon Jun 15 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"Looks like it.  Note that mortar rounds have relatively thin walls, in the video source we see that it takes much longer to destroy a thicker walled 155mm shell."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,malacovics,15,Mon Jun 15 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"Even then it's only 20 seconds, which is lightning fast compared to the average time it requires to do a safe controlled det (5-15 minutes at least)."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,malacovics,29,Mon Jun 15 12:31:39 2015 UTC,"Not as fast as one of these but using a laser seems like a much ""safer"" proposition."

MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Daiwon,2,Mon Jun 15 18:10:57 2015 UTC,Seems like it would be harder to hold the laser on target for 10 seconds than to hold a rifle on target for the moment it takes to pull the trigger.
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,leostotch,16,Mon Jun 15 18:27:29 2015 UTC,I would assume the laser is mounted? Just need to line it up.
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Daiwon,3,Mon Jun 15 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but then you've got the trouble of humping the mount out to wherever it's needed, setting it up, using it, tearing it down, and humping it back to base...  Or you just find the nearest Marine and ask him nicely to shoot the target."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,al987321,3,Mon Jun 15 18:43:10 2015 UTC,From the wiki it seems that it's mounted on a vehicle.   I imagine with the right tech this could also track targets through the air. Imagine what this could do to a chopper? Probably a lot easier to track and destroy a vehicle also.
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,leostotch,3,Mon Jun 15 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"There's video out there of this system (or one very similar to this one) destroying mortar rounds and other projectiles in mid-air.

MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,clee-saan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:34:33 2015 UTC,It has a tracking system. It can actually track a mortar in the air. Source: my dad helped build it.
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,clee-saan,4,Tue Jun 16 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"That seemed pretty long to me, is there going to be time to destroy a round during the short window between the moment it's detected and the moment it impacts the ground?"
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,CircumcisedSpine,13,Mon Jun 15 12:48:33 2015 UTC,In this case I believe they were showing that it could be used to dispose of UXO on the ground.
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Ron-Swanson-Mustache,7,Mon Jun 15 12:50:30 2015 UTC,"Right, I thought this was just a demonstration of the capacity of the system to destroy ordinance, and I assumed the end goal was an anti-mortar shield. My mistake."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Kanthes,6,Mon Jun 15 13:01:57 2015 UTC,"Well... I'm sure that the head of the team standing next to the lead DoD rep was saying, ""Now, this is today.

MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Depends how many shells you are trying to destroy. The laser is electrically powered, on a truck, so basically just uses a bit of gasoline. You just want to amortize the cost over time.  Probably a bit easier to use, too. I think it's aimed with a joystick, and lasers go pretty straight, so you can shoot from further away."

MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,LoneStarGeneral,8,Mon Jun 15 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"It's more of a way to destroy IEDs from a distance once they've been discovered, and it's worth pointing out that EFP based off-route IEDs are usually relatively exposed."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,autowikibot,4,Mon Jun 15 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"This is likely too long to stop a traveling shell, especially when rotation is factored in.   This is actually kind of disappointing."
MilitaryGfys,39wmuy,Xizithei,4,Tue Jun 16 01:51:04 2015 UTC,Note that this is a relatively small laser fitted to a Humvee platform.  The thing that can shoot down mortars in flight is much bigger.

MilitaryGfys,39vrau,kwkfor,14,Mon Jun 15 10:15:24 2015 UTC,"Back in the day, when I was in the AF stationed in Germany, we'd do an elephant walk at the end of a NATO exercise.  Basically it was a worst case scenario, where everything that could fly would be loaded with a simulated nuke, they'd taxi to the end of the runway and one at a time, light the burners and start a takeoff roll.  Then pull the throttles back to idle and taxi to the other end.  The idea was to show that we could generate as many aircraft as possible, in the shortest amount of time, in case the shit really hit the fan. This was back when there was still a Warsaw Pact to deal with, but I imagine today's elephant walks aren't too different and are still used to see how many aircraft can be ready to go at one time.  I also think that they use the opportunity to do a photo op like this picture.  I don't remember us ever having all the F-4's on the runway at one time, but I do remember them all lined up on the parallel taxiway after going down the runway.  Pretty cool to see 50 or so F-4's, all lined up and running at the same time."

MilitaryGfys,39nj9v,Plasmus642,38,Sat Jun 13 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"Instead of the typical tricycle landing gear, the U-2 uses a bicycle configuration with a forward set of main wheels located just behind the cockpit, and a rear set of main wheels located behind the engine. The rear wheels are coupled to the rudder to provide steering during taxiing. To maintain balance while taxiing, two auxiliary wheels, called ""pogos"" are added for takeoff. These fit into sockets underneath each wing at about mid-span, and fall off during takeoff. To protect the wings during landing, each wingtip has a titanium skid. After the U-2 comes to a halt, the ground crew re-installs the pogos one wing at a time, then the aircraft taxis to parking."

It did use two fairly powerful engines, but the Catalina also had a massive, and rather efficient wing (in terms of lift).  The wing loading on a Catalina was actually fairly low, and lower than many, if not most, fighters of the day (and fighters since).  In other words, it really didn't rely on the sheer brute force of engines to get into the sky, it generated a lot of lift."

The rest of the time a C-17 or similar leaves from Christchurch to pick up and drop off scientists. It does get expensive, very.

The rotor system is entirely hingeless, the rotor head consisting of a solid titanium block to which the four blades are bolted;[11] the flexibility of the rotor blades works to absorb movements typically necessitating hinges in most helicopter rotor designs.[9] The reliability of the advanced rotor system is that, in over six million operating hours across the fleet, there had been a total of zero failures.

MilitaryGfys,39fkf8,ScienceShawn,16,Thu Jun 11 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"No, EM spectrum coverage probably ends around UV. It protects against higher frequencies by using probably chaff bundled into the projectile.   It's not really like a shield, it just blinds the sensors by creating a mask. So it doesn't really block signals, just creates a huge blob like you saw, outshining them. A radar seeker would see a bunch of glittering returns because chaff reflects the radar energy in a million different ways. IR seeker would see the ginormous blob...visible coverage would see a bunch of white smoke..etc. etc.   The view shown is a FLIR view, so that's what an IR seeker, IR imaging sensor would see."
MilitaryGfys,39fkf8,Ron-Swanson-Mustache,6,Thu Jun 11 15:38:53 2015 UTC,So what would happen to whatever is shot at the boat? Would it explode once it hits the blob saving the ship and crew from a direct hit? Would it confuse it and cause it to go somewhere else or glitch because of all the signals and not explode at all? This is very cool.
MilitaryGfys,39fkf8,BeanAKAJulian,12,Thu Jun 11 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the missile is programmed to impact a target. Once terminal homing is enabled, some anti-ship missiles increase in speed and climb before diving at a target, so if the seeker lost lock, it would probably collide with the ocean.  If the missile maintains sea-skimming altitude before impact, it would probably continue past the smokescreen and run out of energy as the motor burns out.   They would most likely not re-acquire a target. This is conjecture however. I'm not sure exactly how the seekers would act when confused.   The closest comparison is probably A2A missiles like the Sidewinder that are FoF without datalinks and once they lose track of a target they generally just continue on unless something happens to cross in-front of the seeker and it re-acquires a target.   Some AShMs like the Granit have missiles that fly above the rest and act sort of like leaders, and designate group targets, that might be able to re-route missiles to a non-obscured target.  To be frank, there's no real idea on how these missiles will perform in a true complex, saturated environment with multiple targets, chaff, electronic decoys, and multi-layered self defense systems."

MilitaryGfys,398syl,nspectre,10,Wed Jun 10 06:38:28 2015 UTC,"Primarily the latter.  Fire-control system and optics   The K2 is equipped with an advanced fire-control system (FCS) linked to a Extremely high frequency radar system deployed on the frontal arc of the turret, along with a traditional laser rangefinder and crosswind sensor. The system is capable of a ""lock-on"" mode, which can acquire and track specific targets up to a range of 9.8 km using thermographic camera. This allows the crew to fire accurately while moving as well as effectively engage low-flying aircraft.  The FCS is also linked to an advanced gun stabilizer and trigger-delay mechanism to optimise accuracy while moving in uneven terrain. Should the trigger on the main gun be pulled at the moment the tank encounters an irregularity in the terrain, oscillation of the gun barrel will cause temporary misalignment between a laser emitter at the top of the barrel and a sensor at the base. This will delay the FCS from activating until the beam is re-aligned, improving the chances of hitting the intended target.  The Korean Gunner's Primary Sight (KGPS) and the Korean Commander's Panoramic Sight (KCPS) are present in the Black Panther as in the original series of K1A1 tanks, though modified to utilize the more advanced sensors and armaments deployed on the K2.  The commander of the tank has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and gun from the gunner. Moreover, unconfirmed reports state that, in the event of an emergency, the vehicle can be operated by only two, or even a single, crew member. It is speculated that the FCS can automatically spot and track visible targets, compare them using the data link established with other friendly vehicles to prevent redundant target engagements, and fire its main gun without manual input."

The first game was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 and prompted Nintendo to create multiple sequels on succeeding gaming consoles.   The series has been known for its high-speed racing, unique characters and settings, difficult gameplay, original music, and pushing the limits of its technology to be one of the fastest racing games ever. The first game inspired the creation of games such as Daytona USA  and the Wipeout series.    The series has been largely dormant since 2004, with the last title being F-Zero Climax. It has however made several appearances in other franchises.     Interesting: F-Zero GX | List of F-Zero characters | F-Zero: Maximum Velocity   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Kaekru,16,Tue Jun 9 02:00:46 2015 UTC,Pilot-induced oscillation
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Redd_October,10,Mon Jun 8 03:53:58 2015 UTC,"Flight computers don't factor into it.  The pilot is overcorrecting for pitch issues, and the sequence of overcorrections makes it worse and worse until there;s no helping it."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Redd_October,17,Mon Jun 8 04:04:48 2015 UTC,"Well first off that's about as perfect an example of pilot induced oscillation as there ever was.  If I had to make a guess I'd say the pilot was relatively new to aircraft with canards and isn't used to the increased pitch responsiveness.  Next, fighters don't generally use computers that limit maneuverability, as the whole point of the things is to be able to turn on a dime, and you don't want the computer second guessing you when you need to move now. Any flight computer control would be devoted to stabilizing an aerodynamically unstable design, such as a flying wing or the use of ruddervators.   But really, just look at it.  You can see the canards pitching harder and harder as the aircraft loses control. The pilot sees the nose is too high, pitches down, it pitches a lot harder than he thought so he pulls back, now nose is higher than before, forward again but oh god it's not working pull back shit crash."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Redd_October,6,Mon Jun 8 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"And now I know for sure, yes."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Kaekru,7,Mon Jun 8 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"The pilot went on to crash a second Gripen a few years later with the same mistake, Pilot-induced oscillation."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,The_Doculope,3,Mon Jun 8 05:03:59 2015 UTC,The wiki page doesn't say that the winds induced the oscillation. An incorrect reaction to adverse conditions doesn't mean it wasn't a pilot error.
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Cavalry262,3,Mon Jun 8 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"It was pilot induced oscillations and the softwares fault. It was a prototype aircraft, the computer software should have compensated for the pilot induced oscillations. But it couldn't cope with the strong crosswind and introduced a delay between the pilots input and the aircrafts reaction."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Cavalry262,2,Mon Jun 8 05:41:36 2015 UTC,Swedish wikipedia speaks about the steering commands being queued and executed in order instead of being executed when the commands are being given. Note that the Gripen is an unstable aircraft and the software have to automatically and continuously make small steering commands by itself in order to keep the aircraft from falling out of the sky. http://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_39_Gripen  And a lecturer I once had in a class of control theory told us the control system lacked a (or lacked a proper) anti windup system and that the software therefore couldn't cope with the crosswind. The wikipedia text can be interpreted as a simplified explanation of this problem.  Windup problems occur when the software does not know the physical limitations of the system it controls and can indeed lead to delays between input and output in a control system.
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,Cavalry262,2,Mon Jun 8 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. If they built this prototype in order to test the aircraft and find glitches like this and know why they have a problem, why wouldn't fix they problem? Programming can be hard though  Also the gripen project are a couple of generations in. The current ones have completely different avionics and capabilities than the first ones and the next gen will basically be a new plane. Plenty of time to find bugs and introduce new ones."
MilitaryGfys,38ziwt,RaccoNooB,2,Mon Jun 8 05:54:28 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard about the JAS, it's that the computer can only do so many things. In-putting maneuvers at the wrong time would cause the plane to do unexpected things and then shit went south. The pilots had to learn to ""trust"" the aircraft and let it do it's thing instead of trying to do it on their own.   I'm not sure if that is what happened here, or if it's even the right JAS version, but there was some newer version of it that had this problem."

Rechambering an MP44 for its closest plentiful neighbor cartridge (7.62x39) would require a wholesale redesign of the gun. x39 is longer than 8mm Kurz by 6mm, so the round won't even fit in the mag. You would have to redesign the mag and that means redesigning the magwell and that means gutting the grip/fire control assembly amd at that point you're 80% of the way towards a new gun. Why bother?

MilitaryGfys,38ugpm,Serpent10i,2,Sun Jun 7 08:02:20 2015 UTC,"It works there because the statement is clearly missing ""a"" that to quantify it as singular. That tips the reader off that it is being use as a plural. In the sentence:   ""The BMPT-Terminator is armed with ATGMs, cannons, and grenade launchers.""    It's indeterminate whether the vehicle has 1, 2, or 20 cannon's', so adding said 's' both standardizes the list and clarifies the statement to the reader. (By the way, it does have 2x30mm cannons, as well as 4 ATGMs and 2x30mm grenade launchers.)  EDIT:  Did I mention how awesome the BMPT is? Got a tank? DEAD! What about infantry? DEAD! Lots of infantry standing close together? DEAD! A lightly armored convoy? DEAD!  Pretty much the only thing I can't handle would be an  A-10 or other air support but they have the ZSU23-Shilka for that. And that thing was such a threat that NATO standing orders were ""destroy any Shilka observed, even if doing so required the pilot to abandon his mission."" so the BMPT didn't really have to worry about those flying thingies."

Also, this new system allows more control over how much force to apply and when during a launch. This results in a lot less stress on the airframe."

MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,thisisalili,5,Wed Jun 3 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"so, who won?"
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,umdmatto,12,Wed Jun 3 19:05:34 2015 UTC,16 made the kill on the 15 I think. There would have been more than what the video is showing though. In a close in dogfight assuming the pilots were similar skilled I'd put my money on the 16 every time as long as the merge was equal. Long range the 15's radar kills the 16.
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,zdelamont,7,Wed Jun 3 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, The F-16 is one of the best pure dog fighters we have.  However the US rarely engages in dog fights now.  No point really.  The F-15 would win in most real world engagements.   Edit: a word."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,gumbo_chops,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"What about other countries (read: Russia and China)? Are their jets more suited to long range, or dog fights? I imagine long range, but I still figured I'd ask."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,TehRoot,5,Wed Jun 3 23:17:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure about China but Russia's Su-35 fighter could fly circles around American jets, even the 5th gen F-22s and F-35s"
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,Llaine,18,Wed Jun 3 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"F-35 probably, but it's not an air superiority fighter. The F-22 is also super-maneuverable, and highly maneuverable, even when loaded.   The problem with low speed dogfights between airplanes like the Su-27 and the F-15, and in certain cases the F-22, is that they lose energy very quickly. Supermaneuverability, even in a plane like the F-22 which has vastly higher thrust output then the F-15, and actually posses the capability, can greatly diminish sustained energy of the plane if used too much, which leaves it vulnerable to lighter more maneuverable fighters. On the other hand, the F-22 is an exception(sometimes) to the above rule because light use of thrust vectoring, in combination with the stealthy design(which improves aerodynamic performance as a positive benefit) and vastly higher performing turbines means that it is capable, even while weighing vastly heavier then lighter opponents, that it can still maintain enough energy and accomplish high alpha maneuvers that would cause control departure in other planes, or that simply aren't even possible allowing it to line up kills on those lighter opponents.   The Su-27+ and F-15 both lose in close in fights to the MiG-29 and F-16 or fighters like the Rafale, EF, or Gripen, even the F-18 since they're lighter, more maneuverable, and as a result have better preservation of energy in close fights. On paper. Pilot skill becomes another factor. There's no reason an F-15 or SU-27 can't be competitive at close fights, it's just that it is easier for the lighter plane. Pilot skill can easily compensate for the performance differential.   In real world fights, the US and the west would generally have the upper hand in BVR fights due to superior C4ISR, data sharing between aircraft and command, superior command structures for dissemination of gathered data, and superior avionics in both C4ISR aircraft and the fighters themselves.  Stealth also gives an upper hand obviously since it's designed to directly defeat and minimize the cross-section of the plane to radar in general, but specifically frequencies in the K/Ku bands or higher which are generally what fighters use. Even in a plane like the F-35, which has lower all-aspect stealth capabilities then the F-22, still has an upperhand against bigger more heavily armed opponents like the Su-27+."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,TehRoot,3,Thu Jun 4 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"The MiG-29 was formidable for its incorporation of HOBS missiles, which at one stage made it incredibly dangerous if the pilot got close enough. At long range it was a joke, and is somewhere between the F-15 and F-16 in dogfights otherwise."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,zdelamont,2,Thu Jun 4 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, HOBS with the R-73 spurned the development of Iris-T, ASRAAM, AIM-9X, Python-5 and the JHMCS, etc.   HOBS is useful in certain scenarios obviously, but a moot point. Once you run out of BVR missiles, you generally don't close distance to engage with shorter range missiles unless you really, really need to.   Though out of HOBS and helmet cueing, we got the great helmets like JHMCS II and Scorpion that vastly increase pilot awareness and effectiveness."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,gumbo_chops,2,Thu Jun 4 00:25:43 2015 UTC,Good lord that is a menacing looking machine.  What makes it so much superior?
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,autowikibot,4,Wed Jun 3 23:32:37 2015 UTC,"Lots of features which allow them a high degree of Supermaneuverability, something that Russia has long been interested in for their fighters; sacrificing top speed and energy retention in favor of good maneuverability and acceleration."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,Llaine,5,Wed Jun 3 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"Supermaneuverability:       Supermaneuverability is the ability of aircraft to have control and do maneuvers in situations and in the ways exceeding that which is possible by pure aerodynamic mechanisms. [citation needed] This ability was first introduced in the Russian Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter aircraft in the 1980s, which has since become a standard in their advanced 4th and 5th generation aircraft. There has been some conjectures, but the mechanism behind the supermaneuverability of the Russian aircraft is still unknown. However, post-stall analyses are increasingly used in recent years to advance maneuverability via the use of thrust vectoring engine nozzles.  As the result of such studies, United States produced the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which is the first non-Russian supermaneuverable aircraft.

MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,TehRoot,2,Wed Jun 3 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Supermaneuverability isn't an instant win. It's a niche tool in the toolkit that can get you killed if used improperly.  The F-22 doesn't only incorporate it for dogfights, but also for stealth considerations."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,PM_ME_MUSIC_U_LIKE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:16:25 2015 UTC,Increased maneuverability doesn't mean anything when you don't have the appropriate energy to exploit it. It's a flaw in supermaneuverability that's being brought up more seriously now that the Russians made a big deal out of it.
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,gumbo_chops,3,Thu Jun 4 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the F-22 and F-35 definitely have the benefit of stealth and are their true capabilities really known to the public? In a dogfight I think any of the current fighters like the F-15, F-16, F-18, F-22, and F-35  could definitely hold their own against it. Ultimately I think it would come down to the skill of the pilot of each aircraft. I think an American pilot who has had extensive training in dogfighting - such as the Topgun program - could win a majority of time against the Russian no matter which fighter he was in. I'm sure if you asked this to like /r/whowouldwin they could give you a more detailed answer."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,showershitters,2,Wed Jun 3 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I was speaking from a pure maneuverability standpoint assuming a simple turn based dog-fight. But there are so many other factors that would determined the outcome of a real engagement with modern aircraft (e.g. stealth, radar, etc.)"
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,TehRoot,3,Wed Jun 3 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"If you notice, in several training exercises, the new generation of american planes have been beaten by European fighters like the grippen. This will continue until the real abilities of these planes will be required in war time.  There are two sets of limits to performance: public information and design"
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,DiepFries,3,Thu Jun 4 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"Those exercises reports fail to mention that American forces are generally kept at a numerical disadvantage to their opponents, so 4 F-15s would fight 8+ mixture of rafales, eurofighters, F-18s, etc. The F-22 is also handicapped. It's not allowed to use thrust vectoring, radar capabilities are limited, and top speed is limited, besides the fact that they train outnumbered.   Aggressor squadrons at exercises like red flag are also allowed to "" respawn"" while friendly forces withdraw to bar after being killed."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,DetlefKroeze,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:41:16 2015 UTC,Also compare the countries flying hours by pilot. Russian pilots still get much less flying hours and their planes are grounded for longer periods of time.
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,Llaine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:34:24 2015 UTC,Do you know how many training hours a typical Su-35 pilot has per year?
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,Llaine,0,Thu Jun 4 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true. The F-35 is at least on par with the F-18 in kinematics, and maintains some key advantages in situational awareness over any legacy fighter. The F-22 also maintains these advantages while being super maneuverable."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,strikervulsine,2,Thu Jun 4 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, their newer jets are some of the best among legacy fighters. Particularly the T-50, which incorporates stealth in addition to advanced radar and avionics.  The Russians have maintained capable missile tech and high performance airframes in the past, but lag behind the US in radar technology. Aircraft like the F-35 and F-22 are more advanced than anything in the Russian inventory. In a realistic conflict, western nations maintain an edge mostly through things like AWACS, radar range and better trained pilots.   That said, modern Russian aircraft are more than capable of handling themselves in a dogfight. I'm sure things like helmet mounted cueing and high off boresight missiles are standard now. Pair that with power and highly maneuverable airframes, and you've got a dangerous opponent."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,Llaine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:14:19 2015 UTC,"I see these arguments about what vehicle or system is ""better"" and all I can think of is that in a conflict where they actually were used against each other soliders would die by the tens of thousands and civilians by the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and that is without nukes."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,large_butt,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree, at least in regards to air combat. No one wants to lose multi million dollar airframes, and the proliferation of precision weaponry means less civilian casualties."
MilitaryGfys,38e9qa,large_butt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"but lag behind the US in radar technology   Their current BVR missiles are also significantly outclassed. AIM-120D handily outranges operational R-77 variants (even the older R-27, including the extended range versions). They're not likely to be stuck loading R-27s for much longer given their modernization program, but even the upgraded R-77-1 doesn't come close to matching 120D."

No helmets, no body armor, firing from the hip, no optics, outdated vehicles without even any slat armor. These soldiers are under-trained and under-equipped. Most SWAT teams in the US have more equipment.  Whoever these guys are, their lives are clearly not a priority to the central government.

MilitaryGfys,38abaw,TimothyGonzalez,31,Wed Jun 3 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"My uncle is a navy captain. He described what it was like to be a fighter pilot for the navy to me.   There are other ways, but for the sake of keeping things linear I'll explain it as if you were going through a military academy.  Get great grades in highschool, get into navy academy. Once you're in, you basically get to choose what you want to do based on your class rank. So, if you're lower in the class and by the time it's your turn to choose, there's a chance that fighter pilots have already been all filled up.   THEN you're admitted into flight school. You need to be able to sustain geforces that would make normal people puke and pass out. You're really pushed to the limit. They're putting multimillion dollar aircraft at your hands, so you know they'll train the fuck outta you. This is the hardest part, because everything you do is graded. From the day you enter to the day you retire, every takeoff, approach, and landing is graded. If you do well, you get to land on ""the boat"" (carrier). If you suck at that, you get sent back to training until you're competent enough to land.  As if that wasn't hard enough already, pilots are getting their flying hours cut BIG TIME. The military just isn't as into fighter jets as they were before. and with the way and rate that technology has been evolving, [fighter] pilots will become at one point an extinct race.  If you want to have ""job security"" in military aviation, your best bet is to either learn to pilot drones, or, learn to fly helicopters. The military would never trust an AI to land in and rescue troops from an AO. That kind of job requires a level of thinking that only humans can do.   Trust me, I've dreamed of flying planes. ever since my first airshow, I've dreamed of flying an F-22 raptor ever since I was a kid. I think it's the most beautiful and deadly aircraft I've ever seen. If I were born maybe 15 years earlier I'd definitely had a better chance at it but today it's very hard.  Some of this info may be wrong or outdated, I am not at all in the military, but this is from what I've learned and researched the basic gist of it."

The tank fired specially designed 3M7 Drakon missiles from a pop-up launcher. It saw a very limited service between 1968 and 1970. The large deadzone around the tank created by the missiles' minimum range combined with the limited amount of ammunition carried made it unpopular with the military.

The first vehicle designated VDM carries magnetic and thermal decoys that trigger heat sensitive, trip wire and tilt-rod activated mines. The vehicle travels at a speed of 25 km/h and uses low pressure tires which makes it practically immune to pressure sensitive mines. These are detonated by the heavyweight trailer, towed behind the VDM. A follow-on vehicle is the VTR, which tows two additional trailers to tackle residual un-detonated mines to create a safe track up to a width of 3.9 meters.

It was so named because the thin cylindrical metal outer shell which hinged open when the bomblet deployed gave it the superficial appearance of a large butterfly. The design was very distinctive and easy to recognise. SD2 bomblets were not dropped individually, but were packed into containers holding between 6 and 108 submunitions e.g. the AB 23 SD-2 and AB 250-3 submunition dispensers. The SD2 submunitions were released after the container was released from the aircraft and had burst open. Because SD2s were always dropped in groups (never individually) the discovery of one unexploded SD2 was a reliable indication that others had been dropped nearby. This bomb type was one of the first cluster bombs ever used in combat and it proved to be a highly effective weapon. The bomb containers that carried the SD2 bomblets and released them in the air were nicknamed the ""Devil's Eggs"" by Luftwaffe air and ground crew.

MilitaryGfys,3866zk,Sgt_45Bravo,52,Tue Jun 2 04:25:00 2015 UTC,"Well I ain't a cobra pilot but I spent about 10 years  living and working around them. But to me if you look at the tail rotor you can see it ain't going at full speed when the they take off. This is why they immediately start spin like that as they come off the ground. You can see the tail rotor start speeding up again while they are in the air but by then it's too late. Had they gotten higher off the ground he might have had a little more time to correct and ease the landing. I want to say it's pilot error, because even if something was busted and not working right his preflight check should have caught something. Which means he didn't do them or half-assed them.  Again I ain't no expert just a guy familiar with them.   Edit: and before people yeah I know about the cameras effect on rotors. I was basing it off the movement of the entire airframe. Good clip BTW makes wish I still had footage of harrier taking bird baths in the alantic."

Something appears to have gone wrong, stalling it mid turn and crashing shortly after. One second they're turning fine and the next they've got no lift and just bleed speed and crash.

MilitaryGfys,3866zk,Llaine,4,Tue Jun 2 11:01:16 2015 UTC,"The tail rotor doesn't change speed, it only changes blade pitch.  What your seeing is likely just an effect from the camera and/or the change in viewing angle."
MilitaryGfys,3866zk,InTheCatBoxAgain,3,Tue Jun 2 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I sorta half-assed addressed it. But basically the entire movement of the airframe is what led me to believe it was the tail rotor. The way it spins hard to the left, then the way it just hangs horizontally in the air like that looks as though the pilot was busy stopping the spin but started losing altitude in the process. Then he tries to straighten out but he's already way too close to the ground. Which is why I was saying if he had gotten a little more altitude he might have been able to save it or at the very least not hit so as hard. The entire crash just looks like it all starts from something not right with the tail rotor whether it be technical or pilot error. But again I'm not a expert or anything, just a dude looking at a gif like everyone else."

MilitaryGfys,3857y7,3rdweal,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"Wurfrahmen 40:       The Wurfrahmen 40 (""launch frame 40"") was a German World War II multiple rocket launcher. It combined a vehicle such as the SdKfz 251 halftrack or captured ex-French Renault UE Chenillette with rocket artillery to form a more mobile and protected artillery piece than the towed Nebelwerfer. It was nicknamed Stuka zu Fuss (""Stuka on Foot"" or ""Walking Stuka"") and Heulende Kuh (""Bellowing Cow"").   Introduced in late 1940, the weapon system was a framework with adjustable base plates fitted over and alongside a vehicle which could hold 300 mm high explosive (HE) rockets; 280 mm HE and 320 mm incendiary rockets were also used, the rockets being fired while in their loading crates. Although spin stabilized, the rockets were not as accurate as conventional artillery and reloading was time consuming due to the rocket's weight. Rockets were ripple-fired in large numbers where feasible to quickly saturate a target. The Wurfrahmen 40 was successful in service as a support weapon for the mobile Panzer formations, particularly in urban areas.  When used on the common mounting, the Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack, a frame with six base plates were used, with three on each side. The Chenillette UE employed either two per side or four frames on the rear. The Hotchkiss H35 mounting used two per side also. Some captured American M3 halftracks also mounted Wurfrahmen, with four frames at two per side.

MilitaryGfys,382kya,autowikibot,8,Mon Jun 1 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Kinetic bombardment:       A kinetic bombardment or a kinetic orbital strike is the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an inert projectile, where the destructive force comes from the kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high velocities. The concept is often encountered in science fiction [citation needed] and originated during the Cold War.  The typical depiction of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the target. The rod picks up speed as it approaches perapsis/ the target location due to gravity, picking up immense speed until it begins decelerating in the atmosphere and reaches terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would often be shaped so as to maximize terminal velocity. In science fiction, the tactic is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.  Kinetic bombardment has the advantage of being able to deliver the projectiles from a very high angle at a very high speed, making them extremely difficult to defend against. In addition, projectiles would not require explosive warheads, and—in the simplest designs—would consist entirely of solid metal rods, giving rise to the common nickname ""Rods from God"". Disadvantages include the technical difficulties of ensuring accuracy and the prohibitively high cost of positioning ammunition in orbit.

MilitaryGfys,382lnu,3rdweal,11,Mon Jun 1 12:08:09 2015 UTC,"I remember watching a short Youtube video that showed a bunch of soldiers training with the Carl Gustav. Because of the recoilless design (the Venturi recoil dampener), a huge pressure wave is generated behind the launcher, just like in other shoulder launched systems but apparently much stronger. In the video, shrubs and small trees as far as 20 feet away from the back end of the launcher were getting ripped to pieces by the repeated pressure blasts caused by the 84mm recoilless system.  You know how everyone has a ""recommended maximum dose"" of radiation that they are supposed receive every year, and this maximum yearly dose limits how many X-ray and MRI scans you can recieve per year? Well, the U.S. military has a similar system in place where soldiers are only allowed to recieve a certain amount of overpressure each year during peacetime, as being exposed to too many rapid pressure fluctuations (like those experienced when loading and firing a Carl Gustav) can be detrimental to your health. As a result, each soldier has a limited amount of times he can be in close proximity to a Carl Gustav being fired every year.  EDIT: Now that I think about it, it definitely wasn't the US military firing it in the video. I think it was a Northern European country, like Sweden or maybe Norway or Denmark."

Directly above that is the VSI (vertical air speed indicator) which tells what the climb/sink rate is.  The number to the right of the G is the acceleration of the aircraft in G's.  The number directly below that (6.9) I'm not 100% sure of but I'd wager its some sort of fuel indication.  Maybe 6.9 thousand pounds?"
MilitaryGfys,37wz88,CRMannes,13,Sun May 31 05:03:00 2015 UTC,"The number to the right of the G is how many Gs the aircraft is under, not acceleration (since he isn't in a turn it's around 1G).

MilitaryGfys,37wz88,airsofter615,13,Sun May 31 05:17:32 2015 UTC,"They have IFR guidance, but the skill of the pilot is what lands the plane.  There are 4 arresting cables at the landing zone (aft) and the ideal point is 3rd. A pilot will have the IFR system align them and guide them vertically via a system akin to glideslope but its up to them to arrest the cable."

MilitaryGfys,37wz88,UhOhSpaghettios1963,5,Sun May 31 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"It's an Instrument landing up until a couple seconds before landing. There are a couple systems, instrument carrier landing system (ICLS), optical landing system (OLS), aswell as your basic instruments such as your altimeter, vertical speed indicator(VSI), airspeed indicator, artifical horizon, and horizontal situation indicator (HSI). In this situation you can't really use the OLS so i'll explain the ICLS.  If you look at the bottom of the HUD you see a cross, the horizonal line represents your glideslope and the vertical line is your localizer (centers you to the runway). In the middle of that you see a circle with 3 lines coming out of it, that is your velocity vector (where your aircraft is pointed). And to the left of all that is a bracket which is your max/min angle of attack (AOA).  So when you come in to land you line up your localizer, glideslope, and your velocity vector. While your doing that you are adjusting your throttle so your velocity vector in within the AOA bracket. So, if you can manage to keep everything lined up you'll touch down perfectly. It requires alot of attention to detail and practice"
MilitaryGfys,37wz88,dziban303,3,Sun May 31 05:45:11 2015 UTC,"In IFR situations, the carrier can do a Ground Control Approach (PAR or ASR) to guide the aircraft in, or the pilot shoots the ILS to the deck"

But against a big, determined target there's a good chance it won't do much at all.   This is why suicide VBIEDs can be so effective. ISIS has even figured out putting metal grates in front of their suicide trucks to lessen damage from frontal attacks."
MilitaryGfys,37vghy,SeaLegs,2,Sun May 31 15:34:38 2015 UTC,I prefer to think of pointy swords that explode inside their victim. By the time an ATGM has penetrated through the armour of a vehicle it has lost a lot of it's heat. Besides spalling fragments caused by the shock on the armour it also tends to shatter into thousands of pieces at this stage or when it hits the rear of the compartment. These pieces along with the spall shred whatever is inside the vehicle.

First CF-03 went to Lakehurst over several detachments in 2011 - 2014, where the aircraft's basic ability to be catapult launched and catch wires was tested. Jet blast deflector compatibility testing was also conducted in summer of 2011. Turned out it could handle catapults pretty well but the original arresting hook design didn't work well. The hook point wasn't shaped properly to catch a wire once it made contact, and there wasn't enough damping force holding the hook down. The wire dynamics model provided by the government to design the hook against had some faulty assumptions. So the hook underwent several reworks to make it happen. Here's some info about the problems. The aircraft was also launched from the EMALS during this time, again to see if would work. It did.  So once the hook was right, then you do things like: come in at sink rates well above the target sink rate for a normal carrier landing. Come in with a significant angle of sideslip. Come in too fast. Come in too high such that the hook grabs the wire before the main landing gear hits the deck. This is all standard stuff that the Navy requires before you send a plane out to a carrier. Look at page 16 of this VX-23 newsletter from 2014. VX-23 pilots test the F-18 and also the F-35. All this testing I'm talking about is known as ""Shake, rattle, and roll"". Now look at page 18, where they talk about F-35 carrier suit testing specifically and they say    ""This is accomplished by conducting several series of arrested landings outside of a normal touchdown envelope. The landing series consist of high sink landings, rolled-yawed landings, maximum engaging speed landings and free flight landings. The free flight landing is similar to an in-flight engagement since the hook engages the cross deck pendant prior to the main wheels touching down; however, the aircraft still has a downward vector. The ultimate goal of this testing is to ensure the aircraft can handle the harsh forces it will experience while a nugget is safely executing night CQ.   Did I answer your question to your satisfaction?"
MilitaryGfys,37quja,sci901,3,Sat May 30 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Not the guy you were responding to, but ""...while a nugget is safely executing night CQ.""  What is a nugget and why would they call it that?  Other than that though; A+ post, great info!"
MilitaryGfys,37quja,private_ruffles,4,Sat May 30 16:37:07 2015 UTC,When a Naval Aviator comes out of flight school they are a 2nd lieutenant. The insignia for that rank is a single gold bar. Like a little gold nugget. So nugget is slang for newbie.

MilitaryGfys,37r4ak,ltsaGiraffe,2,Fri May 29 20:31:56 2015 UTC,well VLS is basically useless for combat with systems that still use 72/92 FCS because of the inability to control that many missiles at one time. The Turkish and Aussie Oliver FFGs have VLS cells onboard for ESSM though.

VLS is obviously more reliable then arm launchers, but they weren't that bad. The shift mostly came because arm launchers don't survive saturation attacks, and Aegis allowed for control of more missiles then the old 74/92 FCS."

Heaviest I have been in was on a ferry in the Irish sea, stuck out in a force 11 for about six hours before the ship could be brought into harbor. Fucking awesome. I was also part of a racing yacht club for a while. This one time, in yacht camp, we were meant to be having our normal Wednesday night race around Douglas harbour but t he seas were too rough and everyone wimped out. I managed to convince my captain and another three boats to go out. Anyway, swells were running to about 4m, not too bad, I was up reefing the storm jib because we were heeling quite a bit when the bow sank into a wave, luckily I heard the call and just managed to grab a stay before tons and tons of water washed over me. At that stage cap decided to head back in, as I'm looking at the boat about 10m to our port it disappeared, the swell had become so big I couldn't see the top of its mast when a wave passed between us. Then the rudder snapped. So we're broaching, headed towards rocks on  the Tower of Refuge and desperately trying to get the little 5 horse motor plugged into its hole thing I can't remember the name of while the boat is heeling almost to capsize point.  If the swells had been breaking we would have rolled. Eventually we get it in but it's only got enough grunt to keep us almost stationary and headed into the seas. Get on the radio to the harbour master and request the coasties to come save our arses. 20 minutes later they turn up and my flatmate is leading the crew. That cost me a lot of money at the bar that night as I had to shout both the coasties and the four crew.       I was never allowed to make a call to sail again. Pricks made a poster about it and hung it in the yacht club. 'The day forte2 almost killed us all'"

MilitaryGfys,37g6e7,autowikibot,3,Wed May 27 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"King of Donair:       King of Donair (KOD) is a restaurant chain founded in the early 1970s in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The first store was on Quinpool Road and serviced a broad clientele into the early morning hours when at the time only a limited number of eating establishments were open. KOD serves a wide range of food including the Halifax (or Maritime) donair, the super donair (sometimes served open-faced, with cheese), pizza (including donair pizza), poutine, and the taco sub.  Now a staple at many pizzerias in Atlantic Canada, King of Donair claims to have invented the Maritime donair — a variation on the traditional Middle Eastern doner kebab in 1973. Maritime donairs are characterized by their distinctive sauce, a sweeter version of a traditional garlic sauce, made from evaporated milk, sugar, garlic or garlic powder, and white vinegar. Traditional garlic sauce is usually made with yogurt or mayonnaise instead of evaporated milk and vinegar; it also has lemon juice rather than sugar. Donair sauce is a popular dipping sauce for garlic fingers (another regional dish).  As of 2008 [update], KOD has six locations throughout the Halifax Regional Municipality, as well as locations in New Brunswick. It has been prominently featured in a number of episodes of the hit TV series Trailer Park Boys, in which the character Randy (played by Patrick Roach) frequently visits for donairs, such as the episode ""A Man's Gotta Eat"", where he prostitutes himself in front of one store for coupons.

Most PDWs fire a small caliber, high velocity bottleneck cartridge, resembling a small or short rifle round. This gives the PDW better range, accuracy and armor-penetrating capability than submachine guns, which fire pistol-caliber cartridges.

MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,malacovics,20,Wed May 27 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"The point of a PDW in general is to be as small as possible, while still being lethal and effective when fielded.  THIS particular PDW though, the MP7, is designed with armor penetration in mind."
MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,3rdweal,5,Wed May 27 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"You could argue that with body armor being so widespread on the modern battlefield, armor penetration is one of the basic requirements too.  The Russians have taken a different route and given their 9mm bullets steel cores and higher powder charges in order to defeat armor, which they do but without the range and recoil benefits of the Western 4.6mm and 5.7mm loads."
MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,malacovics,7,Wed May 27 12:34:05 2015 UTC,The 4.6mm carries a lot less energy too however.
MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,3rdweal,11,Wed May 27 12:51:10 2015 UTC,"It makes a smaller hole, true - but at the end of the day, what matters, the size of the hole, or where you make it?  Shot placement is (almost) everything in my view - if you shoot the bad guy in the head with a 22 rimfire, he's dead.  If you miss him with a 44 magnum, he's not.  The small caliber PDWs might not have large energies but what they trade that for is bigger magazine capacities, less recoil and flatter trajectories, all factors that make it more likely that the person holding it will hit his target.  This makes them superior in my view.  Speaking from an armchair of course, I have no real world combat experience with the MP7."
MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,malacovics,9,Wed May 27 13:36:30 2015 UTC,"Either way, I think both rounds were tested for years and were made by engineers with decades of experience, so it's fair to assume both are good at what they are meant to do."

MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,Woodstoc_k,4,Wed May 27 10:54:17 2015 UTC,"So compared to the 9mm vs the steel and kevlar helmets yesterday, what is it that gives it the AP properties?  Is it the size of the round or the velocity of the bullet? Is a firearm capable of giving a bullet more energy if two different weapons were to fire the same round?  Also is the smaller bullet capable of piercing more than the bigger 9mm? I am visualising it in my head as a needle vs a butter knife stabbing some fabric... The smaller object faces less resistance?  Very interesting and lots of questions. Thank you in advance if you are able to answer them!"
MilitaryGfys,37fnlm,3rdweal,11,Wed May 27 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"There are some key elements for penetration, and smaller caliber PDW rounds are generally superior to ordinary pistol rounds in these areas:  Velocity - the faster a projectile is going, the less time the target has to deform and absorb the impact  Sectional Density - a long and thin ""spitzer"" type bullet usually has more weight per unit of frontal area, meaning it will lose velocity less quickly when traveling through a given medium and make it more likely to penetrate.  Hardness - PDW bullets usually have a hard core that is not easily deformed, unlike the soft lead cores we usually see in pistol bullets, so the energy goes into damaging the target as opposed to changing the shape of the bullet."

MilitaryGfys,37arlf,Toby-one,11,Tue May 26 12:52:27 2015 UTC,It isn't about shitty drivers. Competent fighting forces tend to care about their soldiers safety and wellbeing because when you invest heavily in your soldiers training and equipment then they aren't really expendable resources anymore that you can just throw away at a whim. And usually you will have rules or protocols to prevent stupid unecessary accidents like this one. Like not driving buttoned down and/or without a leader when in close proximity to squishy foot soldiers.
MilitaryGfys,37arlf,OrginalCanadian,1 point,Tue May 26 14:33:52 2015 UTC,What is saying that they don't care about there wellbeing?

MilitaryGfys,37arlf,NikkoJT,0,Tue May 26 15:13:46 2015 UTC,...what precautions are they supposed to take? Put a three-foot concrete barrier between vehicles and troops at all times?
MilitaryGfys,37arlf,Toby-one,16,Tue May 26 15:55:45 2015 UTC,You're not armoured are you? Usually there will be some rule/regulation that says something like you have to have a guide on foot when you operate the tank in close to unprotected troops. During exercises or parades (or similar) when this is not really practical you will still have the vehicle commander or gunner or loader un buttoned so that he can have a clear view of the vehicles surroundings and in this case make sure that they clear the column before they turn.  This guy didn't get hit because the quality of the driver he got hit because the outward visibility from a vehicle like that is extremely poor and regardless of how good the driver is he can't dodge what he can't see.
MilitaryGfys,37arlf,showershitters,2,Tue May 26 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"you can tell the driver was worried by how much space he gave the crowd, when he realized he went too far left he paused and then had to keep going.

MilitaryGfys,37a1am,SepDot,10,Tue May 26 07:40:17 2015 UTC,"Specifically, this would be a CRAM land-based system! You can tell because CRAM usually uses a type of ammunition called MPT-SD that ""pops"" before it gets a chance to hit the ground, minimizing any collateral damage."
MilitaryGfys,37a1am,Kanthes,5,Tue May 26 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I thought it was a variable time delayed round used to spray a pattern to increase the chances of a hit on the target."
MilitaryGfys,37a1am,Kanthes,6,Tue May 26 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"Some systems like the Oerlikon Millenium use rounds like that, but the Phalanx just uses self-destructing tracers, relying on the rounds themselves to hit the target before popping."
MilitaryGfys,37a1am,3rdweal,3,Tue May 26 04:48:21 2015 UTC,The Ahead ammo on the Skyshield is pretty bad ass.
MilitaryGfys,37a1am,b0dhi,10,Tue May 26 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"From elsewhere:   The numbers behind this system are just mind boggling.   This is basically how the system works. The function is graphically explained in more detail in the video linked to below.  Using a variety of sensors, an airborne target is tracked and the range to the target is calculated.  A shell is fired at 1050 metres per second (3445 feet per second) and at the muzzle, in less than a milisecond, the velocity of the projectile is measured, time of flight to target is calculated and the electronic fuse on the shell is programmed to activate the shell in the path of the target.  24 shells are fired in one burst, all in the space of less than 2 seconds.  Once the shell is in the path of the target, a small ejection charge bursts the shell open.  It is not a high explosive shell, so the charge does not add energy to the equation.  What it does is eject 152 tungsten subprojectiles in a conical pattern.  Each subprojectile weighs 3.3 grams - assuming that by the time it reaches the target the shell has shed 1000 fps from its initial velocity, this means that the subprojectile is travelling at around 2500 feet per second.  This gives it a kinetic energy of 700 ft-lbs, the energy of a .357 magnum bullet, though since it is much denser and faster, it will penetrate much further - and this is just one subprojectile.  A 24 round burst means that the unfortunate target will fly into a cloud of 3,648 such projectiles.  The AIM-4 Falcon missile illustrated was used as a test target, the actual test can be seen on video here.  Note that the damage was the result of a static test, if the missile had been travelling at speed the result would have been even more devastating."
MilitaryGfys,37a1am,3rdweal,2,Tue May 26 07:21:53 2015 UTC,There's also an amphibious mobile SPAAG which uses a similar mechanism to AHEAD with 2x35mm guns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCxTXv1S6k

It is based on the new Oerlikon 35 mm revolver cannon land based Air defense system, and uses AHEAD ammunition. A device at the muzzle end of the barrel measures the exact speed of each round as it is fired, and automatically sets the fuse to detonate the round as it approaches a pre-set distance from the target. Each round disperses 152 small projectiles to strike the incoming target.  Whilst these are too small to do major damage in themselves, the accumulation of damage from multiple strikes is expected to destroy wings and control surfaces, sensors and aerodynamics, causing the target to crash. Other firing modes are designed to be effective against surface targets such as small fast attack boats.

The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland.  Although never used in Britain, the design was later used in Greece.

MilitaryGfys,374uad,DiepFries,5,Mon May 25 02:35:44 2015 UTC,No expert but I think SS is more designed to be launched from an airborne platform to it's target where as the Tomahawk has long since been implemented in VLS at frigates and even submarines.   It's more of a sole airforce weapon where as the Tomahawk is a navy tactical weapon.   There's also the Swedish-German KEPD 350 and British-French Perseus as well as the US AGM-158 JASSM which is more comparable to the SS and US made.   I think the Tomawk is bound to be out of service sometime after 2016 and will be replaced largely by the Next Generation Land Attack missile tbd and the LRASM in VLS configuration in anti ship roles.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile  Check out the list on that page to get some more understanding.

It might just be Raytheon once more though."
MilitaryGfys,374uad,misunderstandgap,2,Tue May 26 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"According to wikipedia (always a risky source), fewer than 200 tomahawks have been used in Libya, and 4000 remain in the USN's stocks."

Quickly many European nations had their stock of armament sigfnificantly lowered and the Danes needed to buy bombs from the Dutch and the UK and French started new missile production and design and amped up Brimstone etc.   Say if the US were to bomb the SAA in a sudden campaign, many Tomahawks would be used."

It looks like the incoming sets off the tanks ERA, which means the round could have been neutralized. But, that could just as easily be a HEAT round or ATGM hitting the vehicle and not being neutralized or in the case of a ATGM out performing the armor. I just can't tell. But, two things to take away at the end. One, the tank doesn't GTFO, so it could be immoblized or the crew could all be deaf and dumb, or dead, from the hit. Two, the tank doesn't immediately turn into a pillar of fire like this so at least the ammo didn't cook off. Either way, those poor fucks are having a shitty day.

Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medivac, and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue, scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting. It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide.

MilitaryGfys,36xg4q,airsofter615,3,Fri May 22 22:39:38 2015 UTC,Why doesnt it alternate instead of shooting both at the same time? I feel like alternating would be better in most cases
MilitaryGfys,36xg4q,iwancoppa,6,Sat May 23 03:11:01 2015 UTC,Most likely due to the layout and design of the loader or stresses on the traverse mechanism from firing offset barrels.

MilitaryGfys,36xg4q,LagrangePt,2,Sat May 23 13:12:37 2015 UTC,"Neither gun is lined up with the pivot, so firing them alternating would exert torque, which would probably slightly reduce accuracy as it tries to twist the turret side to side.

MilitaryGfys,36xksz,TehRoot,7,Fri May 22 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"Source   Another GFY - I liked the overall view more  I'm proud of myself for figuring out which Kirov this actually was. Soviet Naval ships don't have unique ship identification numbers like the US Navy does. This particular Kirov is lacking two fire control radars that seem to have been added in later for the SA-N-4 launchers, which is why it's different then Admiral Nakhimov or Petr Velikiy, at least in this video/gfy.   The Kirov-class is an amazing vessel, and it's a shame that the first 2 of the 4 are being scrapped. It displaces a hair over 24k tons at average load, and breaks 28k at full load. It's 827 feet long, has a beam(Width) of 94 feet, and a draft of 30 feet. It's about 200 feet short of the length of the Nimitz-class, and it's just a hair(55ft) shorter then the Titanic. Did I forget to mention that it's also nuclear powered? Despite being almost 3 times the weight of a Ticonderoga, it can cruise at 32 knots using almost double the shp of the Ticonderoga.   They each carry 96 S-300s, 44 SA-N-4 Gecko(OSA-MA), and on all of the ships besides the lead, Kirov, 128 SA-N-9(Tor). This is all for air defense, which is amazing. They all carry 20 SS-N-19 Shipwreck(P-700 Granit) anti-ship missiles, and on the Kirov, instead of those Tor's, SS-N-14 Silex(Metel) Anti-submarine missiles(equiv. to SUBROC/ASROC).  Enough fire control radars are carried to fit out a small airbase. 12 fire control radars in total, 8 for the SAMs, and 4 split between the 4 AK-630s. 2 full 3D search radars are also mounted on the mid and main masts.   The Kirov's also carry 2 AK-130 on the last 3 ships, and on the kirov, 2 AK-100 mounted aft and 1 AK-130 mounted fore, and an assortment of ASW rocket launchers and torpedo tubes."

Medina Ridge is the name American troops gave to a low rise, approximately seven miles (11 km) long.  The battle, which was waged over approximately two hours, was the largest tank battle of the war and the largest tank battle in American history. It took place west of Phase Line Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.

MilitaryGfys,36lvi4,thatotherguy9,6,Wed May 20 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"Hedgehog (weapon):       The Hedgehog (also known as an Anti-Submarine Projector) was a forward-throwing anti-submarine weapon developed by the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom during World War II. It was deployed on convoy escort warships such as destroyers and corvettes to supplement the depth charge. The weapon fired a number of small spigot mortar bombs from spiked fittings. The bombs exploded on contact, rather than using a time or depth fuze as depth charges did and achieved a higher sinking rate against submarines than depth charges did.

It is similar in principle to the Royal Navy Hedgehog system used during the Second World War. The system entered service in 1960-61 and is fitted to a wide range of Russian surface vessels. It consists of a horseshoe shaped arrangement of twelve launch barrels, that are remotely directed by the Burya fire control system (that can also control the shorter ranged RBU-1000). It fires RGB-60 unguided depth charges. The rockets are normally fired in salvos of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 rounds. Reloading is automatic, with individual rounds being fed into the launcher by the 60UP loading system from a below deck magazine. Typical magazine capacity is either 72 or 96 rounds per launcher. It can also be used as a shore bombardment system.

MilitaryGfys,36gnza,Konsalik,2,Tue May 19 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, I guess.   But the radio receiver is in the rear end of the missile, and its antenna will only pick up incoming transmission from a really tiny ""field of view"" pointing back towards the launch tube. This means a jammer would have to be behind the launch position.  The radio transmitter sends its signals in a really narrow beam as well, so you'd have to be literally be aimed at with the weapon to be able to detect/receive the radio signals. And you'd be dead then, I guess...

MilitaryGfys,36cwsz,Phiggle,9,Mon May 18 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"The cord is the actual explosive, usually in 5lb packs of C4 and there's a lot of them. The Python is in a trailer which is being towed by a Trojan armoured engineer vehicle. A rocket fires and drags the explosive line out, the rocket snakes as it flies so the line lands in a serpentine pattern, this is so that it can clear a wider lane when it explodes. There is a trailing wire attached to the line which will be used by the engineers to send an electrical signal to det cord in the charge line to set the explosives off. The use of explosives to clear mines was first invented by the British using what is called a Bangalore Torpedo, sections of explosive filled pipe which can be screwed together and pushed into the mine field (Saving Private Ryan beach scene). This was then developed into a MICLIC (Mine Clearing Line Charge), originally however it was a hose like tube which would be pushed into the field by a tank or engineering vehicle, much safer and faster than doing it by hand. Rockets were then added, then a serpentine pattern to create a wider lane."

Early on in Afghanistan many countries used light vehicles, like HMMWV scout cars but experience showed them to get absolutely shredded by IEDs, so they needed to replace them with MRAPs and V-hulled vehicles like Piranhas. That's probably why most western countries have moved away from light vehicles, but given a combat scenario without the constant threat of IEDs and mines, light vehicles still very much have their place."

Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.   though too be fair, they fixed that but it took replacing the engine lel, the AL-31+ series turbines in the SU-27 series have some of the same problems.

Tyre had been recently changed, mechanic had cross threaded the nut and not realised it wasn't wound up all the way (Something about the nut being inside a tube so you can't see it from side on to check)  So, due to the rear legs being splayed outwards slightly, as the aircraft took off, when rotating, more and more pressure builds up on the wheel, which is normally fine, but as the nut was not on properly, it popped off as he rotated.

MilitaryGfys,35xo2e,Swww,13,Thu May 14 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. Bring on the spall, baby   Impacts against hard targets result in local temperatures as high as 1,800°C, which results in a phase change in uranium from solid to liquid. At these elevated temperatures, the uranium reacts readily with atmospheric oxygen. The oxides formed subsequently condense to solid aerosol particles. Oxidation is the source of the pyrophoric nature of DU impacts and is not present with WHA impacts. This burning effect enhances the effectiveness of DU penetrators, particularly inside the target.    http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo4/no1/research-recherch-eng.asp"

For each rules there's exception... and in many case there's also exception to the exception...  I don't have trouble with it since it's my native language but there's exception that is completely... stupid...  Example: the plural    In French, when you want to show the plural of a word, you put a ""s"" at the end. It's a universal rule that works in generally most case.   But:   pou (louse), caillou (pebble/stone), genou (knee), chou (cabbage), hibou (owl), joujou (toy), bijou (jewel) take all a ""x"" instead of a ""s"" words ending with -al end with -aux (un journal, des journaux) when plural except word like chacal, carnaval (chacals, carnavals)  Some word ending in -au can also follow the exception to rule but also the exception to the exception: Boréals/boréaux, astrals/astraux are both correct.    -  Still under this rules some word can accept both of the plural mark but it totally change it's definition. Pascals => unit of measure, Pascaux (generally for animals) => related to easter.  All word ending with -au, -eu, -eau take a ""x"" instead of a ""s"", except landaus, sarraus, unaus, bleus, émeus, enfeus, pneus words ending with -ail take a ""s"" (normal rule) except Bail, corail, émail, soupirail, travail, vitrail, etc that end with -aux instead. Words ending with -s, -x or -z don't take anything when plural. un gros, des gros And to finsh there's some word that follow there own rule: un ail, des aulx     And it's a basic rule... :D"

MilitaryGfys,35twgc,-Daetrax-,8,Wed May 13 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"The retarded bomb uses a mechanical method of creating increased aerodynamic drag, such as a parachute, ballute, or drag-inducing petals. These deploy after the ordnance is released, slowing its fall and abbreviating its forward trajectory, giving the aircraft time to get clear of the blast zone when bombing from low altitudes or with nuclear ordnance. However, these bombs are less accurate than conventional free-fall bombs.   petals  ballute"
MilitaryGfys,35twgc,ToothGnasher,7,Wed May 13 20:22:44 2015 UTC,Why bomb at such a low altitude in the first place? To avoid radar/SAMs?

MilitaryGfys,35twgc,-Daetrax-,5,Thu May 14 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. Though, at how low altitudes are these required?"
MilitaryGfys,35twgc,pocket_mulch,4,Wed May 13 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the size of the bomb. Only the MK.82 and BSU-50 are retarded in US inventory.  The blast radius generally doesn't exceed several hundred feet, the prominent effects are shrapnel which can be propelled at thousands of feet per second and pierce aircraft too close, I think parachute bombs are typically used at sub-1500 ft for 500 pound, but I'm not sure where the 2000 pounder is dropped from. I would assume probably parachute retarded if dropped below maybe 2000-3000 ft?"

It was also supposed to be the symbol of the Nazi Werwolf resistance movement, which ostensibly explains its use as a marking on the werewolves in the True Blood HBO series.  The rune it is most similar to is eihwaz (ᛇ) of the Elder Futhark runic alphabet, but they are stylisticly distinct and the addition of the crossbar wasn't seen in actual runic script.

MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,HoboOnTheCorner,18,Mon May 11 20:06:18 2015 UTC,They needed a way to dump fuel quickly in case of emergency landing. The cool effect is just a side-effect of this.
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,irisher,16,Mon May 11 21:29:48 2015 UTC,It dumps the fuel between the engines. Afterburners ignite the fuel. Good times ensue.
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,pocket_mulch,3,Mon May 11 21:54:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if this boosts thrust too? Although I imagine the sudden loss of fuel weight certainly has some affect.
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,Volitans86,4,Mon May 11 22:53:02 2015 UTC,most likely too minuscule to measure
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,OrginalCanadian,2,Tue May 12 01:07:51 2015 UTC,"My hypothesis would be no. And the reason I say that is the fuel burning would definitely make some thrust, but it's outwards in all directions, effectively cancelling itself out. The thrust isn't confined in a single direction like what you have with jet engines. There's also very little compression.  But I'm definitely interested in someone's response who are probably more qualified than me in the subject. I'm honestly just guessing. But I think the loss of weight would have more effect."
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,Dark_Knight_Reddits,1 point,Tue May 12 02:31:54 2015 UTC,It sort of reduces drag I guess.
MilitaryGfys,35lcqg,3rdweal,2,Wed May 13 10:03:36 2015 UTC,"Base bleed:       Base bleed is a system used on some artillery shells to increase their range, typically by about 30%.  Most of the drag on an artillery shell comes from the nose of the shell, as it pushes the air out of its way at supersonic speeds. Shaping the shell properly can reduce this greatly. However, another powerful source of drag is the vacuum left behind the shell due to its blunt base. This drag is difficult to remove, because the shell needs to be ""nose heavy"" in order to have proper ballistics, and it cannot easily be shaped into a more aerodynamic form.  Base bleed is one way to reduce this drag without extending the base of the shell. Instead, a small ring of metal extends just past the base, and the area in the rear of the shell is filled with a small gas generator. The gas generator provides little to no thrust, but simply fills the vacuum behind the shell with pressure, dramatically reducing the drag. The only downsides are a small loss of accuracy due to the somewhat more turbulent airflow, and a small loss in explosive payload due to some of the space inside the shell being taken up by this thrust mechanism.

MilitaryGfys,35kq1r,yuckyucky,20,Mon May 11 12:26:33 2015 UTC,"indeed. it has a galley!   The Su-34's most distinctive feature is the unusually large flight deck. Much of the design work went into crew comfort. The two crew members sit side by side in a large cabin, with the pilot-commander to the left and navigator/operator of weapons to the right in NPP Zvezda K-36dm ejection seats. An advantage of the side by side cockpit is that duplicate instruments are not required for each pilot. Since long missions require comfort, the pressurization system allows operation up to 10,000 metres (32,800 ft) without oxygen masks, which are available for emergencies and combat situations.[29] The crew members have room to stand and move about the cabin during long missions.[30][31] The space between the seats allows them to lie down in the corridor, if necessary.[29] A toilet and a galley are located behind the crew seats.[29][30] A ladder attached to the nose landing gear and a hatch in the cockpit floor is used to enter the cockpit. The cockpit is a continuous capsule of armour.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-34#Design"

I remember we were EXTREMELY careful while loading the tanks in the vehicle to avoid this thing to happen. I don't understand why the driver wanted to drive that fast and why nobody told him to align correctly with the vehicle.

MilitaryGfys,35e31v,Stuhlgewitter,2,Sat May 9 16:17:21 2015 UTC,A bit off topic but is your user name a play on ernst junger's book?
MilitaryGfys,35e31v,Saffs15,4,Sat May 9 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. There's a German neonazi band that adapted the name (Stahlgewitter), and Stuhlgewitter is a semi-common way to make fun of them by literally turning them into a turd storm.   Not really a political statement, I just needed a silly, german-sounding name for a reddit account."
MilitaryGfys,35e31v,Llaine,16,Sat May 9 18:04:05 2015 UTC,I'm also going to ask where you got it's filmed with a cell phone? A lot of soldiers have helmet cams at this point in time. In which he would just be looking around normally and filming this.

MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,EvilGnome01,41,Fri May 8 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's not the greatest looking plane from most angles, but man it looks good from underneath."

MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,AbideMan,6,Sat May 9 01:00:05 2015 UTC,Dem curves.
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,KargBartok,6,Sat May 9 05:15:36 2015 UTC,I totally agree.  Did they change anything going from the X-35 to the F-35? Or was it always like this and I just missed it?
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,DrMarianus,12,Fri May 8 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, they changed heaps, which is why the first F-35 didn't fly until 6 years after the X-35:  X-35 1, 2, 3  F-35 1, 2, 3  The X-35 didn't actually have weapons bays, and so to fit them in as well as make alterations to make certain parts of the jet more stealthy, the F-35 gained it's extra curves."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Dragon029,2,Sat May 9 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"Fuck me, they've put some work in refining this puppy."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,fishbedc,5,Sat May 9 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the x-35 was more of a ""We can build a better plane than the competitor, now give us money"" thing, while the F-35 benefitted from all the additional R&D funds. The Boeing x-32 is what lost to it if you want to look that up. Documentary ""battle of the x planes"" is very good."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,ShaidarHaran2,3,Sat May 9 14:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I watched that a while back. Always had a bit of a soft spot for the Boeing, I really liked that single piece wing.   But looking at similar angle shots of the X/F-35 makes me realise just how much detail has been refined, how polished it is now as a piece of engineering or craft."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,fishbedc,7,Sat May 9 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the underside is what does it for me, it looks like a muscly shark. It's also interesting from an engineering point of view, the body itself helps with airflow, which people who initially criticized its short wings didn't understand."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,ShaidarHaran2,1 point,Sat May 9 14:39:41 2015 UTC,Really sexy plane. First jet in a long while to actually change up the design a bit.  I just hope it will be of any use and not a complete waste of money.
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,RaccoNooB,3,Sat May 9 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"Something tells me it'll be used quite a bit. It's coming in over budget and behind schedule but it's coming, and seems like it'll have all the capabilities promised.... Debate all you want about whether its worth the money but it'll be one hell of a capable plane when its fully ready and integrated"
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,EvilGnome01,1 point,Sat May 9 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"No doubt it will be used, but I believe the designer of the F-16(18 maybe?) called it out on being terrible. It's trying to do everything, and therefor it will fail at everything.  An example: it's trying to be stealthy, so all payload has to be internal causing it to be bulky with a small load, making it sub-par at bombing, and fighting.   Edit: Yay! Seems like it's gonna be good!"
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,RaccoNooB,10,Sat May 9 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of Pierre Sprey, but he didn't actually design the F-16 or any aircraft, he was just one analyst of several who set the requirements of what the F-16 should be - that said, it's even less than that, as the F-16 that he wanted and the F-16 that was built were 2 completely different aircraft; he didn't want it to have a radar, any air-to-ground capability or more than 2 missiles.  A lot of what he said is debunked in these two videos as well."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Dragon029,4,Sat May 9 13:44:59 2015 UTC,I think you are being to kind about him. You are leaving out the endless bitching about it and punditry.

MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,n00bsk00lbus,4,Mon May 18 09:55:01 2015 UTC,"Along with what /u/Dragon029 said, the F-35 can definitely carry weapons externally."

MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,real_jeeger,3,Fri May 8 20:23:38 2015 UTC,Did a door open up to reveal the flare launcher?
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Ron-Swanson-Mustache,2,Fri May 8 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, there's a door on the right side of the rear fuselage where flares, chaff, decoys, etc can be deployed from."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Dragon029,1 point,Fri May 8 20:11:35 2015 UTC,All from the one dispenser?
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,pocket_mulch,3,Sat May 9 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"Supposedly - it's not large, but there's probably room for one pod of each."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Dragon029,6,Sat May 9 03:01:50 2015 UTC,Do flares still work? I would assume that by now missiles have evolved to not get fooled by them.
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Ch3v4l13r,11,Fri May 8 21:11:39 2015 UTC,"Against older systems yes, and they're cheap enough that you might as well put them on."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,ckfinite,6,Fri May 8 23:01:44 2015 UTC,Most of the advanced AAMs aren't fooled by flares. They are still very effective against most MANPADS though.  The F-35 is getting a possible upgrade in the future with a DIRCM system which is far better against modern IR missiles.
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,ihatehappyendings,8,Fri May 8 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"The AN/AAQ-24 system is a directional infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) system. It consists of a missile warning system (AN/AAR-54), an integration unit, a processor, and laser turrets.   Aww yiiiiesss"
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,TexasTrip,7,Sat May 9 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"You know how it works? By SHOOTING MISSILES OUT OF THE AIR. Well technically blinding them, but same shit. Most military aircraft have these turrets."
MilitaryGfys,35bh1z,Beli_Mawrr,1 point,Sat May 9 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Not even the most advanced FPAs can be distracted by flares, especially in high boresight targeting or heavily congested environments, or against the backdrop of the sun in certain scenarios."

MilitaryGfys,35bgjw,Boonaki,3,Sat May 9 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"Warheads are different.  In an anti-missile or anti-aircraft warhead they tend to use Continuous-rod warheads to maximize kill probability against fast moving targets.
