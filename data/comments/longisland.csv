longisland,3e0pn9,zennyc001,6,Tue Jul 21 03:23:38 2015 UTC,Sounds like the beginning of a good story
longisland,3e0pn9,I_Cant_Even_28,5,Tue Jul 21 13:20:04 2015 UTC,After hours should work. Robert Moses charges 10$ to park between 8-4 on weekdays and between 7-6 on weekends. I believe you're allowed to swim weekdays 9-7 and weekends 9-8. So presumably on a Tuesday you could go in for free at 4:00 and enjoy it for a few hours but I'm honestly not sure if they close the gates. Maybe bringing your friends if splitting the cost is an option. I think gardiners county park is free it's a stroll through nature to a small beach where people can bring their dogs. I don't know if people really sunbathe and swim over there.  The only other thing I can think of is to walk through to the beach and avoid using their parking. You probably can only do this when the beaches are in residential areas as I imagine you can't pull over and leave your car outside the parking lot of Robert Moses beaches. Like how vanetian shores is set up in Lindenhurst. There could be no parking signs in the street though so again I'm not sure. I thought I would give some info anyway since it seems like you didn't get much.

Plus at the time, sprint didnt have 4g service at all, they led me to believe they did or it was coming soon.  but after reading it was being delayed for years, i canned sprint and went to verizon.  I hate verizon with a fiery passion, so would love to go back to sprint since it is cheaper too.  any experiences in central nassau with it>?"

longisland,3dzz2f,zennyc001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"Over the last 16 years I've had 3 out of the big 4 (not Verizon)  I have used AT&T Blue, Cingular and AT&T Orange (which is what Cingular is now)  The most current version of AT&T is great for reception but as far as plans go and top data speed I found T-mobile to be better.    Last month i switched my HTC One M7 from AT&T to T-Mobile. Now I can stream all the music I want without it using my data (which cost me a lot on AT&T in comparison)  I briefly considered Google's Project-FI however the included unlimited music feature tipped the scales in favor of T-Mo http://www.cnet.com/products/google-project-fi/  This is my current set up:  Unlocked HTC One M7  Google Hangouts for Text, WiFi calling and Voicemail  Google Music All Access Grandfathered $7.99 Plan (now 9.99)  Tmobile Post Paid Plan w/ 3Gb of data (not including music) $60+taxes and fees  This week i will complete my move from Bellmore to Holbrook   Reception wise At&T is better in Holbrook but not by much. Using Google Hangouts as my primary connection has made me a bit agnostic since there is wi-fi almost anywhere I go.   The new 700mhz Band12 on Tmobile should make reception better with newer phones.   I currently have the new ZTE Axon Pro on pre-order which supports this wireless new band. I am buying the phone out right for $450 and with T-mobile there is never any contract.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyFGODwsxAA"

longisland,3dt5w5,tcub3dtm,5,Sun Jul 19 17:47:34 2015 UTC,That is a dangerous U-Turn in the first place too.
longisland,3dt5w5,HoodedJinX,4,Sun Jul 19 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Was just telling members of my youth group to be careful driving these days. Way too many fatalities nearly every day on our roads due to speeding, texting while driving, and DUIs"
longisland,3dt5w5,salawm,4,Sun Jul 19 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"Im friends with one of the girls who survived, shes in the hospital now. Cant imagine how she feels right now. Horrible."
longisland,3dt5w5,SeekerInShadows,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:39 2015 UTC,This is so strange. I was at that vineyard yesterday.  There's a good chance I spoke with those girls before they left. I feel terrible for the families of everybody involved.
longisland,3dt5w5,WhatsAFratStar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:14 2015 UTC,"Those comments are, as usual, a shit show.  Tragedy for the families involved not to mention a black wedding for the affianced couple."
longisland,3dt5w5,LoveRecklessly,2,Sun Jul 19 17:37:33 2015 UTC,So sad. I live close to here. This has been weighing heavily on my mind.
longisland,3ds9vc,moltengijoe,7,Sat Jul 18 23:38:59 2015 UTC,Beautiful truck. I see it all over miller place. These original power wagons are worth like 150k.
longisland,3ds9vc,atom631,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:05 2015 UTC,It's INSANE what these things go for restored now. A few years ago they weren't worth 1/10th that.
longisland,3ds9vc,Eat_sleep_poop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:29 2015 UTC,Oh yea I've seen it a few times around three village I think it may be an original lol
longisland,3ds9vc,vinsterX,2,Sun Jul 19 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen this one cruising on 25A as well.  There was one of these rotting away at the Setauket Marina for the longest time.  I always had the dream of restoring it with a modern day Hemi under the hood.  Low and behold, sometime between winterizing the boat in the winter and coming back in the spring, the truck was gone."

longisland,3ds9vc,pyth1100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:16 2015 UTC,I would love to own one of these.
longisland,3dr3ny,HoodedJinX,3,Sat Jul 18 17:22:18 2015 UTC,Set up a decoy cow
longisland,3dr3ny,momgi,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:02 2015 UTC,The only way I've found is to stay entirely submerged as much as possible.   Does bug spray have any effect?
longisland,3dr3ny,TastyBrainMeats,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"It definitely didn't yesterday. I don't remember the brand, but I had one insect repellent with like 7% Deet. Didn't think I'd need the deep woods repellent at the beach."
longisland,3dr3ny,pyth1100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:23 2015 UTC,"Deep woods is sort of the standard, seeing as it's only that or the athlete version."
longisland,3dr3ny,pyth1100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:47:16 2015 UTC,athlete version ?
longisland,3dr3ny,agentanthony,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:29 2015 UTC,That guy
longisland,3dr3ny,BobLI,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:13 2015 UTC,Put dyer sheets in your pocket. Like bounce.
