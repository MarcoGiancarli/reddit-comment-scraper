marchingband,3e5vzv,baxterbear111,2,Wed Jul 22 05:45:26 2015 UTC,yeah telling them to punch through the pain s a good one. In my sousa section on the second day of band camp (or school if the freshmen don't go with us to the university) they get two ibuprofen as thats when it hurts the most. after that they are on their own.
marchingband,3e5vzv,TubaJesus,2,Wed Jul 22 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I'm just a flute, but I have some input.   I don't think that it's unethical at all to do that. Some sections in the brass in my band have horn lifts after rehearsals. The whole section just hold their horns up for intervals of time.  It's to practice holding their  horns up for the long durations of the show.  So, I don't think that it is unethical.   Just maybe make it clear to that person that everyone is just as tired as he is, and he needs to tough it out for the better of the band.   Also, maybe explain that it is kind of an all or nothing impact. If there is a line of trumpets and everyone has their horns up except one, basically everyone has their horns down. Does that make sense?  Instead of the audience's attention going to the  incredible impact of the powerful trumpets, the attention all goes to that one person who wasn't up.   If you still have trouble with the player, don't hesitate to bring your director in or a trumpet staff member. They might have some pointers that you don't know about that could help the person keep their trumpet up."

marchingband,3e5vzv,owlgirlia,2,Wed Jul 22 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"Four long, hot summers ago, I was new to the marching band program. I was a flute player, and it was crucial to have the horn angle perfect. The marching director was new that year. One night, he made everyone block up, and we had to stay with our horns up facing forward and to each side for at least 3 minutes per position. It was incredibly painful for someone who wasn't used to it, and I remember almost crying. It was worth it though, because my horn angle improved a lot. Be a bit tough. I agree, make them hold up their horn for extended periods of time each rehearsal."
marchingband,3e5vzv,owlgirlia,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:38 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of when we do any musical practice, our director warns us up by making us play for ~3 minutes.  The low brass are better at holding their instruments up than my section."

At the end of every day of band camp, we run and hide from the rest of the band, and stand in a circle facing each other. We then stand at attention, with horns up and good posture. First day, we stay there for five minutes. Last day is usually around 15. Anyone drops their horn angle, and we add a minute. There was a year we added minutes for talking.  You gotta be serious about it if you want to be the best, and this guy obviously doesn't care."

marchingband,3dxz36,mansonn666,7,Tue Jul 21 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"One year, our show started with only a quintet playing for at least a minute straight. In my part, I probably had about 60 notes. In our first competition, I would guess that I fracked about 15 of them. Not in a row, just every 3-5 notes. It sounded awful and everyone joked about it for a few weeks.   Even better is a story from someone else in my section. One Friday, we were on live local TV. What we did was stay after the game, and then they broadcasted part of our show live. They had one camera in the box and one on the field. The guy running the field camera was holding it with one hand low to the ground to get a shot of the drum line. My section was marching backwards. The guy next to me kicks the camera, knocks it out of the camera man's hand and onto the ground and then the same guy who kicked it trips and falls on it, and then begins yelling less than appropriate words.   On that same run-through for TV, the camera in the box is zoomed in on the brass block, which is moving. The whole block closes for a short hold, other than one freshman who closes, realizes he is in the wrong spot, and then takes another 2 steps. It looked awful. It's the reason everyone says ""if you are holding in the wrong spot, don't move"". To this day, people still tell this to uneasy freshmen as a ""no matter how badly you mess up, it won't be this bad""."

Not just a regular blue box, no, a GR 55 guitar synth. Now, this was the first year of its existence and the tracking was not particularly good. So what else would the band directors want than for me to play using the world most god awful harp patch to offer to kick off the very start of the show with some showy sixteenth note patterns. This thing was more sensitive than a guard member who sneezed while putting on her makeup. Even touching a string would make a note trigger. So I made the best of it, got it down pretty well so that the mistakes were  few. But then the time of the Atlanta regional comes up. Prelims go by and I nail it. Of course that's only half the battle. The time for finals rolls around and my hands are cold as they can be riding through the streets in the cold on a stage hooked to the back of a truck. We hit the tunnels and of course it's no better, and my hands are pretty much frozen when I finish plugging in all the speakers and setting everything up. Our pre show plays and I'm just sitting there dreading when I have to start. I hear the audio for me to start and I go for it. My fingers, being frozen solid at the time, decide that the best course of action would be to produce the highest pitched sound perceivable by human ears, and that's exactly what happens.

marchingband,3dxz36,kanjobanjo17,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"I was the only one out of our band of ~35 people to ever fall during rehearsals. I fell backwards. With a tenor sax. Then the next year, I fell backwards again. With a bari sax. It hurt my pride more than anything else."
marchingband,3dxz36,dropthebassoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"My freshman year, we were about to perform our show for the first time to a crowd. We were at a huge fancy stadium in Houston where we (quite a redneck school) were opposing a ghetto city school. We got our uniforms on and went out on the field, but there were plenty of holes because a lot of the band kids were gone for livestock judging and whatnot. We didn't hear the drum major's count off, and the drum line took off. Nobody knew where to go, everything was falling apart, the flute soloist's mic went out, our quintet was all sorts of out of tune.  The opposing school showed us up with a show that consisted of the band not even marching, just standing there dancing in place and a dirty dancing drill team. All of the directors were hella pissed and almost nobody spoke the rest of the game."
marchingband,3dww96,drummajorthrowaway,4,Mon Jul 20 05:15:07 2015 UTC,"Dude, you gotta have more faith in yourself.  Sure, you might get nervous about addressing the entire band and asserting yourself, but your director kept you on as drum major for a reason.  Stop thinking about how shitty it's gonna be when you mess up and start thinking about how you're gonna do the best you can do and it's okay if you make a mistake and aren't perfect.  Obviously you need to be able to show that you're competent in your position, but you don't have to be perfect."
marchingband,3dww96,saxguy2001,2,Mon Jul 20 06:29:06 2015 UTC,"I can relate to what you are feeling. I was head drum major if my band last year and was quite surprised that received the position. I was incredibly nervous about the year because I didn't know what to expect and I was generally more quiet. I would say that one thing that helped me out is fake it till you make it. I didn't really know what I was going at the beginning of the season, but I did everything thing with confidence and was not passive. I made sure to put in a lot of hard work and extra hours, and if you show effort and put in an attempt to be a good leader, the band will respect you for this and follow you. Best of luck next year!"
marchingband,3dww96,Saxington,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Your director put you there for a reason, regardless of what that reason was.  The more you hype yourself up to it being a bad experience, the worse it'll be when you're actually up in front of your team, so you need to start thinking more optimistically now. Which is hard. But try to work on it.   Start with your section leaders. Have leadership meetings in social settings so that you're comfortable with them before you have to direct them (go out for coffee or icecream or something?). If they respect you, it wont matter if you fumble your words, they'll know what you meant.   Then come down to below the section leaders. Again, start social (how is your day going? What are you learning in x class right now?) and then move down on to instructions and corrections. You can be helpful without being ""assertive."" In fact, that may just be what your director is looking for.   Don't sweat it too much. You'll probably be great."
marchingband,3dww96,jeanewt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"First thing I would do is try and talk with your director for a bit. Try and figure out why he chose you and also see if he can help you out and give you tips.   As for your classmates, I would try getting to know them a little bit more individually (if it is a small enough group) or even trying to get to know them by sections if it is a bigger band. You don't need to try and be best friends with each person but just saying hello every now and then will help them like you more and make it easier to have them follow you.  If you still need help with leadership and having people follow along I would definitely get close with the section leaders, that way even if you have trouble expressing what you want done they can help you out with it. You can even practice giving commands with them.   Hopefully this helps."

Each year we have a theme selected by the student council when they pick the homecoming theme back in May. They selected superheroes as the theme this year so we have to purchase movie music so we get an extra few grand to spend on music. The school district is also giving us money for eight new sousas in addition to the eight new ones we would get on a yearly basis before that. So this will be a great year for us.

Depending on exactly what shoe you get with the free run sole they can range (online) anywhere from $90-$180 but I got mine at a Nike Outlet for less than $60 so they aren't necessarily ridiculously overpriced like a lot of Nike's can be. Hope that helps."

marchingband,3dglgd,drianA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, BE A GOOD LEADER.  You don't have to be the best conductor in the world, but you best try your hardest to be the best leader you can be. The key is confidence. Not a confident person? Fake it til you make it. I assure you people will respect you for that. Be compassionate, set goals, follow a plan, and communicate. Communication is so very much important. It will make or break you. Learn how to listen.   On conducting, consider it all like Maslow's Hierarchy. Clarity is the first thing you want to address. Make sure to have a clear, precise and consistent pattern. Practice your 'vanilla' patterns everyday. After that, you can address the three domains. ""How loud/how quiet, how fast/how slow, and how long/how short"". After this is addressed (with clarity in mind) you can begin adding cues and other detailed stylizations. Sit down with your score and mark important passages or parts worth noting attention. And most importantly, don't be afraid to ask your director for help.   oh yeah, and FACIAL EXPRESSIONS   Just have fun with it and don't lose sight of why you're doing it"
marchingband,3dglgd,JollyGinger93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"I second that. FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. My director would constantly drill my team (there were 3 of us) about conveying the music to the band with our faces. It's honestly more important than what you do with your left hand, whether the band knows it or not. Also, pick your battles. There'll be moments where you have to correct your best friends and be polite to other students you don't like as much. Sometimes, this leads to problems, but it's not always worth it to argue or confront the problem. It's often better to leave it to that person to work it through his or herself or to take it to your band director."

marchingband,3d71c8,Clambino,7,Tue Jul 14 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"heres a good one. we won a title by accident. We managed to win the national marching band title in spain. The rules in spain are very lax. all you have to do is get the paperwork in the day before competition. You also cant be a professional band or have any members (other than the administrative staff) employed by the government. You must also be in a consistent uniform, play music so that there is no silence at any point while performing (so unless you want a penalty if there's a rest for the whole band have the snare play quarter notes). various administrative rules to qualify and penalty rules which we all could expect from a competition. thing is that the same form for exhibition is the same for competition and our group had checked the wrong box. since there was no rule about country of origin we were allowed to compete (without our knowledge). So when it was time to do our thing we lined up on the rugby field for pregame. we did our fight song, spanish national anthem, US national anthem in place after our fast entry. then we did a scatter set for our homecoming show which was jurassic park, skyfall, cool and somewhere both from west side story. thing is with european marching bands is that they are bad, like really bad, so when our marching band which wasn't set up to compete or win a competition a day in its life (although there was a long string of state championships in the 60's when the school had a different name.) took the field and because we were an american marching band we were so much better than any of the competition that we won by over 40 points. now they have rules that no foreign marching bands can compete. Oh it was fun but God we were so damn confused when our bands name was called. oh god the whole thing was ridiculous . i'm skipping a lot of details because they require side stories for explanation but god it was fun. we all got medals (they needed about 150 more then they had prepared because 200 strong is much bigger than anything they have to offer) and we brought a trophy. and for unrelated reasons we got a plaque because the reason we were in spain was because of the kings parade and the king of spain invited us with a handwritten letter to go."

So, naturally we expected to win championships. I don't know if we got too cocky and our performance decreased, or if the other band was motivated by our win, but we lost at Championships. We felt robbed, but it definitely made us crave the win.   The next, we one about half of the competitions, and the other band (who had one the year previously) won the other half. We worked our butts off and won. It felt super great and we were proud, because we didn't feel like it was handed to us (which is probably how I would have felt if we one the year previously). And now starting up band camp for this year, you definitely can feel something. Like motivation to recreate what we had last year. The rookies picked up on this atmosphere quickly and I think we are headed for another winning season."

None of us were really expecting it because we never really were super interested in the competitive aspect of band. Winning was cool and all but not really worth it in the end as suddenly everyone got really wrapped up in winning and having the highest scores and that really ruined my last two years as everyone was always pissed and lacked any morale thinking that we were doing something wrong when our show was clearly not designed to please any judge.  However, my school's top Jazz Band won champs this year and after what was a really difficult year for everyone outside of the ensemble that night was probably one of the best nights of my life. Everyone that was there loved the music, was dedicated to the group, didn't really care how we did, and just wanted to be great overall. Also, we were all super close, and out of everything from high school that specific ensemble and group of people will probably be what I miss the most."

When I was in seventh grade, the high school band were upset at ACCs after winning 3 years in a row. They did win again my eight grade year, but we still didn't know if we could pull it off again. However, the season went fairly well, and we felt pretty good going into championships. For very complicated reasons, our band director left at the end of my freshman year and we got a new band director. That year was a lot more shakey as the upper classmen all decided to hate the new band director and gave him a really hard time. We still did manage to pull it off though. Junior year we felt pretty good the whole year. My senior year we had our biggest rival band openly say how they were better than us and they were coming for us this year. They even scored higher than us at our home show. By this point, ACCs has become sort of a joke and we never doubted that we could win, which we did with ease. We worked the hardest we had ever worked going into Calvacade Championships, and it was amazing when we beat our rival by half a point. Each time we won it was amazing, no matter if we expected it or not. The new band director we got ended up being amazing and he is really leading our band to new and better things. I am kind of jealous because this coming year they are competing in a BOA show for the first time.

marchingband,3d8ovh,Saxxymane,5,Tue Jul 14 11:07:05 2015 UTC,"I started losing weight this summer, and one of the best things you can do IMO is to count your calories. There is a wonderful app I use called my fitness pal. You input your weight, what your goal weight is, and how much you want to lose a week. You then input the food you eat and the exorcise you do and you try to stay under your daily calorie and other nutrition goals. What's great about it is that it already has the nutrition info for pretty much every food you come across. If for some reason you can't find it, you can always just enter it in for your self or use your phone to take a picture of the bar code. You can also hook it up to the pedometer in your phone to measure the calories you burn from taking steps. There are other apps from the same people like map my run, which I guess you could use in marching band to see how much you moved throughout rehearsal. Good luck!"
marchingband,3d8ovh,reduxxuderredux,2,Tue Jul 14 11:31:52 2015 UTC,Ya mfp is great but don't use the calories they give you.  http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/  use that website to find your tdee (use sedentary life style) then subtract 500 from that so you can lose a pound a week. I actually recommend you visit r/fitness   https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started  Try reading through that.  If you plan on keeping your muscle and and losing fat you should probably track your macros. Probably should be around 50-55% Protein 40% Fat 5-10% Carbs. You'll need my fitness pal to track that

If you eat like crap and march, you won't be healthy.  I've seen a few people lose weight while doing marching band, but the real reason that they lost the weight was because they changed their diet.  What I have seen though is people losing weight by doing DCI.  When you are burning that many calories, it's almost impossible to eat enough to maintain your current weight.  Diet is still the key here.  Almost everyone gains weight back after finals because they become less active, but still eat a lot like they did in the summer."

Your BD's experience may also have been with incorrectly tuned modern tenors. Early tenors (often called tri-toms, quad toms, or timp-toms for the really big ones) were generally tuned much lower than modern drums (even when they were functionally identical) and some programs never adjusted. So, your BD may be envisioning tenors that sound like higher pitched concert toms as opposed to what you'd hear from a DCI drum line.  As for numbers, marching an approximately 2/3 or 3/4 tenors-to-snares ratio is sort of ""standard,"" so 3 snares and 2 tenors or 4 snares and 2-3 tenors would be appropriate."

marchingband,3d7316,saxguy2001,-2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"Why would you use tenor drums in parades?  Parade marches should be played by one snare, one bass (preferably bottom or close to it), and one (maybe two) cymbals.  They're written for military band, not hardcore field show marching band.  Tenor drum parts aren't even written for parade marches."
marchingband,3d7316,saxguy2001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:34:41 2015 UTC,Have you ever seen DCI or a high school or college marching band? Every single DCI and marching band uses quad toms. And composers/arrangers do in fact write for quad toms.   Edit: here's my proof that arrangers write quad/tenor parts for parade and marching band songs.
marchingband,3d7316,saxguy2001,-4,Wed Jul 15 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"Don't get snarky with me asshole.  I wouldn't be anywhere close to where I am if I knew as little as you seem to presume I do.  I absolutely have tenor drums on the field.  (And by the way, I have a sneaking suspicion no DCI groups march quads as opposed to quints if you want to get that technical.  It's not worth my time to look that up, but I'd be pretty surprised if there's a sizable number of corps that still only march quads.)  And are you seriously telling me you would play any of those marches in a serious competition parade?  First of all, all of those arrangements are middle school level.  If a high school is playing them it's because they need something they can learn and memorize fast without challenging themselves.  (And remember, marching band is still a band class where the underlying goal is to learn.  That's what education is all about.)  Second, you searched ""parade music for marching band"" and of those four songs displayed at the very top, one of them isn't even meant for parade!  As for the other three, Patriotic Parade Sequence is something you give to a middle school band marching in their one parade for the year that's not good enough to handle a legit march piece (not even a grade 2 legit march piece), Disney Parade Sequence is about the same type of thing except you're not even pretending to try to give them legit parade music (or you're trying to be cute in a small time parade), and if you're gonna do Stars and Stripes Forever with a high school group do it right and do the ACTUAL Sousa version - not a watered down middle school arrangement just for the sake of having a tenor drum part.  As a director, I'd be embarrassed to give my band a watered down version of a classic like this that was originally written for band.  (As much as I'd love to conduct Lincolnshire Posy, I wouldn't give my wind ensemble a watered down version of it just so we could do it.)  If the original is too hard for you then pick another legit piece that's at a more appropriate difficulty level.  There are plenty of middle schools that find legit march pieces to play for parades, so even a struggling high school should be able to find something appropriate for them.  Now, you claim that composers and arrangers write for tenor drums, and then you only showed me proof for arrangers.  So I dare you to show me a legit march where a COMPOSER and not an arranger wrote a part for marching tenor drums.  I promise you it doesn't happen.  And I guess I should clarify, any march that you choose to learn for a parade competition is going to be a legit concert march with percussion written for snare, bass, cymbals, bells, timpani, and no marching tenor drums with the idea that it's one on a part just like if you were playing it in a concert band setting.  Though it's not uncommon in parades for two people to play the cymbals part.  And hell, if it's just a local parade for fun go ahead and write your own tenor drum parts if you want (I've even done that myself for our Christmas march), but legit marches don't have tenor drum parts.  I say that from experience as a student whose high school band competed on a circuit where every competition had a parade competition in the morning and field competition in the evening, and now as a director for a band that's much more focused on field show but still learns a legit parade march for a couple competitions.  Yeah in college the very few parades we did involved the tenor drums playing, but that's because we played our stands tunes on the street.  If you show up to a parade competition with something that's not a legit parade march and your tenor drums are playing their hearts out, nobody's gonna take you seriously.  It's akin to showing up to a wind ensemble festival with Disney medleys."

You HAVE to be on the same page as the director there.  If you're just an instructor and not the visual caption head this is unlikely, but if you're the caption head (or the head marching instructor if you don't use ""caption head"" in your band terminology) be prepared to take over a visual/drill rehearsal at any moment in case the director has to deal with something else.  Be prepared to help with or even entirely lead stretches and personal training, and make sure you're always early enough to rehearsal to be prepared and ready to start that stuff on time, rather than showing up even just on time and then getting things started late.  To add to that last one, whether or not you're getting paid (but ESPECIALLY if you're getting paid), be reliable and punctual.  Don't be flaky.  Obviously occasionally things might come up causing you to have to miss a rehearsal or maybe just be a little late, but don't make a habit of it.

marchingband,3d2uzj,Shiguray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"A situation like this sounds like positive reinforcement would do more to motivate them than negative reinforcement.  They clearly don't prioritize band the way you would like them to and really the way they need to so that they can successfully contribute to the band.  They need to be intrinsically motivated and negative reinforcement (which is much more common in most marching bands - much like sports) would likely push them away.  Instead, find reasons to compliment and praise them for their efforts and point out when they're doing well.  In other words, make them feel good about what they're doing in band.  However, don't go so over the top that it seems forced and not genuine - they'll see right through that.  With that said, if the lack of motivation continues, your band might be better off without them and finding somebody else more motivated to take their spots, even if that person is pretty much a beginner.  If these guys view themselves as irreplaceable they're gonna act as if they can do what they want and show up when they want.  If the problem persists then replace them and train somebody new who does want to be there and is motivated to learn.  Even if they're never able to play the part better than the boys you have right now, their attitude and commitment will prove to be better for the band in the long run anyway.  I'd rather have a band full of kids with less ability on average but an amazing attitude and work ethic than a band full of kids with more ability and talent on average but an attitude of the band can't survive without them and their shit don't stink.  I had that second one last year and it turned out to be a terrible season despite being one of the most overall talented groups of musicians our school had seen in quite some time.  Most of the kids with the worst attitudes weeded themselves out in December, and we had a very good and successful spring semester even though a few of the best musicians in the band quit mid-year.  Sorry for that tangent.  Long story short, dealing with poor attitudes isn't worth it.  Everybody's replaceable - if their attitude/commitment is toxic to the group, cut the fat and find somebody else to take their spot who's more motivated to put forth the necessary work and effort.  That's how the real world works anyway, so no harm in introducing those boys to it a little early if things don't improve.  Not that you'd have the authority to kick them out yourself, but the issue (and these ideas) would be worth talking about with your director.  And if you're in a situation where you're not allowed to kick anybody out, replace them anyway if their flakiness persists and make them simply be helpers taking front ensemble stuff or backdrops or props on and off the field."
marchingband,3d2xj1,fdsa4321lbp22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"Only looked at the first one at this point (and went about halfway through).  I'll start off by saying you don't have to have EVERYBODY in the band playing the ENTIRE time.  When horn is to face the entire time it can get really tiring and that can lead towards sloppy playing.  Especially when the part is extremely repetitive.  Moving on to that, that much syncopation without changing things up gets pretty repetitive, even if that's exactly what the guitar/keyboard part is in the original.  Moving on from there, one of the ways you can change things up is by giving the melody to different instruments at different times.  If I had upbeats for two minutes straight with almost nothing else I'd hate life.  That's why F Horn players hate Sousa.  On top of that, I wouldn't ever recommend having alto 1 play melody while alto 2 is on the backgrounds, especially for an extended period of time.  Don't split apart the section.  They can play something in harmony but don't give them two separate parts in a marching band or large pep band setting.  In a smaller setting where it's one on a part that's a little more acceptable, but not marching band or large pep band.  And if it's for a high school, some kids can get really uptight about what part they play, and when there's that large of a difference between what the parts play it heightens those feelings.  Lastly, and this may have been oversight copying from trombone to tenor sax, but don't have a 3-way divisi in the tenor part.  I wouldn't even recommend a 2-part divisi for tenor sax unless you were in a large band with a large tenor sax section.  And with that said about copying from the trombone part, nothing wrong with using a divisi to save space in the score by putting things into less staves, but if nearly the entire part is a divisi, I'd recommend having separate parts.  In other words, if it's a 3-part low brass divisi, that's fine for the score, but for parts do Low Brass 1, Low Brass 2, Low Brass 3 rather than just one Low Brass part with all three parts in one.  Reading that many splits becomes cumbersome."
marchingband,3d2xj1,saxguy2001,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:00:41 2015 UTC,"Just checked out the second one - there's a lot of stuff in there that's not playable or at least not practical for a marching band/pep band.  First, that break where flute/picc plays something, that's a mess waiting to happen and won't come across as loud as you want it in the stands.  And second, the 8th note thing tenor and bari sax does with low brass is another mess waiting to happen.  Straight 8th notes that fast will drag, especially for low brass given that octave jump.  Not to mention the higher note is relatively high for brass, particularly if it's for a high school.  If it's for high school then your tubas likely don't have the range to hit that note at all let alone within context, and some of the trombones will be in the same boat.  Even for the ones who can play that note, given how quick the jump is and how high that goes, they're gonna have a tough time consistently and accurately nailing that note.  Not to mention an issue for low brass AND saxes playing that is that they're gonna need somewhere to breathe."

In the first part when the background is just the upbeats, you might want to fill out those chords rather than having a unison.  The unison sounds pretty thin, AND unison would make the upbeat a whole lot more in your face than you might intend."

If all you do is arrange it for your band and your band is the only group to play it and it's not on tv or anything, you're probably safe as that's really small time.  But if any of those artists see that you put your arrangement on YouTube and decides they think you've created an illegal arrangement that you're distributing by putting it out in a place as public as YouTube then you could be in trouble.  (Illegal meaning you haven't paid for the rights to both arrange and distribute that arrangement.)

marchingband,3d099y,saxguy2001,2,Sun Jul 12 12:57:52 2015 UTC,Stuff like that is much different coming from the band director than a peer leader.
marchingband,3d099y,TubaJesus,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:00 2015 UTC,This involves a story that's before my time (like early 70's so it was a few decades before I was even born but it's a good story). There was this student (let's call him billy) who had similar behaviors to wasn't you are describing. Thing that made things bad for billy was that rehearsals had point values attached to them (like five points). So at the end of rehearsal our section leader would notify the BD if someone in the section did not deserve the points for showing up. So every Tuesday night billy would show up for practice and goof off and billy didn't get his points. He failed band three years in a row (probably a more extreme case than what you are dealing with). School policy is you can fail two classes and you can still graduate more then that and you have to make up the failed classes in the equivalence years. The way it was written up was that he had failed three different classes three different grade levels so he needs three years to make up the difference. He graduated when he was 21. So if your rehearsals are worth points see if you can negate them if the kid behaves badly.

marchingband,3d099y,saxguy2001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"To everybody who's continuing to recommend punishment (especially despite the fact that the original poster said that's not an option): Punishment isn't the only way to change the behavior.  This is an issue of the freshman kid not having respect both for the activity and for the section leader.  If the section leader attempts to punish the kid that's NOT going to develop any sort of respect if the kid has not yet bought in to the activity - all it does is make matters worse.  You can't punish somebody who has no respect for you and expect it to make things better.  It doesn't work that way.  And any sort of embarrassment in front of everybody is gonna have the same negative effect.  In this case, the section leader needs to pull the kid aside and away from everybody else during a break or outside of rehearsal to find out what's up.  Doing it away from everybody else is more tactful.  And remember, that's not the time for a power trip, that's the time for showing respect and maturity in figuring out how to remedy the situation to work towards a common goal.  You don't earn respect without also giving respect.  If that doesn't work, then the band director is gonna need to have a talk with him about the attitude.  And the director CAN talk to him more sternly because the director is the professional who has gone through extensive training to earn that position and will have much more experience to back it up (and is the teacher who controls the program and the kid's grade) and will automatically command more respect right off the bat."

Well at this point, I don't think his ability (whatever level it's at) should have any bearing on the situation.  It sounds to me like the entire issue is about attitude and respect.  Doesn't matter how talented a person is, if their attitude sucks and they're not showing any respect to their leaders (or especially staff) that's a problem that needs to be addressed immediately.  This past year we were plagued with a few highly talented students in leadership positions having terrible attitudes.  It sunk our fall season, they quit band during winter break, and the rest of the year was outstanding.  It's not worth dealing with continued poor attitudes no matter the talent level."

Retain a optimistic, but professional attitude. Perhaps have your friend talk to him personally and ask why he doesn't take things seriously and why he is here wasting everyone's time. Don't get headed, no matter their response. Make it where they feel like an outsider if the misbehaving continues. If it gets unbearable, notify your director"

My freshman year, we were allowed to issue laps around the track or push ups for people misbehaving. Ah the good old days. Then all that happened with the hazing incident with that college band down in Florida. So when I was section leader, if you misbehaved and didn't heed my warning, you bet your sweet ass you were pushing my vibraphone up the hill to the practice field. Is there any task within your section that everyone hates or avoids because it's either taxing or just plain annoying? Start assigning that to those who act up. Get the band director in on it.

It is probably 200 feet, but you only need 150 or so. We also have poles with lines of tape for every step. These are 8 steps long.   First you extend the string the length of a field. Ours is marked on the string, which I would suggest doing. Then you paint along that. After that, you measure out 90 degrees on both sides, use the string, and paint a tiny bit (only needs to be 25 feet or so, just long enough to use to continue a straight line). Then you go along the line and measure out 8 steps each way, connect the 2 points with the string, and paint. We also have marks on the string for the hashes so we just do them on the way out. We keep making lines every 8 steps. Once your sidelines end, overlap the string with part of the existing one so you know it is straight and make some more. Keep going until you are at 100 yards.   The endzones are 10 feet deep, so if you are using those, measure 16 steps.   I would ask in /r/drumcorps to see if anyone has any tips to make it go quicker. They need to do it just about every day, so they probably have a ton of experience."

What I have don't is the thanksgiving day parade (where I managed to destroy a sousaphone and before you ask don't bother unless you want a long story) and the parade of the three kings in Spain. Those parades will be long. Like greater than four miles long. This means you want to have everything memorized (even if you don't have to, do it) we were marching for greater than three hours plus an hour just waiting for step of while at attention, you will be in pain and you will want to know your music and cadences by muscle memory. So work on endurance, it will be your best friend as you will be spending a long time marching. You will also have a blast, you will probably have time to explore the city yourself so experience their culture. Stay away from the Golden Arches and before you go get a Rick Steves book from a library or a book store (specifically the book on Great Britain or England depending on the copyright year) the book will cover all the things you absolutely must see (probably part of your bands tour group) things to do if you have more than a few days (some of this you may see because it's part of your tour group package). Basically it has all the stuff you should see and what's not really worth the time. This is a prestigious thing, even more so  than winni a BOA national championship title so take pride in it. Also European marching bands are sub par to most a,erican marching bands (this excludes the millitRy bands) so feel free to show off when it's ti,e for step off. This is an a,aging thing to do so make the best of it as it won't come again.   Edit came back to check on things and saw the song list. I would say hey baby, purple haze, and shake it off would be the favorites. Those are already popular tunes in England and would be easy hits with the crowd. I hope you aren't playing more than three songs. That would be difficult to memorize, especially since the first time you will actually know the route is when you are doing it."

If there was one piece of advice I could give you, it would be to occasionally look up at the surrounding buildings during the parade, London is absolutely stunning, and your being given a rare street view of the whole town. I would honestly prioritize enjoying the parade more than perfect playing/marching. Most of the Londoners are just excited to see you and they don't pay that much attention to the performance itself.   Another thing I would suggest is bringing ALOT of warm clothing. During the parade it was easy to forget about the cold, but the rest of the time it was pretty horrible (especially because I'm from Texas). Many layers of clothing, especially around the feet and hands, are crucial.   One last thing I would suggest doing is to plan where you will eat and visit while you're there. I'm assuming that you will have some free time to pick and choose where you will go in small groups or whatnot, so communicate with them ahead of time and try to research where you want to go. Most restaurants in London can't fit a bunch of people without a long wait, so be prepared.  Anyways have lots of fun! Any of those pop tunes should do fine honestly, as I said the crowd are just happy to see you guys. Goodluck!"

marchingband,3crdww,vain_turtle,3,Fri Jul 10 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"I recently went on a trip to San Diego because my high school band got invited to play at the Holiday Bowl (we also went to Sea World, Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo, the USS Midway, and stayed in a hotel. Total cost for each individual was around $1200). It's an experience like absolutely none other, and I'd imagine it would be better at the Sugar Bowl because it's a bigger game, one of the college playoff games iirc now that they switched to that system.  ANYWAYS what our band did, instead of flying, we took 5 buses. It'll save you all so much money, depending on how far you live from your destination. Luckily, we live in Kansas so it was only about a 26 hour bus ride (it's my favorite bus ride in high school thus far, I'm just a sucker for long bus rides I guess). Our band sells ""band cards"" to the people of our town. They cost $10 but you can use them at businesses that sponsor us directly for some pretty good discounts. We're a band of about 230 kids this year (before the quitters leave). If all 230 members sold 10 band cards, for $10 each, how much money is that, you ask? If I did my math right, that's $23,000!  We also sell fruit through a food service. I'm not very fond of this one, so I can't tell you much about it. Basically, this family has been involved with the band since their first son joined like 8-10 years ago, long before my time. The patriarch of this family works for this food service company, and decided that he could help out the band by sponsoring us for increased sales and whatnot. I don't like this fundraiser. It's kinda like jump rope for heart, only you're giving people a catalog of various foods and soups for them to buy, and they don't get any of it until about 3 months later, and YOU have to deliver it.  Then there's trashbags. This is where we make our bank. Who doesn't need trashbags? I'm not sure exactly on the cost because I've never participated in any fundraising for the band yet (I'm a Junior, and quite frankly, I hate fundraising, but I'm starting to open up to it and hopefully pay for a trip to Music For All next year). The trash bags we sell are durable, plentiful, and are of various sizes. We also offer an industrial roll of 75 for yard work and whatever else you may need such a large trash bag for. This is where the money's at, I tell you.  To pay for whatever costs we had left in gas for our trip, we held a march-a-thon. Literally. You were supposed to take pledges from people for how many laps you could march (roll-step, not walk. We're pretty serious about that) around a track, playing various pep tunes, our fight song, I'm sure the drumline did our cadence a few times, I wasn't there because I was sick. Anyways, one student alone raised over $1000 and paid for the band truck's gas entirely on his own. That amazed me.  So yea, that's pretty much all we do for our fundraising, here in Dodge City, Kansas. In a town of about 30,000 people, we do well. Really, having more support for your band can help exponentially. We don't get recognized for what we have done in the past 15 years, and budget cuts are really screwing us over. Just look anywhere for fundraising opportunities, and I'm sure you'll make the money you need. Good luck, and please, when you get to the Sugar Bowl, update!

Some of my friends were excellent teachers that didn't want to teach anymore.  It sucks, it's not fair and no good teacher feels good about leaving a position and kids that they love. Sometimes it's the best thing for us to do for our spouses and kids and lives."
marchingband,3cg53u,becca-music,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"To add to this, sometimes a dream job type of job becomes available, too, that they simply can't pass up.  Or sometimes they may love the students but they're stuck in a bad work environment with administration and/or co-workers that they simply need to get away from as soon as another decent job comes along."
marchingband,3cg53u,iplaydrooms,2,Wed Jul 8 07:41:53 2015 UTC,"Hi. I have two tidbits.   First, I had a band director die, so I understand the feeling of loss (yours may actually be worse, because your band director chose to leave, while mine obviously did not). We mourned. We got a new director. We didn't like him at first because he wasn't our old director. And then with time we grew to know him and love him and he is still a mentor of mine now. So with time, you, too, shall heal.   Second, I went on to become a band director. For various, complicated reasons I resigned in the middle of the school year. It had nothing to do with my students, and certainly was not because I didn't care for them deeply. I still think about them. But it was a decision that I had to make for myself and I don't regret it. So know that your band director did not do it out of malice or for any personal reason. It was probably a choice that a lot of thought went into and was the right choice for him/her.  I hope either of these are a little bit helpful. Good luck!"
marchingband,3cg53u,mikert3,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing. My band director resigned and moved back to his home town to teach at his old highschool. My best advice is to give your new director a fair chance and be open to how they want to run things. With our new director it took 3 years to get rid of all the negative feelings and lack of effort. You may not agree with the new directors way of doing stuff, but understand its just as hard for them to go into a new school and set up their program than it is for you. Do your best to be open to the new direction the program may go, and try to stay away from ""Well that's not how Mr. _____ did it"" or ""Well we used to"". Just accepting the new ways of things makes the transition so much easier"
marchingband,3cg53u,BeyondTheFail,2,Tue Jul 7 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"My band director had resigned our first marching band practice a few weeks ago. We were all distraught, but we are making it. We are relying on our fellow band members and other staff members for support. Sometimes things like this happen, not because everyone wants them to happen but because they need to. It will be alright I promise you."
marchingband,3cg53u,saxguy2001,2,Tue Jul 7 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"Not quite the same thing, but my band director got fired just before band camp in senior year. Let me run you through the process that I went through.   That feeling of ""Wait...the fuck just happened? What's going to happen with camp?"" That moment of ""Wait, the old director was an asshole!"" When we eventually got a director again (which wasn't until the school year began, we were running on drill instructor and drum majors for prep for the season), we were concerned that his style wouldn't help us go for year 8 of Division 1 rankings for MSBOA. Even more concern when we were being pushed a little more toward MCBA rankings. We did 2 shows for MCBA that year, which was exhausting. Relief when we actually scored in the 60s for MCBA and got our 8th Division 1 rating at MSBOA. Excitement when he actually acknowledged that some of us were decent, and that he was trimming the fat from Wind Symphony (our top group, which had some slackers that just happened to audition well in it).    So, my experience may be a little different, but remember to breathe. You'll be okay."
marchingband,3cg53u,BeyondTheFail,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:09 2015 UTC,How did the band director get fired at that point in the year?  Something illegal going on?

marchingband,3cg53u,super_duper_14,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:34:23 2015 UTC,"Damn.  15 will get you 20.  I remember the semester I started student teaching, we had to go through a week's worth of meetings at the university before we actually went to the school we were student teaching at.  No more than five minutes into the first meeting on day one the person speaking said it's sad and disgusting that she even had to mention it and remind us, but do not fool around in any way with your students.  And it's especially sad as a high school band director that it seems like it's high school band directors more often than anybody else doing this and getting caught.  I've personally known two people who are now in jail for that.  Actually, the first guy may be out by now, it was in either 2005 or 2006 and I heard he got 12 years but could get out in 8 with good behavior.  We worked at a summer band camp together.  I was just a dorm councilor and he was the instructor who was doubling as the staff member in charge at the dorms since he was staying there, too.  He was adamant about not allowing any of the campers into your dorm room, yet he'd let his former students (high school age - he taught middle school) into his room all the time.  Sure enough, he got popped the following school year.  Second guy could be in for a long while - he was secretly video taping girls getting completely naked to change, and since they were underage that means he had child porn on his computer.  Creepy part for me in particular was maybe about a week before the story broke, he emailed me to ask about getting an arrangement for his band of something I had arranged a few years earlier for the college band we had been associated with.  I didn't feel comfortable just giving him the arrangement as is (it was done for a college band and they were a very small and struggling high school band) and I had no interest (or time) in putting in the necessary work to create a playable arrangement for him and his band.  Not to mention the copyright issues since the paperwork I signed for the college band said that the arrangement was to be used only by that band.  Anyway, now I'm really glad I said no about that arrangement."
marchingband,3cg53u,Kanotari,2,Thu Jul 9 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"I just went through the same situation. My band starts practice around early June and I had looked forward to seeing my funny, generally awesome band director handing us our music.   Instead, I was greeted by an awesome person and band teacher whom I really like so far. He seems to know what we need to do but also is pretty strict about getting stuff done. I thought I wouldn't have a teacher as good as my past band director but I was mistaken. I guess all we can do is keep an open mind and hope for the best. Have a good season!"
marchingband,3cg53u,Kanotari,2,Tue Jul 7 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"1) It's not you; it's them. Maybe your band director found a better job, or had a fight with the administration, or needed to move for family reasons. We do it all the time, but it doesn't mean that it is our students' faults. God, it's miserable tearing yourself away from your students.  2) Keep in touch. If your old director isn't moving too far away, get a group of students to go to the new schools' concerts, and see if the director's new students will come to yours. Set up a sister school programs. Some of my marching techs work together at another school that we compete against. So we have our students do events together, hang out at competitions together. Plus we can pool our funds for master classes and do more of them... I'm seeing some really good friendships come out of it.  3) Be open to change. Your new director is not your old director. He will do at least some things differently. There are experiences to be had from good and bad directors. In fact, surviving a terrible director was what set me down the path to becoming a band director, and taught me more than directors I loved. No matter who you get, give them a chance to teach you something."
marchingband,3cg53u,mastertegm,2,Wed Jul 8 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"It was an argument with administration. I am mostly worried about the change. I don't know how to accept it, everyone is saying be open to change but I got so used to it."
marchingband,3cg53u,Kowalski12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:37:03 2015 UTC,"Well I can't speak for everyone else, but what I mean when I say to be open to change is this. If your new director asks you to try something, don't say ""Our old director did it this way."" Directors love having fellow directors come into our classes and work with our bands because our students learn new things, and so do we. We pick up great teaching techniques from each other all the time. So maybe whatever this new director comes up with will be really good, just different.   It sucks when non-student drama gets in the way. Sorry that your director had to leave because of administration troubles. It's really not fair to the students."
marchingband,3cg53u,jaxson25,2,Wed Jul 8 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think the worst part is you could tell our director felt horrible, he was crying and apologizing while saying it was the hardest decision of his career. I really hope we can accept the new director."
marchingband,3cg53u,Spellersuntie,2,Wed Jul 8 01:02:51 2015 UTC,Be positive! Situations like this are always much better if the student body can find a way to have a good attitude about it.
marchingband,3cg53u,Ass_Masster,2,Wed Jul 8 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"Our school had a history of band directors leaving and getting fired and replaced. It's strange to look at our struggling (but improving) program now, but see old pictures of the hundreds of kids that used to be involved. We have a bunch of trophies, most from the times when we were more stable, constantly reminding us of what we can aspire to be.   Be the person you want your band to be. Talk to your band's leadership about continuing routine, don't let things slip through your fingers. Our seniors led the way to organizing practices and leading class when our band director quit, because they didn't want to relive their freshman year of a crumbling program when their past director had to leave them. Don't lose hope, even if your band director had embodied the spirit of the band, try to embody that in yourself, and encourage that in your band mates. So, in a list order:  -Don't lose hope.  -Encourage and uplift others in your band.  -Organize with your band's council or leadership group to continue the regular schedule of practices and those who will lead class.  -Talk to your principal or councilor about getting a new band director, and see if the band parents or students can get involved in choosing a good one.  -Use this opportunity to bring closeness and teamwork between all members of your band. Through this loss find strength and a tighter bond with your band mates."
marchingband,3cg53u,darthjoey91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:40:31 2015 UTC,"welcome to the club buddy. My program has a nasty habit of losing directors. in the 7 years we've gone through 5 directors. that's just high school. the middle school I went to has been through 4 directors in those same 7 years. as you would expect things have never been very stable in our band. lots of infighting, lots of trust issues, lots of suspicion of the new directors. This year our last director put his foot down and didn't leave without any warning just before band camp. he told us we would be leaving before the school year ended, explained why (family and the like) expressed how bad he felt for leaving us, and worked his ass off to make sure we got a director this year who would stay. our new director is local, has experience, and is all around a really cool guy. but still, it always sucks to see a director leave.  my big advice is to make sure your band doesn't get all defensive and shut the new guy out. We've always had that problem (for obvious reasons) but this year us in leadership took steps to prevent it. We got leadership together and met with the new director just the other day to work out what kind of director he was, what to expect from him, we told him what our band was like and what he could expect from us, we told him what we recommend he do and we made a list of things he could not touch. The biggest thing to keep in mind is that your new director DID NOT KICK YOUR OLD ONE OUT. Do not blame them for your director leaving and make sure they have you by their side during this whole ordeal. It's just as awkward and difficult for them to come into a new program and have to run it if not more. They don't want to fuck up and having the students and ESPECIALLY leadership on their side is the only way you can make the experience a positive one.  Best of luck to you, your program, and your new director."

Lots of kids won't offer them the respect they deserve, especially in high school, and try to test them or push them. Weather or not its their first real job, or fourth decade in the business, no one winds up as a band director unless its their passion. So try to encourage your friends to make it pleasurable for them and have everyone get along."
marchingband,3cg53u,logics8,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:35:41 2015 UTC,"When I graduated high school, the band director that had been there for like 30 years retired, kind of like something out of Mr. Holland's Opus. Since then, they had a terrible director who nearly killed the band, a director straight out of college who is now going back to college, and now a guy who graduated high school the year after me. All of this to say, new band directors bring a lot of changes. If there are any traditions that are truly band traditions, the only way they're going to be kept alive is by involved parents and upperclassmen. Most band directors are good, and want what is best for the program. So they probably won't be like the director that my school had that dropped the ball."

BUT, as long as everyone keeps an open mind and to not ignore or turn down the new director just because the old one never did things that way.

The most important thing you can do is SUPPORT YOUR NEW DIRECTOR. He/She is just as nervous as you guys - if not, more. Have your leadership team be there 24/7, willing to help. Make sure to never tell him in public, however, that 'that's not how we used to do it'. That can be a little humiliating and degrading. If you have a question or complaint, make sure to bring it to him in a private setting, because they might just not have known, or perhaps they had something new in mind.

I can't stand watching drum majors who narcissisticly add ""flair"" to their conducting style just to personalize it and try to look flashy at the expense of doing nothing to help the band (which is your primary objective).  You're DIRECTING the band, not creating your own choreography to the music to impress the audience or judges.  So yeah, make your conducting style clean and legible.  And I'll add in have a solid sense of time and tempo and you'll be good.  Once you've got those down, THEN you can start thinking about style, but only in a sense of conveying style and emotion to the rest of the band through your conducting pattern."

Pick your tempo and stick with it. That's a band directors first and most obvious clue that you're following the band when you slow down fast. .  If they refuse to follow you, cut off. Have a good place or two ready to start in places your band has trouble keeping time.  A good style to go for is whatever style your last dm had. Whatever it does, you don't want any extra motions - it may seem like flowy will make you stand out, and it will, but not in the way you or your director wants."

Personally as a clear easy to read and to follow stand point just the straight forward arrow formation is the best. Sooooo you don't want to the the Blue Devils style. It's just kinda weird to me. Often confusing to the eye to anyone who isn't use to it and in my opinion harder to do correctly.   Practice with a metronome always and get really comfortable and cozy with tempos of all ranges. Make sure the down beat is hitting your ictus at the same exact time the met sounds. Stay on beat with the met it's really easy to speed up with out you even realizing it. Keep that same mind set when auditioning.   If in your audition you can't use a met. Keep a steady tempo and stick to it.   Over all just be really confident with yourself and always remember to BREATH.

If you're going for a more dramatic approach, try Song For Lyndsay by Andrew Boysen Jr. It's somewhat difficult, but mostly doable (4/4 & 3/4 time, with a few bars of 5/4), but this one needs a lot of feeling, so it's good for cueing soloists and crescendos and decrescendos.

It always made section members feel special, you know? I always looked forward to it, anyway."

Basically, you need to make every member of your section feel that the role they play is just as important as every other member in the band, regardless of seniority, etc. I always though of show scores as an average of the performance of all the members of the ensemble, and that's what I used to shape some of my ideas."

Those are teachers in the United States primarily that run these programs. This subreddit is primarily students who are part of the program. You would ask us about various styles or would look to find shows of competition bands. Since you are in Australia and there are probably no gridiron football games you are probably forming a parade band or a competition band which means you want to use a roll step. If you are creating a band solely for a sporting event such as a soccer (football for you Aussies) game then as high step may get a better reaction from the crowd.  But to get money for drums you need to do fundraising. Weather you are washing cars or selling baked goods. You are in an interesting spot as you are not part of a school district or partnered with a municipality. That's something you would want to look into, if you partner with a municipality and you adopt its name then they mat give you some money to purchase things you need."

marchingband,3bxd92,TubaJesus,2,Sat Jul 4 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"That is a difficult question to answer. There is no formula to get people interested in a marching band (different types of bands will need slightly different advertising styles). I personally dont know the culture of Australia (IE do schools have marching bands or if they have any real popularity) to give a solid answer but an educated guess is better than nothing.  Local school band directors may be a good way to get referrals. As I understand it, it is the middle of your school year so you may be able to get band directors to make an announcement in class and put a sign up on a bulletin board in the classroom or something. Thing is that any good teacher won't send students out without knowing something about you. You will probably have to email them asking for a meeting or something to that effect.  Things like marching experience (which to me is an interesting question because i don't believe Australia was big on marching bands), leadership positions in a marching band, where you marched, how recently was it.  That would probably be just the beginning, if you get a meeting at all they will probably grill you on various issues to make sure you aren't a perv or something.   Next you may want to talk to private lesson teachers. They probably have less strict rules on those matters and may be more easy to sway. You could do the cliche tactic of putting up fliers in public places such as town halls, bulletin boards in secondary schools (you may have some laws preventing that one but my high school had a bulletin board that people could just place advertisements on), and advertise on the internet.   Take all of that with an extra grain of salt because i have no familiarity with the laws way down under."

I'd suggest that you spend at least a year on the administrative staff of an existing group. Running an ensemble is a very hard job.   If you do go ahead with it, start really small. A polo shirt and black pants is an acceptable uniform for a new group. You also shouldn't worry too much about the instruments you use. If people have their own instruments, let them use them. If you need to go out and buy them, go for cheaper stuff (although not too cheap like $100 horns, those will fall apart quickly). Same thing with drums, you don't need anything special or even new. Heck, I'd suggest starting out with just a horn line. If you do go with drums, keep it small. A 1-2 snares and basses is okay to start out with.   Money is the most important thing you need. Until you get stabilized, try to keep expenses to a minimum. No paid staff, minimal purchases. For the most part, you should only perform in events that make you money. Many places will pay you to perform. Look for cities that don't have their own marching band that have parades, corporate meetings, festivals, etc. that will pay you to perform. The goal should be for whatever you get paid to exceed your travel costs. Apply for every single grant and sponsorship you can find.   Make sure you take care of your equipment. Anyone who touches a horn should have gloves on, no exceptions. Make people sign agreements holding them responsible for damage to their instrument while it is in their possession. Make sure everyone knows how to take care of their instrument.  Td;lr a musical ensemble like you are making is a business. Keep your costs low and try to get as much income as possible from outside sources."

marchingband,3bxd92,ZZZ_YYY_ZZZ,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"Try and get grants and scholarships. Grants are usually companies or government groups that offer money to small groups. This is usually to make them look good. Companies want to be able to say ""look at us supporting music education!"".  Sponsorships are the same, only you need to earn the money by promoting the sponsor when you perform (flyers, logo placement, etc.).   Once you get to performing, try to find performances where you get paid. Some things will obviously be unpaid and will just be for the fun of performing and to promote your group, but you can get paid gigs. The group I play in has earned money from playing in certain competitions (make sure you pick them carefully, some will pay you and some will leech money from you) and from playing at company events.   Member fees should also help, but shouldn't be too high. A good rule I saw somewhere is that every $50 a member pays should get them at least 1 performance and 8 hours of instruction in rehearsal.   If there are local music events that will draw a similar audience (such as a school band event, not a rock concert), try to set up there and promote yourself. Obviously ask for permission first. Also make sure you are working social media. Facebook, Twitter, etc. Once you get a small ensemble started, it should get easier. Once you get a group that can stand on their own (I'd say at least 1 tuba, 1 baritone/trombone, and one trumpet at the very least), you can play in public while promoting yourself. Have flyers ready and hand them out. At the very least, people will remember you and have a positive opinion of you (for example if someone asks). At best, you might get people to join from that (which I've seen multiple times). You also have the advantage of more people to help recruit. The executive staff (at this point most likely just you) will do most of the work, but you are now a team. Other members will probably try to recruit their friends on their own (although I'd still suggest it to them) as it helps the ensemble and it lets them play with their friends."

If you have wire snares (twisted wires that look like stretched out springs,) then you almost certainly have pipe band snare drums.   Do your drums look just like this? Note the snare strainer with no throw-off or butt. Here is another page with a bottom view.  If this is what you have then you have pipe band snares, which should also have a set of wire snares directly underneath the batter head. If these are your drums then they will always use the wire snares."

You have experience playing at a higher level than these students do and you can show off some of those skills, but it's more important that you are able to guide them on technique and playing as a group.  I've employed several instructors that were talented musicians, but lacked in the instruction department and my students didn't do well for them.

marchingband,3bjcyf,KipzOfTheMud,4,Tue Jun 30 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"Clearly, it's the baritone.   Let us examine the sex appeal of the baritone. It's big, it's loud, it's made of brass. Its tones are deep, yet its sound is beautiful. From the moment it emerges from its case, and you first hear its gentle growl, you realize that the only word to describe this instrument is ""masculine"".   The baritone player is not, however, macho. He is self-confident, assured that he is doing the right thing. Whereas a trumpet can be described as a Camaro (fast, loud, cool), the baritone is more like a Rolls-Royce Phantom. Classy yet unassuming on the outside, the baritone hides raw power under the hood.   (I can't stop laughing)  The baritone player carries the heaviest instrument on the field, except for the sousaphone. Unlike the sousaphone, however, the baritone must be held up entirely with the arms, with no support from the rest of the body. As a result, baritone players often have beautifully toned biceps and powerful forearms. If you need a jar opened, ladies, come to one of us.   Additionally, the baritone player often displays an affinity for push-ups and other acts of physical fitness. Though these activities may take place in public, they are not used to show off to other sections. (Okay, maybe just a little bit) While others may do push ups exclusively for that reason, every time you see a baritone player doing push ups, you can be assured that he is doing five more than he did last time.   There are few things more impressive than a line of baritones marching down the street, simultaneously putting their horns up, and playing panic station. Ladies love us, and you should too.

I'm not saying you should spoil them or give special treatment, but that if they feel a sense of camaraderie and respect, things become so much easier. Be their officer on the field, and the friend after practice. Also, after bowing to pressure from a subordinate, it can be hard for you to get them to listen, but it can be done. Every section has its problem students, don't let them walk over you, don't provoke them, and don't let them make you angry.

Please do  I recently got back from a 4 day section leader leadership academy. I've also got a moody freshman, I'm the ring leader of the brass and section leader of tubas. But anyways, what I'd do is across the floors. Take your car or someone who has a car and play music with a good tempo. Then go from one end of the field to the other. You can use sticks for a tempo but sometimes the music is more fun. Anyways we have a foot ball field then a practice field. The practice field is just a parking lot with lines drawn on it. The lines have faded completely on one side. So the point is they are forced to guide to each other when the lines disappear. You could also take a piece of cardboard and put it on there left side of there head. Then say ""this is what it's like for those awesome contra players"" then they'll realize that they can see, then hopefully dress. Also maybe take one by one to the side and hold your hands next to your eyes. Then have 1 person on each side holding a certain number of fingers up. Then ask the person in the middle what numbers they're holding up, if they get it right then that means they can dress, and you just have to apply it on the field.  Now for attitude, I have the most annoying sophomore, first year marcher. He's constantly bringing the horn up at the last second or while he's supposed to be playing. I was told at my camp to just lead by example. So if I get my horn up early then he'll follow. Basically compliment one flute that isn't whiny then hopefully they'll catch on and say ""I want to be complimented"" Also NEVER say a run through was good EVER!!! Because you're reaching for the car and once they reach it the won't let go. So they stay at that level of playing or marching. You don't want that, you want them to be great, not good. So raise the bar every time they get close. That's all I have, you can ask me anymore questions if you'd like"

Practice without instruments, then without playing, then with playing scales. Also, make sure they know you're proud of them for having the music down. Praise, discipline, praise does actually work.  If you didn't gain their respect from the beginning, ask what you can do to get it and do that. Communicate like people, not like a leader with followers. Attitudes stem from lack of respect. When you have their respect, it comes from having a bad day. So ask them how their day went.  At the end of the day, ask for feedback: have them tell you something they did well, and something they could work on, then you tell them 2 different things. That way they have 2 reasons to feel they've made progress, and 2 things to think about at the next rehearsal.  Above all else, remember that this is high school, and that everyone wants to feel respected."
marchingband,3bh6ly,jeanewt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:16 2015 UTC,We ran into this problem last year while practicing one of our shows. Our BD saw it was just the flutes messing up so he took us back to band camp in a way and we just ran basic field maneuvers for the whole two hour practice. My dad decided it was a good idea to record the thing if your interested in looking at it but the idea is that you do the same thing over and over until they get it right. It may take hours of work but it will be worth it.  Edit: word choice fix

Every section has a fatal flaw or combination of flaws that cause issues. I would recommend outside (of normally scheduled) practicing and negative reinforcement - March them in a line while playing a basic scale and everybody runs a lap if someone steps out. A small lap I mean - like around a small building.  Also impart tips about guiding to diagonals and other stuff

marchingband,3bfve9,ATMRN,2,Fri Jul 3 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"It is extremely hard to compare HBCU bands and other college marching bands the style is so different.  I've seen Morgan State and Ohio U in person, and I liked Morgan State better (mainly because of the park and bark/dancing in every song thing the 110 does).  But still, it is very hard to compare the two.  That said, both bands were incredibly nice and great to hang out with."
marchingband,3bfve9,Turducken4You,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, It took me a while to make this list because of that very reason. If you think of Corps : Tenn,USC,MICH,FL ST. and other Show style :BCU, Grambling,Talledega.  Leaving all those great bands out of this list is hard. A lot of schools are restricted by tradition, and because of that its only so much they can do to be creative and entertaining. So my biggest thing was, ""What do you do inside the restriction of your tradition to be as entertaining as possible. Thats why Ohio State amazes me so much. Look at the style of B1G bands, and look at what they do with the burden of being one, its amazing. This is a huge problem for SEC bands, which I think could be much better."
marchingband,3bbpgx,Pikcube,9,Sat Jun 27 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"Try making sure you're getting your toes up as high as you can and really focusing on the ""roll"" aspect of the roll step. Your ultimate goal is to turn your normal step into something that more resembles a wheel than anything else. It should be completely circular and your upper body should feel more like you're ice skating or sliding on a wood floor with socks than walking. Also, it will definitely help to make sure you engage your abdominals and tighten up the core at all times to ensure your upper body stays perfectly still. If you're still bouncing, you might want to check and make sure that you aren't putting your heel down too hard or making a stomping motion as that could jostle your upper body considerably. At the end of the day, some upper body motion is going to occur simply do to the fact that human bodies aren't machines, you just have to make sure you limit that movement to be as little and infrequent as possible to ensure that it doesn't affect your playing or be too obvious to judges or the audience. Hope that helps"
marchingband,3bbpgx,Blarf_,7,Sat Jun 27 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"With our rookies at band camp, we'll put neon green duct tape on the balls of their shoes. We write ""HI"" on one foot and ""MOM"" on the other, and we make sure we can see ""HI, MOM, HI, MOM"" while they march."
marchingband,3bbpgx,Leprechaun_exe,2,Sat Jun 27 21:02:48 2015 UTC,That's fantastic. I'm seriously going to suggest this to my band director who is never satisfied with toes no matter how high we get them.

marchingband,3bbpgx,meannoodle,2,Sun Jun 28 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"I roll step too. I'm a 6'4"" trumpet player so I think I'm in the requirements for ""tall""  Emphasize the ROLL in roll step. While on your heel, your toe should be pretty much pointing straight up (or as close to that as comfortable). As you transition to the toe, make sure you ROLL to the outside of the foot (the side of the foot pointing away from the inside of your body). You must take this to the extreme. Chances are, you aren't going far enough outside. Then you transition to your toe the exact way backwards from heel to outside.   Just rinse and repeat that process.  I know you probably know all of this but it's good to remind yourself of the basics."
marchingband,3bbpgx,LionsOfDavid,2,Sat Jun 27 22:49:49 2015 UTC,"I dealt with this when I marched and I have a technique that I teach my corps kids and other students as well. While what others have posted is very valuable information, I believe they are missing something rather important.   A lot of the 'bounce' you're getting can be fixed more with posture and engaging your core. Unfortunately it's very difficult to explain via text, but imagine separating your body into 2 hemispheres, the upper hemisphere should feel like a constant glide when you're moving. Lift out of your hips, make yourself feel 7' tall and see if this doesn't help."
marchingband,3bbpgx,Mahlerbro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:29:15 2015 UTC,as someone had said crank your toes sky high. i had a issue where i would sway left and right. my fix was don't break concentration on marching. i will stop playing and focus on marching/drill if it becomes a bit much for me to manage. this past year we had to learn roll step because the district thought that the chair stepping would make the new turf field deteriorate much faster. thankfully next year we will do some chair stepping again.
marchingband,3bbpgx,TubaJesus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"I play Sousaphone as well. Make sure your steps are more out and up than just up. My knees used to hit my instrument all the time. Also, practice marching in front of a mirror. Upper body must not move, at all. After watching my friends from the OSU band, I feel ashamed of my marching, but remember youre one in a hundred, and if you move a little most people wont notice. Good luck and dont drop your mouth piece!"
marchingband,3bbpgx,begendluth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:12:23 2015 UTC,"Although I am not tall, many people suffer from this same issue. I have spent years of both marching and teaching marching technique. It took many of these years and lots of frustration to realize this, but the issue rarely comes down to toe height. In fact, the issue usually comes from the back leg. What is probably happening is you are pushing up with your back leg rather than engaging the muscles and pushing forward/the direction of travel. This causes you to ""plop"" back down on your front heel rather than creating a smooth transition to the other leg. Much of marching must be about the back leg and the function it plays. The movement of the body actually comes from this back leg and not ""reaching the sky with your front toe."" While a decent toe height is helpful to not fall down, many people cheat to get a high toe by leaning back. When this weight transfers, a bounce may occur.   Another just as important component to marching technique is engaging your core muscles. As /u/Mahlerbro said, this causes a separation between your lower body and upper body so your upper body is on a level playing field. I don't tend to recommend engaging the ab muscles as much as some others as I have found this ""tightening up"" comes through in the sound, especially of a brass instrument. Remember as important as marching technique is, this technique has been primarily developed for one function, that is better sound on the field."
marchingband,3bbpgx,Mahlerbro,2,Sun Jun 28 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"This guy hit the nail on the head. The same is true on backwards technique, except the opposite. You have to think about pushing yourself, not pulling. I see this issue a lot with young bands.  The kids drop 4"" when they switch from a forward movement to a backwards movement. They sink down, bend at the knees and use their back leg to pull them backward instead of straightening out, and lifting off of that front leg.  Once you realize how much power you have at your disposal when you use the proper technique, you'll hate that you spent so long doing it wrong. This didn't happen for me until my second season of drum corps and life got so much easier after that."
marchingband,3bbpgx,SoaringRooster8,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with being tall. As a 6'5"" tuba player I can say I shared this problem with our shortest tuba player. We fixed it by using our right elbows to lift the tuba off our hips to stabilize it and practiced our marching technique."
marchingband,3bchnf,Leprechaun_exe,6,Sat Jun 27 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"For my HS band when I was in it, we had a day set aside about halfway through the camp for section bonding. We'd have egg tosses, water balloon fights, challenge games, and the band parents would donate snacks and water ice. Especially if things were tense, our directors would form a team, which helped ease tensions from the week before.   That being said, we'd also encourage sections to sit with everyone, remind everyone that each person is integral to the music we make, and then we'd dunk the director at the end of band camp with any leftover water from our cooler to let off some steam. I hope this helps someone!"
marchingband,3bchnf,kbpbc25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds nice! Our band camp doesn't have as much team building, but we do have a drill-off at the end of the week, and whoever wins it gets to dump the water on the director and pie one of the interns."
marchingband,3bchnf,Mahlerbro,3,Sat Jun 27 23:19:17 2015 UTC,Drink water. A lot of it.
marchingband,3bchnf,Mahlerbro,6,Sat Jun 27 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"A few other essentials for the rooks:   Start hydrating the day before camp starts. No dairy. None. Eat healthy foods. If you snack out on any meal, you're gonna have a bad time. No black clothing, unless you're way up north. The more white, the better. Only wear shoes you can march in. That means no flip flops. Similarly, don't buy new shoes right before camp, you want something already worn in. Wear clothes you can move around in. Only wear one layer of clothing, unless you're way up north. Drink the everliving hell out of water. Get a Camelbak if you can. Be sure that you DO NOT CHUG! If you chug water, you will get very sick. Before my first game of my rookie season, I chugged a bottle of powerade and scarfed down a bunch of breadsticks. I got a migraine and puked multiple times while on the field. Apply the everliving hell out of sunscreen. Left is right; right is wrong. Be punctual, and listen to instructions carefully the first time. Don't complain! We all know its hot, and saying ""it's hot"" doesn't fix it."
marchingband,3bchnf,tomla134,4,Sat Jun 27 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"Excellent suggestions here! I'd like to add to your last one, don't complain that your horn/drum is heavy. It was heavy when I marched it, it's going to be heavy when your kids March it, pick it up and lets get to work."
marchingband,3bchnf,tomla134,2,Sat Jun 27 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"why no dairy? i've heard this multiple times before (usually along the lines of ""i puked after i drank dairy"" or solely, like you, ""don't drink milk"") but why? this is my first year of band, so i've never heard this before, except for when my sister (who's in choir) mentions it. also, how much water is normal for camp? i have been drinking about half a gallon for each six hour guard camp. is that enough, or should i be drinking more?"
marchingband,3bchnf,anderson1115,2,Sun Jun 28 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"Heat makes dairy curdle in your stomach, giving you severe nausea. As far as the water thing goes, I'm not sure of the exact amount you need; also, some band camps are more intense than others. A good rule of thumb is to sip on your water every time you are given a break, which should be every 15 - 30 minutes or so. My 2L Camelbak needs to be refilled at least a couple times in one day, which is about 1 and a half gallons. So you may not be getting enough, but again, it's gonna be different based off a bunch of different things.     If you're thirsty at any point, you're not drinking enough. If your pee is yellow at any point, you're not drinking enough."

They just can't touch you. If someone isn't quite at attention unless they move they can stay that way. I was once looking down and when the BD came over and said I wasn't at attention I didn't dare move because he didn't say I was out. I also had my face stuffed in my mouthpiece so they couldn't see me smile when they came over. I'm a cheat :)

We don't play it as a game, but you could. Basically, it's stationary commands, and whoever cannot do it correctly is out. The last person standing is the winner. You could implement a punishment for those out (in my opinion you shouldn't, but it's your section, not mine), or reward the winner. My band does neither, and simply an exercise."
marchingband,3auh8a,fdsa4321lbp22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:23:48 2015 UTC,"Let me say this first: whatever game you play, don't cancel it because the rules aren't being followed. If everyone's on the same page, don't worry if it's a page you didn't write.  Also, if you make the games competitive as the same teams, you have to be fair. You can't give away a win to break a tie if another team won.   Alright, here are some games   Rock Paper Scissors war - two lines of people stand across from each other. They Huddle up and decide whether rock paper or scissors, as well as a back up. Leaders shout ""1! 2! 3!"" And everyone shows their choice. The winner chases the loser to a predefined point to try and tag them. All tagged people switch teams. Note: the running starts when people figure out what sign is being shown. U Ninja - that hand slapping game called ninja.  Viking - people stand in a circle at attention or some sort of attention-like pose. Their hands go in a thumb-on-forehead hang loose to simulate Viking horns. Pick an order for people to go in, and whoever's turn it is makes a sound to try and break the other people(into laughter). You laugh you lose  Playground games - tag and freeze tag are always fun"
marchingband,3auh8a,molotoviphone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"We play an icebreaker game where everyone grabs a chair and sits in a circle, facing in towards a person in the middle. The person in the middle will say their name, followed by something interesting about themselves (something they like, instrument they play, a place they've been, etc.). Anyone else in the circle who has the same interest, experience, etc. must stand up and switch chairs with someone else who also stands up. Eventually you get another person in the middle, and the game starts over.  It's basically musical chairs but with introductions instead of music."
marchingband,3auh8a,Zazzini,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"The way to build camaraderie very quickly is either through shared experience. Similarly to how they treat everyone in the military like garbage and make them do physical labor or punishment together. Things like ""Okay, and for that we ALL get to do some laps"" and such are the sorts of things that people who don't know each other can talk about and joke about. I'm not saying that you need to treat people like crap, but shared exercise and punishments are the key. Make everyone bond as a group because they ARE a group. Another key is to separate them from the entire band. If the entire band has to do things it doesn't work because they are many sections. If only the Front Ensemble has to do something they will feel close to each other.  Make everyone stay after lunch and clean the cafeteria for 5 mins. It'll be nice for the band parents and it will bind them.   Make everyone clean the band room for 10 mins after each day of rehearsal. I always said (as a head and later as an instructor) that we should leave every place better than we found it. This made it less like a punishment and more like status quo.  When someone does something punishment worthy, make EVERYONE do that punishment.   Try to do something good together (as a section) as well. Bring freeze pops for the pit. You can pass out extras to the rest of the band after you all get them.   Some may disagree with this idea but I want to stress that I'm not saying to be mean, nor am I saying to punish the students for no reason. If something has to be done, do it as a group."

At our camp we did Breakfast 2 hours inside 4 hours outside Lunch  4 hours inside Dinner  3 hours outside  We always had an entire bar of fresh fruit so I would pile and entire bowl full and just chow down. Lunch was the safe meal with no outside activity immediately afterwards, and dinner was less safe but the food was usually so good we ate it anyways! Eat according to your activity schedule.  Russian accent And remember my friends, no Dairy!"
marchingband,3anaut,mangarooboo,4,Mon Jun 22 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"We had a rule in our drumline that you should never eat eggs before band camp.

Granted I have a pretty strong stomach, but just be careful to eat enough while not stuffing yourself and you should be fine. I never felt sick based on what I ate and it got hot.  Make sure you drink enough water, too. I usually stuck to water during rehearsal and packed a couple of those little bottles of gatorade for lunch."

I like to carb load before practice, eat light foods like salad or quinoa during meal, then recover with chocolate soy milk or a homemade protein shake.  Think Mediterranean when planning meals-lots of greens and filling carbs with lean meats.  And only water during practice!  If you need to grab a quick meal, get a sub from Subway (tuna or chicken only, light cheese, lots of veggies and little dressing) or, in a dire situation, a fresco bean burrito from Taco Bell.  I'm actually a pescetarian, but during marching band, I always eat eggs, tuna, and beans every day to keep my protein up.  I might have given you too much info but I take diet waaaaay seriously.  You won't get sick and you can get a lot leaner this way."

marchingband,3ainks,composer1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"You'r pretty much correct. USBands started as a local circuit and is now working towards becoming more and more national. USBands has a lot of issues (that I won't go into )that they are trying to work on and I don't know if it'll ever reach the level of quality of BOA (though I hope it does).  That being said, BOA is far from perfect and there are things USBands actually does better. For one, they do have a bigger emphasis on the student experience which I applaud. BOA is a bit more oriented towards providing a solid competitive environment."
marchingband,3ainks,DrummingBear,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind, can you elaborate the issues? My band is in the USBands circuit and we've had a few bad experiences, but overall it's been very good."
marchingband,3ainks,trumpethero786,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"Point blank, there are a lot of terrible judges involved in the circuit, even from a completely objective point of view. The reality is when you have a circuit that operates on the scale that USBands does, it's going to happen. You can't have 25+ competitions in a weekends and expect to be able to find 125+ quality judges.  I'm not accusing them of a lack of effort. They have their weekly webinars which anyone can watch in which they provide some guidance to their huge number of judging staff but in the end it's only but so effective.  In comparison here's a peak at what WGI judges have to go through to be certified:  http://www.wgi.org/contents/Become-a-Judge---Percussion.html  This works because WGI has so few competitions a weekend, they can maintain a small group of quality judges and commit resources to training them.  In the end though, how much does the judging affect the experiences the vast majority of students have? Except for the couple of bands in the running for first place, it's not going to matter much if a band gets 3rd or last, if they got any credit for pulling off demanding listening responsibilities, or if the color guard spent one half of the tape critiquing color choice and the other half drill (and not even the drill of the guard).  Other than that my gripes are more administrative but also related to the scale they operate on. It's pretty typical to arrive at a show and have no idea where the stadium is, where the pit or drumline can warm up, where the bathrooms are, etc, though this is a light complaint. Honestly I much prefer shows to be looser about warm up space/time then BOA which is far too strict about it and honestly probably the most damaging part of teaching a BOA regional and one reason why I would not advocate going back unless with a super high level group of students."
marchingband,3ainks,DrummingBear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about the judges. Almost every bad account we have had with the circuit has been a judge issue. We are a very untraditional band, without a drum line, a pit on the back hash, and monkeys on the field (at least in our 2014 show). We've had many judges adjudicate our style instead of the technicalities of the show. Those issues can be frustrating, and I agree with you on that. Thanks for laying it out for me."
marchingband,3ainks,trumpethero786,-1,Fri Jul 3 00:29:36 2015 UTC,Basically Open Class USBands is the equivalent or almost equivalent of BOA. A-Class is for lesser competitive bands with lesser funding.
marchingband,3ainks,UnlockTheShock,2,Sat Jun 20 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.   A Class is judged solely on execution - did you perform well?  Open class takes design into consideration - did you perform well and was it well designed?  There are bands in A class that have $$$$$$$ and bands in Open that don't. And vice versa.  You can choose to enter Open class or you can be promoted by kicking the snot out of everyone.   That said, the bands that go to BOA from USBands are good, but they're not steamrolling everyone."

marchingband,3afk6v,itselizabeth,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"Coming from a director, one important thing to me is to take your leadership responsibilities seriously without becoming a jerk to your friends and bandmates.  In other words, there are gonna be times when you have to get on your friends about things such as maybe the way they're treating other people or the way they're acting, etc., and a good leader will know it's their responsibility as drum major to step in and do what's right.  In fact, I would even recommend letting your closest friends in band know ahead of time that if they're doing something counter-productive to the band (maybe not treating others right or maybe talking too much in rehearsal, for example) it's your duty as drum major to let them know it's not okay and that you're not gonna let it slide for them just because you're friends with them.  Second thing that's probably gonna be more specific to what a director would expect out of you (as opposed to things your band members would want from you), is to try to be proactive in anticipating what your director needs/wants you to do.  Might take a little bit of time to get a feel for it, but as long as you're learning and figuring it out then you're on the right track.  And if there's nothing the director needs you to do at a given point in time, have a few things of your own on the backburner that you can make yourself busy with - whether that's practicing your conducting, practicing with the baton for parades, or even helping with things in the band room such as organizing the library/inventory/uniforms/etc.  I know in my case, if somebody were to ask me to put them to work in the band room, I would put them to work in the library if there wasn't already something else that may or may not be more pressing."

marchingband,3afk6v,saxguy2001,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:58:55 2015 UTC,"Here are some things our last drum major did not deliver on that any drum major should.    Practice. You can tell people how easy your job is as much as you want, but if you show up and don't have your shit down the band will dislike you forever. You can't just say it's easy and mess up.  Don't mess up more than once or twice a week, and if you do don't mess up huge. And don't do it at a show ever.  Have personal interaction with every wind player at least once every week or two, with special emphasis on rookies. It's okay if you don't know the guard and drumline that well, but know everyone's name.  Be a leader, not just a time keeper. Tell people how they can do better on the field, even when you're just keeping time. I mean afterwards of course. Focus on keeping time. Be prepared. Don't be caught without a phone with a metronome and earbuds on you if your band does that. Always have every piece of equipment checked and ready for every rehearsal.  Speak to your band. Inspirationally. Perhaps at the end of practices. Donuts?    Follow what you want. Those are just some of the mistakes our last dm had that I hope our next dm will learn from."

It's okay if you don't know the guard and drumline that well, but know everyone's name.    This one in particular is a fantastic suggestion.  A little effort in learning who everybody is and in being nice and friendly to those you may not know as well will go a long way.  Marching band can be intimidating for freshmen (both in high school AND college) because all the vets seem to know each other so well given how much time is spent together, so anything to show them that they're welcome and already a part of the family will immediately boost their confidence and comfort as well as the morale of the whole band."

He dislikes the roll step show much that since he has been employed at my school he hasn't updated to roll step. For band camp when we finish things up we preform skits (which need to have a plot, marching, and a musical performance) the Sousa section teaches always teach the freshman roll step for the BD hates it when we do. He also goes into a rant as to why DCI is a terrible thing. I don't really care because I help out with the cavaliers a lot during preseason."
marchingband,3a48d8,jaxson25,3,Thu Jun 18 00:24:22 2015 UTC,sounds like the BD is kind of terrible.

But at band camp Sousa's don't listen to anyone except when lunch is.  Personally my favorite part of band is the high stepping (but annoying the BD is fun as well)? I don't really know how to explain this but I really enjoy the band program and I don't think I would enjoy it as much without the guy. The man is very good and is a fun dude he just has a thing that bugs him, he only goes into the rant at band camp."
marchingband,3a48d8,molotoviphone,2,Thu Jun 18 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"Why would you teach your section a different technique than the rest of the band?   The majority of corps don't match the same technique as cavaliers. The only world class corps near the top besides them with that technique is Pacific Crest, and they're low on the charts when they're there at all.  And the tubas were notorious for holding the cavaliers back a season or two ago..."
marchingband,3a48d8,TubaJesus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:54:11 2015 UTC,well the technique is only for the skit. once that's done we go back to the high stepping we use. And personally i don't have an interest in DCi as more of mtt dad is a huge fan of the cavaliers (well he did march in 1973 when he was 14 to when he aged out). other than this past year when we used roll step because of s district mandate we only used it to get to our positions for our fast entry pregame. Its easier to do 20-40's using roll step.

marchingband,39y2i4,yankeesfan13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:47:12 2015 UTC,My high school band does this. That chair lift step is probably going to be a big part of it (it is actually kinda fun) I could give you a better answer if you tell me what it looked like before. Did it do roll stepping. was it a fast entry? At my school we do a fast entry pregame with that chair stepping style march (later in the season when we do our second show we do that style march for the half time show as well.  At a more basic level it is a style march that gets a crowd more hyped up (which is why i like it). it also is a bit harder to keep smooth (some schools purposefully don't because it makes their plumes bounce and it looks cool if they do it in sync). Something had changed so if you don't mind my asking what did change. Did you get a new BD or something?
marchingband,39y2i4,TubaJesus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"I have done the chair step in high school and I dont like it. Last season, our high step was....how do I explain this. We lifted our feet up next to our legs, not out like with the chair lift, and high enough so our feet were at our calves.

They do travel to different places to help people outside their area do the fundraiser.  You never know - maybe they're willing to travel to your area if there are one or two other schools in the area doing the same fundraiser.  Then they can knock out 2-3 schools in one trip down there.  That was the case for us; we had to wait for the specific days they were traveling our way to make it work since they were getting multiple schools in the area.  If they had a booth at CASMEC, I would have to imagine they're willing to go nearly anywhere in California for this.  So again, at the very least give them a call.  We netted nearly $1800 from this the first time we did it, with a group of about 100 where only about 20-25 of them sold anything at all.  And that's more than twice as much as we've netted from any other non-booster fundraiser in at least the last two years."

I played bass 3, and I hated guard (sorry). We spent A LOT of time doing guard stuff instead of actually working on vis/music. Get ready to be frustrated with the newbies. The guard was supportive through it all because they know how hard it is, because it's just like when you started. It helps if you become friends with the rest of the band, and be more open to helping them if they come to you and ask. I went over to one of the guard girl's houses and she taught me how to do flag stuff. Good luck, it pays off in the end."

All of the time spent on something like that is time NOT spent on actually making the music and drill cleaner, which is primarily what you're doing as a wind player."
marchingband,39j9z6,saxguy2001,2,Fri Jun 12 08:01:09 2015 UTC,"Also a director, and have done this with great success. I've also seen lots of success with guard-like materials, such as chain flags. When my program did it, we used our wind line spinning during a drum feature, and had them in a terraced formation (huge wedge) and gradiated colors with the flags. Nothing we did was more complicated than the very basics - slams, drop spins, and presents (not even a toss of any form).  The keys to doing this is to structure the effect and to K.I.S.S. We won high visuals in our class (band of 50 or so) and consistently outscored bands 5x our size in visuals. It can be done very well with proper planning and effort."

So all of a sudden, there's a huge brass chorale and 100+ white and holographic silver and gold silk flags filling all the negative space surrounding the brass and percussion. Again, very basic work but nice - best effect was a ripple that began on the outsides and came to the center. I've not heard of a large full band going to guard, but I'd love to see 250 guard on the field for a drum feature. That does seem a bit impractical though."

Basically what it is, 5/4 should be interesting. Change into 3/4 towards the end mimicing Cavalier's awkward counting breakdown in their 1995 show... 2/4 measure into 5/4 ending incredibly loudly. MVT3: Venus. Nice and soft. Battery is out doing stuff with the colorguard. Flute solo and soli. Pretty soothing and a nice relaxation and lull after Mars.  MVT4: Brass plays the Uranus intro as we go into the percussion feature which is going to be Mercury (we don't know much about this yet as it's still being written). The band is gonna be marching and delivering heavily on General Effect at this point (hopefully) MV5: Our closer is Jupiter. Starts off as per the original and soon goes into the 3/4 moving part directly into the Andante Maestoso and ends as per the regular piece, but plot twist: after the last hit, we hold a chord and it descends into the nasty chord from MVT1 and then end it with a majestic build up.  Should be pretty sick, not gonna be easy. We have 2/4,3/4,4/4,5/4,6/4, and god knows what else at this point which isn't too bad, but a lot of freshmen are coming in this year and 3/4 and 5/4 is gonna be a challenge for them to pick up."

I was on staff about five years ago with a college marching band and a freshman tuba player died in a car accident on his way home after the first home game of the year.  We always did one show a year in the same style as what a competitive high school band would do to show off to high schoolers and blow their faces off at the high school competition we hosted.  So during the climax of the ballad in that show we had a set where the dance team brought out his sousaphone and framed it while the band spelled out his initials.  I remember the drill-writer saying that was the most difficult set he ever wrote since it had to be absolutely perfect.  And then all year long they kept his hole in the show for pregame."

You will have to assess whether your commitment to yourself and your instrument is greater than to the ensemble as a whole.  This is not to suggest that choosing yourself is inherently shameful - I'd much rather have someone be honest in their desires and goals than to guilt someone into something they'd hate or be super dissatisfied with in their final high school experience. However, I can assure you that you'd likely have a great time on tuba, be highly successful (given the obvious immediate limitations), and be in a better position to contribute more effectively to the overall program if you do as your director asks and switch.   But it's your band experience and your decision. Sorry to say, but in a band of your size, three additional tubas can make your band sound amazing, more so than 10+ saxes (caveat - generally depending upon show and band style. I'm presuming the average pseudo-corps style prevalent in hs marching bands today). Good luck making your choice!"
marchingband,3979xz,BEHodge,9,Wed Jun 10 00:07:22 2015 UTC,You being a senior won't fix the problem. Why don't you make a recommendation to have a younger student switch.

marchingband,3979xz,budgetband,2,Tue Jun 9 21:45:56 2015 UTC,thats the truth. our district has two tubas when we start in 5th grade and we pull a total of four more from the middle schools (more kids tall enough to reach the mouthpiece) to feed our tuba program.
marchingband,3979xz,TubaJesus,2,Wed Jun 10 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! Mention to your band director that they might want another tuba player for more than one season. Get a new freshman to switch, or a sophomore on a plentiful instrument."
marchingband,3979xz,Kanotari,7,Wed Jun 10 02:45:48 2015 UTC,If I were you I wouldn't switch. It's your senior year and it's your last year to have as much fun as you can. I'm sure your director can find others that could switch.
marchingband,3979xz,eat_more_cheetos,2,Tue Jun 9 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you think is more important. Playing what you want or doing what's best for the band.

marchingband,3979xz,BeatMastaD,2,Tue Jun 9 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"If you're interested then go ahead and do it. Your BD may be hoping to add your leadership to the tubas and believes you can make the transition without much difficulty.  The saxophones will go on without you - really. They'll be just fine.  (Having said that, I do agree with other commenters that it makes more sense to move one or more younger players over. But, that doesn't mean that both can't happen.)  P.S.

marchingband,3979xz,CasualTyrant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"Learning tuba would be great for you. Tubas are always welcome in college bands. You said that there are 4 people in your section next year? If you're on alto that seems really small for a 175 piece band. If you're on Bari or tenor, then you should be fine switching. But to me, alto should have more than 4 people.  I also look at high school band this way. Its for fun. If you have a bunch of friends in the sax section, and you feel like you won't get to hang out with them as much, or you feel like you won't enjoy tuba, then don't switch. I switched to tuba one year and hated it. The part is so boring (Any part was boring in my high school though. I was way past the level my high school played at)."
marchingband,3979xz,mythic94,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Bari. I feel that 4 is a good number for our size, it is comparable to those of our neighboring towns"
marchingband,3979xz,mythic94,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I didn't see that you play Bari, so 3-4 with your size should be fine. My music teacher told me that he always tried to get 1 tuba for every 10 people. (That's not how it works out. I don't know what it's called, but its like how colleges accept more people than they can enroll. Some people say no, so you plan to have too many, then end up with about the right amount) He usually had, I think, 9 tubas for 170 or so people.  So if you don't have any preference, I would say switching to tuba may be best for the ensemble as a whole. I still agree to the second half of my post though that if you don't want to give up sax, then don't. Band is and always will be an activity to have fun."

Had I been given the chance back in HS I may have switched to tuba from Bari. Instead I doubled the tuba parts on bari and did the best I could to cover down as I was the lowest instrument in the band that year. (The year I marched it was the smallest the band has been in 10 + years and it was just really sad) After that the program has steadily grown into what it is today though!

marchingband,3979xz,DRUMS11,4,Tue Jun 9 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's the attitude of this entire subreddit. The majority of kids I've seen on this sub have the idea that they are the only one who can make changes to their band, and take up this mentality that everything rests on their shoulders. Its weird really, that people have the idea that they need to control every situation. Honestly, its just band. The band director can handle it. It's his job to handle things and make the decisions. It's the job of the membership and a student leaders to follow through with it, even if they don't think its best.   Like above said, the most you could do (except in your case, but that's your relationship with your director) is suggest things. When it comes to changing someone's instrument, I've always had the thought that the most the director can do is strongly suggest to a student that they switch instruments. After all, you spent all the time learning your primary, maybe you pages money for lessons, maybe you bought your instrument. If I don't want to switch to tuba and stay on sax, I'm damn well staying on sax no matter what the director says. That's the approach I take with my students, at least. Then again, it depends on your director and your program."
marchingband,3979xz,dan1361,2,Wed Jun 10 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"I never said force someone to change an instrument. Only saying cause it seemed like you implied it.   The reason I am honest with my directors is because they trust me  they put in a leadership position because they don't want to micro - manage every little thing. It IS my job to make my band better. The directors have to worry about funds, parents, the show,  and a plethora of other things. They shouldn't have to worry about making sure someone wants to switch instruments.   For example, they told me to find a trumpet player that will switch to low brass and let them know. I asked around and a kid said he'll do it. I relayed this to the directors and next week I am teaching him the basics.   I don't think everything rests on my shoulders, I know it doesn't. I do control a lot of the situations because that is the responsibility I was given, the directors want to avoid getting involved as much as possible. A band is better if it is self - sufficient.   Also, not every band works like yours. Down vote me as much as you want but that statement is sure as hell true."

Maintenance:   DO NOT drop these things, low brass instruments are a lot heavier than a flute and in my experience suffer more damage from a fall. Oil your valves at least once a week, even if you aren't using the instrument. This includes your concert instrument if you are making a permanent switch. There a plenty of videos on how to oil valves and it is pretty simple, worse comes to worse ask your section leader. There is debate on which valve oil is better but I have found the most success with fat cat. I don't apply slide grease as often as I do valve oil, I usually wait until something feels wrong. I still use the fat cat brand for grease too. If you want to have a good time, invest in some mouthpiece cleaner. I clean mine everyday because those things quickly look and smell horrid. This is what I use and it smells minty. I really love putting it on before a performance for the stimulation you get. One last thing you need to do is work out your forearms.

marchingband,3941fa,CasualTyrant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"Practice buzzing on the mouthpiece as much as possible. Play some long tone buzzes, some rhythms, practice pitch bending, maybe even buzz along to a song. The mouthpiece on a brass instrument is the real instrument. Think of the actual horn as just an amplifier. The tone and control all comes from your buzz.  Also, I saw above said oil once a week. I would recommend once a day on hot days. During band camp in the sun the oil will dry out quickly. Keep those valves quick!  Practice breathing too, the key to any (most) beginner brass technique issues is MORE AIR. This phrase should be embedded in your brain. Tattoo it on your face.   For anything, find the best brass player in your band and ask them. Ask your teacher/tech/director too! But most of all get that horn on your face as much as possible."

marchingband,38x56j,Flaut,11,Sun Jun 7 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"I won't just tell you to deal with it. 1. Stay hydrated. If permissible, wear a camel back. Drink as much water as you can before the parade and during breaks. Avoid milk. 2. Pace yourself. Don't go nuts at the start of parades. 3. If you can control the temperature of your wrists and your head you can help a lot. A wet rag under your helmet does wonders. 4. Dress responsibly underneath the uniform. Just don't go commando in case you pass out and staff needs to get you out of your uniform in a hurry.   A bathing suit is a good option. 5. Conditioning. The better shape you are in, the less your body will have to work during the actual parade. Less work = less heat. 6. Modified rest position. Depending on what you play, you might get your section to hold your instrument a little lower than normal when not playing."

Dress sparingly under your uniform (I usually wear my band t-shirt and some basketball shorts). Towards the end of the parade, everyone will be tired and it will be more difficult to play. Something we did to counter this is if your section is large enough, split into two groups (make sure 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parts are evenly distributed). Then have group 1 play one tune while group 2 does the next and so on. But this is more of a last resort for long parades. If you guys are able to hold out it's better to just stick together."

If he didn't believe you were capable he would've just given it to her. You should try talking to him about how it makes you feel weird that they are so buddy-buddy. Because that is pretty weird that they go out to eat... Not very professional of him. Also try getting your Drum Majors to help you out. If she tries to boss them around as well then I'm sure they see her as a problem as well. Use them as a resource. Just try not to let this boil up inside you too long and let it blow up into a huge dramatic thing. Jump on it and talk to her while the problem is arising. Write out exactly what you want to say to her and make it not belittling. That way when she tries to twist your words you can say, ""no, I didn't say that"" because you have it written out. Just some ideas.  I'm sorry you have to go through this sort of thing. I know it sucks and it will seem to keep getting worse as the season progresses. Just don't let the opportunities slip past you to assert that you are the section leader. I know it sucks, I'm also quiet so I know where you're coming from.

The next few times, remind her of that. After a few times, tell her even more sternly that you are the squad leader and you are the one who should be making decisions about seating, correcting mistakes, etc., and tell her to either do push-ups or run a lap around the field.   One thing that I did was when I told people to run or do push-ups, I did it with them. This let them know that you weren't trying to be overly bossy, plus it provided a chance to talk about the incident with them. If you choose to have them run, it also lets you talk in private with them.   If she refuses to run or do push-ups, go to your director and tell him that she isn't listening to you. Even though he is friendly with her, he chose you over her for a reason. If he ignores you multiple times, suggest that if he will allow her to act as the squad leader, he should make her the squad leader."

marchingband,38rqyo,junkmailrocket,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best advice. When dealing with a student, start with the section leader (you), then DM, and then director. You say that she has twisted your words before, so it might be helpful to have a junior or a senior with you (or another section leader) when you talk to her. If you do bring someone, do not let it be a friend of your's or her's; you'll need them to be neutral. When you talk to her, be confident and firm with what you say. I don't feel that push-ups or laps are necessary for this situation, but if she continues, bring it up to the DMs, director, or even the booster parents, if the director doesn't want to help."

marchingband,38r5qk,TomCruiseFanboy,2,Sat Jun 6 14:25:34 2015 UTC,My school marches about 250 people in a 300 person band. The people that didn't march were mainly freshman and did props for the competition. I don't know what the 100 people in your band will do because thats a larger portion of the band that's not marching compared to mine.  Edit: As well during band camp everyone marched but the people that didn't march in competitions shadowed someone. They switched between the shadow and the main marcher in football games every week.
marchingband,38r5qk,heroicevil,3,Sat Jun 6 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"It will certainly raise the competitive band's scores, but that doesn't make it a good idea. I think everyone in a competitive high school band knows that the competition show gets way more attention than the football only stuff. That's fine when everyone plays everything, but when you split up your band, you are essentially ignoring half of your band.   It's called music education for a reason. When schools put winning over development that much, they hurt the kids and ultimately their band. There is a place for limiting the size of the group to maximize results (DCI).  As for the logistics, the competitive show will probably be like previous years, but with less people. The football show will likely be very simple and a lot of easy forms (lines, blocks, follow the leaders, etc.) that aren't hard to learn. During the competitions, the rest of the band most likely won't come."

marchingband,38r5qk,HammyDone,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:47:22 2015 UTC,They way we do it is we have the whole group do performances for school and stuff but a subset of people who choose to compete are the ones who are in the competitive group. The people who compete also go to the performances with everyone else. This way band can be more chill or more high stakes depending on what you're looking for. Keep in mine we're Canadian so this works pretty differently for us but it's something to think about maybe.
marchingband,38r5qk,lordnerd,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"We're actually doing that next year.  Our problem in the past has been that some students want to be in the band program but can't handle the time commitment required for marching band.  In addition to that, there have also been some students who want to be a part of the marching band who simply can't be relied on to consistently be at all the rehearsals for the entire time.  In other words they're incredibly flaky.  And that's not fair to the majority of the band who is committed to being at every rehearsal.  So this fall we'll have the entire marching band who will be at all the football games and parades but they don't have to be at any rehearsals outside of school (other than the first week of band camp), and then within that band will be the competitive band that does all the extra rehearsals and learns our competitive show.  And since our overnight trip is for a competition, only the competitive band will be going on that trip.  As for football games, we'll be learning a separate show to do at halftime that involves two easy songs, the fight song, and probably no more than 15 easy sets of drill.  Basically something that can be learned that first week of band camp and during the school day.  Then as we progress through the season and start using 4th period to work on the competitive show more and more, the head director will be working with them while I (I'm the assistant) work with the non-competitive group on basics, on fine-tuning the parade march and stands tunes, and eventually getting a head start on the Christmas march and all the Christmas music."

Since marching band is a class, anyone who doesn't want to march gets put into second block band instead of first.  They still have to show up to football games and march pregame, but they don't come to competitions.  There's literally only like ten people who do that; the rest march. But what they get to do is have concerts with the jazz band in the fall, since competitive marching band doesn't work on concert music at all."

Usually it is two different shows and you are only in one of the bands.   I can see why it is done if the school is pushing the band to keep placing higher in competitions. Also with the competition band usually having auditions it can push the band as a whole to get better. But at the same time if you aren't hugely successful it can be a mistake."

marchingband,38nkyn,Galt42,5,Fri Jun 5 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"Athletic shoes (Nike, Adidas, Asics, etc) are going to be your best bets for good marching rehearsal shoes. They provide the support that your feet need with how much you're going to be moving. Not only do they typically have soles shaped for physical activity, they are usually somewhat stiff which will help support your ankles and keep you from hurting yourself.  Converse do not have any built-in support and an insole won't really help much on its own. They have thin, flat soles and are typically very flexible which gives your feet and ankles no support while you move around. It would be like driving a car without suspension, every bump would shake things around and can cause damage."

marchingband,38qy18,demonqueen21,5,Sat Jun 6 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Both and neither.  im going to explain the neither because that would be hardest to explain (if you want ill explain both as well). Sometimes you can have to politics (and no the mom had nothing to do with it) and the achievements and you still won't win. there are other factors that will be on trial weather you audition or not. if your BD is like mine then he will know everything you've done in band weather you've complained during band camp or if you help a freshman who looked lost but didn't ask for help yet. I've had section leaders (which is as close to brass captain as we get because we don't have them) who did not inspire leadership as well. they had the title but none of the authority, someone else took charge of the section and that guy was sorta hung out to dry. with a DM though you don't have that latitude you are it and inspiring leadership may be more important than scoring better. Your actions and personality may not be a match for a leadership position of that caliber. Someone in my band once said they didn't want to be drum major because he felt that the band would be better if someone else was in charge. our BD heard this and asked him to be a DM for the next ear and he was one of the best DM's i've seen. it may be that your Character is what caused you to be where you are, after all there is no reward for  putting in extra work. By quitting you have only proved that your character is not that of one who should be drum major."
marchingband,38qy18,TubaJesus,9,Sun Jun 7 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I wouldn't normally say something like this, but if you quit band over not getting a leadership position, you just proved your director's point, that you don't actually deserve that position."
marchingband,38qy18,Guticb,-7,Sat Jun 6 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"When it's my senior year and I've always put in 110% and get nothing back, I am justified to quit. I had an accident during one of our games (my director wouldn't let me leave even though I was feeling sick) and I evening up passing out and falling down the bleachers. I had a hairline fracture and was out of practice for 3 weeks. I got the drill map and when I went back to practice I was the only who knew where my spots were and I wasn't even there. I've more than proved myself this past season but it's just politics. Its not based on achievements, and that is justified for quitting. If I had even gone up in position, I would have stayed. The current band captain's score wasn't anywhere close to mine, but he got it because his brother was it last year and his mom is another music teacher at our school. I'm not putting up with politics anymore."
marchingband,38qy18,yankeesfan13,4,Sat Jun 6 03:15:34 2015 UTC,"A true leader is someone who actively tries to make their group the best they can be, regardless of what position they are in. You are showing all of us that you are not a true leader as you are more interested in being in a leadership position than the well-being of your band.   Your best option is to be the best brass captain you can be, work with the drum major to figure out how you can help each other, and try to do the best you can. Is there a chance that you deserved it more? Sure. Now that it's over with, forget about it and work on improving your band. That is what leadership is about."
marchingband,38qy18,Guticb,5,Mon Jun 8 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, I doubt it's politics. I think it's attitude that kept you from it. Like the attitude you're showing now."
marchingband,38qy18,saxguy2001,3,Sat Jun 6 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"The attitude you're showing right now is something I'm sure you've shown from time to time and I'm sure your director has seen it at times.  And it's exactly why you were not chosen for those leadership positions.  The best leaders all put in the effort you claim to put in and don't expect any recognition for it because they simply know it's what needs to be done for the good of the band.  Yes, recognition for your efforts is always appreciated, but should never be expected.  Another likely reason you were not chosen was that you're a brass player, and many band directors absolutely HATE taking one of their best brass players off the field to put them on the podium.  Given that you've already been brass captain I would assume you're among the best brass players at your school.  If my brass captain (a junior this past year) had auditioned for drum major for this coming year, the head band director and I would have told him ahead of time he's welcome to go through the process but we wouldn't be going with him because he would be of much better service to the band as the lead trumpet player and brass captain than as an assistant drum major not even on the center podium.  And he would've understood exactly where we were coming from.  Now, back to your attitude, if this is the attitude you've shown your band director from time to time, he's probably not as sad as you'd like to think that you quit.  You sound a lot like the assistant drum major we had last year.  We were wary about his ego and narcissism but he and the guy we made head drum major were heads and shoulders above everybody else and we simply couldn't ignore that.  The guy we made head drum major was a junior while the assistant was a senior (neither had been DM the year before).  The senior was better than the junior at conducting, but the junior was a much more selfless leader and had much more respect from his peers.  Well, eventually that senior who was assistant DM let his ego, immaturity, narcissism, etc., get the best of him.  He showed his true colors to the entire band, nearly quit his position mid-season because he was unhappy with his lack of recognition for all of his hard work (which he thought he worked harder than everybody else and thought he deserved recognition for it), and eventually did quit band altogether after the winter concert (in which he didn't play because we actually didn't have enough instruments for what he played and he didn't care enough to force a freshman off the instrument or switch himself to one of the several other instruments he could play).  By then we were done with him thinking don't let the door hit you on the way out.  In fact, the band ended up better off the rest of the year without him (him AND the other seniors with similar personality issues who followed suit and quit - and the top wind ensemble got a unanimous superior at a festival for the first time in years), yet they spent the rest of the year making fun of how the band was worse off and could never survive without them.  He's attempting to be a music ed major in college this fall and it'll be interesting to hear stories of him getting put in his place by people who won't (and don't have to) tolerate his attitude."

marchingband,38qy18,heyitsliz,-5,Sat Jun 6 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"Even if they weigh conducting more, I still should've gotten band captain. But the kid who is now band captain, his brother was it last year and his mom is another music teacher at our school. It's all just politics and I don't want to deal with that anymore. Not my senior year."
marchingband,38qy18,molotoviphone,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"Mmm. Well, it would be worth talking to your directors (respectfully) about. While they probably won't change assignments now, it may help others down the road."

(Sarcasm)   But I also got the pleasure of being saxophone section leader one more year. And honestly, I loved it. I decided not to quit and didn't regret that decision once. I'm not marching anymore, but it's that last year and all the feelings and people I'll leave behind that Ill remember the most.   That being said, they aren't based on politics. They're based on who the director's favorite student is."

That skinny guy on bass is going to be awful and you'd do so much better than him! You should go to your instructor and tell him this and hopefully he'll see your reasoning and switch you.  Version B: As you mentioned you just started. Starting anything is hard. Why do you hate pit? You didn't give any reasons other than you can't read treble clef. Is your tenor or bass drum sight reading that much better? If you can read bass clef then learning how to read treble clef is honestly not that hard. Learn a couple tricks and to get you started (I used to just transpose up or down to the next line or space).   And you find it boring? Yes, I'm originally a front ensemble person, but between battery and front ensemble there really isn't that much difference, especially in the beginning. You think playing scales is boring? How about playing legato strokes on one drum for 4 hours. We all have to start with the basics and they are never fascinating. My past experience tells me that kids who use the fact that they didn't get the instrument they wanted as an excuse for not being able to focus just plain have problems focusing.  To help you out a bit...  What year are you? (Freshman, sophomore, etc.) If you're young then it's perfectly normal in most programs that you will start in the front ensemble. The skills you learn in front ensemble (assuming taught right) will certainly transfer over to battery. I've had students go from marimba or vibes to snare within a year and it's never a surprise. My center marimbas almost always have the same potential as my snares and I would not hesitate to swap them.  What were these drum lessons you took? What did you learn? Did you learn any marching bass drum technique? How many lessons did you take? If you really want to get on the batter next year start talking to the battery instructor now. Find out from whom you can take lessons from, specifically for marching percussion.  Stick with it. No one will ever tell you it'll be easy, but you will be so proud of what you've accomplished by the end."

I hate this way of thinking that if you're in pit it just means you suck at drumline. I was in pit last year as a rookie, and now I'm section leader because 1, im good at it, and 2, everyone who could've challenged me wanted to do drumline. And I have no problem with that, do what you want, and if it's not what you want, you'll probably end up liking it. But one thing that pissed me off that I like because you didnt do it is that a clarinet and sax player tried out for drumline and when they didnt make it, the went to their main instrument, not pit, because unless you have thw natural talent, pits the road to drumline.

Assuming you're not graduating, you'll still have next time to try again. You didn't state at all why you didn't make drumline. Maybe you should think about why you didn't make it?  Nobody really wants to be stuck in an ensemble with some kid who hates it and ends up bringing down the mood of the group, it's not fun. If it's not fun to you, try to make it fun.

marchingband,38fe8r,7edge,5,Wed Jun 3 21:13:59 2015 UTC,Well I would learn to read bass clef. its more practical than playing an Eb Sousa.  I had switched from euphonium to tuba so the jump was very easy (learning the ledger lines to play down an octave was the only thing i had to do). the fingerings should be very similar while playing scales (or that's what i understand from passive observation) they only real difference is learning to recognize that concert pitch is is the pitch you play. a concert Bb scale is the Bb scale on tuba/sousa. The instrument is awesomely fun and a blast to play. please feel free to message me with any specific questions. im not particularly good at vague questions.
marchingband,38fe8r,TubaJesus,2,Wed Jun 3 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, from what I've messed around with so far, the fingerings seem to be the same the whole way through as long as I think in concert pitch. A specific question, since you asked: When I play certain partials it kind of starts ""shifting."" It sounds like bubbling but not like spit-needs-to-be-emptied bubbling, hard to explain. What is that? How do I get rid of it?"
marchingband,38fe8r,TubaJesus,2,Wed Jun 3 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds like you may have an embouchure problem. Almost as though you are playing the correct note but almost in between the next note with the same fingering. Its hard for me to tell without hearing it. it could also be a breathing problem, if that's the case working on fundamentals is a good safe bet. are there any specific notes it gets bad on."
marchingband,38fe8r,manondorf,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed any specific notes, no. It tends to get worse as I go up in pitch, though."
marchingband,38fe8r,Pimptastic_Brad,4,Thu Jun 4 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"On trumpet, the embouchure tends to have the lips rolled in a bit. Don't do that on tuba. The control is going to come more from the very corners, with very little engagement of the inner lip muscles.   I'd recommend working on lots of long tones. The thing that killed me the most learning tuba was how much air I wasted at the beginning of each note just getting it to take.   As for the clef adjustment, a trick I use is to memorize primarily the open notes' positions on the staff. This gives me fewer things to think about. Then I think of the other notes in relation to those open notes. This helps me get around the renaming issue (C is Bb, etc) because I don't have to think the individual note's transposition, just the open notes. As in, I'm not thinking ""that's a G, which is the same as the trumpet's A,"" I'm thinking ""that's a step above open F.""  If that makes sense to you, maybe it'll help. It also might not, we all think differently."
marchingband,38fe8r,FlowerFetish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:05:42 2015 UTC,"That is a really good idea! I may not with open specifically, but I'll use the idea. I'll probably figure stuff out from the bottom line G and the C below it, I already have those set in my mind."
marchingband,38fe8r,zombie2uRBX,2,Thu Jun 4 10:14:57 2015 UTC,"I primarily play Bari sax, but the principle is still the same (I was also taught by a tuba player, and spent more time with the tuba section than the sax section).  Breathing exercises. Tuba air is not like trumpet air. For trumpet, and other smaller instruments, pressure has more impact than capacity. Large instruments are the opposite. Going from trumpet to Tuba, you will be a loud Tuba player with a short amount of time between breaths.  More later when I have the time."

marchingband,38bb82,yankeesfan13,2,Wed Jun 3 13:31:32 2015 UTC,Well our BD was a drum major for northwestern university and our assistant bs has some experience at U of I so that's where we get it from. We emulate the big ten bands as much as we can at the high school level.
marchingband,38bb82,dv893,3,Wed Jun 3 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"Around the Texas area, we usually have a fight song and a traditional song, one of the bands knows all the traditionals from the other schools and plays them at their games. I find it amusing although most find it offensive. They are a highly competitive band though."
marchingband,38bb82,chivomaximus,5,Wed Jun 3 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"I have not seen a matching band do it in my area. While I can understand why it would be done as a nice gesture, most people I know view it as being disrespectful, especially if it's done while the band is there. Could be seen as them trying to out perform the other band.   It's like when one band plays the same stand tune that the other band just played. The other band could be doing it to be playful, but it can be seen as them trying to play it the ""right way""."

marchingband,38bb82,FragmentOfBrilliance,2,Wed Jun 3 14:49:18 2015 UTC,Eh that's debatable. Our BD tells drum line to take cues off of the Sousa section.  If the tubas are wrong then the whole band is wrong.

Waaay back in my sophomore year of HS we went to a pre-season marching festival. One of our songs was Heartbreak Hotel (Elvis theme show - non-contest), during which we made a giant heart from about 20-to-20 with the drums at the top center (we had no pit at the time.) Both field commanders were brand new, this was their first public performance...and they flubbed the conducting on this song: they each had a different tempo. The percussion section leader sort of called an audible on the field, picked one of the commanders and told us to crank our volume to fortissimo. Luckily I have never again experienced this situation."
marchingband,38bb82,rm_a,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"We actually have a rule to fix such a problem. of our three drum majors always follow the one in the center. It doesnt matter if the other two are right and its just that one guy. the middle is always right. Our DM's though get to go to Dm camp for a week to learn the ropes, then there's freshman Technical marching day where they have an opportunity to learn everything before band camp. then theres band camp for about three or four days. then we usually have a football game the second week week of school so this is when it all comes together. that allows for two out of school practices on tuesday nights for about two hours and one hour every school day during the band period. by the time of our first show the DM's know what they are doing. all of that for a band that will never compete (and there is a long story why)"

marchingband,38bb82,saxguy2001,2,Wed Jun 3 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"In a college setting, it's a common practice among the Penn States and Notre Dames and such to do a shortened bit of the opponent's fight song if the opposing band didn't travel.  If they did, you don't."
marchingband,38bb82,ColonelButterscotch,2,Wed Jun 3 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. The Pride of the Southland (the University of Tennessee's marching band) plays the other team's fight song for home games.

The program was called Alleluia and featured Hazo's Exultate, Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral, Alleluia (Eric Whitacre) and the Finale of Beethoven's 9th symphony.  Props were 3 wedges (Served as a stage for soloists and section features. Our trumpets, drumline, and flutes all performed up there at some point).  Backdrop was the Rose Window from the Notre Dame cathedral (To fit the Alleluia theme) and the Arches symbolize the rib vaults in a cathedral (Again, think Notre Dame).

In this show the songs we play are Gibraltar, Scotland the Brave (bagpipes), Sing sing sing, Invincible and finally Rule Britannia. This show was with our previous director 2012-13. I can't remember the name of the first tune, but the rest are Hey Pachuco, O Waly waly, and again Rule Britannia. Though both of our directors worked together for 20+ years you still see a difference in style of show. Our band goes back to the 20's, we didn't take on the Royal Guard theme until i think the 60s or so. Our bagpipe core had also been created around then. We recently got new uniforms for a performance in the Rose Parade last year, which were made with the almost identical to the real thing and were made by the same company in Britain.

marchingband,37pt2s,Gratuitousity,9,Fri May 29 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"Not to put you down or anything, but just be wary that with such a small size, things may not go as they play out in your head - it's very hard to get a full sound out of your band, limited percussion positions means the sound is very sparse and those are the kinds of things that people often use as delineation between high school bands and a full on drum corps. It's simply harder to get a more full experience when there are so few members - and you will likely be plagued by lack of funding, too. If you can make it work, by all means, go for it, but I think size may be a limiting factor."
marchingband,37pt2s,moppr,5,Fri May 29 15:12:32 2015 UTC,My band director let us March a show composed of pop tunes and the band worked extra hard with the music and with the marching. I would try using things that kids are into to get them to work hard. Show them videos of great bands and maybe even conduct a survey online to people who march on Reddit to show the students why people love it so much!
marchingband,37pt2s,CasualTyrant,2,Fri May 29 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe show some videos of the cool marching bands out there. USC, Ohio State.  Let them here some peptunes of modern music. Let them know that it's not just the Bachs and Sousa. Try to have an assembly or school presentation. I'm sure you can get kids to sign up. Don't expect them to just walk in the band room and ask. You have to let them know.  You gotta be the cool band teacher. I had great band directors throughout my school years. I miss it greatly."

marchingband,37pt2s,LikeAThousandBullets,2,Fri May 29 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"You might be more successful if you start off just marching parades and playing pep tunes in the stands at football games.  I'm all for going for it almost no matter the situation, but with a group of 20 students you're gonna have a really tough time finding any type of success even in a non-competitive situation.  And you really don't want to kill the morale of the band just from forcing them to struggle through marching and playing a show with so few people.  Hell, in year one you could even go out on the field at halftime to play a few fun songs in place and show other students how much fun you're having.  Then once you reach about 35-40 start worrying about having them march a show.  But with a group of 20 you want to be very careful of not doing something that's gonna push some of them away from band.  Biggest priority by far should be to make band something that's fun and education for them so that you can start to increase numbers.  In fact, keep on working on basics so that the band you DO have can all become solid musicians so that they're more ready for the field once you reach that point."
marchingband,37pt2s,saxguy2001,2,Sat May 30 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"My director built our program from the ground up for 11years, and we are now 350 members strong and growing. They started out with ~30 people. He said that the first year, he made everyone a leader. Next year, they stayed leaders and taught the new kids. Then there were interviews where they picked new leaders, and now we audition on marching and have an interview. In my opinion, the best way to motivate a band is to build a great leadership framework and work through them. People who are given responsibility and a say feel like they have a deeper connection to what comes out of it, and that's what band leadership is.   Also, develop fun traditions, like stopping at Walmart after football games or a coordinated band dance in the stands. Also make serious traditions, like a silent call-and-response about pride and honor or something like that. We have one of those, and the focus in that monent always gives me chills."

marchingband,37pt2s,LilStein,1 point,Fri May 29 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"Instead of trying to field a show on a program's first year with only 20 people, I would start out doing something like this or this for half time, because with 20 people, it would be MUCH more practical than fielding a show. Once you get your numbers up, then you can start thinking about fielding a show. Once you get good at fielding shows, you can shift focus from half-time to competition."

marchingband,37pt2s,nalyd8991,1 point,Sat May 30 02:27:46 2015 UTC,I dont think competition would be good for him. If the students are reluctant to be in marching band to begin with then competition would put more stress on them. and if the ease off the stress they probably won't get scores that improve moral. i think being a friday night band is the best option for the first 5 years or so.

marchingband,37pt2s,TubaJesus,0,Wed Jun 3 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Well for our marching band if your in conce t band you have to be in marching band (unless you have some valid reason not to be like your in football, medical, or you don't want to do it so bad you would hurt the program in which case you fill out an opt out form). Also modeling your band after university bands of drum corps may help. A big ten style band would get a better reaction from a crowd at a football game than a crops style band. If you can get the crowed into it they will like it as well. Also the our going to need to get recruitment into band way up. Once you get everything up and running every year  try to get the band to go to all the elementary schools and show off with the fight song and other fun tunes like ""hey baby"" and ""sweet Caroline"" these first few levels ears should be about making it look fun and cool (or as my BD lik s to say hip) Also band camp is something you may want to have a good look at. We would go to a small college and stay there for about three nights. We would learn the drill and teach the freshman who couldn't Go to the marching instruction days. Have a section Olympics to allow them to compete against each other for bragging rights. Also we would do drill downs and try to be the one. Guy who didn't make a single mistake. Try to get involved with the rest of the school. If they have a homecoming theme about movies pick movie music. I'll try and come back to give you some video examples of some other things we would do."

marchingband,37mpbl,yankeesfan13,2,Fri May 29 02:11:47 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with what everyone else is recommending. Practice outside and get used to the heat. It will help you perform better when the time comes. Go all out when you practice and you'll get better results when you perform.

marchingband,37mpbl,_bagelthief,1 point,Thu May 28 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"All these other people have no idea what they're talking about (they're not guard). Of course you need indoor space to practice. Now, don't get me wrong, practicing outside is necessary too so you can get used to the wind affecting your equipment. However, new stuff (like new tosses) NEED to be learned indoors correctly before they can ever be applied to the outdoors where wind and sunlight are factors. My guard usually learns choreography inside and then rehearses that choreography outside with the band once it's cleaned. That being said, I have no idea where you can practice. Maybe call a local gym and see if they have anywhere for you? Try practicing in your band hall before/ after school."

marchingband,37kafc,owlgirlia,3,Thu May 28 13:25:23 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I was gonna say.  Don't give generic compliments just to compliment them, but listen for reasons to compliment them.  If they're nailing a tough rhythm, point that out.  If they're doing a good job with dynamic contrast in a particular spot, point that out.  As for helping them to get better, you have to know what you want it to sound like before you can come up with a plan for how to help them get to that point.  But then when you do give them some direction on something to fix, listen for exactly that.  If they didn't get it either it just needs repetition or you need to let them know they still didn't get it.  If they DID get it and fixed their mistake, then let them know.  Don't leave them hanging wondering whether or not what they did was correct.  And last but certainly not least when running sectionals is pacing.  Don't waste your time with lengthy explanations of how to play something when all it needs is repetition.  All the time you spend talking or allowing them to talk is time NOT spent playing their instrument and instead getting off task.  It's one of the most difficult things for less experienced leaders and it's one of those things that even lots of experienced leaders and teachers always wish they could improve.  You really kind of just have to get a feel for it.  Basically, don't go so fast that you're leaving everybody behind without actually making any improvements, but keep things moving at a pace that forces everybody to maintain focus on the task at hand without allowing them to get bored."
marchingband,37kafc,saxguy2001,5,Fri May 29 05:54:35 2015 UTC,"Along with that, when a mistake or problem occurs, follow three simple steps: 1. Praise them for the correct things 2. Suggest ways to fix the problem(dont command as thiz will make you seem like an asshole sometimes) 3. praise again  Another method i used is that at thise sectionals, don't just make it about playing and working and learning, but balance some time amout to simy habg out be social. Plan a day for bowling or whatever, but always keep them happy, satisfied, and comfortable; because then they'll enjoy sectionals more  And like i said, avoiding commanding them on what to do, its ore leading them.in what they should be doing"

Actually treat them all equal. Don't hang around your same group of friends, visit them all and befriend them all. Be strict yet loving - just a bit more of the former during rehearsal Teach WHY, not WHAT. Don't just say ""you're doing it wrong change it to this"", say ""Change this because it will improve such and such; the way you did it has these weaknesses that will prevent you from being amazing"". People buy your motive, not your authority or title. Be encouraging in all your feedback if any suitable effort is evident Heart and soul in, heart and soul back. If your students see that their leader is fiery passionate and sticks to their word - they madly respect that Start identifying in the back of your head possible successors to you. Encourage everyone to try out for leadership and constantly talk about what you've learned to communicate your style (once you feel you're an effective leader that is). Doesn't matter how well you lead if the one chosen after you is terrible, and I wouldn't want what I've built to fall apart.   Good luck and most importantly have fun! It's gonna be great!"

Also if they were like me they don't know when they've pushed to far so that's what I would keep an eye on. 5 you don't have to have sectionals very often but make them worthwhile. If you can get something done and make time for fun then you will get them to go further than a weekly sectional of hard drilling.

However, I did not make a section leader this next year.   Am I disappointed? Yes.   Am I a little relieved about being able to relax and not have to worry about many other things? You bet.   Basically the way I'm approaching it is that even though I'm not a leader, I'm gonna keep doing my thing and I'm going to maintain our tenor line and be even better than we were last year. If we play clean and have fun doing it, I couldn't care less about a small little leadership position."

It was a game where two Sousa players line up in front of each other and they both bow to their right, then to their left and back to the right with increasing speed back and forth until one of them messes up and they smash into each other usually head on. The reason why we had to kill it was because when we did the game before a parade (to show off to an out of state band) and both Parties were correct just not enough, it was a glancing blow causing one bell to have a major crack and on the other about a third of the bell was ripped off.

It is more of a hassle than a blessing. Proper marching technique and style becomes a lot more important because you are carrying a larger instrument and it's WAY more noticeable than a tenor or an alto. Play loud as well, the instrument is a graceful giant ;) and if your school, like mine, had a quiet tuba section, you'll get commended for being louder than then often. Just fight through the pain and you'll enjoy it a lot  Love, Fellow Bari Player"
marchingband,37bqe5,Huggy_Bear48,6,Tue May 26 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"A harness will really hurt your mobility, and ultimately cause more hassle than it helps. My biggest issue was being able to push it out far enough to avoid hitting it with my legs. The biggest strain will be on your neck and right thumb. Honestly, the only way to work around those issues is to just push through the pain in the first couple of weeks and build up endurance.  One thing I do heavily recommend is buying some mouthpiece pads. They will save your teeth and mouthpiece from a lot of potential damage that can come from marching with such a heavy thing connected to your mouth"
marchingband,37bqe5,nalyd8991,3,Tue May 26 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"Fellow tiny girl bari marcher! I'm 5'6"", 110lbs soaking wet. USE A HARNESS. you may not feel like you need it, but after my senior homecoming game (first a Saturday afternoon football game, then a competition), I had never been more thankful that I had one. Good luck! If you have any more questions, lemme know!  edit: after reading the rest of the comments (I got a little excited to answer), I understand that harnesses are bulky and unattractive. But if you don't have the upper body strength, it's so much better for you in the long run to evenly distribute the weight than to have it all hang from your neck. Holding it perpendicular is the proper way to do it and you will regret holding it slanted later. I went right into marching bari with a harness after learning how to play and it made my posture better, allowing me to provide the proper air support in other settings and properly support the bari in more long-haul, traditional settings, like a band adjudication."

marchingband,37bqe5,Alvins_Hot_Juice_Box,2,Wed May 27 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Don't use a harness. Honestly, they are really inconvenient and I've found they lend to poor posture and a weak stature. I see the harness-wearing baris sometime, holding their horns to the side and leaning over; not good stuff. As you develop upper body strength, It will be easier to hold the bari properly, that is keeping the body of the horn perpendicular to the ground. Also, while in set, make sure to keep the horn a good ~4 inches away from your waist. It's a pain, I know. Marching bari is really difficult, but they sound beautiful when done right."
marchingband,37bqe5,sinces,2,Tue May 26 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"Here is the biggest most helpful tip I have yet to see posted here yet, GET A GOOD NECKSTRAP. It may seem like common sense but the larger and more cushiony the neckstrap the less neck/back pain you will have while playing, and you would be surprised at the amount of bari's Ive seen marching with these dinky little neckstraps that turn their necks purple from the focused weight of the bari and don't believe me when I say im comfortable with mine."
marchingband,37bqe5,IAMYourFatherAMAA,2,Wed May 27 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I marched bari my senior year switching from alto, and I disagree with all the people saying not to use a harness. I used one and honestly I don't know what I would have done without it. Mine's a neotech in case anyone else has had different experiences with other brands. However, at the end of the day it comes down to your own preference! Get a nice neckstrap and compare it with your harness and see which one you like better. Play with rotating the neck, the mouthpiece, how much you hike the the harness/neck strap, etc. Personally, I also played it slanted to the side and used my right hand to push the bari outwards away from my leg slightly, while the harness was pulling it up so it didn't much that much weight on my right thumb. However, my body type is a little different than yours (6' 0"" 150lbs) so your mileage may vary. To summarize: take a half hour or so out of your day and literally just wear and walk around and play the thing in different configurations. And do it soon, before your have to dress and cover all while trying to just keep yourself upright with the thing. Good luck, its a super fun instrument!"

marchingband,37bqe5,sinces,1 point,Wed May 27 11:26:55 2015 UTC,"I marched bari a couple years ago. It's definitely considerably more difficult than tenor to march. I would recommend playing with it slanted like others have. For me it was more difficult to march and play at first, but as the season went on, it became a lot easier. It just took a little bit of time to get used to and to build up some muscles in the right places. I'd also make sure that you stay very smooth with your marching, because it's harder to march smoothly with a heavier instrument, as you might tend to bob up and down, which will impact your playing. It might be difficult for a while, but if you stick with it and work hard, you will probably be fine after practicing for a bit."
marchingband,37bqe5,aden417,2,Tue May 26 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you are saying, except the slant bit.

marchingband,3766nu,bonelife,2,Mon May 25 13:30:07 2015 UTC,No. Because the director says no.

marchingband,3766nu,transam79301,2,Mon May 25 08:40:41 2015 UTC,No because daily rehearsals are during school and when we do the extra rehearsal it isn't until 8 at night on a Tuesday.

During my first year the front battery (snares and tenors) would be shirtless a majority of the time outside and almost all of the time during indoor and nobody cared. This year our section leader got yelled at by staff for being shirtless after ending practice with a double run-through (and this is the same staff that's been in place when being shirtless was allowed). Our indoor drumline only needed one changing room during shows in 2012, but now we either need two or have the girls change first while the boys wait in the hall. Funny thing is the kids don't care at all and would rather we save time by letting us all change together."

marchingband,3762qm,mvronsky,3,Mon May 25 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"I have to take a different angle with the leadership philosophy. Instead of showing them who's boss, take suggestions. Your a sophomore. You don't know everything. I'd be willing to bet that there are seniors in your section that know more than you do. Does that mean they make better section leaders? Absolutely not. However, use the section's knowledge to improve your own and take the section in directions that are more democratic instead of just the decisions of you, the section leader. This will help you both make the best decision and will help to alleviate the ""the sophomore has no idea what it's doing"" sentiment. However, at the end of the day you are the section leader and your word is the final say."

I'd say don't let it get to your ego. The best way to earn respect is to show them your knowledge. Prepare ahead of time for rehearsals and sectionals, and ask for input from your section. Always tell people what they did well first, then tell them how they can improve. The less respected leaders in my program have one thing in common, and it's that they were always trying to fix everything, without bringing any attention to the good things. If nobody gets good feedback, nobody is going to enjoy it.  I hope this helps, good luck with your season, my marching career just ended this morning, make the most of it!"

Total run throughs so far : 9   Lather rinse repeat three times over the course of a day   So the total times is 27.  It does seem like way to many times. Its not trust me.  It gives you plenty of time to identify and resolve any problems that may occur.  ProTip: 1) always use a metronome 2) get another bandie to cruetike? your run throughs
marchingband,36xrpb,concretecondom,1 point,Sat May 23 09:02:02 2015 UTC,"Critique   When you have someone else listen, give them a copy of the music.  And have them mark the spots you miss.  This way you can work on what you really don't have memorized, not what you think you don't have memorized.   As others have mentioned, repetition is key. So is understanding where phrases are.    Repetition can get boring, so practice your music in ways that are not you literally playing your instrument.  Sing through your part, do that while fingering the instrument, etc."
marchingband,36xrpb,Valint,2,Sat May 23 12:54:21 2015 UTC,"Find something that works for you.

marchingband,36xrpb,williewillus,2,Sun May 24 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"Stop looking at the music. Everyone says to just play it over and over, but you won't get very far if you don't lift your eyes off the page. You're going to mess up, but the more you play without staring at the music, the faster you will internalize it."
marchingband,36xrpb,xMcNerdx,1 point,Sun May 24 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"I like to learn chunks and then put them into context.  First I'll select whatever chunk of music I'm about to memorize. I'll look at the first measure and play it a few times. I'll do the same thing with the second measure, and then play them together a few times. If the music is easy, this process usually goes much faster than I'm making it sound, as you can skip some repetition and just sightread your way through.  I keep learning little bits and then putting them into context by playing from the top of the chunk all the way to where I just learned. It's earned me a reputation for memorizing music insanely fast compared to everyone else, with my record for an entire marching band movement being a little over 10 minutes from start to finish."

Some bands who change their show each week may not want to memorize everything. ( at least that was the excuse in college) back in high school with the one show per year we memorized everything.   You are less likely to make mistakes with them.  Honestly even though in college we had to have them I memorized all the common songs cause I hated using the damn thing."
marchingband,36qb2w,Ekgladiator,2,Thu May 21 11:14:36 2015 UTC,"I don't feel it's professional if you only have one show the entire year. I feel that the band should work together on memorizing it, unless the band cannot meet for that. Then, I believe, it should be the individual's responsibility. Edit: I don't hate anyone because of this, I don't want anyone to be angry about this statement."
marchingband,36qb2w,Ekgladiator,3,Thu May 21 16:16:45 2015 UTC,Oh I agree if you are only doing one show a year there is no excuse to not memorize it. But again it is a huge hassle to memorize every show if you change it once a week.
marchingband,36qb2w,SirTiger,18,Thu May 21 22:13:49 2015 UTC,"College marching band student here. Our band director made it very clear he wants us to use our music at any and all times on the field. We change shows every 2-3 weeks, so we don't have the time to memorize music. Plus, he says he was a director of another college band at one point who insisted on NOT using music and one of their shows was an absolute trainwreck because of this."
marchingband,36qb2w,rm_a,14,Thu May 21 11:49:03 2015 UTC,"To add onto this, there are very few college marching bands that can create a complete show in a week and have the show 90% memorized by the entire band by Saturday. I hate lyres on the field, but I would take having a new show for every game over playing the same show (or close to it) the entire season."
marchingband,36qb2w,SirTiger,8,Thu May 21 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Lyres overall are a hassle because it's an extra thing to carry with you on gamedays. BUT, like you said, I'd rather be able to have 3 or 4 different shows per season as opposed to 1."

marchingband,36qb2w,saxguy2001,2,Thu May 21 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"I was on staff with a band in the MWC that did 4-6 shows a year, had 8 hours of rehearsal time per week, and still never took lyres out onto the field.  All it takes is some planning ahead.  Whenever we had back to back games where we planned on doing a different show for each, the second one was always slightly easier music and significantly easier drill AND we would start learning it before even performing that first show.  All this while also learning the type of show a high school would perform for their competition show that was used to show off to the kids at the high school competition we hosted each year.  If you want to march any drill that isn't painfully easy, lyres start to get in the way."
marchingband,36qb2w,MyFacade,3,Sat May 23 11:47:12 2015 UTC,There's a middle ground that allows memorized shows while not recycling everything. We used to perform a park and bark concert at the end of the season that was an hour of memorized music.
marchingband,36qb2w,URETHRAL_DIARRHEA,5,Thu May 21 21:26:31 2015 UTC,Seems like sort of a cop-out when you consider that drumlines generally require unilateral memorization of the parts (because it's really obvious if a drummer doesn't know the part) and are able to pull it off.
marchingband,36qb2w,DRUMS11,3,Thu May 21 17:33:33 2015 UTC,That and the few attempts at a drum lyre out there really suck.
marchingband,36qb2w,Toothier5,6,Thu May 21 21:14:33 2015 UTC,My band uses it as we march our show in the beginning before everyone has it memorized. We will march through our sets looking at the music.
marchingband,36qb2w,vinylscratchp0n3,2,Thu May 21 11:34:02 2015 UTC,"My band only uses them for the song that the dance team makes us play for their routine before we start our show, then while they're announcing us the parents come and collect them. Our show was still memorized."
marchingband,36qb2w,katnapper323,2,Thu May 21 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"We use lyres during rehearsals, and then we play memorized during performances"
marchingband,36qb2w,katnapper323,2,Thu May 21 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"We learn it in class, then use it in drill the next day."
marchingband,36qb2w,Caterpiller101,2,Thu May 21 23:50:52 2015 UTC,We still encourage members to memorize early in the season

marchingband,36n2te,krob99,6,Wed May 20 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Well if your school has an extr session before band camp to teach freshman marching go do it. It's fun depending how they run the show you get to know people in leadership positions. Also make a bunch of friends and don't cut out the underclassmen and freshman. The more people you cam ask for help the better because you will need it. Also if you can just start asking questions to people in your band, they will give you better advice than faceless people on the Internet.  EDIT apparently this is a thing. Don't drink cold milk on a hot day, I don't get it but I'm sure there's a reason."
marchingband,36n2te,TubaJesus,5,Wed May 20 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"For the milk thing: I have been told that if it's hot enough outside, milk can curdle before it gets to your stomach, and make you sick. Best case scenario - you'll throw up and it'll be over with. Worst case - you'll hold it in and feel like shit all day.  In any band setting, (and honestly, most other settings) if you feel like you're gonna throw up, just get out of the way and try to throw up. When it's out, you'll usually feel loads better and be able to just get back to what you were doing. Just make sure to stay hydrated with water, not Gatorade or sport/energy drinks."
marchingband,36n2te,mildlyAttractiveGirl,3,Thu May 21 03:03:59 2015 UTC,I am familiar with throwing up etiquette (i cant believe that is a sentence)  some poor soul at band camp threw up in his trumpet because he was homesick. it was nasty because he didn't take the thing away from his lips until the chunks were already flying.
marchingband,36n2te,TubaJesus,2,Thu May 21 03:30:04 2015 UTC,Thaaaat is disgusting hahahaha
marchingband,36n2te,mildlyAttractiveGirl,3,Thu May 21 03:34:39 2015 UTC,thing is that the trumpet still smells like barf (i've checked) after 3 baths and a trip t the repair shop for professional cleaning. every time it would go out to be cleaned the student in question would brag how its going to be all better when it comes back and then nothing changes.
marchingband,36n2te,TubaJesus,2,Thu May 21 03:37:09 2015 UTC,Smells like it's time to get a new trumpet.
marchingband,36n2te,mildlyAttractiveGirl,1 point,Thu May 21 03:42:49 2015 UTC,I don't think my school has that.  And I have some friends that are helping me ease into it because this is (mostly) new to me.  And I don't consume straight milk.  Just in chocolate delight cereal when I can't sleep.
marchingband,36n2te,the_ares,4,Thu May 21 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"With me becoming a Senior as well I have learned a lot about Marching Band the past 3 seasons, and I think I can be somewhat of a help.  •Do not procrastinate if you have to pass things off. Everyone will be passing it off at the last minute, and you just get to sit back knowing you already did it.  •Listen to your leaders (even if they are younger than you) they know what they're talking about. And if you don't have leaders listen to your director(s).  •What you do in practice is what you wish to do in a performance.  •It's your Senior year! Have fun with it! It will be what you remember for the rest of your life so make it count.  Hope this helps even a little bit!"

You'll do fine :)  Honestly a lot of people on this sub over hype things. Its just band. Don't be afraid to ask questions but most importantly have fun! Always put your all into it. The more you out in, the more you'll get out.  Enjoy! :)"
marchingband,36n2te,sashalinn0425,2,Thu May 21 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"I just started last year as a junior so I feel you.  Make friends with the underclassmen; they won't be puzzled as to why you just started marching (in my school you pretty much have to march to stay in band).  You're going to need to drink lots of water so get a Camelbak at the very least.  Bring a little notebook to write your drill down (you might get a dot sheet, you might not).  It's easier to read in English what you're supposed to do rather than coordinates all the time.  Eat well before, during, and after rehearsal and make sure to exercise!  We march corps-style so this might be a bit excessive but good luck!"

Do as much as you can so that when the time comes, you know what you're doing because you've done it often.  Talk with section leaders about how they dealt with nerves. Everyone had to cope with them at some point.  I know someone who can sing really well. Amazingly well. Good actor, too. He went on a European tour with a musical production. And he still gets sick before every performance. He's a wreck. So, being nervous doesn't mean you're no good.   Do your best."

marchingband,36jlu6,dribrednuht,3,Tue May 19 21:31:13 2015 UTC,Any arrangement that doesn't turn the half cadence into a perfect authentic cadence is a good arrangement to me.
marchingband,36jlu6,manondorf,6,Wed May 20 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"I love the arrangement, but I gotta say, the Dixie quote at the end was surprising. Perhaps inappropriate?"
marchingband,36jlu6,ClocksStriking13,2,Wed May 20 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"Perhaps; I never thought much of it, seeing as the arrangement was done at Long Beach State, nowhere near the deep south."
marchingband,36jlu6,ClocksStriking13,3,Wed May 20 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, almost any other song I wouldn't care, but it feels wrong in the national anthem. Not that I think the arranger meant it to evoke the Confederacy; i just hold the anthem in very high regard."
marchingband,36jlu6,techiejames,2,Wed May 20 11:22:34 2015 UTC,Dixie quote?
marchingband,36jlu6,ClocksStriking13,2,Wed May 20 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"After where ""brave"" would fall, you can hear the horns play a little bit from Dixie."

Or, you could do maybe the theme from Independence Day, or the theme from Armageddon. And like you said, Star Wars could also possibly work.  EDIT: The reason why I'm including The Planets is because John Williams based much of Star Wars's theme off of it."
marchingband,36kd08,TubaJesus,1 point,Thu May 21 02:08:04 2015 UTC,Well there's the overture from Star Trek generations. One of my favorite movies vies of the franchise but the theme I think is pretty good but I have no idea where to get rights for it. For our DMs have to arrange all music we play for marching band themselves. Find it here http://youtu.be/ooIUtXEuTYQ
marchingband,36b5re,AustinTheGeek,24,Sun May 17 23:11:50 2015 UTC,I'd have to say without. It's more clear.
marchingband,36b5re,Tiej,16,Sun May 17 23:56:52 2015 UTC,"Without. Most competitive marching band and drum corps expression is predetermined, taught, and practiced rather than taken from the conductors. Seeing accurate time is more valuable IMO than getting fancy with a stick. This is why many people find the marching arts ineffective at teaching musicianship."
marchingband,36b5re,dtorb,5,Mon May 18 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you said this. I'm currently struggling with the head director at my school to get our DMs to simply keep time and not give cues or dynamics or anything. (I'm on staff, btw, not a student.)"
marchingband,36b5re,redditispopular,4,Mon May 18 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"Well you shouldn't completely ignore cues or dynamics or even style.  Yes, time is most important, but it's not the only thing the DMs are there for.  Hell, time doesn't even come from the DMs - it comes from the drumline."
marchingband,36b5re,saxguy2001,6,Mon May 18 09:29:00 2015 UTC,"No no NO! The DM should look at the feet of the first snare to get time,  but if winds and guard listen back the whole band falls apart."
marchingband,36b5re,Alvins_Hot_Juice_Box,4,Mon May 18 10:59:02 2015 UTC,"The band, the DM, and the drumline are the holy trinity. All three need to work in tandem which means that the winds have to listen back, especially if the band is super spread out. The idea is that you need to add your voice to the wave of sound originating in the back of the field if you want the band to sound together in the stands, knowing full well that it might not sound right to you as an individual on the field."
marchingband,36b5re,88MilesPrower,3,Mon May 18 12:00:08 2015 UTC,"Depends where you are. If you are close enough to the drum line, it works fine."
marchingband,36b5re,yankeesfan13,4,Mon May 18 12:32:23 2015 UTC,"Listening back is generally safe. Listening forward is what will kill you. To you as a performer they sound the same, but from the audience perspective, the sound delays are much different.  Also, while I've certainly heard of it before, I've never agreed with the idea of the DM taking time from the drumline. The only reason I would see for doing that is if your DM can't keep time, in which case they probably shouldn't be DM.  Edit: whoops, apparently I missed. Meant to reply to /u/Alvins_Hot_Juice_Box."
marchingband,36b5re,manondorf,2,Mon May 18 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it is easier for the battery to do their own thing because that is what they are used to. It is naturally easier for a DM to follow their feet when that is most of what they do, compared to the battery who has many more things to worry about.   Sometimes holding a steady tempo isn't the best option. I'd rather see a band have some fluctuation but stay together than have someone (a DM) try to hold the tempo and have the band not be together. Letting the drum line lead gives you a better chance at staying together."
marchingband,36b5re,yankeesfan13,1 point,Mon May 18 19:04:14 2015 UTC,Never ever ever listen forward. Ever.   Or the guard. Typically they can't count in time either...
marchingband,36b5re,hawcru,2,Mon May 18 21:19:32 2015 UTC,"Yup. Always watch the center snare's feet.   People don't get this, even in college."
marchingband,36b5re,LiquidBionix,1 point,Tue May 19 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, the DM needs to lock tempo with the center snare's feet, but anybody between the DM and the drumline should be listening back to the drumline, not worrying about looking at the DM."
marchingband,36b5re,saxguy2001,2,Wed May 20 06:21:12 2015 UTC,Dynamic ques are important to make a nice effect. It always helps bring more punch when you have someone pushing you to be louder.

marchingband,36b5re,IamA_reptile_AMA,5,Mon May 18 03:46:32 2015 UTC,Without. Easier to see and more stylistically freeing for the drum major.
marchingband,36b5re,TubaJesus,4,Mon May 18 00:18:19 2015 UTC,Without batons. it looks much cleaner. I never really saw the point of the baton for marching band. it didn't really do anything and most people couldn't see it anyways.
marchingband,36b5re,kbpbc25,3,Mon May 18 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"While I've seen both systems in use, I personally went without a baton. Especially when backfield, it was easier for my band to my extended hand over a baton. While it is ultimately your decision, consulting your band and giving each style a few rehearsals will help solidify your decision!"
marchingband,36b5re,whops_it_me,2,Sun May 17 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm best friends with our DM and he conducted for us for three years, using a baton his senior year. It was mostly a stylistic choice on his part, being that our show was Phantom of the Opera and was somewhat different from the shows we'd done in years prior (both jazzy shows from famous music artists). It suited both the theme of the show and the conducting style he chose to use, and nobody in the band really had an issue with it, so I think it's acceptable if it suits the show and the conducting style is still clear and well-defined."
marchingband,36b5re,LockOn1225,2,Mon May 18 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"My assistant band director who marched drum corps for five years put it this way. With baton conducting, you are looking for a spot roughly the size of a pin. Conducting with hands is waaaaaay easier to see on the field. It also defines the ictus more."
marchingband,36b5re,molotoviphone,3,Tue May 19 12:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's a nice stylistic touch but generally it has little effect other than that. Our show was a box six show called ""The Classics,"" so it fit with the aesthetic last year. The drum major was really dedicated as well as hard working, so we did well"
marchingband,36b5re,Meruem123,4,Mon May 18 02:45:25 2015 UTC,A baton can't be seen on the field. A mace is better
marchingband,36b5re,TubaJesus,4,Mon May 18 02:04:51 2015 UTC,To me using a mace is ridiculous. which to me makes me want to ask what are you smoking.
marchingband,36b5re,rm_a,3,Mon May 18 03:13:42 2015 UTC,Using a mace in general is ridiculous?  Or for podium conducting?
marchingband,36b5re,TubaJesus,1 point,Mon May 18 20:33:07 2015 UTC,for podium conducting. The mace in general is very useful I steal it from one pf the drum majors and throw it like a spear into a Susa bell
marchingband,36b5re,Meruem123,1 point,Tue May 19 14:21:46 2015 UTC,I wasn't talking about on the podium. Just because your band doesn't use mace doesn't make bands who do ridiculous.
marchingband,36b5re,TubaJesus,3,Mon May 18 20:43:46 2015 UTC,No we do use a mace. It makes for a good throwing spear and Susa bells make awesome targets for it. But in all seriousness the mace only makes an appearance for parades or for worse regime and we do the high stepping onto the field. The drum majors also do this throwing thing during the star spangled banner.

Next tier would be Cal and San Jose State.  I'm not sure how San Diego State is, but I would assume pretty good since it's not too bad of a music program there.  I'm not even sure who else has a marching band outside of UC Davis and Sacramento State since by far the primary function of a college marching band is to play for the school's football team and I can't think of any other California schools with football teams.  And then of course there's Stanford....."
marchingband,36bfph,saxguy2001,2,Mon May 18 09:25:10 2015 UTC,"San Diego State has a pretty decent marching band.  Size is good, sound is good, show is good.  Their marching (basics and such) isn't great though."
marchingband,36bfph,rm_a,5,Mon May 18 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Though less of marching band advice and more of college advice: please do not pick a college just based off of their marching band.  You may find out that you might not have as much time as you thought you would in college, and are only able to do marching band for a year or two.  If you're going to a Pac-12 school, from what I've seen the bands there tend to travel a lot (except for the goons at Stanford, who can't travel this year).  If you want to go to Oregon you'll have to watch their football team get within striking distance of a national championship on a yearly basis, but always fail to get said championship.  That said if your academics are strong, Cal, USC, and UCLA have top-notch comp sci programs and marching bands.  If your academics aren't as strong, SJSU, SDSU and Fresno State have marching bands and comp sci programs and are less selective than the UC schools."

marchingband,36bfph,dribrednuht,3,Tue May 19 04:58:42 2015 UTC,"To give you another option to consider, I marched at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo (graduated last December). We haven't historically had a huge band program, but in the past 5-10 years or so, it has grown a lot - we went from 145 in 2010 to 220 now, where we have to cap our membership due to our budget. As for skill, it's pretty typical - you have a lot of variation in skill/experience among most members, with a good handful of people who march corps. To be totally honest, we're experiencing a huge transitional period right now, and the growing pains that come with that, but if the opportunity to really have a hand in shaping the program interests you, you might consider looking into it.  As for academics, Cal Poly is pretty strong all around, including computer science. Apple and Google recruit directly here, as well as plenty of other companies and industries. The philosophy is ""Learn By Doing""; you'll get lots of hands-on, practical experience as opposed to learning more theoretical information that you may never apply to anything. It's a tough program (from what I know), but being that band rehearses twice a week plus game days, it's not like band would eat up all your time here, and you'd have the support of a lot of computer science people in band (a huge portion of it is made up of people in computer/engineering fields). If you've got any questions specific to computer science, I'd check out /r/CalPoly."
marchingband,36bfph,Inkysin,3,Mon May 18 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the CS departments, but here's what I know about marching bands in California.  If you're looking for a corps-style band, check out San Diego State, UCLA, Cal Poly, Sacramento State, and Fresno State. Sac and Fresno have pit percussion, the rest don't.  If you're looking for a Big 10 style band (high-stepping, new shows each week), there's Cal, UC Davis, and USC. Cal and UC Davis are also student-run, with an elected student director, drum major, treasurer, etc., which means you'll have many opportunities for valuable leadership experience, and the chance to plan shows, arrange music, and write drill.  I don't know too much about the program at San Jose State...I think they're a bit smaller than the ones above. They have pit percussion, but don't march flutes or clarinets.  Stanford and Humboldt State have scatter bands, which isn't everyone's thing but some people really enjoy being a part of them, since commitment is flexible if you have a busy academic or work schedule.  Almost all of the D1 UCs and CSUs have basketball pep bands; some D2 schools have them too. A few community colleges (I know of Riverside and Pasadena) have marching bands that are basically DCI feeder programs.  Lastly, don't be afraid to contact the directors of the school to ask questions. Some programs may offer scholarships (not always for freshmen but a friend of mine got paid to march at San Diego St. his first year), and occasionally a director can help a borderline student appeal a decision if they commit to joining band."
marchingband,36bfph,Inkysin,5,Tue May 19 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I can't speak to the college band scene, but have you thought about marching DCI?  Cali has a lot of great corps, including DCA and Open Class.  I'm hopefully marching Boston Crusaders next summer, after my first year at conservatory, for they have no marching band."
marchingband,36bfph,jack456123,2,Mon May 18 01:29:46 2015 UTC,i dont think i could do DCI because of money... like to get into a Cali university I NEED scholarships and my playing isnt spectacular (at least to be in DCI ayway)
marchingband,36bfph,TubaJesus,2,Mon May 18 10:18:46 2015 UTC,Definitely hear you on that.  College is all loans for me.  I plan on getting a part time job just to pay for corps.
marchingband,36bfph,TubaJesus,1 point,Mon May 18 11:22:26 2015 UTC,yeah i migh do that 2nd year of college and such if i can pay for it then
marchingband,36bfph,Upholder,2,Mon May 18 11:26:54 2015 UTC,"If money is a huge issue, try DCI Open Class. Their tour fees are much lower (about $700-$1000 compared to the cheapest world class corps [Bloo] at $2700). They still get to travel a lot and it's a great way to get some summer band experience so in the future, when you do have the funding, you can march with a World Class corps.   There is also tons of fundraising that can happen, and if you know a lot of people who support your interest in performing arts, sponsor ships can go a long way. My friend who marched Bluecoats last summer (with the color guard) raised almost 70% of his tour fees from sponsors and fundraising. He sold custom bracelets for $5 a piece. You can go around to all the local businesses and ask them for sponsorships. Most corps give you a pre-written letter to send to people, but it's always good to add a little hand written thing as well.   Another story comes from my other friend who I met at the Jersey Surf camps (their tuition is higher because they are one of the lower world class corps, so they still have a big schedule and lots of traveling, but they get less funding from DCI than a bigger corps, per say Blue Devils or Crown. we can thank George Hopkins for that ). Anyways, he's been marching for 3 years, this year being his 4th, and he's only 16! He told us that we should include a hand written note with a description of drum corps in a way that that particular person would understand. Then also include some incentive to donate, like you'll give them some pictures of the season and a CD of the show or something. There are tons of websites like gofundme.com and patreon.com that are basically made for this stuff.       Also, working a job helps too.  As you can see, I enjoy the sport and hope it grows in popularity. Good luck with your search!  TL;DR -  Do fundraising. go to friends, family, and small businesses asking for donations. Write letters to relatives, old band teachers, anyone who'd be willing to support you. and offer something in return. Also, working a job helps too.  Edit: check out /r/drumcorps for more advice. there are a million threads over there about everything."

marchingband,3654iv,molotoviphone,5,Sat May 16 13:29:43 2015 UTC,Interesting how no one mentioned Finale Notepad. I prefer Musescore over Finale myself but my director and my friends swear by Finale.
marchingband,3654iv,88MilesPrower,2,Sat May 16 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"Finale Notepad isn't free.  Last I checked it was $20.  Cheap price for how useful it can be, but still not free.  I would recommend it."
marchingband,3654iv,saxguy2001,2,Sun May 17 00:24:00 2015 UTC,Right now it looks free but that could be just a promotion or i'm missing fine print somewhere.
marchingband,3654iv,88MilesPrower,2,Sun May 17 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess it IS free now.  In that case I would recommend Finale Notepad hands down over all the rest that somebody could get for free.  I think it's smart of them to offer it for free as it entices people to use their program, and then they have an easier time hooking the ones who later look to buy the full program."

marchingband,364sjv,molotoviphone,4,Sat May 16 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"At out high school the band actually has a private parking lot blocked off from anyone else during the marching season. It's marked with dots every 4 steps. We just use chalk and mark a symbol at our sets, it's really nice. We don't go onto the field until we all know our sets by memory, and it's just got the normal football markings."
marchingband,364sjv,MuricanFork,1 point,Sat May 16 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"Same. We have a senior parking lot and so after school ends, we give people around 15 min to get their car out of the way and then we march"
marchingband,364sjv,Tdog437,5,Mon May 25 17:27:20 2015 UTC,We have a grass field that we burn the marks onto.  EDIT: We spray paint our dots on the field.
marchingband,364sjv,TheLetterPizza,4,Sat May 16 16:49:46 2015 UTC,That's metal af
marchingband,364sjv,ColonelButterscotch,3,Mon May 18 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"We use a grass/dirt/mud field (starts as grass, ends as mud) with white paint for everything on the field. It is as realistic as possible (centre circle, kick off x, tick marks, numbers, etc). When learning drill, we each have 5 little coloured plastic squares that we put down."
marchingband,364sjv,yankeesfan13,2,Sat May 16 10:59:00 2015 UTC,We use multiple colored poker chips!
marchingband,364sjv,Milk_My_Duds,1 point,Sun May 24 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"In high school we had an awkward chunk of school lawn with metal pegs driven into the ground at corners, sidelines at yardline points, and hashes. There was a rope contraption that people would stretch from peg to peg, then run a field liner over the ropes.   On foreign fields that weren't set up (like at band camp at a university with yard spaces set up, or when the school decided we couldn't practice out front with school board members touring and the football team needed the real field), we used a tape measurer and the liner.  In college I've never actually seen them line the field. I guess TA's do it when we're sleeping or something, poor bastards. I know the field gets lined, there's no visible pegs, and the lines are pretty much carved in the practice field ground at this point even without paint.  At a high school nearby, they do literally carve out the lines with an edger. Another uses tape on asphalt."
marchingband,364sjv,gingerfer,1 point,Sat May 16 04:33:23 2015 UTC,"Mainly our grass football field, which ready has all of the adequate sidelines and hashes and yardlines."
marchingband,364sjv,hypopotamus,1 point,Sat May 16 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"So our school redid our AstroTurf field last year, but we get to practice on it at most 5 times a season because of the football team...  Usually, we practice on the outfield of the grass baseball field and mark it up with white spray-paint for yard lines and hashes. We use orange paint to mark 4's. Since we have no pre-drawn lines and we can draw circles for drills and exercises."
marchingband,364sjv,mvronsky,1 point,Sat May 16 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"We have a sloped, patched up, uneven parking lot that we use for practices. Otherwise, we have a ~1 year old AstroTurf field that is so comfy. We use it for Thursday nights, shows, and sudden or special emergency practices.  For marking the field, we use orange weighted triangular yard markers for each yard line. We use them for mostly everything."

marchingband,364sjv,ColonelButterscotch,2,Mon May 18 00:45:50 2015 UTC,Ew blue tape.   But I guess it's not dangerous to leave in the ground
marchingband,364sjv,OUrocks,1 point,Mon May 18 02:29:18 2015 UTC,My school uses a section off piece of the parking lot that has big red dots every 4 steps and little white dots in between. To mark sets we use chalk. It can get annoying when you chalked 10-20 sets in a practice and then it rains at night.
marchingband,364sjv,TubaJesus,1 point,Tue May 19 03:29:11 2015 UTC,I've been reading most of the comments and I. Surprised at all the differant sets that pele have. We have a turf football field and that thing gets a beating. During nice weather every class period of the day there is a gym class on it and we use it our rehearsal period and in the evening twice a week. All the football games are played there (unless there are several going on at once then they will use the other turf field or one of the other two grass fields)soccer also uses the field. I really don't understand why bands don't rehearse on the field because it's not a fragile thing. Ours gets replaced one a decade and you read the punishment it gets.
marchingband,364sjv,sashalinn0425,1 point,Tue May 19 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the day.  In the fall, we have a section of the parking lot closed off.  It's about 10 yards short of a football field but it works.  We have dots spraypainted 4 steps (8 to 5) apart and we put yard numbers on the front sideline.  We also have high school hashes painted.  We also get to use our school's football field when there isn't football practice.  Dots are yellow and put on lines, painted onto the artificial turf.  During rehearsals, we mark sets with washers, which I have found annoying and awful considering my drill changed completely from the beginning of the season to the end.  Eventually, I just gave up.  Apparently we used to have our own grass field to practice on but Kansas gets some abnormally humid mornings and evenings so the bugs were just too much to handle."
marchingband,364sjv,vinylscratchp0n3,1 point,Thu May 21 03:25:44 2015 UTC,We don't mark anything at all on our grass field.
