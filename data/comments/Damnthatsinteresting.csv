AFAIK, Nazi was a political party. Anyone who was in that party deserves the title. There were multiple german political parties that got dragged into a war they didn't want because they weren't in power. It would be like assuming that every American in Afghanistan is republican just because they were the polical party that started that ""War on Terror.""  If I'm wrong, someone else can correct me. That's my best understanding of it.  Edit: I did some googling. Source   From one perspective, however, because members of the German armed forces weren’t allowed to affiliate with a political party, one could say all German soldiers in WWII were non-Nazis. The Nazi political party, however, had its own armed soldiers in the Waffen-SS and these soldiers therefore were Nazi soldiers."

My mom had 3 kids and no stretch marks and she swears by vitamin e oil (you can buy it in capsules from the drugstore).   Helps with sunburns also because it moisturizes your skin like crazy!

The brighter areas on the negative(called negative because the pictures are exactly opposite) burn darker on the paper. Conversely dark places will not have as great of an effect so a lighter color on the photo paper would be expected. Pretty cool imo.

The video is a hoax, and is powered by a hidden pump.  The machine violates the rules of capillary action (it would only lift the fluid a few tenths of an inch, plus the tube is FAR too big for that) and a siphon requires the output to be lower than the input.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=287qd4uI7-E#t=10s Same machine, same author, and clearly says ""not to trick but to inspire"".

The blades on those fit into corresponding slots on the main frame (where we got the term ""mainframe"" from).  The blades themselves were made of tinned copper, and riveted through a phenolic plastic or pressboard holder and the cloth insulated wires soldered to them on the back.  Very secure system, but bulky.  The wiring itself was usually loomed, which is a lost art these days.  I used to be pretty good at it but then, I had a lot of practice."

Damnthatsinteresting,3dy011,freudian_nipple_slip,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:22 2015 UTC,That's not too surprising. Guitar tubes were never actually picked for their special sonic characteristics. They were the same tubes being used in all other applications at the time.
Damnthatsinteresting,3dy011,Krono5_8666V8,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:27 2015 UTC,For sure! What is cool however is that their sonic characteristics did sort of manifest themselves in voltage and how that affects the rest of the circuitry. Some are interchangeable and sound different.

Damnthatsinteresting,3duqvv,thebigbadben,11,Mon Jul 20 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"What is going on here is an example of a phenomenon often given the name ""The Tennis Racket Theorem"" because it can be demonstrated easily with how a tennis racket rotates around when you throw it into the air. In essence, all objects have three different axes they can rotate around: x,y, and z. In asymetric objects there is an axis that has the most rotational ""strength"" to it and one that has the least. These are stable rotations (i.e. the object likes rotating like this). The third axis is neither a minimum or maximum for the rotation so any disturbance from this axis will lead the object to rotate towards the other two axes. When the object flips, it is switching between these two stable axes.   Try casually tossing your smartphone about its length, height, and depth and see what happens.  EDIT: The handle is not switching between its two stable axes, but is returning to its most stable axis (this is analogous to the spin on a bullet keeping it straight). It still flips directions for the above reason though."

Damnthatsinteresting,3duqvv,Bluecat16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I can think of a few things happening here.

Damnthatsinteresting,3duqvv,P1r4nha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:  ""Every solid body inherently has three principal axes through its center of mass, and each of these axes has a corresponding moment of inertia. The moment of inertia about an axis is a measurement of how difficult it is to accelerate the body about that axis. The closer the concentration of mass to the axis, the smaller the torque required to get it spinning at the same rate about that axis.  The moment of inertia of a body depends on the mass distribution of the body and on the arbitrarily selected axis about which the moment of inertia is defined. The moments of inertia about two of the principal axes are the maximum and minimum moments of inertia of the body about any axis. The third is perpendicular to the other two and has a moment of inertia somewhere between the maximum and minimum.  ...  A body is never stable when spinning about the intermediate principal axis, and dissipated energy will cause the polhode to start migrating to the object’s axis of maximum inertia. The transition point between two stable axes of rotation is called the separatrix along which the angular velocity passes through the axis of intermediate inertia."""

Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,GallowBoob,49,Sun Jul 19 13:34:59 2015 UTC,I appreciate the apparent lack of frosting the most.  I hate those elaborate sculpted cakes that are 90% fondant.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,David-Puddy,56,Sun Jul 19 15:47:50 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? This cake is entirely covered in white fondant.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,bettybetsy,39,Sun Jul 19 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"the simple shape implies only a thin layer is needed, though"
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,David-Puddy,10,Sun Jul 19 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"Having eaten a Disney Wedding Cake....  It's a pretty thick layer.  Granted, I haven't eaten this cake specifically."
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,TomBad87,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Well, why not?"
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,gtsomething,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:32 2015 UTC,My Disney Wedding was before they had the projection mapped cakes.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,TomBad87,5,Mon Jul 20 03:09:24 2015 UTC,Wait - is this a real Disney wedding cake that  adults purchase for their actual wedding or is it some kind of thing done at the Disney parks?
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,GerontoMan,6,Mon Jul 20 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"https://www.disneyweddings.com/  Disney has a weddings department. I got married on one of the cruise ships, the Disney Fantasy.  So to answer your question: Yes (on both counts)  EDIT: This was my wedding"
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,TomBad87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"Something you get when you have your wedding at their wedding pavilion (Which is next to the Grand Floridian hotel).  Their projection stuff is unreal, they do the same thing on Cinderella's castle and Spaceship earth."
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,mojavespirit,6,Mon Jul 20 05:11:48 2015 UTC,I think it would be really cool if they had some small tracking points so you could move the cake and still have it work.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,skmagiik,7,Sun Jul 19 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"That would be cool, as of right now this takes like 2 hours to set up IIRC (Wife works in the catering department at Disney World, and they work with Weddings fairly often).  The tech can only improve though."
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,TomBad87,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Why don't they build in some lines to match the cake tiers into the opening scene of the projection, so you only have to pause that part to position the cake in the right spot?"
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,jellybeanbean,2,Sun Jul 19 21:50:07 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure how it works. But they have to map it out each time. I am assuming it probably has something to do with each space being different and not having the projector in the same spot every time.  Projection Mapping is something that I have never researched.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,TomBad87,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:16 2015 UTC,can you explain to me a little better how this is setup? I'd love to know!

Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,Proxify,29,Mon Jul 20 14:32:10 2015 UTC,I get the feeling that women who want the full Disney princess treatment for their weddings are incredibly high maintenance.
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,Poppenhoffer,6,Sun Jul 19 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine married a girl who went all out Disney for their wedding. Choreographed first dance to 'I can show you the world', themed tables, disneyland honeymoon, mouse ears and a candy bar at the reception..   High maintenance is a massive understatement. Theory confirmed."
Damnthatsinteresting,3du0ts,howunosnowflake,2,Sun Jul 19 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"I only know one girl like that. She's dating a teammate of mine and in a year she's turned him from a fun-loving guy who loved to go out to a judgey, preachy douchebag who doesn't get any and never leaves her room. She's obsessed with all things Disney and he's seen all their princess movies enough times to make most anyone vomit."

She doesn't sound fun, you said he's not getting any, and the Disney thing sounds ridiculously over the top. As a single woman who can't seem to keep a man, do I need to go this route to get someone to stick around?"

I've dated the girl who needs me to be at her side 24/7 and can't hold down friendships too, and I've gotta say that I love girls who know how to take care of themselves and not be treated like royalty every second a lot more. Honestly I and my friends don't know why he stays with this girl either. His roommate says they fight all the time and he really doesn't seem that happy at all.

On one hand the sheer ballsyness of it would work on a lot of girls, but on the other hand most girls slut alarms would probably go off and you'd get a flake. I like to go for visiting a coffee shop near my house so we can chat and get to know each other, then walking through a nearby park (the goal here is to get a kiss early into the walk so you can try to later in the walk make out so enticingly you get a finger in the vag without resistance. If she resists you have to back off a bit and try again, but basically, get to as many bases as possible before inviting them to your house), and finally inviting them back to my place real quick so I can either: smoke a bowl with them, get a drink, watch that YouTube video I mentioned, show them cool thing from other country I'd mentioned, or just whatever segue sounds good at the time.   You always say, when you invite them to the house, ""But you can't stay that long, I have work in the morning."" (saying this makes them feel like they won't be pressured into sex, like they have an out, because you are already showing that you're not obsessed with getting them to stay the night.)  Some might say this is too well thought out. Well if you ladies weren't like fucking puzzle boxes I wouldn't have had to develop a multi stage strategy. ;)  Edit: idk why I'm ranting about this, I'm high and bored leave me alone! haha"

Plus TVs don't tend to show up on film that well, screen tearing, banding, screen glare/reflections and flicker as well as view angle would all be issues. And the crew would still have to do all the animations the exact same way but now using two video inputs that have their own coordinate system as opposed to a single video feed with one constant frame of reference."

Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,cresquin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by you moving and not the frame... Essentially your eyes replace the camera in op's link, so that portion of the setup is unchanged."
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,Spiralyst,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"Meaning that in the clip the motion is do to the movement of the projection against the movement of the box. but if you're moving, like on a roller coaster, then your environment would be moving too fast for projection against it, so the hololens would make more sense."
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,cresquin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:17:43 2015 UTC,The clip also likely coordinated the camera shutter with the lcd refresh rate so you don't see any weird artifacts there.
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,cresquin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"I see, I think you could get a projection system that would be fast enough to keep up in an amusement park type setting. Say you pumped up the refresh rate to something like 240hz, that should be fast enough to beat the human eye. Some lcd tvs can refresh at 240hz but most signal is only 24-60hz.  Really, the hololens will need to do the exact same thing/suffer the same problem.   I've read that human eye is only 60hz and perception anything faster than 100hz feels instantaneous.

Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,Quartinus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"A festival stage typically has about 20 hours of programming in it, tops. The rig is set up, and the headliner LD will request a rig and design a show based on that rig in the days preceding the festival. Often the rig is constrained by the geometry of the stage, the presence of opening bands, and what the local production company has or wants to rent out plus the gear that the band brings with them. The largest acts on the largest stages get about a day and a half to set up all their shit, but typically it's only about 4-7 hours for smaller festivals.   20 of these could be cool for a group which is touring and has several months to program them properly, but for a festival no way that's going to happen.   Additionally, the amount of safety controls that have to be implemented for these to be feasible would be insane. I got whacked in the head by a Sharpy (small, very common moving head) because it moved without warning when I had the truss flown in, getting hit with one of these robotic arms would probably kill someone."
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,wotmate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"Not always true. A good friend of mine was LD for the ultra music festival in Miami, and a huge chunk of that was done in his pre-vis studio.  iirc, design and programming was about 200 hours all up, with only 5 or 6 hours of touch-ups on site.  Obviously this is at the extreme end, but more and more people are using pre-vis or simply merging their already programmed show with festival rigs."
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,Quartinus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, pre-vis is playing an increasingly large part. However you're still stuck with small amounts of setup time, a constrained stage, and the other factors that make the quote ""A festival is nobody's best show"" true. For a band that is doing a tour where they have as much time to set up as they want and they're playing on their terms, then I could see crazy projection mapping and robotic arms working. But a festival is not really the place for a rig like that."

Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,thisonehereone,13,Fri Jul 17 15:22:21 2015 UTC,They are projecting those renders in real time onto the canvases. It's not effects that are done after the filming. I believe it's kind of a tech demo.

Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,SomeDumbGirl,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"No, cgi is filming and then adding effects.  This is sort of the other way around, where the effects are made first and then filmed in real time. Which means, unlike cgi, it can be watched live and in-person."
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,mdp300,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:01 2015 UTC,OH. I thought they were big-screen TVs projecting the animation!

Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,WorkingISwear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:43 2015 UTC,It's nowhere near that simple. The projection is mapped to those surfaces and software accounts for the relationship between them and the projectors as they move to warp the image and ensure it displays properly.
Damnthatsinteresting,3dm831,witeowl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it would have the same effect without the robotic arms moving around. I mean, yeah, I guess they could have animated the robotic arms and screens and made the whole thing a flat-screen presentation, but I just don't think that it would have had the same impact. If you watch the video, the man ""moves"" the screen and it gives the impression of turning the flat screen into a 3d box. I don't think that would have been nearly as effective if the man was cgi as well. The ""intersection"" illusion makes it look as if the two screens have somehow, um, intersected. Again, I don't think that would have been nearly as effective if we didn't see the screens moving around beforehand.   But then again, I am watching it on a flat screen in my home. Maybe it is all cgi after all, even the man and the robotic arms, and we really are living in the matrix..."

Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,xybrdragon,56,Fri Jul 17 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"Why is Rohos necessary when VSUSBLogon appears to perform both the logon and lock functionality on its own?  Also, in the video he's using VS to perform the locking function, but Rohos literally has a screenshot on that page showing their program does exactly the same thing.  He's using two programs that appear to perform identical functions, for seemingly no reason. There is a complete overlap in features as far as I can see, except VS is free.  Edit: So I'm testing it on my domain PC, and it appears that VS doesn't let you auto-logon completely, it's making me hit 'Other Credentials' and click on the USB option in the user account selector on Win 7. Rohos might perform better, will test.  Edit 2: Rohos doesn't work at all on my domain PC. It won't lock the computer when removed, and it won't unlock the computer when connected, even when going into Other Credentials and trying. It started working. Restarted the service and it now performs the lock and unlock as expected."
Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Tural-,13,Fri Jul 17 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"After messing with it, it looks like Rohos is needed to automatically log on and VS is needed to automatically log off. Each one doesn't do the opposite thing for some reason, even though it seems the options are there.  When I used VS only, it wouldn't log on automatically, I had to select it from ""Sign in options"" when on the lock screen.  Edit: testing! Roho logs on and off so VS is totally unnecessary. Too bad Rohos isn't free like VS."
Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Evil_Disco_Marmot,7,Fri Jul 17 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"Rohos will do both on its own. It locks on removal and unlocks on connection, without needing to do anything on the lock screen."
Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Tural-,3,Thu Jul 16 14:37:06 2015 UTC,I just found that out for myself after some testing. I guess you need to fully log off or reboot for it to work.
Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Evil_Disco_Marmot,2,Thu Jul 16 14:28:24 2015 UTC,So is it possible to use only VSUSBLongon?

Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Meatslinger,6,Thu Jul 16 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Another good one is TokenLock (OSX). You can set it to monitor for a Bluetooth device (such as your iPhone) to automatically unlock the screen whenever you get near, and to lock it again when you walk away."

Damnthatsinteresting,3di1l6,Meatslinger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"I use it every day at work. It's highly configurable, so I've got it tuned just ever so accurately that it unlocks my screen pretty much the moment my butt hits the seat of my chair. Then, it locks again as soon as I get about 12 feet away.  Edit: it has USB functionality, as well. So, if you want to do the ""USB key"" trick seen in the original video above, it has that feature, as well. Best of both worlds. in fact, you can even use your phone as the key itself, when you plug it into the computer to charge. Plug it in: screen locks. Unplug it: screen locks again."

He has a hat, because realistic hair was quite difficult to portray, a moustache to accentuate his nose, and dungarees to make his arm movements more noticeable."

Damnthatsinteresting,3ddmk7,Logalog9,3,Thu Jul 16 11:54:03 2015 UTC,Looks like there is a drainage system built into the area in the splash zone (look at the spacing of the tiles). Probably leads to a filtration system and gets resupplied to the tank.  I would argue that having the water splash over the top provides a self-skimming system that gets rid of floating debris. A nice bonus to a design that makes the pen look less like a pen (if it was not intended in the design anyway)

Damnthatsinteresting,3dg1xz,manchestercity21,2,Thu Jul 16 02:15:47 2015 UTC,What do you mean false color? Was it edited?
Damnthatsinteresting,3dg1xz,ThyZAD,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're edited.   A famous example of this is Viking 1's landing on Mars, where engineers had the color mix wrong and it made Mars look Earth-like with blue skies.   Here's an explanation from NASA:   The term ""false color"" is used to describe what astronomers (and others) often do to images to make them more comprehensible. Long ago, when radio astronomers first started generating images of sources, they wound up with essentially images that were just shades of gray - ranging from pure black to pure white. Each shade represented the intensity of the radio emission from a particular part of the object. Radio astronomers took their shades-of-gray images and converted them to color ones by assigning red to the most intense radio emission and blue to the least intense emission recorded on the image. Intermediate colors (orange, yellow, and green) were assigned to the intermediate levels of radio intensity. Black was assigned to places in the image in which there appeared to be no radio emission.  This process allows astronomers to more quickly recognize features in the images. Typically, when looking at a photograph, the human eye can only distinguish about 16 shades of gray from one another. Using millions of colors, instead, we can often bring out details in an image that we might otherwise miss. These days, just about every area of astronomy creates ""false color"" images. Remember - electromagnetic radiation does not have ""real"" color except for the radiation that has a wavelength of between 400 and 700 nm. That little range is called the ""visible"" spectrum, since it is what we humans beings see with our eyes!   Now, New Horizons does have a color camera (MVIC) but it's hi res camera (LORRI) is black and white."

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,mki401,23,Tue Jul 14 15:54:05 2015 UTC,youll live long enough to realise that at some point you too dressed like an idiot.
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,Shivadxb,23,Tue Jul 14 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"Ill fitting? Let me tell you something, as a person who graduated high school in '93, those pants fit fabulously...for the time period. Seriously, you can't measure fashion by current standards. Zoot suits are also hideously fitted by today's standards.   Look, baggy jeans will come back into style. I remember making fun of the people who wore 'nut-hugger' jeans in the 90s. They were horrensously out of fashion by 10 years (Levis used to advertise 'shrink to fit 501s' in the 80s), yet here we are some 20 odd years later and skinny jeans are fashionable again."

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,PBRwithalime,426,Tue Jul 14 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"I don't like the inconsistencies between social/economic status and casual/fancy dress between the years.  Like in the 30s, we obviously have a well-to-do man. But the 50s it's some greaser punk.   Meanwhile the 60's man is in casual clothes but sometimes they're shown in business attire. It's like we selectively remember business clothes at times, casual clothes at others. Like there are the late 90s/early 2000s big boxy power suits? Where are the 80s lady shoulderpads? The denim of the 80s? The flannel of the 90s? The weird knit outfits of the 70s? What about 60s hippie dress as opposed to posh housewives?   I'm nitpicking, but I feel like if you're going to both doing a project like this, you might as well be exhaustive."
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,bw13187,151,Tue Jul 14 16:25:25 2015 UTC,It seems like they just picked the most iconic and recognizable styles.  Definitely would be more interesting if they had more styles for each period.
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,mki401,35,Tue Jul 14 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"I thought the 50s would have been the very preppy, conservative look. Seems like that would have been more mainstream too. And one of the reasons young people of the 60s rebelled with the hippy look."

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,mgraunk,2,Tue Jul 14 17:26:24 2015 UTC,I really really want a more extensive version of this (several gifs per period).
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,ammicha,23,Tue Jul 14 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"I agree - I am particularly bothered by the lack of period-appropriate foundation garments.   Underwear. I'm talking about women's underwear.  It varied wildly over the time period covered here - we're talking a transition from corsets to thongs - and it was absolutely critical to giving the era its hallmark silhouette. I'm particularly looking at the '45 and '55 dresses - they don't hang right and look uncomfortable and ill-fitted, and I'd bet that it's largely because the model is wearing 2015 underwear and bra beneath.   Of course, it could also be that they just didn't go to the ends of the earth for a fun and interesting project that wasn't intended to be 100% historically accurate. But still."
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,Siamsa,10,Wed Jul 15 06:59:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right. They obviously paid a lot for the models and the videography and all that. So they should have taken the next step."
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,bw13187,11,Tue Jul 14 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"Similiar thing to my nitpick complaint about gestures. For example the 90's girl is doing L and W, but in the 30's she's just standing there. I am sure in the 30's young women had fun hand gestures as well.  Just kind of takes the focus off the clothing and focuses more on overall culture"
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,jesterx7769,9,Tue Jul 14 18:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was all over the place and not especially accurate. The 30s dress doesn't  look 30s to me at all. The 40s dress was too short. Dresses got shorter but not that short. I don't know where they got that 70s outfit.  I watch old movies all the time and can date a movie just by looking at the clothes.

Biggest transition I think has been from boot cut to straight cut jeans and sizing down slightly. As far as ""Fashion"" goes, there are still people that wear ridiculous patters and loud colors.

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,pjor1,3,Tue Jul 14 10:29:47 2015 UTC,"I kind of despise looking at these comparisons.   Here's the thing, in the 1920s all the way up to the 1990s, the fashion models that kind of define what we see as that era's fashion were wearing that stuff (i.e. high fashion), but for the most part, no one else was   1920s. If you weren't a blue collar worker, you were wearing a 3-Piece suit, probably grey, charcoal, brown, or black. Only entertainers and quick-talking sales guys wore straw hats, and linen-like suits. Not all women wore ""flapper"" shit... 1930s - This is actually closer to what the majority of people looked like in the 1920s.  1940s - The woman isn't far off, but the man...is he supposed to be a post-war newsie??? You want to know what the real look should be? A 2-piece suit. The war rationing of silk and other fabrics had people abandoning their vests, and opting for a coat and pants. The tie remained.  1950s - So you're telling me that men dressed like slobs, all men were greasers and women were highly dressed? WRONG. Men who dressed like greasers were probably scumbags, or at least treated as such. Cardigans, both for men and women were the more common dress. Also - this will probably remain true to the end - you won't go wrong with a suit.  1960s - Not far off at all, but ""mod"" culture wasn't this giant epidemic in fashion. High end circles kind of embraced it, but much of the 60s fashion was characterized (for men) by baggy clothes, longer hair, and of course...suits! 1970s - Larger collars for men were not uncommon, nor were jumpsuits for women. That seems to be about it. Aside from that, you know what was pretty common and to a high degree fashionable in the 1970s? Go back to the 50's and check out the greaser look. This is reflected in pop culture. TV shows like Happy Days and Grease reflected this a lot. It was ""cool"" and not at all scummy to be a greaser.  1980s. I grew up in this time. Brighter suits like Miami Vice definitely were a thing, but you were mocked for it usually (especially as it became more and more obvious that you were shooting for the Don Johnson look). T-shirts covered up by jackets worn with jeans and windbreakers with parachute pants were more common and more reflective. The woman isn't that far off. 1990s to today - not at all far off. The 2005 polyester blouse was this thing that kind of came into fashion then immediately rolled out after I blinked."

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,P1r4nha,6,Tue Jul 14 13:47:59 2015 UTC,I think it is to avoid having baggy looking knees as the fabric would get stretched out due to the bending of the knee. The rips take the pressure off.
Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,CrazyBunnyLady,4,Tue Jul 14 13:56:54 2015 UTC,It's possible that it's a practical solution. I should ask a jeans producer about that.

Damnthatsinteresting,3d8ftx,TheTHINGsabres,42,Tue Jul 14 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"100 years of white American fashion.   edit: see comment by /u/name_with_a_y below - I would still love to see complete outfits from other parts of the world, and I still think that ""United States, white"" shouldn't be the go-to default. I'm not saying that the title is necessarily wrong or needs to change. It's just something on my mind a lot lately as an American white woman who draws pretty white American ladies almost exclusively, even though I live in a diverse community and travel frequently. My personal critiques and insecurities as an artist lead me to question art by others as well. So I am interested in those dialogues, in self-improvement, and in figuring out exactly what the boundaries are.    They've actually done those videos on this channel.

But seriously, sharks are predictors, but they don't typically mess with people unless they have a reason to( protecting pups or food etc). And on top of all that they play a huge role in the oceanic ecosystem. They're crutial and not monsters. This year there have been a ton more shark sightings and I saw the first ever beach get closed down for a shark bumping a surfer(typically a behavior exhibited before they attack, their goal is to taste you basically when they do this) 4 days ago.

Saying an animal accidentally beached is equivalent to saying a human who couldn't swim climbed stairs down into an empty swimming pool and then made no effort to climb back out as it filled with water.  Not terribly likely unless something was very wrong with that person."

Damnthatsinteresting,3damb6,Reneeisme,0,Wed Jul 15 14:34:43 2015 UTC,"Are the down votes because we all want to believe he was fine?  Or because you think he went for a stroll on the beach just to check things out?  Or because you think they should have left him there?  My thought was climate change.  Again. Changes in ocean temperatures are drastically changing the ocean food web, and the big ocean predators are feeling that.  (Read about the starving Polar Bears for example).  It could be as simple as starvation, but I can't see how that animal got there unless it's in distress."

""nearly three-quarters of adults say they're within five feet of their smartphone most of the time"" Holy fuck balls, people actually try to be reachable? What if their kids would be in an accident? How are they possible going to not get aware of this when they are so close to their phones! Someone needs to warn them so they can throw em away before crucial information reaches them!"

Damnthatsinteresting,3d3z7f,asdfgasdfg312,2,Mon Jul 13 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Hey I think addiction is just a form of prioritizing your life and what's important to you. Being said are people now prioritizing their life around the cell yes, believe it or not there are people who can't simply live without their phones my dad is one of those. Seriously people get upset if they don't have a cell. Now if you can't go without a cell phone and it effects your life a psychologist would consider that a dependence or addiction. So yes people can be addicted to their phones take it from someone who doesn't use my phone more than an hour a day max and it's not because I have a shitty phone.  There is such thing as electronic depency that is only being able to go day to day with aid of Electronics. But that could be said about the majority of Americans so evolution perhaps? Who knows the fact is that people depend way to much of their phones."

But I would hardly call someone who sets his cellphone alarm before going to bed addicted. And the signs in this poster is not the signs used to see that your father is hurting himself with his cellphone. I wouldn't call your dad addicted to cellphones, but addicted to the functions of the cellphone. Your father could feed his addiction with a land line, a computer and a fax machine. It's just that your father isn't retarded and has realized that he can feed his addiction twice as fast by using a single product which contains all 3 of these functions."

If you begin to develop new interests that are far outside the first group, set up a second username and view and comment on that subset of subreddits.   You must also set up filters if you are mobile. There will be things you don't want to see.   If you are on a desktop browser, you should get a third party app that allows you even more control over the experience.   Finally, you have to recognize that the entire world is here. Some of them will be disgusting to you. You will be better served by avoiding them. They will mostly avoid you as well because they are here to discuss things with like minded disgusting people.   Good luck. Don't be overwhelmed. Stick around and get a feel for it. Learn how to sort things by New or by Top and watch out for things that say NSFL. If it's NSFL, it is likely to make you sick."

Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,Micrafone_AssAssin,60,Sat Jul 11 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Tough to tell from that angle. It seems to be some form of a service boot with brogues (the holes on a wingtip) on the quarters (side cuts of leather where laces are threaded through eyelets) and potentially on the vamp (in front of the laces/top of the foot), but it's really tough to make that out. Outsole looks to be leather and the laces are brown flat cotton laces which may be waxed.   I'm sure you could find something along these lines from a fast fashion store, maybe your local department store, or an outlet if you don't mind them being relatively shitty leather quality and looking like ass after some moderate wear. These are generally marketed well to sucker people who aren't aware of quality footwear into buying them since the price (which is usually placed at an ""accessible/reasonable"" point for most) to quality ratio is very poor.   If you have the means, a quality pair of boots (and footwear in general) is well worth the investment. Quality of the leather uppers and the quality of interior components (innersole and midsole) are the most important factors in determining the quality of a boot. Don't be swayed by marketing, fancy pictures, or stupid trends. A pair of simple, quality boots will always look great, hold up well, and be your go to for a variety of uses.   Some companies that make great service boots:    Wolverine 1000 miles - these in brown would be very similar to the boots in the gif... 150 on sale to 300 Red Wings Iron Rangers - more traditional work boot shape than military service boot but an amazingly built boot... 150 on sale to 350 Dayton boots - I own a pair, made to order... around 400 ish given what details you choose Truman Boots - new start up, totally customizable... above 400 White's - Pacific Northwest bookmaker, very work boot shaped... 400 ish Nick's - similar to White's, started by a previous employee and located very close Viberg - the current king of service boots, brace yourself for the price tag/limited availability.... 750 to 1200 depending on the leather type   I've owned or handled all of these except the White's/Nick's and can attest to their quality and the fact that they're generally made very well.

The arm functions very similar to traditional prosthetics, but it features a twist-and-lock modular design that’s easy for kids to assemble. And with a special motorized adapter, its standard three finger gripper can be swapped out for one made entirely of Lego. By essentially turning the prosthetic into one of their toys, Carlos hopes his IKO arm will empower children by improving their every day lives.

Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,Iklowto,34,Sat Jul 11 05:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ooh ooh, I know this!   Biomedical engineering student, have been working with prosthetics every semester since I started.   The prosthetic extends up over the remaining stump of the arm, like a sleeve or a really big glove. Under the sleeve, there are several sensors placed on the skin over certain muscles. They are usually placed on the top and bottom of your lower arm.   The sensors pick up the electrical signals that are generated when a muscle contracts. When you extend your hand (do the ""Iron man firing his hand laser movement""), a major muscle on top of your lower arm contracts, sending out electrical waves. An amputated patient is still able to contract the muscles by just imagining doing that motion with the hand.  The prosthetic has a mini-processor that extracts all data it can from the signal and if the sets of data looks like the sets of data from the same movement in the doctors lab, the prosthetic performs the movement. (You perform all the movements with a doctor first to calibrate the prosthesis - this way the prosthesis knows what kind of data sets to look for).  So, you can usually make the prosthesis make three movements.  Typically, these are   Contraction of flexors (hand down-movement) = Prosthetic hand closes Contraction of extensors (hand up-movement) = Prosthetic hand opens Contraction of flexors and extensors (flex your entire lower arm) = Prosthetic hand rotates   Sometimes, you can flex your muscles quickly in sequence to perform other movements - this depends on the model of the prosthetic.  In most prosthetics, there are now buttons and switches on the hand itself that you can switch and the hand changes ""mode"", so that the same muscle contractions make the hand do different movements. This is how you can go from the pinching opening and closing movements in the .gif to, maybe, an all fingers opening and closing movement for grabbing an apple, a ball etc.  TL;DR  They don't read brain signals, they read muscle signals from the remaining muscles in the arm."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,Saylar,5,Sat Jul 11 07:04:32 2015 UTC,You said that the amputee is able to do that contraction by imagining the motion of the hand. How long does it take the brain to learn that motion? I'm wondering if people who lost their lower arm as a baby are still able to do that?
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,Iklowto,3,Sat Jul 11 10:47:43 2015 UTC,"Can a baby learn it? I'm actually not sure. I've never encountered it before.   However, I know that amputees can use their remaining lower arm muscles with close to no transition time between losing the arm and having the wounds heal. I've been told by a patient that it feels like the same thing, there's just no weight at the end of the arm. It's supposed to be very intuitive."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,steeley42,2,Sat Jul 11 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"With models like this, you have to program the movements using a computer program.  This one has 14 different movements.  You plug it all in, do a flex that you think is what ""close hand"" means, and tell the computer to tell the hand that that is the close hand signal.  The hand then remembers that.  Kind of like teaching a team what plays to run based on hand signals from a coach on the bench or something.   So it's not the brain learning anything, it's the hand learning what the brain is telling it."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,MilhouseJr,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"Have a look into phantom limbs. There's a hypothesis that the brain is hardwired with an idea of what shape a human is, and what each part does. An amputee from birth has the same neural map of their body as anyone else.  This also goes the other way, with some people hacking off their arms because it doesn't feel like it's theirs. The thought is that the neural map is damaged somehow."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,lux_operon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how would someone not from an engineering background get involved with prosthetics? Do you have a lot of MD's involved in the research/implementation? What about neuroscientists?"
Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,Iklowto,2,Sat Jul 11 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"MD Prosthetist/orthotist   MD's do research, prosthetist make molds the patients armstump, make sure they get the right one and helps with training and rehabilitation.   For implementation, the bio.med. engineers usually have enough anatomical knowledge to be able to judge wether or not the patient gets the prosthetic, what muscles to read with sensors and so on.   I worked with a neurologist (nerves) and a mech.eng. trying to test the idea behind a new kind of prosthetic that works by bypassing the nerve endings in the remaining arm and applying them to another muscle, and then reading the signals off that. It worked incredibly - almost too - well. Amazingly accurate finger movement. While it still had its flaws, I'd say that the best way to become involved in prosthetics without an engineering degree is to study medicine. I would specifically say neurology, because there is ridiculous potential behind the nerve bypass technique.   MD's are, usually, indirectly involved in the research, though. If a neurologist finds out that you can effectively read brain signals that correspond with certain hand/finger movements, be assured that every bio.med.eng. will be all over it for years trying to make a prosthetic that works on that principle. MD's are vital for the research, but their research isn't based around the function of prosthetics - it's based around the functions of the body (that can later be applied to prosthetics). Every prosthetic manufacturer has a few MD's, but it's mostly engineers."

Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,AsterJ,2,Sat Jul 11 15:06:37 2015 UTC,I feel like the other hand is making the prosthetic look good.  If you look the prosthetic hand can only open and close its fingers while the other hand is doing much more complex tasks.  The amount of actual control of that hand is just 1 dimensional.   That's a step up from a hook which is 0 dimensional though.

Damnthatsinteresting,3cvkhz,tuseroni,2,Sat Jul 11 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"can't speak to this particular model but different prostheses have different methods.  some use myoelectric control, basically there is a little sensor that picks up on electricity produced when a muscle contracts, if someone is missing a limb below the elbow the muscles that control the fingers are still there, above the elbow you can still make use of this technique by training muscles to move certain parts of the prosthesis (this way a person missing an arm at the shoulder for instance can use muscles on their back to move the prosthesis)  another way is by hooking directly into the nerves that send the signal to move the fingers, if you get them early into the amputation you can preserve these nerves before they have a chance to atrophy and can actually send signals BACK to the brain allowing for rudimentary touch (but this is still in the very very very early stages) hooking into the nerves allows for a better signal/noise ratio and makes for an easier to control prosthesis it is however invasive and over time the body will produce scar tissue around the electrodes diminishing their capabilities. so for the time being myoelectric rules the prosthesis field."

And with a special motorized adapter, its standard three finger gripper can be swapped out for one made entirely of Lego.

Damnthatsinteresting,3cwsls,Eddyill,3,Sat Jul 11 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Leidenfrost effect:       The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. Due to this ‘repulsive force,’ the droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. This is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It has also been used in some potentially dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead  or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.  The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.

Damnthatsinteresting,3cob6m,SlimJones123,194,Thu Jul 9 13:38:21 2015 UTC,That magnet is scary big. Magnets like that will crush your hand into a sheet of paper if it gets between a chunk of steel or another magnet. I'd almost be afraid of loose screws or whatever else flying out of the TV like shrapnel.
Damnthatsinteresting,3cob6m,nvaus,65,Thu Jul 9 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"That magnet is freaking terrifying.  I'm having a hard time telling how big it is, but it looks at least 4"" across from the way he's holding it, which makes it at least an inch thick, probably more. (edit- intentionally guessing small because I can't tell how big the TV or the guy's hands are, it's probably bigger than 4"".)  A bit of googling found this monster, which lists a pull force of 1700 pounds.  Actual pull force is pretty variable depending on material, distance, conditions, etc., but it's pretty safe to say that it's a A LOT.  Yeah, I'd be pretty scared of ripping something out of the TV and having it pierce my hand on its way to the magnet.  I have a 2X2 and a 1X2 cylinder, and once I got them too close to each other without holding on.  About 18"".  The magnet sitting on the floor flew to the one in my hand hard enough that there was a hell of bang, and a piece of one magnet broke off with a shower of sparks.  Those are way smaller than the one in this gif."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cob6m,Seicair,40,Thu Jul 9 16:40:39 2015 UTC,I'm getting a chuckle at the thought of that being shipped via UPS. That would be a complete disaster. So how DO they deliver 1700lb pull force magnets?

Run the drill in front of the display going back and forth from top to bottom.  It's actually pretty easy to fix a tv that's been messed up by a magnet like this.    Or just use another (or the same) magnet to pull the picture back into place.  You can also buy manual handheld degauss wands.  Not that it matters a lot these days.

Damnthatsinteresting,3cob6m,DishwasherTwig,21,Thu Jul 9 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"CRT, cathode ray tube, TVs work by sending a stream of electrons to hit the phosphorescent coating on the inside of the tube creating light of the color of each pixel. The path and direction of these rays are controlled by fine tuning electric and magnetic fields at the beginning of the beam, each bending the ray slightly by changing the strength of the fields. When working in tandem, the beam can be directed to any spot within the vacuum tube and is done so scanning from top to bottom, left to right until a full image appears.  If a magnet is introduced, especially one this strong, it affects those two fields and sends the predicted trajectory of the beam off, fucking up everything in the image."

Damnthatsinteresting,3col2w,rh60,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:21 2015 UTC,My sister-in-law home schooled her kids. She barely graduated high school but her faith instructed her that public school was bad.   My cousin was homeschooled and later graduated from a top American university. Public education is quite bad in America. Freedom of choice is important.
Damnthatsinteresting,3col2w,megazen,2,Thu Jul 9 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"Product of homeschooling here.  For those interested, this is what homeschooling amounted to for my siblings and I: My parents decided to homeschool their children back in the mid 90s (I was born in 1990). They didn't really have much of a plan, but had heard the public schools in Michigan where we lived at the time described as ""hell-holes"". Thus, for religious education they decided to educate us at home. Honestly, what that meant was that we would read Bible together in the morning, then break and go off to do our own school work.  Our school work was varied and somewhat unpredictable from my point of view. In the early years we had a somewhat concrete curriculum as those books are cheaper and easier to keep in order. But as we grew older and our interests became more focused our education became more flexible. There was a time where we were ""required"" by our parents to do typing lessons on Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 9, which gave a good foundation for basic computer use and a good starting point for really learning to type, though to be honest, getting into chatting with friends over AIM did more for my typing speed than anything else. And yes, we did have friends, mostly met through church functions and the one year that we went to a private school (3rd grade for me). Thanks to church, we weren't socially starved, plus the location where we lived made it easy to get to know our neighbors. We also ended up moving several times while I was still in school, but my parents made sure to look into social groups where we could get involved (usually sports teams that would take homeschoolers).  More specifically on the actual education part of it though, our primary metric for knowing when our school year was over was when we had completed that year's math textbook. And by completed I mean every practice problem in every lesson (~30 per lesson). We generally did 1 lesson per day, but if we wanted to do more nobody was going to complain. To be honest, I don't really recall much of the specific school work I did in the early years, there was just one big thing that stuck with me: My parents made sure that I had a healthy interest in reading. I never wanted for a book, and to this day I have one on hand almost 100% of the time, whether at home or out and about.  Near the end of my education my parents decided to give online schooling a shot through The Mourning Star Academy...That was a mistake. I am not saying that online schooling can't work, but that it didn't work at all for me. We had been into video games since we were young, all the way back to playing Duke Nukem 1 & 2 on an old DOS system. So putting me in front of a computer all day long and expecting me to just take care of school work was a poor idea. That coupled with the specific school that they chose which used some stupid time tracking system for a graduation requirement (which boiled down to just leaving the page open to ensure that time was being tracked) lead to my laziest school year ever. When I was a Junior in high school I basically did no work at all. When I had about 3 days left of my school year I had about 9 months (no that's not a typo) work of class work to do. That was not a fun 3 days, but I did end up getting it all done. What that should tell you is that some parental oversight is required to keep students on track (duh).  The end result of this is that I'm a Senior at University studying Computer Science, on track to graduate 1.5 years from now. I have completed all math and general education requirements and now have only major classes left. My siblings are doing even better than I am in most cases, one is married with a degree in nursing looking to get into med school (heard he put out something like 50 applications over the last few months). Another is engaged and studying Psychology, and another is studying Business but hasn't completely decided on what he wants to do with it yet.  tl/dr: 4 siblings homeschooled by parents who weren't sure what they were doing turned out pretty well"

Damnthatsinteresting,3cex96,WellComeToTheMachine,10,Tue Jul 7 14:35:25 2015 UTC,I believe originally Nintendo was gonna work with Sony to release the playstation as a cartridge based system similar to the Nintendo 64. However Sony insisted on switching from cartridges to discs which caused Nintendo to back out of the project.
Damnthatsinteresting,3cex96,haircut74,7,Tue Jul 7 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, I thought the PlayStation was originally intended to be a disc-based add-on for the SNES. Nintendo also tried working with Phillips on a similar project, and the breakdown of that collaboration resulted in a licencing agreement that would end up producing the abominations that were the Phillips CD-i ""Zelda"" titles."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cex96,master0fdisaster1,3,Tue Jul 7 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"When Nintendo wanted to make their next console that would succeed the snes they originally teamed up with sony to make it.   Then Nintendo flipped them of, cancelled it and made their next console in collaboration with philips instead, resulting in the disaster that was the Philips cdi.   In response sony said ""I'm gonna make my own console! With cd's and analog sticks!"" which was to become the First Playstation and subsequently Nintendo's greates competitor."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cex96,pottypotsworth,10,Tue Jul 7 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Except Sony didn't have analogue sticks on the PS1, they added them to the controller after the N64 launched."

Damnthatsinteresting,3cdjvs,blackvr,10,Tue Jul 7 11:53:43 2015 UTC,"They split a couple years back. The JRTCA split from the AKC, so working lines are still called Jack Russell Terriers, but conformation bred dogs are called either Parson's Russell Terriers or just Russell Terriers.   A dog that is registered with the AKC can't be registered with the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America either, because dog politics..."
Damnthatsinteresting,3cdjvs,RegressToTheMean,5,Tue Jul 7 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"because dog politics...     Let's put a little more fine point on this. JRTs were invited to join the AKC many years ago and they said no. Why? Because the AKC is more interested in the appearance of dog breeds instead of their health. A quick Google search will show you what years of selective breeding has done - and not for the better * - to several breeds (pug, bull terrier, and the German Shepherd to name a few).  While there are size restrictions for JRTs, they are only a function of what they have been bred to do: hunt foxes. To certify a JRT they have to be able to 'Go To Ground' which is a test of their abilities and intelligence not their looks. Close breeding of JRTs  is highly discouraged.   Some people wanted to monitize their dogs, which is really the whole point of the AKC shows. Blue ribbon breeding comes with a very hefty price tag. So, those people split off and called their JRTs Parson Russells so they could compete in the AKC.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am the owner of a JRT and one that would have been selectively bred out because he is a rough coat (long hair JRT), which is a less desirable trait. Yet, he knows over 60 commands (and still learning!), has an amazing temperament, and because of the genetic diversity of the breed, he will likely live into his late teens and possibly all the way to 20.  So, yes, ""dog politics"", but it is so much more than that. It's about preserving the health and wellness of a breed of dog that has brought so much joy to me and my family.  Edit: *This is a blog post; so, read with a grain of salt, but it does have sources cited and further reading at the end of the page."

One showed this very video. I'm not a prude or anything, but when your entire presentation is on large women's bodies, it makes it a little awkward. They didn't really follow the rubric either. They were just trying to project their feelings.  It was funny when another woman did her presentation after theirs on the cause of obesity in America. I would like to call them out on their BS, but I'm not a mean person. Hopefully their grades reflected their failure to follow directions."
Damnthatsinteresting,3caki4,Powdershuttle,19,Mon Jul 6 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. This video has HAES written all over it. Talk about moving (lowering) the goal post. Even in the art work, some of the women depicted were representations of wealth. As in "" I can afford to eat rich food and I don't have to do any labor"". So these are not representations of the average woman from the times. Even the biggest from these periods would be called ""thick to chubby"" not these representations. The fifties one is hilarious. Because you can pick up a playboy and see that Monroe would be a ""thick"" build. Not fucking fat."

Maybe jeans were slowly introduced, or maybe the fabric for their clothing was produced in a factory instead of a small mill, but in reality there was little change.

There were distinctive changes in fashion in India, not just the introduction of Western/Middle-Eastern clothing centuries ago, but also in Indian fashion (including hair, makeup, accessories like this video shows, and yes, they'd usually wear it with Indian clothes) and unless you're fashion conscience, you won't notice the subtle differences in the clothing. The hairstyles you see doesn't just belong to the West, they were popular internationally (Hindus wore the side pony was around for decades, perhaps centuries, before the 80s). Fashion changes in the Indian subcontinent only happens slowly amongst the poorer populations as they can not afford the latest trends. This is common in many developing countries and even in developed countries where new fashion isn't easily available due to remoteness. You question where Buzzfeed got there information, I question your ""90%"". Sounds as if you got it off the top of your head."

Damnthatsinteresting,3cdhir,SenorDing_Dong,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Chlorate**   potassium chloride is rather harmless. As a matter of fact KCl is often used as a substitute for standard table salt by people trying to watch their sodium intake. Also I would argue that the gummy bear is a reagent itself, as a catalyst would be readily reformed as the reaction reaches equilibrium. KClO3 acts as an oxidizing agent and gets reduced during the reaction with the gummy bear."

Also, a jet ski cannot turn with the engine off and you can see the handle bars moving as it slows down, but the jet ski keeps it's forward momentum without turning. At that first turn, it looks like they pulled the key out (which is attached to the driver and will shut down the jet ski if it is pulled away) as soon as they saw the tight turn coming up."

Damnthatsinteresting,3c3s8s,InnocentPossum,-6,Sat Jul 4 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think the whole point of the ad is how cheap it is to fly to those places with Norwegian.  I wasn't sure what the figure to fly to Bangkok was so I checked what it was in a more familiar currency and found it interesting that it was so cheap.  I checked then how much it might be to go on to Indonesia. That's a long way altogether but interesting that the flight from Norway to a Bangkok is hardly more than the flight from Bangkok to Bali which is a much shorter distance.  The total is still very low, but it would be contingent on getting the advertised lowest fare, which can be tricky at the best of times but even more so if you had to get connecting flights from two different budget airlines.  Norwegian likely don't fly to Indonesia because it's a low fares airline, Indonesia is a lot further away, and Thailand is a much more popular tourism destination."

Damnthatsinteresting,3bvixp,chipsambos,2,Thu Jul 2 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"It also seems kind of misleading since the whole point of an hourglass is that the sand falls through it at a steady, predictable rate. But population over time isn’t stable or predictable at all."
Damnthatsinteresting,3bvixp,SpacePirateAsmodaari,2,Thu Jul 2 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"It's like a triple hourglass. There's another ""bubble"" above representing all the humans who haven't been born yet, and it has a larger hole in the bottom than the middle, allowing sand to fall through quicker (births) than sand falling from the middle (deaths)"
Damnthatsinteresting,3bvixp,Ride_the_Lighting,2,Thu Jul 2 20:17:28 2015 UTC,I got that. But it still doesn't change the fact that an hourglass is a poor representation for population growth rates.
Damnthatsinteresting,3bvixp,SpacePirateAsmodaari,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not a great metaphor. They're trying to represent a) current rate of birth b) current rate of death c) current total alive d) current total dead.  The hourglass fails in two ways: 1) implies steady rate (as you've already said) 2) implies a closed circuit shifting of resources  A more accurate one might be a conveyor belt of baby chicks leading to a grinder and a vast lime pit underneath (belt and grinder have independently variable speeds)?"
