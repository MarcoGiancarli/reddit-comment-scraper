I'm actually racking my brains to think of a single GTA character I unabashedly like, which I didn't expect to be saying at this point, seeing as I really am a huge fan of the series..."

GTA,3e1dxj,TragedyTrousers,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"Generally, I find the supporting characters are the least lovable, for the reasons above.  Especially the mission givers - you don't get to kill nearly enough of them for my liking!  Many of the GTA protagonists are fairly likeable for much of the time, but while they pontificate a lot over not doing horrendous crimes, the game has them going against this constantly.  Although I understand why this is the case (the gameplay defining the story), I find it jarring, and get a strong sense of cognitive dissonance about the characters because of it.    The writers valiantly try to paper over these cracks with Michael and Niko, by handwaving this inconsistency as being fits of insane rage, but to go from being a sympathetic flawed protagonist and family man one minute to slaughtering dozens of human beings in cold blood the next is just a little too jarring to make me fully buy those characters beyond the 2D videogame level.  Upon reflection, then, I'd rather bizarrely say Trevor is the character I come closest to actually liking.    I mean, yes, he's an amoral, horrible cunt (in a nemesis kind of a way), but he knows full well what he is and stays true to it.    He's a killer. A murdering bastard. And there are consequences to stepping into the shoes of a murdering bastard."

GTA,3drc8u,Convaw,16,Sat Jul 18 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree it's an amazing game, the city itself is probably the weakest of all the 3D GTA games.  It's quite small and not all that varied.  And very flat (although I hear that's true to life of Miami).  Don't get me wrong, I do still like tooling around Vice City, and the fact that it's so small makes it easier to get around and memorize the map.  But it's sort of an uninteresting place."
GTA,3drc8u,rube,2,Sat Jul 18 20:51:55 2015 UTC,It is a tiny map. Makes it really easy to get the taxi and ambulance stuff
GTA,3drc8u,chinkostu,6,Sat Jul 18 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's sort of my point.  It's small and not all that interesting, but I liked the fact that you can get to places easier.  Where as IV had a large and amazingly detailed city, but it felt like a chore to drive to destinations or just tool around the city since everything was the color of pants and usually far away.  The floaty/sloppy driving handling sort of ruined the game for me too."

GTA,3drc8u,Devastas,4,Sun Jul 19 02:45:33 2015 UTC,"The cutscenes alone are worth that game. Add to that the soundtrack and the awesome vehicles and it's just too good.  Then again, this was a big GTA for me. Though I was very young with the early GTA's and never managed to play them because my brother hogged the Playstation, I always liked them. GTA III was a real oddity because it switched to third-person and I had no idea how it'd work, but then Vice City came out and I was just the right age, had my friend group with their Playstations, and finally got more of it to really enjoy it proper. Even disregarding nostalgia though, it's a thrilling work. As with many GTA's it starts off slow with a lot of tutorial style missions that feel almost patronising, but when it builds it really builds."
GTA,3drc8u,TheEvilScotsman,11,Sat Jul 18 22:14:36 2015 UTC,"It is hard to go BACK to Vice City after playing the others. The huge improvement in graphics, writing and animation make Vice City look pretty dated, that's for sure so be prepared. It doesn't quite have the same immersion and the aiming controls are kind of weird.  That being said, it's a solid story, and if you've played V, IV and SA you kinda have to finish with III and Vice City!  Also, amazing soundtrack as has been mentioned."
GTA,3drc8u,FatherMuck,5,Sat Jul 18 23:26:17 2015 UTC,Best soundtrack of any GTA game to date in my opinion.
GTA,3drc8u,WC_EEND,2,Sun Jul 19 12:55:16 2015 UTC,"The setting of Vice City is really what sells it. That said, I think even III had better looking graphics than it."
GTA,3drc8u,Democracy-Manifest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best answer.  Vice City was amazing for its day, but if you're familiar with GTAIII it's quite nearly that level of early-PS2 fidelity.  It's an excellent game but without nostalgia to fall back on, I would only recommend it after exhausting V and IV and craving more.  That said, it's not the same game, and it's a very good game. Just remember a lot has changed in 13 years (graphics, interface, streamlining, checkpoints, conveniences), and some things have changed very little (good gameplay and writing are timeless)."
GTA,3drc8u,KDLGates,4,Mon Jul 20 21:59:12 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'd say it's the best in the series.  BUT! A lot of that comes from the context of the time.  So maybe play GTA3 first to prep.
GTA,3drc8u,xtravar,4,Sun Jul 19 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"it's one of the best, i agree with other posts, but if that didn't hook you, gta III will not even come close"
GTA,3drc8u,Psychedelic_Leg,3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"To this day, I'd say Vice City is my favorite GTA I've ever played! I'd say go for it!"

GTA,3dqtcr,compoundbreak791,5,Sun Jul 19 04:54:52 2015 UTC,My friend told me he'd always take a cab everywhere because he hated the driving so much. I personally like the driving physics more in 4 than in 5 for that it's more realistic.
GTA,3dqtcr,HonkHorn,4,Sat Jul 18 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I hated GTA 4 because every vehicle will lose its hood after a short distance. That's not very realistic, no?"
GTA,3dqtcr,compoundbreak791,6,Sat Jul 18 19:42:52 2015 UTC,Vehicles will lose their hoods in real life after treating them the way you do in the game. I just hate how the vehicles are basically tanks in GTA5 and had to adjust the handling files to fix it.
GTA,3dqtcr,Ithier,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:15 2015 UTC,That is a very specific reason to hate on the physics. But in GTA4 it feels like you were supposed to be detached from your ownership of a car. So you weren't supposed to care about your car
GTA,3dqtcr,compoundbreak791,3,Sun Jul 19 04:51:09 2015 UTC,I only drove so I could run over people. They really need to add pedestrians in Need for Speed.
GTA,3dqtcr,ElMuffinHombre,2,Sat Jul 18 19:42:10 2015 UTC,I would always spawn a car on happiness island and just do laps around it continuously running people over. I had God mode on my car too so it was perfect.
GTA,3dqtcr,ElMuffinHombre,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:11:18 2015 UTC,The driving physics in 4 were shit. It was easily the thing I hated most about it. 5 isn't super realistic either but actually usable and fun.
GTA,3dqtcr,joeingo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:55:40 2015 UTC,Exactly the guy I was hoping for. Could you go into it in a bit more detail?  I loved the physics but I think that's just because I enjoy driving.  What exactly took you out of the driving? Those curbs that fucked everything if you touched them?
GTA,3dqtcr,drh94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:35 2015 UTC,Honestly I haven't played it in a while but I remember one thing being the suspension in the vehicles was terrible and completely unrealistic making it flip or completely loose control easily. I should get on and try it again sometime.
GTA,3dqtcr,winston-smiths,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"I like the certain aspects of the driving in both IV and V.  In IV I thought the cars were way more fun to crash since they were so squishy and dentable, the wobbly-ness of them also added a bit of entertainment.  I liked in V that you didn't have to slow down too much or plan a turn out too much to make it around a corner."
GTA,3dqtcr,VadersCape,2,Sat Jul 18 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"I actually loved the driving physics in GTA IV, but I didn't liked how fragile cars were (as in many other GTA's before the 5th)."
GTA,3dqtcr,sn3eky,2,Sun Jul 19 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"Driving normal cars was fine, but when it came to motorcycles, I hated it.  Turning was impossible, especially on the mission where you had to get Faustin's daughter from her boyfriend."

GTA,3dq5sx,Daniel_Kay,5,Sat Jul 18 10:49:56 2015 UTC,Why on earth would an entire USA setting be any fun? They would need to drastically change modes of transportation otherwise it would be hours of helicopter flying past nothing.
GTA,3dq5sx,Somethinggrate,5,Sat Jul 18 15:34:13 2015 UTC,You've obviously never driven through Nebraska. Best 6 hours of my life.
GTA,3dq5sx,Aesth3tik,3,Sat Jul 18 15:36:27 2015 UTC,Never have. GTA should just make up a city like they did with GTAIII Liberty City. Take a bunch of different characteristics of different cities and put it in a blender.
GTA,3dq5sx,Somethinggrate,3,Sat Jul 18 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"it is largely a rumor, however with ""entire USA"" they obviously wouldn't mean everything full sized. More a large landmass with several major cities on it, kinda like ""The Crew"" which has a miniature USA as its setting.  Also on transportation, fast travel between airports like in San Andreas, jets that can actually travel realistic speeds (maybe able to travel faster if they are above a certain altitude) and such."
GTA,3dq5sx,jorgp2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:02:03 2015 UTC,Have you played Arma?  It's just a small island and it takes forever to fly accross the map in a helicopter.
GTA,3dq5sx,DanzaBaio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"I was kinda stoked for The Crew, which is the entire USA you can drive across, with certain landmarks of places and areas marked as cities and towns. There are satellite dishes you can drive by to unlock points of interest, races and other things near that certain area, so its easier to find things. And to easier get to different parts of the country, you can use trains or planes as a kind of fast travel. You can drive across country, and there's even a race that has you drive across country, but you aren't forced to.    But there are large expanses of almost nothing, and I personally like the handling of cars in GTA better, plus you can hope out on foot. For an idea, here is a comparison of The Crew's map VS GTA V's-(from this thread) -- GTA's map is bottom right there. The Crew is HUGE. There are events to complete all over, like races, crash through signs, follow the line, escape the explosion blast, so its not totally barren, but GTA seems more alive imo.   Could Rockstar get it to work? Possibly, but I can't even imagine how they'd populate it, or make it feel alive, or all the stunt jumps they'd put in. And Arkham Origins had a fast travel Bat Plane, which was removed in Arkham Knight because Batmobile, but for a larger GTA I could see train stations or airplane terminals to move between areas."
GTA,3dq5sx,Bufudyne43,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"IMO The crew map of LA is way better than Grand theft autos. Also, the crew is an awesome game but the driving physics kinda suck."

So what you will need to do is to re-download the game again, can be very annoying if you are using the rock-star downloader which seems to loose connection after each file.  Whatever you do don't delete the .part files to increase the download speed, just pause and restart every time your download speed dies. Hope this helps :)"

This led to very frustrating retries over and over.  I swore to never even attempt the missions again until someone told me it was a glitch that was fixed in other versions.  I completed them on Android, they're not hard now.  And the follow the train mission was never difficult, get over it, people."

But the follow the train mission was kinda hard, buy I played it recently on the xbox 360 version and they massively toned down the difficulty.  I think of they had to do that, then the original difficulty was probably too hard."

GTA,3dlxy8,simplycass,7,Sat Jul 18 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"I completed the original Zero missions with the help of a guide from Neoseeker back in the day. You had to take out the targets in a certain order and rely on gliding/coasting to maintain fuel. Pretty sure I finished with a sliver of fuel left.  It wasn't easy, but it was possible. Might have to bust out the PS2 to have another go at it."
GTA,3dlxy8,MilhouseJr,4,Fri Jul 17 17:35:55 2015 UTC,This is 100% correct. There was a specific way that you had to do it and any deviations would cause failure. It was made easier in later releases.

(One trick with his missions, especially the three van mission, is to find the truck, fly ahead of it, land in the street, and orient yourself towards it, and shoot it as it goes by.)  The flight school, however, was a nightmare at first. I finally figured out that if switching the camera to interior view (like you were in a car) made it a shitload easier to fly. Once the flying skills jumped up halfway, I could then fly third-person view (the normal one) without a problem."

GTA,3dgbxi,Daiwon,7,Thu Jul 16 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"It'd be cool, if a little cliche, to have some misunderstanding between the gangs cause an all out war. But of course since you are the only one that can see each side you are the only one that sees the misunderstanding."
GTA,3dgbxi,rube,2,Thu Jul 16 08:13:39 2015 UTC,"While that's a cool idea too, I have a feeling that they will continue to use the three main characters from the original game in any story DLC."

GTA,3dgbxi,Shaggyninja,19,Thu Jul 16 01:52:49 2015 UTC,how they did the DLC in GTA 4 was pretty cool
GTA,3dgbxi,ArkaStevey,11,Thu Jul 16 02:28:03 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS!  He didn't really develop at all, and that was kinda his character. He's always striving for more, but even when he gets what he wants (like the big house) he's still not happy.  Michael developed by deciding he wanted to make movies. Trevor developed by finding out his friend betrayed him and yet still decided to help him and not kill him (after a while) but Franklin really can't develop. Because he can't be happy."
GTA,3dgbxi,Shaggyninja,14,Thu Jul 16 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  Couldn't you say he developed somewhat in the end? This is only if you chose ending C, Franklin's 'deathwish' ending.   Franklin realises that he just can't kill either Trevor or Michael who he now considers to be his close friends. Betraying them to keep his freedom and appease dickheads like Devin and Steve Haines just wouldn't fit the bill in his opinion, so you can say that in he kept it OG in the end.   This is because he realised that the 'street' values of looking out for your homies no matter what was more important than the materialistic lifestyle he aspired for so long, and was willing to sacrifice everything for them, even himself.   That seems like development to me, even if it did happen right at the very end."
GTA,3dgbxi,PKAwesome,10,Thu Jul 16 07:47:30 2015 UTC,"True true. And he also called Lamar to help him look out for his friends. So yes, I guess you're right in that he did develop.  However that occurring in the last mission of the game really doesn't give you the same satisfaction as Michaels or Trevors."
GTA,3dgbxi,DocNoob,3,Thu Jul 16 10:32:16 2015 UTC,it was also really satisfying to put michael's family life back together towards the end of the story.
GTA,3dgbxi,dnb_4eva,2,Thu Jul 16 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"Franklin's not really supposed to develop.  He's the player avatar in the vein of the previous rags-to-riches GTA main characters.  I'd argue that he was the one in the least need of development anyway, since he knew he was dealing with some crazy people but felt that it was a much better use of his time then gangbanging for a few nickels."
GTA,3dgbxi,SonOfJack541,-3,Fri Jul 17 00:06:54 2015 UTC,Gang Wars are gone. Rockstar* are thinking too much big picture stuff nowdays
GTA,3dgbxi,RaymondBates,16,Thu Jul 16 20:38:18 2015 UTC,"Would be cool to have 3 new characters associated with 3 different gangs (triad, bloods and cholos for example), play a story with each one and at the end decide to stick with one and try to conquer SA. Each gang could give you some kind of bonus (money, better guns, vehicles)."
GTA,3dgbxi,SonOfJack541,11,Thu Jul 16 08:34:24 2015 UTC,"As cool as this would be, I'm sort of expecting an Alien themed DLC. Lots of alien related content in the game already, and if they make it huge, they could sell the DLC as it's own game; the same way they did Undead Nightmare for RDR."
GTA,3dgbxi,Reilly149,5,Thu Jul 16 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"This is what i am expecting too. Undead nightmare was such a success it just seems to make sense.   Don't forget you had the mythical beasts loitered around RDR too. So we've had Zombies & mythical creatures, aliens makes sense."
GTA,3dgbxi,SonOfJack541,3,Thu Jul 16 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"Especially with the amount of Alien stuff already in the game too. They have an alien body model, UFO's, the UFO car thing. I know the other games had UFO's but it's a much bigger presence in GTAV."
GTA,3dgbxi,Reilly149,3,Thu Jul 16 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"Only concern I would have with that is how heavily Saints Row 4 relied on Aliens.  I mean it could really go either way,  I've always said that Saints Row was GTA's less serious, underachieving twin... and SR3 & 4 were pretty damn good games both tinkering with Aliens."
GTA,3dgbxi,SonOfJack541,2,Thu Jul 16 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"True, but I imagine that there would be a very different take on Aliens by GTA. Espically with all the FIB stuff related to them. Who knows, maybe they'll fake an alien invasion and somehow the characters will be roped in? Either way, I think it would be excellent and better than Saint's Row (Which I do like btw)"

Lamar, or more likely another friend of Lamars... so it's a little more removed from the main story but still has that connection and can have Lamar occasionally show up to either screw things up in a hilarious fashion or be some kind of brilliant mentor to you, but you as a player (having played GTA V) realize every good bit of advice he's given you is what Lamar's from Franklin and the guys."

To make jump ramps (which is pretty much what people want to do with creator mode) you have to resort to bugs and it's a pain in the ass.  GTA MTA and SA:MP have great ways of making customs maps, in MTA you have maps similar to maps in TrackMania..  This   is just an example from MTA, GTA V has nothing like this.

As far as testing mode, it's never a perfect analog to the game: the testing engine inside of the creator isn't perfect, and sometimes things will power up in game, sometimes building doors (like the bank vault) can be opened in testing and not in game, and you're more durable in testing (even invincible!) than in GTA:O.

As far as stacking, I know how to stack things, but I can't figure out how to tilt things, namely cabins and similarly shaped items. I was hoping to use some cabins as a ramp to get to rooftops, rather than having to stack a bunch of ramps and having less props to play with, since the limit is 100."

As a 14 year old thinking he's slick at a local second hand music/game shot and then feeling like I had to hide it from my mom.  It's easily one of my favorite video games ever.  San Andreas is amazing too, but there was something about Vice City that I loved.  Maybe it was the simplicity of it all.  San Andreas had a lot going on, and Vice City just wanted you to focus on the good story."

GTA,3d8jmf,GoodHustleOutThere,4,Tue Jul 14 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"My heart will always be with Vice City. I really wish they'd rerelease it with San Andreas' improved camera (not having to be motionless to look around), swimming (!), and expand the western island greatly to include an Everglades-style swamp, a Disney-like resort up north, and a string of islands like the Keys down south. Add some new missions to reflect the expanded areas. But that time has passed, unfortunately, and all I can hope is that they return to Vice City someday with a next-gen reimagining."

GTA,3d8jmf,simplycass,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"III is my favorite but it's incredibly dated but so is Vice City and San Andreas. For me, it's all nostalgia and the feeling I get from looking at pictures or video from III takes me right back to being 16 years old.  Vice City to me was just a continuation of III but in a new location and new songs. There wasn't as much ingenuity in terms of game play, it played identical to III. It was cool to buy property and generate income through that but what more was there to do?  San Andreas though blew the series wide open just like III did three years prior. Now you had the ability to take over gang territory and continually defend them, you had a gigantic map that required a significant time to be explored, player customization along with other RPG elements. San Andreas was alive!  So I'd say 1.) III 2.) San Andreas 3.) Vice City"
GTA,3d8jmf,HawaiianBrian,3,Tue Jul 14 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"GTA3 for me, but thats probably due to nostalgia and the amount of time I spent playing it."
GTA,3d8jmf,I_LIKE_VIDEO_GAEMZ,4,Tue Jul 14 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"Usually it comes down to 3 having started it all, VC being nostalgically awesome (despite the small map), and SA usually being nearly universally adored and praised for having the most ambitious story and setting.  One thing I noticed is that you can really see Rockstar's advancement in terms of thinking.  On one hand, Vigilante is much better in VC (the criminals are a lot smarter, come in 2-3 cars, and have up to four in a car) and they added the ability to do it on a motorcycle in SA, but SA is so huge that it's harder to pull off, plus the criminals do drive-bys as early as Level 3.  And GTA3 had the game-breaking glitch of pause-unpause to make it easy to hit Level 12.  Also in VC/SA you get a Level 5 checkpoint for Paramedic, and things are overall not as ridiculously hard as the hostile gangs made it in GTA3.  Good luck trying to get ANYTHING done once you've pissed off a gang.  On the other hand, Firefighter is almost too hard in VC and SA, with the fires being bigger and the car's occupants fleeing at times.  On the other hand, GTA3's fires were almost pathetic in comparison.  Another thing to note is that they had all weapon powerups tied to the hidden packages in GTA3, something they kind of ""went away"" from in VC and SA.  Finding those hidden items meant different bonuses."
GTA,3d8jmf,DomHaynie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:31:58 2015 UTC,"I always found Vigilante to be completely impossible without the attack helicopter. I always waited to tackle that mission until after the Apache was unlocked.  For paramedic and firefighter missions, it all comes down to where you perform them. In Vice City, the best place for paramedic missions is north Vice Beach area, because a lot of the victims are out on that big open beach really close to the hospital. My favorite firefighter area was downtown. In San Andreas, both missions are way, way easier out in Fort Carson in Bone County. It's flat, not heavily populated, and most of the rescues/fires are located close by."
GTA,3d8jmf,Bacon_Man123,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"San Andreas has the gameplay, breadth of mission variety, customization, world design and size.  Vice City wins on music, atmosphere, and focus.  By adding more things to do and a bigger world, San Andreas somewhat watered down the overall experience.  Vice City felt more contained and committed to recreating the atmosphere of a certain time in a certain place.  Both are legendary games and it's really hard to pick one over the other since they both do different things so well."
GTA,3d8jmf,DomHaynie,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"This could probably just be between Vice City and San Andreas. Even though I'm in Portland where GTA3 is based off of, it's still my least favorite between these 3. But the talk shows were some of the best."

GTA,3d0a2x,oss_spy,20,Sun Jul 12 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yup. Niko is, by far, my favorite character out of all of the games - maybe except for CJ or Sweet - because he's tried his hardest to leave that world behind him but the violence of his past keeps catching up.  Edit: Maybe Vic Vance too."
GTA,3d0a2x,DigChrono,3,Sun Jul 12 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"CJ all the way. Franklin is my second favorite of the franchise because he's a no nonsense black guy, although he doesn't really take charge as much (except for the end but even then that's ehh)."
GTA,3d0a2x,IBuriedPaul90,32,Mon Jul 13 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"I would like to argue that most of the protagonists, except for Claude and Tony, are decent people who were thrown into situations that required them to be excessively violent and commit further crimes. Tommy would probably be relaxing in a condo somewhere if the initial drug deal had succeeded. CJ merely came back for his mother's funeral. Of course he's a petty criminal, but the events of San Andreas propelled him into being an even bigger criminal. Victor and Niko both get into heavier crime because of family members.   I won't attempt to tackle GTA V's protagonists. I'll save that for someone else."
GTA,3d0a2x,MilhouseJr,32,Sun Jul 12 13:26:38 2015 UTC,CJ was the most manipulated. From the moment he arrived back in LS he was framed for a police murder and set up for a fall by his apparent friends. It was only due to his sister's boyfriend that he was able to piece together what really happened with the green Sabre and begin to take down Tenpenny and Smoke.
GTA,3d0a2x,jordan_bar,30,Sun Jul 12 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"Trevor and Michael are pretty bad people. They are greedy and their story began with them robbing banks. Michael was even selfish enough to save him and his family by betraying his friends. The story then turns them into guys who need to do what they gotta do to survive because they were put in a bad situation (Madrazo's house, jobs for the agency).  Franklin was hardly ever a bad person aside from the killing and robbing. He started out getting scared whenever Lamar was up to no good. He was poor and when he met Michael he wanted help from him so he could get out of his aunt's house and off the streets. Although it seems like an alternate motive for all his crimes were to get his girlfriend back into seeing him."
GTA,3d0a2x,noktiis,34,Sun Jul 12 16:08:23 2015 UTC,Franklin was hardly ever a bad person aside from the killing and robbing.    Only in GTA.  Haha
GTA,3d0a2x,PartyPoison98,11,Sun Jul 12 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"True, but I think everyone that Franklin robbed/killed canonically was much worse than him"
GTA,3d0a2x,sanderman123,8,Sun Jul 12 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"Obviously, you've never seen me play as Franklin."
GTA,3d0a2x,PartyPoison98,2,Mon Jul 13 01:05:09 2015 UTC,Hence the word canonically
GTA,3d0a2x,p44v9n,11,Mon Jul 13 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"Trevor is incredible unique, but I'd argue that re Michael, taking the decision to betray to save his family proves he has some conscience. Of course he's no angel but I think you can definitely see as it progresses that he's not evil either.  Agree with the Franklin comment though; he definitely started out the most 'good', and with no history like the other two."
GTA,3d0a2x,TheAddiction2,5,Sun Jul 12 18:18:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Michael is a bad guy by the metric of GTA protagonists. He wanted to make sure someone was there for his family, and the only way he could that was to rat his friends out to Dave and the FIB. A high school jock with no future outside of a McDonalds cashier isn't exactly going to surprise anyone when he puts his bets into crime."
GTA,3d0a2x,TheAstroChemist,26,Sun Jul 12 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"Niko himself is one of the huge reasons why I personally think IV had the best story of them all. He does distinguish himself from other protagonists in his character. You can compare him in my mind to the ones from the previous games.  Claude (from III) - Fairly emotionless killer, also mute which doesn't help... Vercetti (VC) - Very stone cold, doesn't show much soft side...  CJ (SA) - Perhaps closest to the humanity displayed occasionally in Niko ... still pretty gangster though ...  Tony (LCS) - Maybe a little less emotionless than Claude...  Vic (VCS) - Here's a guy that really does want to do the right thing in many cases, so perhaps he's actually closest to Niko"
GTA,3d0a2x,PartyPoison98,7,Sun Jul 12 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think Nico is a better character than CJ, just somewhat different"
GTA,3d0a2x,TheAstroChemist,7,Sun Jul 12 20:28:10 2015 UTC,CJ had a lot of humanity in him at times as well. You could kind of see it in him when he walked in the house and looked at the photo of his mother on the first mission. There was a very interesting dynamic going on with him.
GTA,3d0a2x,MrWigggles,8,Sun Jul 12 21:26:35 2015 UTC,CJ drove a combine harvester and murder fucked like lots of people.
GTA,3d0a2x,darksugarrose,11,Sun Jul 12 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"CJ also buried a man in locked in a port-o-potty under a whole lot of concrete for hitting on his sister, after destroying all the portable offices and killing all the other workers. Y'know, some Trevor level shit."
GTA,3d0a2x,MrWigggles,12,Sun Jul 12 23:32:47 2015 UTC,CJ was kinda broken of a human.
GTA,3d0a2x,darksugarrose,5,Sun Jul 12 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"They ALL are broken though, and it makes the stories fun for sure, but I never got the sense that CJ was a very deep character in comparison to Niko/Trevor/Michael. Maybe because of how they've done dialogue, how they actually have conversations throughout the game instead of bitching about the traffic when outside of a cutscene/travel to a mission destination.  In IV and V you are given a whole lot more opportunities to witness moments of weakness in them through dialogue, random events, etc... moments where they're like ""wow I'm fucked up"" and even just for a second they regret it all, maybe even wonder a little how it would have been if they'd chosen a different path, but for some too far gone to get out. I think Niko and Michael made decent strides to get out of the life, Trevor on the other hand got stuck in that cycle and probably will only escape in death.  CJ shows no remorse. Yes he shows sadness for losing a couple people, his mom, Ryder for a brief period (until Cesar says he was trying to bang Kendal) and Big Smoke, ultimately he couldn't give less of a fuck for any one else and I think even shows a little pride for the shit he has done. Its possible that impression comes from the lack of deeper insight that you get with the others but not with CJ.  TL;DR I need to stop playing so much GTA..."
GTA,3d0a2x,TheAstroChemist,2,Mon Jul 13 00:00:59 2015 UTC,You can never have too much GTA.

GTA,3d0a2x,dxgxnxratx315,3,Sun Jul 12 13:03:00 2015 UTC,The missions in V are better but the IV story is so much better. There's hardly anything to get emotionally invested in GTA V.
GTA,3d0a2x,-eagle73,6,Sun Jul 12 23:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have been trying to play GTA 4 lately because I got a bit bored of 5, but GTA 4 caps at 30fps for some reason and it's bothering me."
GTA,3d0a2x,genghisdani,3,Sun Jul 12 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, there is a parameter you can add to the shortcut to unlock the framerate. Not that that helps that much; I have a GTX 970 and can't get a smooth 60 fps on max settings, which is ridiculous."
GTA,3d0a2x,-eagle73,2,Sun Jul 12 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"Also using a 970 here, if you ever figure it out let me know I need to do research on that, because I love GTA 4 and it's a nice change from 5 sometimes but I can't bear 30FPS when I know 60 is more than doable."
GTA,3d0a2x,Yugenk,4,Sun Jul 12 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"I felt some kind of emptiness from gta V story too, maybe this 3 main characters thing dont let us getting deep into the character feeling. Or the story was poor."
GTA,3d0a2x,Open_To_Suggestions_,4,Sun Jul 12 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"Or the story was poor.   Short.  The main story line of GTA V only has 69 missions..  GTA IV has 94.  They need to release story DLC for V.  Add a jet pack, hydraulics for lowriders, dual wield guns like SA, play pool, basketball etc."
GTA,3d0a2x,p44v9n,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:00 2015 UTC,"Having read this comment I've realised how much I agree and how much more empty 6 felt when I was playing it...   I think the character development was on point in 5 though as much as it was with Niko on 4, and of course gameplay mechanics were far better in 5, not to mention and just the sheer size of the map in 5... so yes, I agree it must have been the story in 5 compared to the story in 4 which was lacking.  I wish GTA 6 was at least in sight... hey ho"
GTA,3d0a2x,The_Greenarrow,20,Sun Jul 12 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"I would play the fuck out of a PS4 port of GTA IV just to go through and do all of the side missions where Niko offers up chunks of his past. Particularly with Dwayne and Little Jacob's missions where you go out with them, you learn a fuckload. Roman too. He's got a very detailed and interesting past, and if you just play the main story, you'll miss it."
GTA,3d0a2x,BlackSmokeDemonII,4,Sun Jul 12 13:17:00 2015 UTC,"I would love more of Packie, he beats Little Jacob as my favorite side character. It was nice to be able to find him in V"
GTA,3d0a2x,The_Greenarrow,3,Sun Jul 12 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you choose the ending in which something bad happens directly to his family, then the side missions afterwards are heartbreaking and depressing, but they wrote it into his hang out missions.   Also, yeah, he's a nice little addition to V. I made sure to get him on PS4 when I played through again."
GTA,3d0a2x,dbadaddy,4,Sun Jul 12 23:30:25 2015 UTC,I'd play a ps4'ized gta:iv too.  And probably a skyrim.
GTA,3d0a2x,The_Greenarrow,5,Sun Jul 12 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just hope all of the PS2 games they ported to PS3 get ported to PS4. I really want a condensed collection of all the games I love on my system."
GTA,3d0a2x,BlackSmokeDemonII,2,Sun Jul 12 14:34:43 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if Rockstar would make a Max Payne type game with Niko

GTA,3d0a2x,isaac161000,2,Sun Jul 12 23:41:48 2015 UTC,Max Payne is an amazing series. The noir style of 1 and 2 worked great for the story. And while I didn't get the same feel of 3 being as dark it was still very deep. Especially with his alcoholism and emotional drain he's had from never letting the death of his family go.
GTA,3d0a2x,BlackSmokeDemonII,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:29 2015 UTC,If any games deserve a complete remake its the 1st 2 Max Payne games
GTA,3d0a2x,ImperialDoor,0,Tue Jul 14 20:16:52 2015 UTC,If you had an Xbox One you could do that this fall.
GTA,3d0a2x,pattiobear,9,Mon Jul 13 01:33:38 2015 UTC,I think he's more troubled/brooding/introspective than the other GTA characters. More like Max Payne than GTA maybe? I guess Michael would be second place though.
GTA,3d0a2x,HotRodSam91,7,Sun Jul 12 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's true with most characters in GTA IV.  I won't give you any spoilers, but there is a very well written back story and character development arch in that game that you just don't see in V.  This is actually one of the biggest complaints about 5 that I've seen.  Niko is probably the most human protagonist in all of the games, slightly more than CJ from San Andreas.  Anyways, I hope you really like the game, it's a great story."
GTA,3d0a2x,danw650,6,Sun Jul 12 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"He's not a criminal, exactly.. he's had bad stuff happen to him though.  CJ from San Andreas was born and raised a gangster but kind of left that life behind before the game started.. Claude from GTA III and Tommy in VC were pretty bad dudes.. and the three in GTA V are pretty clearly not very nice people."
GTA,3d0a2x,tjh961,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:50 2015 UTC,i dont know. i kind of feel like a lot of the shit franklin got into was shit that lamar dragged him into. he never would have fallen in with de santa and phillips if he hadnt listened to lamar and went to work for simeon
GTA,3d0a2x,danw650,2,Sun Jul 12 17:15:43 2015 UTC,I agree. I was thinking about editing my comment to say that I think Franklin is a chaotic but good character.. I just didn't care enough to actually do that.. comment on reddit and all
GTA,3d0a2x,World_Corruption,4,Sun Jul 12 17:17:28 2015 UTC,Niko is indeed a criminal but his past is what made him a criminal and he had come to liberty city to start a new life
GTA,3d0a2x,TheAddiction2,3,Sun Jul 12 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"He's a better person than, say, Michael or Trevor, but he's no angel. It's mostly that his old habits and old ties keep him opposed to the straight and narrow lifestyle, but he obviously wants to get onto it however he can. You'll learn more toward the end of the game."
GTA,3d0a2x,Sanlear,3,Sun Jul 12 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Niko is good so much as (almost) everyone else he runs into are worse.  On a side note, my version of Niko watched a lot of television.  Republican Space Rangers may be the funniest parody GTA has ever done."
GTA,3d0a2x,Lord_Jeebus,2,Sun Jul 12 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"The voice actor was an asshole, but I think Niko is the most likable GTA character of all time. I think that CJ comes in second, and maybe Franklin 3rd. I still think Rockstar should have gone into more detail with Franklin, there's definitely enough there for him to be a super interesting character."
GTA,3d0a2x,p44v9n,2,Sun Jul 12 23:29:04 2015 UTC,"I think 4 and 5 the characters were all a lot more multi-dimensional. I definitely wouldn't call any of Michael or Trevor or Franklin ""horrible criminals with no conscience"".  I also agree with the comments that say all the protagonists were good people in bad situations but having only played 4 and 5 can only comment on those. But from what I've read about the earlier games I think these later ones benefit from a longer storyline allowing us to see the whole extent of each character's fall from grace."
GTA,3d0a2x,PartyPoison98,3,Sun Jul 12 18:15:27 2015 UTC,You wouldn't call Trevor a horrible criminal with no conscience?
GTA,3d0a2x,Si421,5,Sun Jul 12 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"The dude has some major issues, sure. But he has a messed up past. He does occasionally show some remorse and emotions. Like in the face-off between Michael and Trevor in North Yankton, over Brad's grave. Both of them show some serious remorse, and prove that they do really care about each other..."
GTA,3d0a2x,NemWan,2,Sun Jul 12 21:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Trevor is capable of remorse or empathy. He rationalizes other people's points of view instead of feeling good or bad about them, and compensates by asserting a personal code of fairness, that he expresses through acts of loyalty, which are meant to obligate others to be loyal to him — people who have nothing he needs or refuse to play along are disposable."
GTA,3d0a2x,darksugarrose,2,Sun Jul 12 22:40:47 2015 UTC,"While I agree about his crazy loyalty thing being one of multiple ways he manipulates others to keep them around (how would they stay around the whack job other wise?), Trevor is not ignorant of the shit he does and at some point even admits he scares himself with his own thoughts. Also he has pretty random shows of remorse sometimes, for example when you run into the Don Quixote looking guy that confronts Trevor about the work he did with the Minute Men and the unlawful apprehension of legal Mexican immigrants. Trevor is pissed of as always but you can tell from the get-go he wasn't really down with the shit Joe and Josef were up to.  As absurd and downright disturbing Trevor can be, the writers actually made a human out of that monster."
GTA,3d0a2x,Lord_Jeebus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna copy and paste some stuff from the wiki here, just to play devil's advocate.   In contrast with his heavily sociopathic behaviour, he has shown many times how needy he is for love and care. He tells Michael repeatedly how much he mourned him, to the point that he got a memorial tattoo with Michael's name on it. As he was being confronted by Floyd and Debra, he told them how much he wanted to be with them. His relationship with Patricia was also a display of true love and, in his words, he enjoyed a lot the time spent with her.  Despite his weak relationship with Amanda and having a strained friendship with Michael, Trevor surprisingly cares for Jimmy and Tracey, viewing them as surrogate niece and nephew. Evidence of his caring is chasing Lazlow Jones when he does a sexual pose against Tracey as she performs a stripper-like dance and forcing him to take off his pants and dance in his underwear. Also, he will not allow Jimmy to drink alcohol when hanging out with him. Despite this, Trevor will insult Jimmy and Tracey when he encounters them outside of missions.  Trevor also seems to sometimes dwell on respect. When Wade calls Ashley a ""bitch"", Trevor asks him if he thinks it's clever to disrespect women. He also often tells some of his friends to show some respect to himself, and also sometimes even others. When Wade is covered in what seems like waste, Wade's cousin suggests to call the heist off, but Trevor responds by telling him to respect Wade for what he went through and so he should carry on with the heist.   Trevor, despite his heartless behaviour, possesses an awareness for guilt. This is seen in the Strangers and Freaks mission Minute Man Blues in which Manuel; one of the innocent men captured by Trevor and the Civil Border Patrol members Joe and Josef on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant in the previous mission An American Welcome, stands up to Trevor fearlessly despite the latter pointing a gun at him, and claims he and his family have migrated to America since more than 200 years ago, saying that he is more American than Trevor is. He criticizes Trevor for disregarding civil rights with ""Trevor's friends"", who are harassing innocent legal immigrants and, in Trevor's case, in return for money. He adds that, unlike the Civil Border Patrol; he will not give Trevor a single cent for helping him to stop the Civil Border Patrol. Fueled by this and Trevor having already felt the Civil Border Patrol's actions were indeed illegal, he storms into a rage and hunts down and puts and end to the Civil Border Patrol once and for all. Also, when Trevor runs over a main character, he will often scream ""No!"" in panic, although he may instead blame the person for being in his way in an unconcerned way."

Maybe I'm weird, but I also liked all the characters in V, all in their own way, and thought the story wasn't the deepest, but still good.

Johnny is by far the most ethical. In a bad lifestyle he always tries to make peace and always does the honourable thing. A bleeding heart for his hopeless meth-addicted girlfriend. The polar opposite to Trevor and that's why Trevor hates him because it's goodbye Mr Nice GTA Protagonist - it's time for some havoc"

GTA,3cwhhn,BassWool,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"If your laptop didn't already come with an HDMI input for a capture card, then you're kinda SOL. AND it is HDCP encrypted which limits the PS3 to being played on specified devices, like TV only. You will need a composite or component capture card.   You can also get an Easycap , which is relatively cheap, and use the S-video cables from the PS3 to hook through USB to the laptop. There is a bit of latency vs using a cable-to-card hookup. Not too noticeable.  But, this doesn't exactly help you out right now. :("

GTA,3cwhhn,Nuclearbananas,3,Sat Jul 11 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"Red and green marks mean start and stop I'm assuming. The little green dots all over the place are likely because the map was taken from the in-game website where they show the locations of health kits, flying rats, etc.   This just seems like a really long Sprint race, I thought when it mentioned challenge maps, it meant to wheelie the entire thing or something."

From http://www.rockstarnexus.com/article/208/San-Andreas-updated-on-Steam-removes-songs-and-reverts-fixes  Adds support for XInput controllers (Such as the Xbox 360 controller.) ""Steering with Mouse"" now enabled by default (Vehicles turn when the mouse is moved. When disabled, the camera is able to be moved around with the mouse.) Entirely DRM free Removes several songs for all owners (Seems to be the same songs that were cut from the mobile version. We would have liked to see a situation similar to VC where only new Steam copies had songs removed and those who had purchased it before got to keep the songs.) Missing resolution options, including 1920x1080 (EDIT: To clarify, this was broken in the original 1.0 version, then fixed in patch 1.01. Later updates such as this reverted that fix.) Mouse oddities -  Always has been an issue with III, VC and SA. Alt+Tab'ing out of the game and then back in fixes it most of the time. Issues with mods - Mods always have had issues after the No Hot Coffee patch. Specifically, this new version had a compatibility issue with certain ASI loaders. Silent has already updated his loader to work with this version. There was nothing that could have been done to prevent this. Some previous game saves just start a new game (EDIT: Silent has told us that the German Steam version pre-patch was actually version 1.01, which would explain broken saves for some.

I had an issue with the mission editor in the original ArmA. My script for a mission wouldn't work, so one of the devs actually added me on Skype and watched me as I tried out the script, then showed me how to simplify it and make it work.

GTA,3cqiqi,SneakySnakeX,2,Fri Jul 10 08:47:45 2015 UTC,I see them telling people on Twitter to file a ticket. And once I had an issue which took them more than 6 weeks to resolve (character migration problem when going from PS3 to PS4) and although I reminded them almost weekly in the ticket system and on Twitter it still took them ages to resolve the problem.  It's really the worst support you can imagine. Support is scalable by the way. If you want to of course...
GTA,3cqiqi,xTHANATOPSISX,5,Fri Jul 10 09:14:48 2015 UTC,"It's truly incredible when you spend so many years with Blizzard then you come across many other companies to find most have shitty support.

They gave me a rounded number so I lost money and they said that it was a one time deal.. really, so if it happens again, I'm fucked?   Ridiculous yet people keep buying and playing so they see no need to change."
GTA,3cqiqi,SneakySnakeX,13,Fri Jul 10 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"You all do realize R* has sold over 50 million copies, right?  Even if you allow 30% for people who bought copies for multiple platforms, that's 35 million individual users.  So if 350,000 users have a problem requireing assistance from the developers or the community at large that's still only 1%.  ONE PERCENT.  I can't even imagine what the real numbers for user complaints is, but it likely isn't more than a few percent.  When 1% is a third of a million complaints, it doesn't take a big leap to see that many of those complaintants will be visible.  Add in that users will seek a venue related to the topic and obviously a small community will see a disproportionate amount of the user-base is unsatisfied.  And in spite of Reddits mass, this sub has just over one tenth of one percent of the total GTAV users worth of subscribers, and that covers all iterations of GTA, not solely GTAV.  Edit:  I want to add that I realize that many user are having problems that are often pretty unreasonable, and likely easily avoidable.  While I have had virtually no issues as a PS4 user, R* is still often shitty to the users that DO have problems.  My point above is that saying GTAV is wholely broken is a tremendous exageration.  The VAST MAJORITY of users have few or no issues and generally don't require assistance from R* or a third party.  Basically, people keep buying their games because they have had, and will likely continue to have a generally positive experience.  I know I have.  I will not defend the times R* have failed to provide customer service, but most users won't have that issue, and won't have any reason to be dissatisfied."

GTA,3ckp1i,InTheCatBoxAgain,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"Try to do the transfer without deleting it first. I don't see any reason why this shouldn't work, unless they only allow one transfer, which seems unnecessary.  But then again, you can go PS3 > PS4 > PC. I'm going to go ahead and say it will work. I really don't know why they would put a restriction on it."

GTA,3chem6,TheNathanNS,17,Tue Jul 7 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"The mod ADDS North Yankton to GTA San Andreas.   So, you can swap between North Yankton and San Andreas whenever you like!  I've been [kind of] working on this mod over the past month. I released a public beta about 2/3 weeks ago, which you can get here, if interested.  I'm the sole developer of the mod.  The map actually keeps the GTA V coordinates it has. So, like GTA V, North Yankton is accessible directly at the bottom right of the map, however, due to GTA SA's terrible draw distance, I made a simple CLEO script that adds a teleport marker at Los Santos international so you'll be instantly teleported to North Yankton.  As for bugs at the moment: Just a few minor missing textures (I need to add, I forgot to add in plg_rd's textures for the bridges) and a small issue regarding a wall at the church.  The entire map hasn't been done yet. But the ""base"" has. As in, most of what you see in GTA V itself.   Just thought I'd share here.   For the mod, I used a hell of a lot of tools.   See here, for some.   I used the Xbox 360 and PC versions of GTA V for this."
GTA,3chem6,jorgp2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:54:00 2015 UTC,Why not just max out the draw distance?

GTA,3cj8r9,GameMisconduct63,5,Wed Jul 8 14:45:46 2015 UTC,"Newspapers/Magazines could take over most of that. You could go to a mailbox and read the newspaper, which would have jobs and etc. And, a magazine could replace the websites: You can get a Luxury Motorsport magazine if you want to buy a supercar, a Warstock Cache & Carry magazine if you wanna buy a jeep, etc.  Or we could simply do away with all that and just go back to how the game worked in GTA III, with payphones."
GTA,3cj8r9,EksCelle,3,Wed Jul 8 19:01:23 2015 UTC,CBs!
GTA,3cj8r9,Eslader,2,Thu Jul 9 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"True, It would be a weird transition. But if anybody could pull it off it'd be Rockstar. I think the phone thing would be the biggest hurdle. The others could easily be dropped and replaced with specific locations or activities you can perform. Like instead of a Dating Website you go to the newstand and go to the pages where people are wanting to go on dates yadda yadda. So I guess Newspapers would be a bigger thing in the context of doing certain things. Contacting other characters would be the tough one I guess it'd just be your character going straight to them or using Telephone booths and Radio Common Carriers."

GTA,3cj8r9,SirExor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:23:45 2015 UTC,Personally I would like the game to be all three Cities. That would be the greatest thing ever. But that's only a dream but yes a 70's Vice City would be dope. Or just Vice City in general. I still am holding out hope that Rockstar makes a GTA in the 70's some day lol.
GTA,3cj8r9,SirExor,2,Thu Jul 9 12:09:52 2015 UTC,All 3 cities at once will never happen.
GTA,3cj8r9,SirExor,3,Thu Jul 9 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"It can, because like any other open world game in existence it wont load what you cannot see. Plus you could easily have planes be the loading screen when landing into LC SA or VC. It can be done but I don't think Rockstar will ever blow their load on a concept like that. They love each game having a singular focus on location."
GTA,3cj8r9,SirExor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it wont be possible because of size, I ment for the cross over visibility. To even have LC today R* must have to upgrade and renew every single texture, revamp all lightning, road systems, trees, atmosphere and add more excitement to a map that has already been outplayed by most people."
GTA,3cj8r9,SirExor,2,Thu Jul 9 21:30:52 2015 UTC,To add on I think Rockstar wants fresh ideas instead of reusing old stuff. Altough I think extending the GTA V map to include SF and LV would had been epic.
GTA,3cj8r9,Marshall_Lawson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"People could have said the same exact thing about GTA 4. ""Why go back to LC?"" To say they've already exhausted all of what they could possibly do with LC is pretty ignorant. We don't know we're not developers its not that absolute. I personally don't think they'll do it anytime soon but to say there's no point in going back to LC in lets say 6-7 years is pretty dumb."
GTA,3cj8r9,redeemin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"I know for sure it's not gonna be LC for GTA 6 , but that's a absolute no brainer. I was just saying it would had been cool with a 70's NYC imo."
GTA,3cj8r9,redeemin,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:59 2015 UTC,Yeah GTA 6 won't have LC but I definitely do not think GTA 4 is the last time we will visit that city again. Maybe I interpreted what you said wrong.

It's just pretty frustrating driving on the highways with the constant fear of getting rear-ended at 120+ mph looming over you. Also, sorry to bother you with another question, but have you experienced cars, for example in the roads just south of Fort Carson by the ammu-nation, and the area surrounding big spread ranch, moving really fast, if not faster than they do on highyways?

And the police shootouts etc in IV actually happen, whereas V just felt like a breeze. Like it was too easy to burn through. I didn't see a whole lot of relevant character development for the story, and I thought the '3-intertwining-protagonists' wasn't executed as well as I had hoped.  Whereas in IV, San Andreas, you can remember each main character distinctly. Their own personality. I felt the whole 3 man thing diluted V quite severely. It's obviously pretty, and the mechanics that work behind the scenes are brilliant, but it's missing that 'oomph'."

GTA,3cbdye,StaticSeasons,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"True, I think opinion is mostly based on what people are used to.  When GTA V first came out, I found the car physics very lightweight and weird compared to IV.  Now, after having played V extensively and getting used to the way different vehicles handle, I honestly think IV's handling is over-exaggerated (almost like they were trying to show the full potential of the RAGE physics at the time) whereas the new handling, to me, makes the car feel more like a powerful and dangerous machine--going at top speed, you actually get a sense of the damage the car could cause.  Only thing I think IV did better regarding vehicles is how other cars react when you barrel into them--in V they barely move and are rooted to the ground even if you come at them full speed."

The map was pretty ""static"", as it was the same nearly everywhere you went, the story wasn't really that good IMO and it felt far too serious for a GTA game.   Plus GTA SA has a load more cheats, more weapon variety, better PC port, planes and helis, tanks and, of course the traditional 6 star wanted level."

GTA,3c9tqm,POW_HAHA,3,Mon Jul 6 21:14:24 2015 UTC,"For me SA was the best GTA ever, althought IV was also fun and enjoyable. I see people complain about the only city map, dull, grey. But I think it's a matter of opinion, because I enjoyed it very much. The story is more serious then SA, but I dont know what are u looking for? saints row style? Although serious the story its very good, better then GTA V.   And to be honest in my opinion V it's the lesser gta when u talk about gta experience, good game, but I didnt felt the same think as when I played SA or IV the first time.  Liberty city storie equally good."
GTA,3c9tqm,Spoofer07,3,Mon Jul 6 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"I think the story and characters in GTA IV are far, far superior to the ones in San Andreas.   However, San Andreas is much more of a sandbox. You'll probably have a lot more fun on there. More things to do, more character customisation, and far more variety in the map.  Plus, on PC, GTA IV is a horrifically bad port.  I'd generally say SA first but if it's story you're going for, then get IV. IV also exists in the same universe that V does if you ever plan to get that, whereas all GTAs prior to IV exist in a seperate branch of the GTA universe."
GTA,3c9tqm,Doylio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"IV's story is pretty grim and the cityscape is pretty gray.  I'm not knocking it - GTA3's Liberty City was the same feel, very gray and a concrete jungle.  SA is much more bright and colorful, the story considerably takes a lot of twists and turns although it's a little disjointed at times."
GTA,3c9tqm,simplycass,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"GTA IV has a much deeper and multi-layered narrative exploring the themes of the ever distant ""American Dream"" and the corrupting power of greed.  Walking around the streets of Liberty a City, you get a sense of what a piss-hole the place really is, with old, chipped graffiti littering dilapidated buildings, so closely and haphazardly packed together that the streets are dark and claustrophobic.  The seedy and unpleasant aspects of criminal life are explored through the character of Niko Bellic, who is forced to commit crimes he does not feel comfortable with in order to survive in a dangerous world, ruled by criminals, many once like him, who have succumbed to the corrupting influence of ""American Greed""  On the other hand, GTA: SA, a game considered to be the height of the series by many, provides an interesting (if slightly biased) view of early 90's SoCal gangbanging culture.  While the narrative is less coherent, it does loosely explore the themes of community and brotherhood against a backdrop of the crack epidemic that swept through poor communities in the 80's and 90's.  Drugs, and the money gained from their dissemination, in this case are used as a plot device to show how loyalties die and communities are destroyed in an attempt by some to become successful kingpins.  Overall, I would choose IV because of the amazing story and characters.  I honestly felt like I had learned something about the darker side of criminal life after finishing the story, contrary to the more glitzy GTA V, which doesn't really directly confront the player with the consequences of their actions."

GTA,3bydxm,CODMuffinMan,3,Fri Jul 3 05:43:22 2015 UTC,I guess I missed something.. I honestly have no clue what happened.
GTA,3bydxm,mods_suck_dick69,11,Fri Jul 3 06:13:58 2015 UTC,"Basically, Reddit's administrators have been doing a shitty job, and the recent decision to fire a very important admin (who helps some of the most important subs) was the spark to ignite the powder keg.  So moderators of many subreddits have decided to ""shut down"" their subs in protest of the admins' shitty work. There are two main reasons for this: because keeping some subs running without the fired admin would not go well, and because shutting down (more than) half of reddit might actually send a proper message.  The unfortunate thing is there are plenty of subs shutting down that don't really need to be shut down, but the fact that they are adding to it still kinda helps the cause in a way (but not enough to be worth it). Subs like those include the GTAV subs, Fallout subs, and others that are directly related to specific fanbases. If a sub like /r/movies shuts down then that's pretty big, seeing as it's a default sub and is for a very broad topic. A sub for the production company /r/roosterteeth however is probably better off staying up because it would just be another drop in the sea of more important subs going down.  I think GTA subs, Fallout subs, and all other kinds of subs devoted to specific fanbases or insignificant topics shouldn't have bothered... but I personally respect any sub that does it out of solidarity."

GTA,3bydxm,mods_suck_dick69,6,Fri Jul 3 06:39:10 2015 UTC,I think the default subreddits going private definitely sends out a message but seriously this is going overboard. I'm getting annoyed by all the niche subs going dark.

GTA,3bydxm,DERANGEDcitiZen,29,Fri Jul 3 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"That's the point. The mods of these subreddits have done something drastic and overboard, but it's necessary because it'll get the attention of the admins.

Victoria was a really helpful person in organizing AMAs, however, upper management fired her on the spot, with no notification to other subreddits, specifically, /r/IAmA. So, a bunch of major subs are going into private in protest to this decision after /r/IAmA started to private itself first."
GTA,3bydxm,Bieberkinz,4,Fri Jul 3 05:40:28 2015 UTC,She must be sitting at home laughing at the Reddit employees right now.  I know I would be.
GTA,3bydxm,Kinectivity_RBLX,2,Fri Jul 3 05:43:07 2015 UTC,We'll see why she was termed
GTA,3bydxm,TheDemonator,-1,Fri Jul 3 08:20:27 2015 UTC,"I would not call her position easily replaceable. She organizes AMA's for multiple subreddits and fishes out whether the actual famous person doing the AMA is in fact the person or their agent(probably not easy). Even if the position were replaceable the reddit community would most likely not accept the new employee as well as they did Victoria, many reddit users were very happy with the way she did things. To end this rant, I think this is kind of the last straw in a string of infuriating events that reddit management has caused. This pent up anger from mods and users is now coming out at a larger scale."
GTA,3bydxm,Tootinglion24,2,Fri Jul 3 14:19:20 2015 UTC,No they will care because she actually verified if they were the actual people and not just their PR team. Also she fought for the community and was one of the few who was liked by the community and participated. I'm glad the mods were given power in the AMA's sub instead of admins.
GTA,3bydxm,mitchb6,2,Fri Jul 3 15:14:43 2015 UTC,They literally had an AMA dedicated to her. She's one of the few if not the only admin that has had users want this for positive reasons. Also do you really think telling the agent from the celebrity is easy? These agents know crazy amounts of knowledge about their client and the questions asked on AMA's usually aren't terribly personal. I hope you don't think that Victoria would actually get together with the celebrity in person to do AMA's. This would happen in very rare cases. Not to be rude to reddit but celebrities are busy people who can do other things than reddit AMA's.

Prebuilt PCs and ones built by amateurs tend to overheat, especially if you haven't cleaned the dust out of them in quite a while.  Download GPU-Z and Core Temp, make sure to run them before you play and check the markers for GPU-Z to keep updating in the background. If you experience your ""lag spikes"" (bad wording), tab out and see what happened.  Check your CPU temperature in Core Temp and compare it with tjmax. If you hit that limit, your CPU is overheating and thus throttling.  Check GPU-Z to see how hot your card was at the time and if it clocked itself down at that time. That would be your GPU overheating."

Believe it or not 2GB of VRAM doesn't give you the ""what the fuck ever"" for graphics attitude (get 4+ then you can do that). 2GB VRAM (on GTA V) gets you normal, functional graphics with no AA at about 30-40fps no crash.

GTA,3bmw0f,SimonGn,4,Tue Jun 30 15:04:19 2015 UTC,Hard to say... GTA logic... I'm guessing more on the lag side because the minimap shows you going right through them. That means on your screen you see yourself scrape past but on their screen they see you bang right into them

GTA,3bmw0f,sn3eky,3,Tue Jun 30 15:37:20 2015 UTC,My guess is neither your computer or the server registered a hit but the C-130's computer did due to some lag. On his screen the plane probably blew up instantly but by the time the server realized what had happened and communicated back what should've happened it was too late to try to fix it so the game just kinda went with it.

Of course, if you want to get outraged about something, this is another example of how violence isn't considered adult content when rating movies or games or anything else, but sex is."

Therefor the scriptcode, the models, the animations and the dialogs by the original voice-actors were all created by RockStar. The only thing I had to do to enable the mini-games was toggling a single bit in the main.scm file. (Of course it was not easy to find the correct bit)."

GTA,3bigm0,oven_chips,7,Mon Jun 29 16:04:34 2015 UTC,This is the answer. Change your resolution from (for example) 1280 x 720 x 16 to 1280 x 720 x 32. Just scroll through the whole resolution list and it will switch to the x32 resolutions. :)

Start at the simplest solution and just unplug all of your chords, (HDMI or whatever you're plugged into)   Use canned air or something gentle and clean  to try to rid the ports of any particles.  Then firmly plug everything back in.  If that doesnt work step it up and attempt taking your Graphics card out and doing the same.  I had the same issue (Pinks and Greens only) happen to me on the Tomb Raider Reboot.  For me that quick fix was all I needed however I've had friends who have had their cards start to go out and they've claimed discoloration like that is a symptom.  Hopefully for you  it'll be the easy solution of just replugging everything in cleanly."

GTA,3bbe42,Charles3129,12,Sat Jun 27 20:22:47 2015 UTC,Can think of a few things that usually cause this. Non-gaming video card or laptop. Massively outdated gaming video card. Outdated drivers.
GTA,3bbe42,Anach,6,Sat Jun 27 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"I do have a gaming rig.  It is 4 or 5 years old though.  How do I check for driver updates?  If they are already up to date, then I guess it will be my video card that may be out of date."
GTA,3bbe42,Anach,7,Sat Jun 27 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"5 years it the typical lifespan for a decent gaming rig (Intel i7, high end Nvidia card), or around 8 years for a ridiculous gaming rig (Overclocked i7, SLI, SSD, etc). For something mid-range, you'll only typically get a couple years out of it before you need to update something. You really need to give us the specs of your PC. If you are running Nvidia card, then go grab the latest Nvidia drivers from Nvidia's website, and if you are running AMD, then get the latest drivers from the AMD website. If you are running Intel Video, then you don't have a gaming rig, or possibly you have mistakenly plugged the monitor into the wrong port."
GTA,3bbe42,Anach,3,Sat Jun 27 21:03:17 2015 UTC,Ok thanks.  I have an AMD card.   AMD 6570.   Checking AMD's site now
GTA,3bbe42,Reilly149,3,Sat Jun 27 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"While that card is technically called a gaming card by AMD, I wouldn't use that to describe it. It's a very cheap, low-end card, not really built for gaming. This is probably going to be your issue in GTA and many other games. If you don't know which cards are for gaming and which aren't, then the size of the card is usually a good way to tell if it's a gaming card. Google image search for your card, and you will see its quite small, with a single fan bolted on. Then you look for something like a 6970, which is the high end of the same series (I had one), and you will see there is a big difference between gaming cards and non-gaming cards, with good reason."
GTA,3bbe42,jallen315,3,Sat Jun 27 22:23:31 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Problem is I don’t have the resources to buy a new video card.  Got my drivers updated and will have to play on lower video settings.  Haven’t had any problems yet.

GTA,3bbo8a,doqimu,3,Sat Jun 27 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"You can kill stealthily, using silenced weapons or a stealth takedown, but ultimately there are only a couple of missions in heists preparation stages where you utilize it. Enemies are usually grouped together and they will raise an alarm instantly, once you shoot any of them. Sometimes you can snipe someone standing aside from a group undetected, but it is rare and you certainly can not complete any contact mission fully in stealth."
GTA,3bbo8a,Dragoniel,4,Mon Jun 29 05:18:13 2015 UTC,"There's no stealth system in the game. You can move stealthily and slowly, but it makes no difference. If anything, it just slows you down.  If I think you're referencing what I think you are, that mission is just a 'stealth' mission.  I don't know if cops etc notice stealth and that, but it's not part of the game ultimately.  If one enemy detects you though, they all do. I can tell you that's in there for sure."

Once in a while you will get a one star wanted level for car jacking someone, but it's rare.  It's not like GTA 4 where there was a cop every couple of blocks, it's very rare to see a cop just on patrol in the city.  If you're shooting your gun while driving, most of the time someone will call the cops.  it's very easy to lose the cops in the game, just get out of their sight, and hide in a ally, or if you're in the desert, just go off road, for the most part cops will stay on the roads while looking for you."

GTA,3az6vq,tenhotuisku,3,Thu Jun 25 00:47:45 2015 UTC,One of my favorite things with v is the ability to hide to lose cops. In iv I found a great hiding spot when I had 4 stars. Just left it there and 30 minutes later the police were still looking for me. That would be 30 hours in game time.
GTA,3az6vq,newuser27,3,Thu Jun 25 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"Until recently, I thought one minute = one hour in game. It may not be this way in all of them but in gtav, two minutes = one hour in game."

GTA,3az6vq,HearshotAtomDisaster,-1,Thu Jun 25 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"I find if you head to the nearest train tracks, and fallow them, you can loose even a very high wanted level quickly.  Cops for the most part won't fallow you on the tracks, and if they do, you can just speed ahead very easily.  Also, you are always going to go into a tunnel at some point that will loose the helicopters.  You just have to look out for trains coming at you; but if you've ever waited for a subway train, you know that trains don't run very often.  So the chances of getting hit are very slim."

GTA,3axkak,CreamyGoodnss,13,Wed Jun 24 14:45:06 2015 UTC,That is probably true. On the other hand I think weather effects in games are mainly a vehicle for the devs to show off their coding skills. 😝

GTA,3axkak,penisinthepeanutbttr,3,Wed Jun 24 17:02:45 2015 UTC,So it adds a challenge to the game by increasing the difficulty when racing. So by that logic the entire game is just a giant show-off by Rockstar then..

GTA,3axjdl,DoctorxWalrus,12,Wed Jun 24 08:23:01 2015 UTC,"Great work on the math, but it's ultimately subjective. If you've played some of the major MMO's, 90 hours for the games top item or gear is completely normal. In some it's even conservative, with item sets taking many hundreds of hours to complete or craft with or without RNG factors.   A second argument is ""should"" the casual player have every item in game? If for whatever reason the time involved in accruing that amount of cash isn't possible,  R* does offer shark cards for just that purpose. If paying real money isn't an option, and neither is the time commitment in the short term, then accept it. Make it a long term goal to work for over time, and when you get it the reward will be all the sweeter."
GTA,3axjdl,DigitalSignalX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:56:27 2015 UTC,"The counter argument to the ideo of the ""top tier"" items is that the new toys (osiris aside) have virtually no actual uses.

If you feel that playing the heists is work, the cards save you at least 90 hours of work by your estimate. If you don't get anything out of heists and you feel your time is worth more than $1.80 an hour AND you really want the gold Luxor, just pay for it.  3) Just like a gold apple watch in real life, there's got to be a way to indicate people have way too much money... that's what the gold luxor is there for in the game."

It was a real mess, but the RP was the most important to me anyways (97 levels). In the end a friendly scripter dropped some cash on me and i bought most of the cars and apartments i was missing.

All that prep work, and that flawless execution. GTA V heists lack the personality of that heist. Doing it to help a friend and fuck over a bad guy. A bad guy that you had helped earlier. Oh man, GTA V/online heists have nothing on that thing.  2. Area 69. GTA SA. Acting like a fucking ninja, taking out all the guards before they saw you or raised suspicion. And then going underground and taking out everyone and finally getting down to the absolute bottom and taking the prize we all wanted. The Jetpack! (That we had already played with because of cheats :P)  1.The End. GTA:SA Simply because GTA San Andreas was my first real game love. It was the first one that I played, and played, and when I wasn't playing it, I was thinking about it. And then the last mission ended, and the credits started rolling and I was just so sad. For a number of weeks that game had been a huge part of my life and it was over. I still get that same feeling after I complete every GTA game, but never as strong as the first time.

I personally find Roman to be one of the most fascinating characters in any GTA, and for him to be taken away like that, was just shocking. Also, I am sure no one gave two fucks about Kate.  *GTA SA: Drive-Thru- The whole mission was funny, but that part where you gun it and drive off the ramp through the billboard and they even go ""oh shiiiiiiit"" was just too cheesy for me to forget. Like real classic GTA, there is even a sexual innuendo on the billboard as well.  *GTA 5: Fresh Meat- After you save Michel and go back to his place, Michel and Franklin talk. When pressed about what happened in North Yankton, Michel tries to cut the conversation short with ""I know what you meant"", and is a silent pause from Franklin. I thought that really was a sign of how much the writing in these things matured. For me it also helped me make a more complete ending.  *GTA 4: Truck Hustle- This is a minor scene but I thought that the opening cut scene for this mission was so classic GTA. There's the overly stereotyped characters of course, but the way they speak to each other (Ray Boccino and Phil Bell) that it's one of those moments that kind of stuck with me (the mission didn't)."

Anywho, a chick got on my bike with me and I went over the jump by the Malibu club. In mid air we just detached from the bike and landed about 10-15 feet from each other. I stand up and see she does too and the bike slammed on the ground in front of me and skidded across the ground and crushed her as she just stood up.  GTA:SA - Playing two player with a friend when she got a sword and cut my head off. I believe I started it with immortality cheat so when I respawned in SP I was running around with no head and blood gushing from my new wound.  GTAV - Online; Playing with friends again and driving on the motorway near the military base. It was a stolen sports car (an infernus, I think). As it was stolen I couldn't mod it and give it bulletproof tires. One of my friends is driving his Turismo and is just behind me. He suddenly shoots out my front right tire and I immediately lose control and swerve into oncoming traffic. I ram a sedan or something and they scream bloody Mary and the car takes off and crashes into a car parked on a driveway and explodes on impact. I actually felt guilt."
GTA,3ag3wk,inyafaice,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Your question's a little difficult for me to understand, but I'll try to sum up all I can.  Yes, by clicking right on the D-Pad you can choose an unlimited number of the Stock Cars, so you don't need to worry about blowing them up or losing them.  This means you don't have to park them in a space in your garage unless you want to save certain customization features, which leads me into my next answer.  When spawning a 'Special Vehicle' such as the Elegy RH8, it will give you the plain, vanilla, no customiazations version of the car -- every time.  The only way to save a customized 'Special Vehicle' is to actually keep it in a space in your garage.  So instead of spawning another plain Elegy RH8 using the 'Special Vehicle menu, if you wanted the custom one you would have to take it out of its garage spot.  This also means that the customized version will only be available in that one character's garage, as the others will get the plain Elegy RH8 when selecting it from the menu."

GTA,3ag0oj,t12totalxyzb00,2,Sat Jun 20 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"You can temporarily change various settings to fix stutter with 970. After launching the game I for example change MSAA from 2x to 4x, apply, set is back to 2x and the game runs smooth. You can also alt+tab to windows and alt+tab back to the game but I felt this increases the possibility to get the D3D_DX11 error. It´s nice to hear that /u/t12totalxyzb00 also uses this techniquie and feels the game runs better since some people think this ""hotfix"" does not work with the 970."

It is a similar concept to Valve Anti-Cheat... they give players a selection of servers, where some are VAC enabled and some are not. Cheaters can go wild on non-VAC enabled servers and are asked to leave their cheats out of the VAC enabled servers. Some cheaters try to use their cheats in VAC enabled servers, and many get away with it, but the load is less. If you give them a place to go, there is no excuse that they haven't got anywhere to play with their toys."

GTA,3a1g7b,GraveGaming,40,Tue Jun 16 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"Wow two useful new cars, gun skins and ONE WHOLE NEW SMG that isn't as good as the ones I already have. Such DLC, many updates.  I do like Rockstar and I give them all the props for payless DLC, but it's hard to be excited for the DLCs at this point. I'm more excited for the title updates that fix bugs really."
GTA,3a1g7b,Paril101,7,Tue Jun 16 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"I would like to think they are going the CDProjektRed route by saying DLC is free, small periodic updates with minor fixes while the big stuff could be called an Expansion Pack or something. At least they are giving us stuff, but I agree on wanting a big piece of juicy story content.   Heists came out, but they were announced to go alongside GTA Online. Yes they were complicated for the developers to make but no excuse for lack of some sort of new Story Content 2 years after initial release."
GTA,3a1g7b,TweakedCulture,5,Tue Jun 16 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm super excited for a large expansion, whether it be story or Online. It's just really weird that it's taken them so long to even comment on it."

I hate delays and silence as much as anyone, but at least R* has a pretty great record of following through (no matter how long it might take)."

GTA,3a1g7b,shxrk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:48:23 2015 UTC,I sincerely hope not. With what they pulled in the Steam Sale too it makes me wonder if they are regretting the free DLC nonsense and charging for money when people are just getting around it anyhow.

GTA,3a1g7b,GraveGaming,4,Tue Jun 16 15:40:42 2015 UTC,But it is downloadable content? What is the wrong with calling it DLC?

GTA,3a1g7b,Pinkman505,0,Tue Jun 16 16:32:22 2015 UTC,DLC is a console buzzword to highlight the fact they finally got internet access.  PC players have been getting the same kinds of updates for ages...often also for free...and it never had a special name.

GTA,3a1g7b,Chairmonkey,-2,Wed Jun 17 02:09:19 2015 UTC,Small updates like this arent expansion packs.
GTA,3a1g7b,majoroutage,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:15:43 2015 UTC,"It is an update, yes, although considering it is a separate content package that must be downloaded (whether it be manually (http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/The-Ill-Gotten-Gains-Update-Part-1/477c4634-a9d7-4b6d-8c0b-b2a9a4a5c73d) or automatic), it is still DLC. DLC does not mean it has to be paid.  I complain because it's worthless for those of us who actually play Online legit. Everybody around us has already either hacked in the money themselves or joined a public lobby and was shot moneybags. Cars are ultimately worthless because of the ecosystem being completely ruined.  Guns aren't permanently droppable any more, meaning I'm stuck with a wheel full of weapons I don't use - that's why I am complaining about new guns. The new SMG is actually pretty good in terms of its stats, and it's the one I use for unsilenced stuff now, but I still have to go through 5 other SMGs to get to it which is extremely frustrating.  I'm not surprised you think I sound spoiled given the minimal wording of my post, but I'm not the only one with this opinion. It's great for the people who want to fill garages I guess, but that's just not the way I and many others play the game. I sunk a lot of time into this game, and it's extremely disheartening to see -new players- immediately have all of the new/best vehicles without even paying for them (those who have purchased Shark Cards I am completely fine with. They are helping to support the ecosystem and Rockstar's free content delivery). Certainly you can see my point of view for somebody who has supported and played the game since launch on the PS3."
GTA,3a1g7b,Paril101,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"I also played since launch day on the 360, now on PC. I grinded my ass off getting that luxurious Eclipse Tower apartment and all the cars I wanted. And I get extremely frustrated when I see level 15's that has spent less than 10 hours flying around in the golden jet, I completely agree with you that that sucks. But that does not mean the update sucks, instead of getting no new cars we get 4 new cars. I don't see the problem with getting content added without paying for it."
GTA,3a1g7b,GraveGaming,0,Tue Jun 16 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"When they could spend more time focusing on how to stop the cheaters (which they absolutely could do; it should not be that difficult for a company as big as Rockstar, when their Online mode is ""always online"", to implement some server-side rules that actually work instead of only looking into reports 4 months after they are reported), it is a little frustrating to see a content update that is entirely focused on money. That's my gripe with Ill Gotten Gains; the title is almost a joke in itself, because a lot of players (if not -the- majority of players at this point, on PC anyhow) literally have ill-gotten gains - some that have gains that weren't even their own fault! The update was tailored for those with a shitload of money to blow, and you and I are a minority that have actually grinded (ground?) and heisted to get this stuff."

My only real advice would be to collect a few oysters to make the grinding a little less boring.  Keep in mind that you don't need to max out lung capacity to play the mission; 15-25% should be enough.

After having played Fleeca to Humane labs finale Nonstop, trying to get the Mastermind challenge, I went to the toilet and got some food in the loading screen. When i returned, I found myself without weapons, surrounded by some kind of asteroid, and about three million richer.  Now I am banned, I have no idea why, I have no idea how long. I got a mail from R* suport linking me to the EULA and TOS, but without any statement that, why or how long I am banned...  I opened a support ticket, curious how long that will take.

I had a save from way back before the last mission and I just tried taking a car out of Trevor's garage and it worked.   So as a long shot I went back to my current save (much later in the game -  about 10% more progress) and now his garage in that save works. Don't know how or why but it does.   I probably should mention I have the PC DVD version of the game as reference in case anyone else ends up having this problem.  Thanks again for the suggestion."

Essentially, you have to have internet constantly connected so rockstar can communicate with your PC to make sure the game isn't pirated, even if you bought thru steam. Look at it like what x box 1 was going to do when they launched the console, the required internet connection. There are no plans on fixing it because this is how rockstar made the game. They said if they got enough complaints then they would look in to doing something about. Best thing to do is call rockstar and complain"

GTA,39ya3a,shauryak,0,Mon Jun 15 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it.  You don't say how much RAM you have. Apple's website state they do two versions of this laptop with either 4GB or 8GB ammounts of memory.  Additionally according to this it says the graphics is Intel HD 4000, which if past experience is anything to go by, ""onboard"" graphics do not have the power for modern 3D games. This graphics chip also does not have it's own VRAM so it will have to use some of the system RAM, which at best on Apple's website is 8GB in total which I don't think will be enough at all.  You could drop the settings down to the lowest and you may get something, but to be honest I don't think it'd be worth it.  However I have had GTA5 running using an AMD HD7770 which is a very old and cheap card now, but the settings had to be on very low and it looked worse than GTA4. But this card is about 3-4 times the speed of that Intel HD 4000. IMO onboard graphics are a waste of components.  Edit: Oh forgot about the Bootcamp bit, not a chance! Your laptop will also need to emulate windows which will use a good chunk of it's resources as it is."

GTA,39i8pj,MattMisch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"As the Ill-Gotten Gains DLC is an update as well as new content, it also includes bug fixes (such as reinstating depth of field functions on the Snapmatic camera app) so it’s likely that the latest mods issue isn’t intentional.   From your own source dude, did you even read it? I know you want to circle jerk about it, but don't ruin the game for others by lying."
GTA,39i8pj,TheAtomicOwl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"Likely is the key word there. If they actually cared they would have issued a statement. They have not.   Edit: you seem to have not read either.   ""I wonder if RockStar will say again that they are not against single player mods. Got the patch (1.0.372.2), native hashes are changed, drm code protection is applied to lots of script related functions, including natives itself. Backup your files til ScriptHookV update.""   They blocked them with DRM. not an ""Accident."""
GTA,39i8pj,MattMisch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think so,  they're a big company, it takes a lot to put together a statement and approve it from pr and such. The update has also been out for about a day."
GTA,39i8pj,TheAtomicOwl,-1,Fri Jun 12 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"I bought the game at the midnight release for 360. I waited patiently for GTAO, I then waited more for iFruit to get mt custom plate. They pushed notices on what was happening pretty quick in the early days. They can simply put out a ""PC mods not supposed to be disabled, will be fixed as soon as possible"" like they do for other problems. Remember PC release and the textures changing on PS4/Xbone? They released a notice in under 48 hours.  Now go back and read (I noticed you downvoted before my edit and before you replied) that it's blocked behind DRM, not a simple code problem with the depth of field this reporter mentioned."
GTA,39i8pj,MattMisch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"I've bought it all three times too, and they never released statements quickly. You've gotta give them more time than one day. Also, how the fuck would I know you were going to edit and you downvoted me right away too.  Edit: also I just read your edit, I did read the article, and that quote is probably from another butthurt modder who is assuming big bad rock star is out to get him right away just like that enb guy did."
GTA,39i8pj,peterhobo1,32,Fri Jun 12 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Allthough everything before this sale was scummy, not putting it on sale now is fine with me IMO. Its a recent release in AAA terms, and many AAA games won't get even 10% for a full 6 months. Complain about them taking it off, the putting it back up at $85 with a sale down to $60 but having it at $60 with no sale isn't a crime."
GTA,39i8pj,GrognakBarbar,21,Thu Jun 11 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wouldn't care if it just wasn't on sale. It's worth full price anyway.   This bullshit they are pulling though. What a fucking insult to everyone's intelligence, what do they take us for..."

GTA,39i8pj,GrognakBarbar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"Don't be so naive. Giving us free stuff? You think they care about us liking them? For a start, shark cards aren't worth jack shit. Hackers have fucked the economy.   They are effectively giving nothing extra, charging the same price, and calling it a 'sale'.   That's not even the part I was referring to though. I was talking about the game alone being listed as being originally $85 dollars, on sale to 60. We all know that it's bullshit. Look, if they don't want to put it on sale, then don't. Don't put it on the sale page for the original price to try and get extra sales."
GTA,39i8pj,bombings,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"The sale is Steam's idea, not Rockstar's. It even says that right in the name of the sale."
GTA,39i8pj,SpaceCowBot,-9,Fri Jun 12 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"THEN GET THE FREE GAMES, jesus christ nothing will please you people. Or don't buy the game at all. You're literally complaining that they're trying to give you free stuff with your full price purchase.   That price raise was obviously an error, as it's been corrected now and that sort of thing happens EVERY SINGLE STEAM, vavle fucks it up somehow. Unless you honestly believe that Rockstar thought they could pull one over on the whole internet by raising the price of there game thats been out 2 months to a price above even brand new games.  Maybe you don't like the free stuff that they're peddling with their game, but that doesn't mean they're being malicous in their sales."
GTA,39i8pj,cornette,5,Fri Jun 12 00:10:23 2015 UTC,The price raise wasn't an error considering its still raised. GTA V was $75 for Australian's yesterday. Now its $93 reduced to $73. That is bullshit. No one would of given a fuck of they didn't put it on sale other then some disappoint. Now they just pissed everyone off by insulting everyone's intelligence by raising the price then reducing it to what it was.
GTA,39i8pj,SpaceCowBot,-10,Fri Jun 12 00:42:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, well could still be an error they're working on. Because at least in America it's the same price, with an extra game or mircocash.  Maybe R* just hates Australians... Can't say I blame them, such a loud people."
GTA,39i8pj,BirdPecker,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:53:20 2015 UTC,I'm sure that's it. It takes a bunch of computer scientists 20+ hours to change the price on an online marketplace...
GTA,39i8pj,SpaceCowBot,0,Fri Jun 12 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"No, for sure its Rockstar thinking that no one would figure out that they raised the price of their game above the price of any new game out there. That makes a whole lot of sense...  You're a fucking idiot."
GTA,39i8pj,Leafy_head,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have been disappointed if they didn't include it at all in the summer sale, but I could understand it as a business decision. But what they did with the bundle and price dancing was on another level and greed.  Fuck that company.  And... Steam, why would you allow this kind of bullshit? It's like you care nothing for the reputation you worked over the years to build."

GTA,39i8pj,Interference22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:29:49 2015 UTC,I agree. Don't want to put your game on sale? Then don't. Don't screw the figures to make it look like you're offering something you're not.
GTA,39i8pj,RichB93,4,Fri Jun 12 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they've pulled this tactic to make it appear on sale and dupe people, as well as get free advertising on the storefront. It's disgusting behaviour."

GTA,39i8pj,NecesitoSubaru,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:20:22 2015 UTC,"I just made a screencap. You are right.  http://i.imgur.com/L83Tj1b.jpg  It's price was highered from 59,99€ to 73,97€ and is now at a ""discounted"" price of 55,48€.  That's 4,50€ less, yet displayed as a -25% reduce.  Since before the steam sale it was 59,99€ as a standalone.  It's now being falsely advertised in a bundle. Which still is, in fact, misleading and illegal."
GTA,39i8pj,Senseless-Insult,-7,Fri Jun 12 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"People bitched and bitched and bitched so they took it down from the sale, you get what you deserve. People leave pissy little entitled reviews on their game so why would they make it cheap for you? You aren't entitled to anything just because of a Summer Sale"
GTA,39i8pj,NecesitoSubaru,6,Fri Jun 12 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"I feel entitled to honesty as a consumer.  Is it honest to raise the price from 60 dollars to 85 dollars, just so you can put it on ""sale"" for 60 dollars immediately?  No."
GTA,39i8pj,Senseless-Insult,-5,Fri Jun 12 14:05:03 2015 UTC,"Is it honest that people who don't even play it leave whiney reviews about how shitty it is and why we should boycott it? No, why would even think about giving in because of that? It's a new game, The Witcher is only $8 off too, but reddit has that game so deep in it's throat no one gives a shit. People need to get over it"
GTA,39i8pj,NecesitoSubaru,4,Fri Jun 12 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"The only recent negative reviews I'm seeing are directly related Rockstar's business practices, not about how the game is shitty.  Plus, even if these people don't play the game, why shouldn't they be allowed to post a review based on business practice related to the game?"
GTA,39i8pj,countpoopoo,-8,Fri Jun 12 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"They can do whatever they want, but they're only doing it because Rockstar is doing what they want, which is make money off a new game. So the game you want isn't on sale, stop bitching about it and ruining the games rating on steam and deal with it."
GTA,39i8pj,ahainen,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"That's the thing.  It isn't on sale.  But it was listed on sale.  The price was raised so they could list it on ""sale"" for the normal price.  That is unfair business practice.  I'm not bitching about the fact that I can't get the game for cheap, I'm upset with the fact that they are outright lying to people to make them think they are getting a discount price when they are not.  By all means, that makes it fair to ruin the game's rating on steam.  It is relevant to the game on steam because it is being sold on steam."
GTA,39i8pj,zerocool4221,-3,Fri Jun 12 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so they fixed their side of the problem, they took it off the sale. And people still feel like they should get it for a sale price for no other reason than a Summer Sale"
GTA,39i8pj,TenBear,4,Fri Jun 12 00:28:12 2015 UTC,"And guess what? They fixed it as soon as people started posting all of those negative reviews.  So job well done.  And before you say it was probably an accident or error, somebody didn't ""accidentally"" raise the price.  It's a little ridiculous to think that someone could perfectly ""accidentally"" raise the price so that the sale discount was the exact cost of the game when it is normally not on sale."
GTA,39i8pj,omac0101,-2,Fri Jun 12 00:30:33 2015 UTC,So why not wait for them to say something? People need to stop flipping their shit when they don't get what they're expecting. They didn't want to sell their new game for half price so they offer a range of optional extra's. People still flip their shit and will constantly be leaving those reviews because they didn't get their precious GTAV for 8 bucks.

The PC version is going to have the long tail of buying, so they can probably f around with it with bundles and what not and it won't hurt anything. 6 months from now, no one will fault or remember that R* did this. It's really shitty."
GTA,39i8pj,countpoopoo,0,Fri Jun 12 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"Try to take into consideration they are offering you a service for free. You don't have to pay to play online when it costs them money to maintain those servers from the electricity costs to running on the internet, server as mind need to be paid plus customer support plus devs. And they are giving y pu u all the dlc for fucking free. They want to bring in a bit of revenue to pay their shit, let them. Otherwise no more online mode. Then you guys will bitch about it closing down, then where will you be? It might be shady shit, but it could be worse. You could still have to pay monthly for the game as well."

GTA,39jxql,landonianb,4,Fri Jun 12 06:36:39 2015 UTC,Everyone likes discounts but I still think it's worth $60 dollars. So many gameplay hours are to be had! I don't really think that badly of R* for not putting a sale on gta. This is just my opinion but I think the replay value and the fact that they give away dlc definitely makes it worth $60 dollars to me. Plus I don't really think the hacking is really a big issue! Maybe I'm just lucky but I've found a hacker maybe 3 times.

I find a lot of the fun comes from playing with random people.  I played around 3 hours last night with a couple of friends and we ran into at least 3 hackers, maybe more that were not as obvious.

These heists look super fun but i have nobody that plays gta.  Am i missing a lot? Any tips to get going and enjoy online mode. ANYTHING would help. Thanks

It's fun, people will still kill you which is why me and my friends try to stick together. The heists are sometimes fun. Sometimes they're drawn out but that may be just me and I've only done a few. I would say give it a try though and see what you think.   And tips- from my level I realize you need to get a RPG and Assault Rifle ASAP. Also parachute. Don't know how many times I died from falling. I used to get murdered all the time and now I can at least defend myself. Just try to have fun doing stupid things. See an overpass, Go drive off onto highway. See a tower, Parachute off of it."

Jets are insured too I believe, but the issue isn't losing the jet, it's having your party come to an abrupt end right after it starts.

GTA,38yrwp,alcaponesuite,4,Mon Jun 8 07:34:45 2015 UTC,Yea that one mission where you have to blow up 3 vans and bikes with an rc plane had a huge increase to the gas tank capacity. It was much harder on the ps2 version.
GTA,38yrwp,scarface910,3,Mon Jun 8 10:27:43 2015 UTC,Correct – that Zero mission was in fact already made easier with the PC version back in 2005.

PC is by far my favorite platform so far. The graphics and feel of the game make it absolutely gorgeous. I was able to get back into the heat of it on PC even harder than I did before. Paired with director mode and rockstar editor, it is pretty hard to beat.  I am surprised you found it boring. There is never not something to do in this game. Sometimes I completely forget about the missions and just have fun going on cop chases, doing stunts, and sometimes just driving around the map. PC is my favorite platform for all of this.  I say its worth it but I am probably biased."

I've found I'm actually better at the game because I can see things smoother; if I see a car turning I can swerve to avoid it, whereas before I might see it too late.   Another thing are the graphics. You know that bridge entrance to zancudo, the one with the jet statue where you have to drive on the hill and over a lil bump to get in? I can't do that anymore, because there's so much foliage and grass in this game now. The world looks so much better and full of life compared to last gen. With that being said, even on low textures the game looks amazing.   To sum it all up, YES DO IT ITS WORTH IT DO IT - If not for the reasons I listed above, just for the mods."
GTA,38yrfu,herpderpcake,3,Mon Jun 8 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"PC is absolutely a better experience. Aside from the improved graphics and soundtrack, the biggest thing I noticed was the variety of vehicles. The console version (I played on PS3) had a tendency to spawn many of the same vehicle that you were driving which became a huge distraction. I attributed this to it being easier on the hardware to spawn far fewer vehicle models and just make duplicates. PC version has no issue with this, vehicles are unique and none of this bullshit where find a rare vehicle and as soon as you start driving there's a half dozen of them at the first intersection. I played GTA V just for fun on my friend's PS3 and I just recently built my gaming PC, the difference is night and day as far as overall experience, well worth the $70(CDN)."

Even on my older gaming laptop.   And I have a mic to find other people to play with.   I wish there was proximity voice chat so people might actually use it and not get annoyed hearing the people across the map.   Mods will come in time. I'm not ready to jump into those yet."

GTA,38yrfu,SneakySnakeX,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:08:59 2015 UTC,"PS4 isn't comparable to PC just because the graphics are better than Xbox One.   The difference between PS4 and PC are substantial. 4k is a good example of something PS4 will never be able to handle and this game already can do that on PC.   And the average priced gaming rig (for US) is around $800 including a so-so graphics card.. even then it blows PS4 out of the water. That's not even touching the players who have graphic cards that are alone worth $800.  If graphics between PS4 and PC weren't very big, I seriously doubt so many people would waste over $800 when they could get a console for $350. That's not logical at all.. but they do because the graphics for PC ARE substantially better."

I managed to get a 25% off deal and if I didn't get that I don't think it would have been worth it, plus 9/10 of my friends on PC own it so that makes it a lot more fun.  The 60 frames is good, really nice, self radio is great. Unfortunately I can't run it maxed on my build but it still looks fine.  As much as I hate to admit it but that's all it has going for, I haven't seen any mods that are actually worth downloading and  checking out (mind you I haven't been looking).  Bottom line: if you're buying it and have no-one to play with I would say pass, but if you've got a group of mates that you can screw around with see if you can get a discount from GreenManGaming (if you're not too annoyed that you wont own it through steam), they're regularly giving out vouchers that's the only way I find it being worth it.  But of course, that's my opinion."
GTA,38yrfu,viccie211,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:05:21 2015 UTC,The nodding scene has to rise and learn a lot about GTA V still. It takes a while for really good mods to come to a new game. Yes it runs on the same(but improved) engine as IV but it takes a while to get everything down.

GTA,38yrfu,rotorain,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:48:26 2015 UTC,"I have a decent gaming pc that can max out skyrim no problem with mods and all, but GTA V eats resources like I've never seen. I max out my overclocks just for this game and I can still only run it on high at 1600x900 to get 50-60 fps.   If your laptop doesn't have a dedicated gpu, solid cpu, and at least 8 GB of ram then there's no way it will be able to run it well. All the advantages of gaming on the PC have the drawback of requiring powerful hardware to realize all the benefits. Yeah the game looks amazing at 1080p @60 fps but you need a good computer to do that. That said, 1600x900 @50 fps and loading times that are 25% of the console versions is still totally worth it.

Server lag is a pretty big problem for the PC version. PC loads faster. 360 is all around smoother.

All using WASD+numpad controls."
GTA,38yrfu,Lrode10,0,Mon Jun 8 04:58:36 2015 UTC,A thumb stick has a greater range of motion than 4 keys just as a mouse has more accurate motion than a thumb stick. A keyboard can work just fine but you are playing at a disadvantage.
GTA,38yrfu,Dragoniel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well, I am trying real hard, but I can't think of any situation where I had a need of a ""greater range of motion"", really.   Flying jets I need to turn as tight as possible at all times, which means maximum pressure anyway. Same as keyboard.   Flying helicopters there are several ways to adjust your vector and fine movement controls doesn't work because of the ""snap-back"" feature - maximum force application required, keyboard works just fine.  You could make an argument about driving, especially at very high speeds, but that would require some extensive testing. Never had any problems with a keyboard. I don't do races, though. Weaving through traffic doesn't require that kind of minute precision."
GTA,38yrfu,Luringens,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:46:51 2015 UTC,"I keep a Xbox 360 controller connected and use that for driving, having pressure sensitive gas, brakes and better steering feels way smoother and is definitely better than WASD, but it's not gamechanging."
GTA,38yrfu,Dragoniel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my assessment as well. Driving is smoother with a controller, but it really doesn't matter outside of being able to cruise at lower speed than maximum or start moving without screeching your tires.   If there is really any tangible difference I wasn't able to tell and I'm just using a keyboard to drive nowadays, because it is annoying to switch back and forth."

GTA,38sz8z,481k,16,Sat Jun 6 18:44:27 2015 UTC,Not directly true. VAC works in the way it does so if someone is testing a cheat they don't know if it's detected or not. More people using the cheat on the probability of it not being detected (because nobody is going to wait for a VAC ban to happen) means more cheaters get banned.

Answer: No, you do not need to report this. We are able to tell the difference, automatically through gameplay data, between the cheaters and the players who received this money innocently. Players who were willingly cheating are notified about any action taken against their account. If you were not cheating, you do not need to do anything further.   TL;DR: No."

GTA,38ryog,Democrab,2,Sat Jun 6 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"this has nothing to do with their micros? Can you elaborate?  I am pretty sure its common practice to not want people cheating in an online version of any game to keep with fairness. Yes, in turn this may help with shark card sales but for fucks sake it isnt the only reason.   Yes they are banned but probably by programs set to identify large amounts of cash added to accounts within 30 seconds which shows it was a hack and needs to be corrected. Setting them to ban leads to a list of acct's they have to look at and fix. Make sense to you?  So can you give me an explanation as to why this is shark cards fault?"

You don't need to buy anything, just sit on the barber chair and leave. Make sure to save your outfit to save the duffle bag, as it can change back to a parachute upon reloading. Selecting the outfit again changes it back to the duffle bag. This will also let you safely see what clothes in your wardrobe are compatible with the bag."

GTA,38libr,Lambchops_Legion,2,Mon Jun 8 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"It could be as simple as thinking in 2002 that it didn't make sense to advance the number when the new story (Vice City) was set in time before the previous one (III). A different executive could have just as easily decided to call Vice City GTA IV instead. I don't think Rockstar had or has a master plan for the series.  If it was up to me, I'd say the system from IV on should be that the number goes up whenever it's an all new map. That's when you really get a fresh start and a new world to explore."
GTA,38libr,NemWan,2,Fri Jun 5 02:37:13 2015 UTC,"The number next to the title has only ever gone up when rockstar uses a new graphics engine. Gta3, vice city, and san andreas all used the same graphics engine. Gta4, tbogt, and lad also shared a graphics engine. I'm hoping that they make a spin off of gta5 before gta6 is released."

The engine has been used on several different platforms such as Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. RAGE initially evolved from the Angel Game Engine originally developed by Angel Studios for use in the sixth generation console era versions of the Midnight Club series and other Rockstar San Diego games.

Kinda like the RPG Neverwinter Nights comes with the editor (Aurora Toolset), this new GTA game would have a storyline and all that but also give all the tools so that players could use the scenario to create their own storylines, and share those campaigns they created with everyone.  Does anybody else here played Neverwinter Nights? Remember NWVault and its awesome modules like The Aielund Saga, A Dance With Rogues, Honor Among Thieves (my favorite)?

You can select the weapon slot by moving the mouse up, right, left etc. Once you highlight the fist slot scroll your mouse wheel to select a weapon for the slot. You need to do that while holding Tab. It takes a bit to get used to it, but it works.   Another way to do it is with the numbers on your keyboard. Each number is assigned into a weapon slot (1 is for fist), pressing the same number again and again will circle through the weapons in that slot."

GTA,37jle9,claystone,6,Thu May 28 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"San Andreas had that. You could go into negative cash in a casino (I forget where it stopped; I think it could be up to -1mil) and upon leaving, if you hadnt made back the money, you'd get a courtesy call saying that you owe money and not to be a stranger.  From that point forward, if you were still in the Venturas city limits, or if you left LV and returned later, you would get a second call saying ""Mr. Johnson, I see you're in the neighbourhood! I've sent my... associates... to have a word with you.""  A few seconds later, a car with four guys (oddly some of the game's more scraggly-looking character models as opposed to clean cut, mafioso types) would pull up in a Admiral and come out weilding the game's best firearms. I think one guy had a Desert Eagle, one had an AK-47, one had an MP5, and one had a Combat Shotgun.  They would shoot you until you or they were dead. After that, on foot or driving, they would pop up every few in-game hours until you left Venturas limits again or got back in the green."

GTA,37j7v3,thnye664,-2,Thu May 28 10:47:41 2015 UTC,Can you get 60 or 30 fps?
GTA,37j7v3,mroosa,2,Thu May 28 12:21:14 2015 UTC,"Not the original comment author, but I have a MBPr 2013 2.7GHz i7, 16GB 1600 MHz RAM, GeForce GT 650M 1GB with Windows 8.1 in bootcamp.  It runs fine to both of my external monitor setups (1650x1050 and 1920x1200) using GTA's auto configuration (which is pretty much set to Normal for most options (save for having to uncheck safe configuration to get the higher res which pushes the memory usage to 1127/1024MB + High shadows and FXAA enabled bringing it to 1147/1024MB. I get an average of 40 fps, but it does drop below 30 occasionally, especially when  in the wide open spaces on clear days. The Normal setting for shadows is a little ugly and Trevor's rampage/special is a little funky, but everything else looks and plays fine.  If your wondering about quality:    dusk underwater LSC more here   edit - I would be a little more wary of the MacBook Air, though. It is not meant for graphics crunching (No discrete GPU, only the integrated Intel HD graphics with shared memory). Even with the maxed out specs, your talking about 8GB shared memory between OS and the integrated GPU, so you will not get similar results. Also keep in mind, GTA V is 60GB. I set aside 130GB for the Bootcamp partition and the base install of Windows 8.1 + Steam + GTA V already ate up to 90GB of space, plus I have work related installs leaving me about 20 gigs free."

GTA,37cd5y,TheBigCon4800,50,Tue May 26 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, GTA IV is better than V in some aspects, it has Vigilante missions and has a free roam lobby setup that allows you to set weapon pickups and disable police. I also preferred the soundtrack but that is entirely down to my preference.   Some of the weapon additions in TBOGT were really fun too. The APC was so much fun to ram into cars and the TBOGT Buzzard didn't have that annoying delay between missiles like on V. Finally, although there were less cheats, I really miss having the cheats on a menu like in IV, going back to button sequences felt like a step back in V."

GTA,37c1t8,elr3y,9,Tue May 26 16:54:40 2015 UTC,I think an asian city would be too close to Sleeping Dogs
GTA,37c1t8,iterable,1 point,Tue May 26 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"That was Hong Kong. Comparing it to Tokyo is almost an insult. HK in Sleeping Dogs was nice but had very little immersion and replay value.

New Orleans - It's it's own world, very different thinking, accents, history than the rest of the US. Very interesting. Grave sites are tourist attractions, Voodoo is still widely practiced.  Detroit - Firefighters need police protection, and many homes have been burnt down several times to collect insurance. You have these truly epic, massive, grand terminals and factories that were the largest in the world at it's time that could be explored. Lots of crime but lots of hope.    Non-US Cities   Seoul, South Korea - North Korea as your neighbor, Advanced-Developed economy, US military bases. That'd be awesome.  Tokyo - Massive city meets ancient shrines older than most countries. Human trafficking, robots, Japanese mobs. Also, lots of Western businesses / people with obviously a prominent Asian society. East meets West.  Oslo - Nobody picks Oslo. Why? It has a huge muslim population that doesn't fit in with the Caucasian population. You could easily go into a Fargo-like storyline. It's also out of the cliche of cities. White, educated people can be crazy too.. their killer beats any US killer in regard to number of people shot."

Here's a quick sampling.    Houston   Huge city Giant bay/harbors Industrial area filled with petroleum refineries Some hurricane-damaged coastal areas that look like the beat-up parts of Sandy Shores Trailer parks  Oil platforms off the coast Galveston off the coast  Dallas/Fort Worth   Rich neighborhoods in the far north Grid-like roads in the Plano subdivisions Monster of a stadium where the Cowboys play Speed limits are high for some rather windy major roads   Austin   A beautiful city set in rolling hills  San Antonio   Great tourist area with landmarks like The Alamo and The Riverwalk  Corpus Christi   Giant Naval Base that could house multiple aircraft carriers  South Padre Island off the coast   Very pretty beaches  Great highway infrastructure Texas Hill Country Huge open grassy rural farmlands Some big lakes and rivers to draw from to make boats more interesting   Plenty of stereotypes to pick from, from rich businessmen in technology and petroleum, blue-collar workers, rednecks, immigrant workers. Extreme conservatives almost everywhere, but then a high concentration of hipsters, hippies, and liberals in Austin. You've got some seriously insane college football rivalries happening down here that might as well replace the gang colors that San Andreas/GTAV have. Nearly 80% of the civilians in the game could be packing heat, just waiting for an excuse to use it. There'd be giant trucks and SUV's everywhere. There's plenty of major and rural airports to make air travel more important, and the map could be so huge/spread-out that it would be useful."

GTA,37c1k9,ifaptoyoueverynight,2,Tue May 26 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"I've used ZModeler 1.07 (?) with GTA 3 and Vice City, I have no experience with newer versions of ZModeler. Last time I touched it was in 2006, so no guarantees here (I created the first 3D wheel/rim mods for GTA 3/VC back in 2003/2004).  There were a couple of things you needed to do to create a valid model for the game, iirc the hierarchy of the parts needed to be correct (correct order that is) and the dummys that GTA uses for various things (doors, engine, lights, ...) need to be present.  I've encountered this problem myself, but I don't exactly recall what was happening, so...  Which version of ZModeler are you using? Which dff export plugin if any? What is the ""minor thing"" that you changed? Are there any options in the export dialog that you could change (screenshot maybe)? Maybe a problem with the texture mappings (are you touching the TXD at all)? Did you do anything with the COL file? Are you able to install modded cars that other people made?  There are lots of tutorials on how to properly create/convert models for GTA 3/VC/SA, you might want to look at some."
GTA,37c1k9,p0d3x,-4,Tue May 26 16:56:28 2015 UTC,I heard something about that you have to edit the poly ID to get it to work in game but I couldn't read the whole solution because that particular thread was deleted. Basically Im able to export dff's but when added to the game they cause the game to crash. Yes I have downloaded other car mods that work so I know it's not my game that is unmoddable. It's just when I export a dff myself in ZModeler that dff causes the game to crash.
GTA,37c1k9,p0d3x,-6,Tue May 26 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. What I am trying to do is for now just to test if exporting a dff file is actually giving me a working dff file for the game. So I took a dff file of one of the unmodded cars from the game from gta3.img, then import it in ZModeler. I see it in 3D view and it looks okay. Then I'm exporting it without changing anything and choosing Textures as BMP like one should. I am not even changing anything in the car model, I tried making some small change but it doesn't matter if I edit it or not. I get a exported dff file that is about the size of the original file. I don't have any plugins, I have ZModeler Registered version 2.2.6 but it's basically the same as the older ones. When I at last import this new file into gta3.img and try to spawn that particular vehicle the game crashes, even though the car model dff that I exported is working, I see this because it is showing up in a 3D view in GGMM (Gta Garage Mod Manager. I googled alot of tutorials but most youtube videos are in spanish and I never found someone with my problem. Is there something I am missing that you need in order for the new dff's to work in game? I mean I am getting a new dff and I replace it in the gta3.img but it always crashes when that car spawns. Maybe I am missing something but I have no idea what."

GTA,37aw8e,Priyanshu7,3,Tue May 26 07:22:05 2015 UTC,"There's 51 missions in GTA III, I'm not sure how many there are in GTA VC because there are some you can leave and some you have to do to unlock the final mission, San Andreas had 100 and GTA IV had 95. I defintley think GTA V took a step backwards when it comes to SP content. Sure there's parachuting and strangers and freaks but I'd have preferred more to the main story. The ending was so rushed."
GTA,37aw8e,Spinetablet,2,Tue May 26 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of the missions in V are more unique or more well thought out than GTA games with more missions, maybe its a sense of quality over quantity?"
GTA,37aw8e,Akrash,1 point,Wed May 27 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"I loved the story, I thought it was really engaging and that the missions had a nice variety to them compared to IV but I was disappointed how quickly everything wrapped up.

GTA,37aw8e,GoodHustleOutThere,1 point,Tue May 26 18:08:20 2015 UTC,I think some of the feeling of our being shorter comes from there finally being a checkpoint system. You never had to redo an entire mission in this game. That cuts down playtime without cutting down content.

GTA,376shk,askaquestionforonce,7,Mon May 25 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Could be done, but not without many glitches/bugs. Small example would be simple clipping issues. a single footprint of this monster wont fit on a small street. You would need destroyed versions of each building which are non existant.   Only game i could think of that had demolition models for each/some building were bad company 2/Flashpoint1/Arma series.  Second would be particle effects.  Solely scaling up particle effects such as dust/explosions wont work and will look like shit. the dev would have to create massive particle effects that render over massive distances which would cripple the game to a point were it wouldnt be playable anymore.  Solely porting a model and scaling it up is also not how to create such things. there was a ps2 or ps3 game were you played against massive monsters/gods and they were a good example of how good such monsters would have to look.  Thats just a small objective viewpoint from a modder. I dont mod GTA but other games."

Plus the ocean in GTA is so big and empty I feel it wouldn't be that challenging to draw up and render a sea monster and throw it in there?"

GTA,3775zi,KilledFox,3,Mon May 25 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty hit or miss IMO. 2, 3 and are really nice, but I can't say the same for the others. The first in particular is too busy I feel. The fractals (?) don't work very well and is in severe need of some AA.      I feel as if the masking on the fourth image is a bit rushed. The characters have a weird outline and it just doesn't mesh well with the vanilla (I assume?) background.     The fifth image looks good, but it would look a lot better if you toned down the contrast, and the lack of AA is particularly noticable.      It might be just me, but I can't see anything done on the 6th image, but it might be because I'm on a few painkillers right now.    The last one however, was especially bad. It just feels like you used a filter from a free editing site.    That being said, 2 looks aesthetically pleasing, if not a little generic but 3 is amazing. Stick to that style because it's very refreshing and it just might be my next desktop background. Keep it up and remember to use AA for your screenies (assuming you took the screenshots)"

GTA,376del,JoshuaBr,15,Mon May 25 06:36:43 2015 UTC,I thought the car models in SA were MUCH better. Especially under the hood. Also the gun sounds have a lot more impact. The only things I saw that KIND of took a hit were the face animations.
GTA,376del,MSnap,-8,Mon May 25 07:40:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I always found odd about the car textures though were the wheels. They weren't round at all, and  it always bugged my eye having to drive around on nuts rather than wheels. I never got why it is so hard for them to make round objects in general? Even GTA V has alot of 3D models with ""round"" shapes, build up by obvious edges like a nut."
GTA,376del,ifaptoyoueverynight,3,Mon May 25 07:55:32 2015 UTC,it is all polygons. they make the models outta polygons so san andreas wheels had low polys but GTA V had high polys since it is on a better system that can handle it.

GTA,376del,Marzz,7,Mon May 25 08:55:09 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but polygons are not square based anyway. You sure can use two triangles to make a square, but you can also make other things, and this is essential. If we had to use squares only and couldn't use triangles, we would have to use exponentially more power to draw all the extra squares. Try to make a sphere using triangles and then squares.

Like our minds are all little triangle polygons coming together to make the complete polygon sphere of human knowledge.
GTA,376del,GoodWilliam,1 point,Mon May 25 18:33:56 2015 UTC,Well technically any shape with more than 2 sides is a polygon.

Shot to the arm or a leg won't do nearly as much damage as a shot to the chest or head (obviously).   Second, even if your connection is very good, theirs might be bad. I have no idea how the game handles situations like that, but it's a P2P system, there are always at least two sides to each event. What looks like a body shot to you, might be a grazing miss on their end.  And then there are are snacks and armors that can be instantly re-equipped, though you should notice that."

GTA,36rhql,BunkBuy,28,Fri May 22 00:26:49 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain to me why the BBC is being sued for making tv drama about GTA?  There have been plenty of similar unauthorized movie dramas about technology like Pirates of Silicon Valley(Apple and Microsoft) and The Social Network (about Facebook).  Even worst was Ashton Kutchner's historically inaccurate Steve Jobs bio-pic.   These movies weren't sued out of existence for trademark infringement.
GTA,36rhql,iMadrid11,20,Thu May 21 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"It's weird because the film isn't directly about GTA, but the makers of GTA and how they were sued by a lawyer who deemed GTA to be 'too violent'. My only guess would be that because Rockstar haven't been involved in the project they think that the BBC might be creating stuff that could put them in a bad light (maybe Sam Houser or others involved in the early years of Rockstar did some 'dodgy' stuff). So they asked their lawyers how they can put a stop to the production of the film and this is the best plan the lawyers could come up with.  Also the films you mention were all made in the US and the US has strong laws to do with fair use, parody and what have you. I'm not sure if we have those same rules/laws in the UK, so they might have a better case in this instance."
GTA,36rhql,AndysDoughnuts,3,Thu May 21 20:58:14 2015 UTC,No doubt the BBC would dedicate most of the show to how racist/sexist the game is.
GTA,36rhql,lelciv,6,Fri May 22 11:04:04 2015 UTC,Considering it's being directed by Owen Harris who made Black Mirror and Misfits and it's being written by James Wood who created and wrote Rev a really realistic portrayal of the struggles of being a priest in a rural multi-cultural area. I highly doubt most of the film is going to be about how racist/sexist the game is.

GTA,36p7fw,Manwich3000,9,Thu May 21 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"They've done London before, that was during the GTA 1/2 era. How about make that HD?"
GTA,36p7fw,Supertrinko,1 point,Thu May 21 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"The Leslie guy said in an interview that a return to London probably won't happen in a GTA game.  He said it worked for the series at the time, but he doesn't see it fitting in with the series today.   It makes sense.  The series has become based on satire around US culture."
GTA,36p7fw,TheBlueprent,0,Thu May 21 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"It's easy to be satire on UK culture, just look at Simon Pegg's movies. Maybe you could start out in a ""m8"" gang in London, then a petty thief, working your way up to master criminal, kinda like IV's story.  It would also be nice to see less ""American Dream"" and ""You're what's wrong with this country!"" jokes and phrases thrown around."

GTA,36p7fw,TheBlueprent,1 point,Thu May 21 18:58:42 2015 UTC,They should look into making it of a 3rd world country but with first world cities and beautiful natural environments. I'd say a place like Cape Town in South Africa would be perfect because it ranges from wealth to poverty and is located in and around lots of scenic routes around the coast line. There are also many other natural environments on land and also lots of small towns and suburbs surrounding it.

London would be neat but I think it would be harder to sell it to American audiences. We loved Liberty, Vice, and San Andreas because they were NY, Miami, and LA.  The jokes are topical and people understand them because even though they may not be from one of those cities, they know enough about it.  I'd wager the majority of Americans wouldn't know enough about London to be interested in a GTA game set in it, and while Reddit may have an opinion, they certainly are not the majority."
GTA,36p7fw,SeriousMichael,2,Thu May 21 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"I just picked London because it was already a destination that they had gone to, and it would be nice to see an upgraded version of it.

GTA,36o7i3,puptake,4,Thu May 21 03:49:35 2015 UTC,Not really. start carrying sticky bombs
GTA,36o7i3,3n1g,2,Thu May 21 09:16:58 2015 UTC,Insurance is a bitch though. I dont think we should have to pay insurance when destroying armoured cars or tanks etc.
GTA,36o7i3,Daleyo,5,Thu May 21 09:36:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  On the other hand, the Kuruma is a car you can keep on your garage... So it's just like a normal car... Except it's retardedly OP.  They should allow the Duke O'Death so we can just ram those Kurumas to all hell."

GTA,36o7i3,_Aurora_,26,Fri May 22 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"Explosives. Grenade launchers or rocket launchers oneshot those things, then you can engage the drivers in normal combat when they respawn, before they can resummon it.   From vehicles, get good at throwing sticky bombs and bait them in to alleys where you can drop a proximity mine on a bottleneck.   If you are caught in the open on foot, you can also try automatic shotgun, it sometimes works, but it's easier to just nuke that thing with a rocket."
GTA,36o7i3,Dragoniel,12,Wed May 20 21:08:40 2015 UTC,The automatic shotgun is the best technic as you don't have to pay the fucking insurance

Three times heavier than a Tank, if someone cuts an Insurgent off, they will get violently smashed away or just driven over by this black monstrosity, forcing its way through with brutal impunity.   Off-road, on-road, mountains, crevices, vehicles, rockets, miniguns, landmines, even aircraft cannons - it shrugs everything off and just keeps going, like a force of nature.

GTA,36o7i3,Dragoniel,1 point,Thu May 21 21:45:45 2015 UTC,Hydra and Lazer have the most powerful weapons in the game (machine guns) IMO.  Single flyby destroys a tank.
GTA,36o7i3,Shaggyninja,2,Thu May 21 07:19:50 2015 UTC,"Tank is much weaker than an Insurgent, though. I have tanked multiple attack runs from two jets at the same time, before they gave up and left me alone.   Granted, Insurgent will get killed eventually, but it can survive I reckon up to about a full second of sustained cannon uptime, which is a lot. Usually you get like 0.1-0.2 seconds uptime per attack run at best and if you are familiar with jets, you can make it very hard for them to get a bead on you."

GTA,36o7i3,ChosunYin,0,Thu May 21 03:56:35 2015 UTC,The SUV doesn't have a gun on it. The truck does though.

Don't waste your rockets just auto aim and tap the right stick up to two shot the gunner, then auto aim the driver and presto...

GTA,36o7i3,SpearmintTrafficCone,4,Wed May 20 21:29:30 2015 UTC,It's still annoying that it calls you a bad sport each time.  It's like the game is insulting you for using a decent tactic.
GTA,36o7i3,Senseless-Insult,1 point,Wed May 20 22:43:16 2015 UTC,Bad sport! You mildly inconvenienced somebody and compensated them for it. They can run you down but you can't defend yourself without being a bad sport haha.

GTA,36o7i3,Kommando666,17,Thu May 21 07:25:13 2015 UTC,I believe if you place a 1k bounty on them you wont be charged for the vehicle repairs. It's stupid but better than 8k or whatever it is.
GTA,36o7i3,Lithirm,11,Wed May 20 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say there are about four options.   Get a proper car and just flat out outrun them. If they really want you dead they'll continue chasing you. This isn't the best way to deal with it. Maybe even buy your own Armored Kuruma like /u/binaryecho suggested. Passive mode. You simply cannot be killed by a player, every kuruma related issue is solved. Blow up the Kuruma. My personal favorite, especially with a side of killing them some more when they're on foot and not so cocky. It's a bit annoying that it costs you some money, 6-7K, pocket change. Bad sport points.. well, I've blown up basically every kuruma I've seen, it's fine. Killing the driver. Aim for one of the sweet spots in the armor and actually shoot through it and kill the driver. I've never managed to do this while driving, but a couple of times while on foot. You of course have to know where the sweet spots are, so this is probably the least popular choice."
GTA,36o7i3,blowthatglass,2,Wed May 20 21:48:04 2015 UTC,I enjoy flushing someone out of their Karuma/Insurgent and getting into a little urban warfare.  I won't bother someone with a Karuma generally unless they come at me (bro) but if you do...it's game on.  Once they are on foot it's usually pretty obvious why they drive around in an armored vehicle non-stop.
GTA,36o7i3,smell_my_thoughts,2,Thu May 21 19:32:49 2015 UTC,They can still run you over while you are in passive mode. Really frustrating.
GTA,36o7i3,Magiobiwan,9,Thu May 21 01:24:52 2015 UTC,"Only on previous-gen consoles. On XBone, PS4 and PC, Passive Mode players are ""out-of-phase"" with normal players and they can pass through each-other. Someone not in Passive-Mode can still kill a Passive mode player indirectly by causing NPCs to hit them, but otherwise they don't interact. Also, I found out that if someone in Passive Mode drives a large vehicle (such as a Semi) into a fuel station and hits a pump while someone not in passive mode is standing by it, the person not in passive mode gets counted as the killer of the person in passive mode. However, the Passive Mode player is also counted as the killer of the non-passive player."

GTA,36o7i3,AbsoluteAnarchy,4,Thu May 21 07:49:57 2015 UTC,"Uparmored vehicles really need some serious balancing in my opinion. Right now its turning into a huge arms race where you're either driving one or running from someone who is. First they shouldn't have any insurance or bad sport penalty for destroying them. If you're going to drive around in an bulletproof car, then having someone pull out the heavier guns to take you out without consequences should be the trade off.  Not allowing people to shoot out of them is a second option, or severely limiting the cones of fire. That would make the car more defensive than the offensive murder machine it is now. This might help balance them better for missions as well."
GTA,36o7i3,welltheresAbacon,7,Thu May 21 08:35:27 2015 UTC,Kurumas are for pussies. People over use them in missions and think they're hot shit in Freeroam because they're bulletproof. They make people soft. I blow up every kuruma i see. It's well worth the money.
GTA,36o7i3,Grimlyn,3,Thu May 21 00:21:56 2015 UTC,"It's not in every lobby, but it tends to happen once others are seen using one. I normally get into a public game and see whats going on and if there's a lot of killing and people running around in Kurumas, If I feel like playing in the chaos, I get in my own Kuruma. If not, I join a new session.  Unfortunately there will always be the ""shoot-on-sight"" types who run alone and feel that killing everyone while in their Kuruma is so amazingly awesome dude. These are usually younger players.  You'll find a good session. Just be prepared to flip from one session to the next. If any of these happen; 1. There's a lot of killing going on. 2. People are running around in Kurumas 3. You see a lot of Insurgents icons on the map. 4. One person in a jet/heli being a dick. Just hitup a new session.  Also, TALK to people randomly. I've made friends just randomly trolling the trolls back, or just saying something stupid to start a conversation. Cruise around in a car and race up with someone. If they drive around with you, pretty good chance they're cool. Create your own event. Just last night my crew and I took an entire session skydiving. Just to be safe, a few were in passive mode. But that's what it's there for.  Passive mode is your friend. So you can't show your car off to other people in a public session? If it's that important, then create a private session and have them join it to oogle your cars. Otherwise, if you don't want to be bothered, the creators of the game included passive mode to keep yourself from being shot constantly by others.   It's really all about how you look at the game and your attitude toward gaming. You can take it seriously and get extremely frustrated all the time. Or just chill, go with the fun sometimes, or just find a new session.  The good session are out there. /r/gtav_cruises is the crew I'm in. I normally get into a public session with a few of them and try to start something. Hasn't failed yet. It's made playing online gta 5 worth it. So if you want to cruise around, join in private held sessions, just have fun without all the explosions every second, then join GTAC from your crews list in game too."

GTA,36q5u5,HiyoleX,7,Thu May 21 06:22:27 2015 UTC,I think the Bati 801 has the best overall performance with the Akuma following in its footsteps. Bati is better in my opinion pure because it can do wheelies really easy which makes the bike go faster. The Akuma has a higher top speed but it's really bad at wheelies. The Bati wins in a straight line race pure because of the wheelie technique..  It's also depending on how you race. But I'd suggest taking a Bati 801. I've not lost that much races with the Bati and I'm kindly in love with it. You wont regret taking a Bati ^
GTA,36q5u5,TyranMisu,2,Thu May 21 09:29:57 2015 UTC,"The Akuma actually has a faster acceleration.  Not entirely sure if it has higher top speed, but Bati definitely is better for top speed with wheelies."
GTA,36q5u5,SundayNightSix,1 point,Thu May 21 14:09:43 2015 UTC,The akuma has a lower top speed.
GTA,36q5u5,ouchimus,2,Fri May 22 00:09:41 2015 UTC,What is the wheelie technique?
GTA,36q5u5,VArobot86,3,Thu May 21 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"The Bati 801 is my favorite all around motorcycle. It's perfect on long stretches. You can wheelie even at top speed, so that makes things easier! However, if your race has a lot of twists and turns, you'll need a bike with really good acceleration and solid cornering. In which case, you might want to use the Akuma. I have both bikes, and I use the Bati 801 more often, but if it's a race with a lot of turns, then the Akuma is your best bet."
GTA,36q5u5,Dragoniel,3,Thu May 21 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thrust has the highest theoretical top-speed, but its handling and acceleration are atrocious, therefore you will never actually achieve those amazing speeds, especially in a city.   Hakuchou has the highest practical top-speed (its acceleration isn't complete shit), but it is heavy and doesn't handle turns very well (still my favorite bike, though).   Bati has a slightly lower top speed than Hakuchou, but it has slightly better acceleration and much better handling. It is widely regarded as the best racing bike out there, with Akuma a close second.  Everything else is garbage as far as performance is concerned. Different bikes have different strengths in different areas. Some have good acceleration, on-demand turbo boost, others have very good handling, off-road capabilities or other things going for them, but the top bikes, as listed above, stand out sharply."

This means on basic consumer-grade pre-built PC's its very likely you will get WORSE frame rates than you would have gotten on PS3 or Xbox 360. If you have a custom PC with AT LEAST an i5 quad-core processor, nvidia GTX 460 graphics card with 8 gigs of RAM on 64-bit windows you should be okay and the game will run smoothly.  However I had a lot of fun with GTA4 on PC and it is the game that got me into PC Gaming because the mods are absolutely amazing for that game. If you can't run it I would suggest saving up your money and building your own PC (very easy to do following youtube tutorials) because the experience is worth it!"

GTA,36nu7s,HollandPeyton,2,Thu May 21 01:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think such interpretations are a little bit off-base, conspiracy nature-like.  For example, some gamers were saying that the police being super aggressive and 100x harder to evade than GTA IV were theorizing that it was all intentional, since it was based on the LAPD which in 2013 was getting criticized for highly publicized incidents of police brutality (such as the Dorner manhunt).  I don't think that Rockstar was going that deep with that.  One reason is that the development of the police mechanism was probably well under way long before the Dorner manhunt; it was coincidental."

I think their stories should be left the way they are. Claude has gotten his revenge on Catalina; we see Toni at the top of the food chain in 2001, presumed to take over the Leone Family after Salvatore's death; Vic and Johnny are both dead; Luis has resolved all of his issues and dealt with all of his enemies; and Huang has avenged his father.  Tommy and CJ are who I'm interested in. I'm curious of how we get from 1986, where Tommy is on top of the world and partnered with Rosenberg, to 1992 where Tommy has washed his hands of Ken. And I'm equally curious as to what direction CJ took his life in. Does he still stay in Ganton and ensure the reign of GSF, or does he leave Sweet - who could never leave the hood - in charge and retire to his multiple business interests across the state?"

I hope you know that the pickup is a Pegasus vehicle, which you can not save in your garage, insure or modify in any way. You call Pegasus on your phone, they deliver it to a pre-set location on a map and you have to go and get it. Pegasus never delivers any vehicles to your current location and does not work in Heists. You can use it in missions, though.  The weapon mounted on the pickup is extremely powerful. It will destroy unarmored vehicles in a very short order and armored ones in a... short order (even insurgents). However, you won't have to pay insurance since you can't use the gun yourself, unless your friends are going to drive this thing.   Should you buy it? If you don't want any aircraft, this is your only viable option regarding military vehicles, unless you want a Technical, which is an all around shittier version of Insurgent. Or a Tank, which is made of paper.   I have both Insurgents. I use the SUV version (without a gun) as my primary vehicle, because it can punt idiot civilians out of the way, ignores explosives and I don't have to worry about my crew or randoms destroying it with stickies, rockets from helicopters or just smashing it up when they feel like it. It is also reasonably fast and it is the only vehicle in the game (that I found so far) that instantly responds to aircraft controls when in air, making offroading very easy.  Insurgent pickup is 90% useless, unless you PvP in freeroam (which I usually don't). If you are going to use pickup in a mission, chances are you are much better off just taking a helicopter instead in that situation. Well, provided you can fly it."
GTA,36bwq7,Dragoniel,2,Mon May 18 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"Ok I see, but with the technical can I use that in heist and is that a vehicle I can store in my garage, or is it a peagusus vehicle as well? I would just get  the insurgent so me and my friends can go around killing them but neither me or my friend can pay insurance multiple times. Also could I take the technical with me on heist and missions or no?  EDIT: BTW thank you for the information so far"
GTA,36bwq7,Dragoniel,7,Mon May 18 05:16:27 2015 UTC,"Rule of a thumb - if a vehicle has a gun, you can not use it in heists. If it has a gun, it is also a Pegasus vehicle, without any exceptions.   You can use armed vehicles only in freeroam and in missions, because you can not call Pegasus in any heist, which means there is no way to spawn any armed vehicle, helicopter, plane or boat.   So, to answer specifically, no - Technical is a Pegasus thing, that you can't modify or store in a garage. As for the insurance, just do a few missions. It costs about 6k per destroyed Kuruma and usually only about 2k for a random personal car. Spend half an hour in missions and you can wreck dozens of cars to your leisure.   You can also kill people without destroying their cars with an Insurgent P., as long as it's not a Kuruma. Just be careful with your aim. I'd say it's less effective than automatic pistol in that regard, though. That cannon on top of Insurgent is meant for destroying vehicles.   Technical doesn't have any armor and the shooter is completely exposed, but the caliber of its mounted gun is much larger than that on top of an Insurgent. It deals much more damage."
GTA,36bwq7,Dragoniel,1 point,Mon May 18 05:31:36 2015 UTC,So with the unarmed insurgent I can customize it and is pretty much like a kuruma but with better armor. Can I still shoot out of it with and SMG or explosives? Which one should I get first? What kind of customizable things can I do with it?
GTA,36bwq7,Dragoniel,6,Mon May 18 05:58:07 2015 UTC,"Unarmed Insurgent - SUV variant - can be customized and saved in your garage, just like a Kuruma, yes. It has no visual modifications available, besides customizable two-tone color scheme and standard neon layouts. All standard performance and wheel upgrades are available.   You can throw explosives and use all standard weapons from both Insurgents from all standard angles (including backwards), there are no specific restrictions.   As for which one should you get first - only you can tell. Unarmed Insurgent is a very decent car, but it is vulnerable to small arms fire - front and side windows are exposed (back window is blocked, you can't get shot from behind). Ain't nobody is going to kill you using explosives, though. And even if they did (after a 7 direct rocket hits or so), they would have to pay a whooping 16k for insurance. Resummon it and I doubt they will want to try and kill your car a second time.   Pickup variant is good for messing around in freeroam and it can be fun in missions, if you have some friends to do missions with. Other than that it's not very useful."
GTA,36bwq7,Techman-,3,Mon May 18 06:10:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for all this feedback I really do appreciate it. I'm gonna go with the unmounted version so I can customize it a bit and save half of my cash. Later I'll try to save up for the mounted again but for now I think I will be fine with the normal one. Thanks for all this feedback it was very much appreciated
GTA,36bwq7,Saagster,6,Mon May 18 06:32:44 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad it was helpful.   Can't go wrong with an (unarmed) insurgent. Very solid vehicle all around. I can actually beat randoms to the objectives with it, because they keep crashing their tricked out Zentornos everywhere, while Insurgent just punts everything out of the way, idiot players in their expensive toys included.   And no police car is ever going to stop that thing, which is nice."

GTA,368u0j,tobberobbe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:46:22 2015 UTC,Because I don't want cables running around the house?

GTA,3659w7,kirbygonnastalkyou,1 point,Sun May 17 14:29:43 2015 UTC,Hard doesn't make the missions harder it just gives you no extra lives. It's not worth playing on anything but hard.

GTA,3659w7,UnckyMcF-bomb,1 point,Sat May 16 19:27:25 2015 UTC,It does make the enemies harder - they have extra armor values and take a couple extra shots to kill each. It also seems (though I can't verify) that they also shoot more accurately.
GTA,3659w7,chicorafa1,1 point,Sat May 16 20:03:29 2015 UTC,It took us approximately 5-6 hours. We also used trip skip whenever possible.

GTA,367cpx,charlieboy1089,1 point,Sat May 16 23:02:43 2015 UTC,Is this the native trainer? Where'd you get it from? Is it safe going only into single player mode and you'll only be banned if you try to go online? I only ask because I remember hearing stories of people using mods in trainers in single player only and were banned. This has me really worried as I really want to have some fun in the single player since I've seen what these trainers can do but I don't want to lose my $60.
GTA,367cpx,SuperHolySheep,2,Sun May 17 05:05:41 2015 UTC,Those people were banned because they used a cracked trainer online.

GTA,367vf4,Xxcodfan789xX,1 point,Sun May 17 01:48:39 2015 UTC,I don't know if PC is different but on PS4 jets spawn in the same spots always and a technique for stealing them is to take off asap then fly directly upwards and pull up when the missile lock gets near you.
GTA,367vf4,Fox436,0,Sun May 17 03:27:56 2015 UTC,You are complaining because they reduced your ability to cheat in the game? Why don't you just play through it over time and get everything by earning it?   And yes the jet should be that hard to steal. Go into the nearest AFB to you and try hijacking a fighter jet and see how far you get. Just be glad the driving and overall physics aren't realistic or else the game would be really fucking hard.

GTA,361dhy,LilLebowski,7,Fri May 15 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"Because a huge part of GTA since the third game has been satire of the times and places it is set in. So 3 was a satire of mafia movies and action films, Vice City of Miami and 80s crime films, San Andreas of Los Angeles and 90s gang films, IV of New York and loads of different types of 00s culture, V was of California and loads of modern culture.   If 6 goes into the future you can't really satirise what doesn't exist yet."

GTA,361dhy,I_am_baked,1 point,Fri May 15 23:16:05 2015 UTC,I think Las Venturas makes more sense since Rockstar can do a lot with that. It would be a good setting to have a lot of unique interiors.   It would be different to have a free roam game with a version of the Everglades west of Vice City. It doesn't seem like a fun environment for cars though and what else can Rockstar do if they want to make the region big?

Tommy owns that city and Ryan Gosling is not about to put the hurt on Ray Liota when it comes to racketeering and general mafia business.   Also, R* has them all kinda interconnect. There's a conversation where Michael mentions a ""European guy"" that went quiet in V (obviously referring to Nikko.) So even if they were to redo Vice City with a new actor, it would just be dumb and unfulfilling considering that VC is considered the best overall GTA in terms of location and story."

GTA,361dhy,teaminus,4,Fri May 15 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference I think is the layout of cities.  With US locations, we have sprawling cityscapes with big roads and suburbs.  London, on the other hand, would be cramped, tight quarters with little townships outside of it (over-exaggeration i know).  I agree with you that it would be cool, but how well GTA has done is partly because of the GTA aspect, grabbing cars and going super fast on crazy streets.    Yeah, you could reenact the Borne chase from the first movie, but that's kinda honing the point I'm trying to convey...it's a bit tight for what we expect in a game.  So they've done LA, NYC, and Miami...what about Vegas? Or like NOLA, that would be AWESOME!  The Northwest could work, or even go into Canada...OMG CANADIAN GTA!!  Boston is a white version of NYC so meh... you got a lot of southern charm dotting the east coast.  Charleston, ATL, etc...  Chicago? eh, maybe..."

Plus there is the countryside. My idea is the UK, not just London. So 3 or 4 islands, 3 cities, and plenty of countryside. London was an expansion in the classic era so there is precedence.   But if we must stay in the U.S., my vote is for Seattle. It has water, city with hills, snow, rain, yes even sun, and a mountain.  ps They already did Las Vegas in San Andreas!"

Seattle was Infamous 2nd Son, and was done really well.  But that's like taking Chicago off the table because of teh abortion known as Watch_Dogs.  Seattle would be good with it's people there, its culture, it could work well...   I2S did it well but it could be much better. I am in Seattle and there is much room for improvement for sure. Yeah it would be good and so would Chicago.    PLUS I MIGHT STILL GET CANADIAN GTA!   Where would you set it? Vancouver? Toronto? I've never been to Canada so I don't have any first hand experience but I know it from TV and stuff. It seems like we are slowly infecting Canada with our American cooties!

GTA,360urc,IHaTeD2,2,Fri May 15 09:51:50 2015 UTC,"Ok so what you're seeing are artifacts, usually common when the video card is overworking which is usually accompanied by overheating. If the card is fairly new then it might just be your settings are too high or doesn't have sufficient power.   From my experience a crapping out card would crash the game or even your computer though. You can do tests using benchmarks called FurMark. Keep upping the program to test your videocard and then compare to what it should be doing.  This could also just be an issue with the game and a driver update may fix it."

It makes no sense! /s   Just like when you download an illegal game (never done such a thing....) and it always says ""Disable firewall, ignore FALSE positives.""  Let me ask you something. How many games do you download from legit sources that require you to disable your firewall and when your AV alerts you of a trojan,  the company says ""meh, ignore it, it doesn't know what it's talking about.""   Then again people will also use Softpedia and Download.com to download shit instead of going directly to the source. Why? I have no clue..   Wikipedia - Fyodor of insecure.org published his strong dislike of the installation manager and concerns over the bundled software, causing many people to spread the post on social networks  TL;DR: Want security advice from a professional? Don't download jack shit from the internet unless it's from a trusted source. If it's free, you should highly question it. Don't download from places like download.com (CNET), go directly to the SOURCE. With Mods, be very careful. If you ask around in forums, EVERYONE will tell you how safe they are.

GTA,35yf8c,HarryPotterIsDolphin,10,Thu May 14 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"IMHO the missions are not a great way to illustrate GTA's satirical elements. The GTA open world / backdrop is probably a better way  (examples: the billboards in the game, the TV channel content, the foreclosure signs everywhere). Also - no offense - it kind of sounds like you're asking the forum to do the work for you. If you don't have an idea of how to back your argument why would you choose this topic? I would say it would be difficult to ""prove"" video games are not a waste of time -- that's very broad and would depend on the person and the game. How is that measured? Is it measured by eventual economic outcome (Vanoss makes a lot of money on video games, but I make no money on video games)? Enjoyment? Fitness level (better hand-eye coordination vs sedentary lifestyle)?  etc etc. So if I were you I'd focus on an analysis of GTAV's satirical elements (and btw you may have to answer the question of whether enough of the audience ""gets"" the satire)."

GTA,35yf8c,jibjabsqueebsquab,3,Thu May 14 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Like I said, if it were me, I'd focus on the backdrop of Los Santos and Blaine County.

GTA,35yf8c,CharityHack,3,Thu May 14 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"Great idea for a project. I would encourage you focus on the GTA Talk Radio station - It has several different shows on it, each satirizing a different aspect of modern life, like politics, consumerism, self-help, and religion. I think this radio station is achievable (i.e. it won't take you weeks of work, just an evening), and it actually pretty sophisticated satire, covers a lot of topics, and is something your teacher would get.  Edit: Should also point out to your teacher that some of the most famous satirical movies like ""Network"" for example, were only seen by a 5-10 million people. Whereas GTAV has already been shipped to over 45 million consumers (and more importantly, to people who would otherwise never be exposed to satire)."
GTA,35yf8c,praystationfoh,1 point,Thu May 14 17:25:31 2015 UTC,think of 4 or 5 reasons why you believe games aren't a waste of time. Each reason should be a short complete sentence. Now think of an example in the game or in the way you play the game that supports that reason (idea). Each reason and example should be presented in a way that reflects your thesis (games aren't a waste of time).

The idea of jumping off a cliff to ""fake our deaths"" is ridiculous in the context of GTA. In GTA, you don't need to fake your death to avoid the cops. You just need to hide for a while."
GTA,35zn78,GalacticGhidorah,2,Fri May 15 07:48:28 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and read guides for it... lester's way of bikes and his route is probably the worst possible way to do it. You'll thank yourself later
GTA,35zn78,irwiss,3,Fri May 15 11:02:38 2015 UTC,"I agree the bikes are shit, and you're better off getting a car, but I find that Lester's route is the best way to go if you at least roughly stick to it. Every time me and my friends avoided his path, no matter where we went, we got WAY more cops attacking us than we did on Lester's route. In our case, Lester wasn't lying when he said it was the safest route with the least cops."
GTA,35zn78,Bacon_Man123,1 point,Sat May 16 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"Well IMO roughly using lester's route is an ok way to go (in something decent, not bikes), but blindly following the road on bikes usually gets someone knocked off the bike and dead within seconds.  But there are methods (for example, swat van or nearby apartment with kuruma/insurgent inside, using west coast etc that are SO much safer that lester's method is silly"
GTA,35zn78,irwiss,2,Sat May 16 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I agree, definitely no bikes. I was disagreeing on the route part. In my personal experience with that heist, using his route and at least making an attempt to stick to it ended up with us encountering way less cops than we did any other time by ignoring his route and going elsewhere to get to the canyon. We would just grab a 4-door car (we wanted NOOSE vans but never saw them as we didn't attract NOOSE attention) and headed off on Lester's route and it worked like a charm vs. going on a different route."
GTA,35zn78,Bacon_Man123,1 point,Sat May 16 02:43:03 2015 UTC,"Is everyone so shit at driving bikes? We always do it on bikes without any issues. When it comes to scaling mountains, bike wins over any car any time."
GTA,35zn78,Dragoniel,1 point,Mon May 18 11:18:15 2015 UTC,"First off, a significant amount of people are shit at driving bikes because they don't bother with bikes in GTA, since they're inferior in just about every way to a car  And secondly your money carrier or carriers is very likely get hit by random bullets regardless of their bike skills or the route, so the easiest way to get the full 1.25m rather than 1.2mil-ish with randoms is doing it in a 4 seater with money carrier ducked"
GTA,35zn78,irwiss,1 point,Mon May 18 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"since they're inferior in just about every way to a car   Oh hey, that's some strong statement there! pretty much nothing can beat a bike when it comes to offroad and mountains. Hakuchou or Batti are like Skyrim horses, but with turbocharged engines.  We always do Pacific on bikes, usually finish at about 1.1-1.2m, we do take some fire from helicopters on the final approach. 95% of the journey is completely uneventful, though, especially if the money bag takes the railroad to be extra mega safe.   I tried going with a car, but it was a mess. Much easier to dodge everything on a bike, until helicopters start shooting. Then you're going to take a few shots, yes. I have an insurgent ready for our next run, just to see how many cop cars can I punt in to the river. We never tried beating the timer, it should be faster."
GTA,35zn78,Dragoniel,1 point,Mon May 18 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry for late reply, I wouldn't say it's a strong statement, it's pretty much a statement of fact, barring superhuman skills or lucky drives the driver of the money bike will get hit by gunfire or drive into a curb taking 1% hp damage and lose money while it's trivial to get over 1.2m in a car. It's moderately easy to get the full 1.25 with the money carrier ducked in front seat of kuruma or if willing to go a bit slower - in the back of an armored NOOSE truck. The only thing the bikes are ""superior"" for is getting the challenge mode, simply because there's no real alternative.  PS I'm not talking about bikes in general but particular application in that heist."
GTA,35zn78,irwiss,2,Wed May 20 21:17:58 2015 UTC,That came too late. I will try to find a guide if I try it again. Lester needs to learn that maybe his escape plans aren't always the best ideas

GTA,35pslk,SeriousMichael,3,Wed May 13 01:46:28 2015 UTC,And why can we have like 10k shots for our snipers? How could you even possibly use that much ammo?
GTA,35pslk,MrAppleSpiceMan,8,Sun May 17 13:48:47 2015 UTC,Be good at heists and join any finale you get invited to.
GTA,35pslk,SeriousMichael,7,Tue May 12 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Contact missions. Be conservative with your ammo. Very few of them require explosives and if you take your time, use cover, use tactics such as flanking, and go for headshots, you can maybe spend less than $500 worth of ammo in one mission.  Edit: also these missions pay you hourly. Load up a mission but before you go anywhere go get something to eat, piss, whatever. Kill 10 minutes, then start the mission."
GTA,35pslk,MrAppleSpiceMan,2,Tue May 12 17:52:39 2015 UTC,"So theoretically, could you just free roam while still in a mission just fuckin around and when you're bored just finish it and get paid?"

Pre-mod Dominators sell around $19 grand, Sentinels at $14 or $17 grand, chrome or gold Dubstas at $23 grand.  You can sell 1 per day (once every 48 minutes).  I'm always trying to show this to people as I play on Xbone, but you have to hit the pay 'n spray while it's empty..."

GTA,35pslk,Bacon_Man123,10,Tue May 12 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Completing a survival is difficult even with a quality team, and anything less than completing it nets you pocket change. I think 5th wave gets you $5000.  I recommend missions."
GTA,35pslk,DL1982,5,Tue May 12 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I think survival is good for one specific thing: getting your shooting skill maxed so you can stop having to buy $10k-$50k in ammo after each mission due to increased carrying capacity.  One solid player can carry a group in Boneyard, and two solid players can carry a group in Sandy Survival. I find Sandy to be the more fun level of the two."
GTA,35pslk,Bacon_Man123,1 point,Tue May 12 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Do you find Sandy to be easier than Boneyard, or just more fun? I was able to do Boneyard essentially alone and I haven't really tried any of the other ones yet."
GTA,35pslk,SeriousMichael,1 point,Tue May 12 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"Just more fun. If you're the guy stuck carrying Boneyard, you spend most of your time running from one end to the other of a very tiny trailer, and hoping that at least one of the three idjits you got partnered up with will see the monkey eating the red berries, and get his ass behind the trailer as well. You need at least half-hearted suppressing fire from both ends of the trailer to keep guys from piling up at more angles than you can cover at once.  Sandy has similarly ""good"" cover spots except that you still feel pretty involved in what goes on all game. There's the dumpster, the hallway right inside the fence that says ""Chinese Food"" on it, and the spot up on the roof of the Chinese Food building where you can hide behind an air exchanger.  The cherry on top is the last little hidey hole you can abort to if you've got any time to run after your last remaining teammate bites it. If you can sprint over to the garage to the right of the roof and dumpster I mentioned earlier, you can hide against an interior wall, and have a tremendously limited range in front of you where dudes can even see well enough to shoot at you. It's not as safe as a last stand behind the trailer in Boneyard, but it feels awesome when you manage to survive a wave after sprinting to that spot."
GTA,35pslk,Bacon_Man123,1 point,Tue May 12 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"I was carrying in Boneyard and I just camped this one spot. It was right by a health and armor drop, and no enemies spawn by it, and I could just pop up and aim at head-level and take out anybody who walked by the gate I was looking at. It did get a bit boring but it was extremely easy money."
GTA,35pslk,UnckyMcF-bomb,1 point,Tue May 12 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"In almost every survival, there is a spot where you can camp... You just pop your head out and shoot the enemies. Duck - stand up - shoot - hide. Repeat as much as necessary :)"
GTA,35pslk,Nebulion,1 point,Tue May 12 20:31:00 2015 UTC,"Do Boneyard. If you're at all good then you can do it solo. I had a group of 4 people (me and 3 randoms). Two people either left or disconnected in the first wave, and me and the 2nd dude stuck it out until around Wave 6 with me carrying him a lot of the time, until he started dying and getting mad at me for not helping him, and he rage quit. I was able to pick off the last 4 waves alone and I never died during the whole thing. There's this one spot I used that was insanely good.   If you can find the airliner fuselage (there's a body armor on the wing of a jet over here) there's this little concrete half-circle thing you can hide behind. Spot works wonders. If there's ever a heli, pop out and blow it up if you have a launcher. If not, just shoot the hell out of it."
GTA,35pslk,UnckyMcF-bomb,1 point,Tue May 12 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"Used to be you could camp on top of the small building next to the warehouse. That was an excellent spot.  And is survival lucrative? Survive 10 waves, earn 30k, but use that much in ammo?"

GTA,35pslk,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Tue May 12 22:14:16 2015 UTC,You get 30 grand each time you complete a survival   Survivals aren't worth the ammo. Not cost effective enough. Missions on hard in a  Buzzard or like the man said be good at heists and slay every finale you join.
GTA,35pslk,Nebulion,1 point,Wed May 13 03:27:47 2015 UTC,AP pistol is your friend.  Plus the amount of rockets you need for buzzards is random like their spawn.  At most I've spent like five grande want to say- and even then a quick 25k is still more income than the 9 you get for most missions I've played.
GTA,35pslk,tmcottle,2,Wed May 13 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"You and I could do two fifteen grand missions faster.     I've done all the survivals multiple times.  They're great, just not my way of making money."

GTA,35pslk,Schly,2,Tue May 12 17:43:11 2015 UTC,There're a couple three maps where you can focus on ground enemies with cover from air like the junkyard.    It's easier to do the heist setups for around that much but he'd hit the same problem he has now.    It really just takes trial and error to figure out which survival you can repeat but /r/heistteams is probably the easiest solution to his actual problem.

GTA,35pslk,FaustKnight,1 point,Wed May 13 07:43:18 2015 UTC,What is the difference between on call and direct lobby
GTA,35pslk,MrAppleSpiceMan,2,Tue May 12 22:45:42 2015 UTC,"On Call reserves you a spot in the lobby and will automatically join you into it once the lobby is full. Until then, you can run around in free roam doing whatever you want to do. If the host leaves before you join, it will keep looking (I think). The host will see you in the lobby with (On Call) next to your name.  Direct Lobby instantly joins you to the lobby, and you'll have to sit and wait for it to fill up. If the host leaves, you get to enjoy all the loading screens to get back to free roam.  Direct Lobby is no better than accepting the random invites you get from people. On Call will basically accept one of these invites without forcing you to wait in a lobby.  The only downside I've seen is that you'll often get the Fleeca Scope Out mission, which pays terribly and automatically loads into the Fleeca Kuruma mission. Usually you'll have to sit through the heist leader's tutorials and cutscenes. If this happens you can either bail on the host or politely ask that they reinvite you for the finale so it's not a total waste of time."

GTA,35nrmv,wahwahwildcat,2,Tue May 12 06:03:10 2015 UTC,"I love how the ISS dates are the day the game came out (17 September, 2013)  Their birthdays are not actaully confirmed in game I think, aren't they? Franklins is implied to be 1988 cause of his license plate. And people say Michael is 45 but his North Yankton grave says he is 48 (as of 2013). Trevors age is not even mentoned in the storyline."
GTA,35nrmv,Surreal_Serendipity,4,Tue May 12 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. All true. I do a lot of research into this.  The birthdays are based on arbitrary numbers I came up with and the years are as close as I could get them. So the actual dates are completely fake, but the years should be as accurate as anyone can get with known information at this time.  Michael is confirmed the oldest protagonist to ever be in a GTA game, but there's more evidence supporting him being 45 in 2013 than 48. Since Michael is the oldest, that means Trevor can't be as old as him, but since Trevor said that Michael is his age, I could only assume they're about a year apart or so. And of course, with it being so close, I just HAD to make his birthday in 69, in true Rockstar style. :)"
GTA,35nrmv,spreilly,5,Tue May 12 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"I think Trevor's weight is a bit too high, both Franklin and Michael get jokes about being fat but Trevor has a different body shape. Amazing job nonetheless. :)"
GTA,35nrmv,sonicmaster10,1 point,Tue May 12 05:17:45 2015 UTC,I'd say Rockstar left Trevor's age ambiguous in this sense because they know people would figure out that Michael was born in the late 1960's and people would eventualy say Trevor was born in 1969.
GTA,35nrmv,DozeAgent,1 point,Tue May 12 06:06:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, the long con. I wonder if they had in mind that it would happen when someone is making fake IDs for the characters.

GTA,35pu1o,Nfear,3,Tue May 12 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed playing the games when I bought them on sale/in a pack in 2013.  I still like them (heavily modded, though, with texture packs and GInput among other things) as their atmosphere, play style, feel, etc. is completely different from the HD universe (well, at least insofar the first part that I played of GTA IV).  They're balls-to-the-wall fun.  But it's still best to wait for them to be on sale."
GTA,35pu1o,simplycass,1 point,Wed May 13 07:07:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think I would buy them again at all. If I had to choose, I'd say buy them in a pack.  My opinion. The thing with 3D GTA games is that each successive release is essentially the same game with a new story and more features. They just constantly added to what you could do, and I can't think of a whole lot that they removed. At least nothing that I can remember being disappointed about. So basically, GTAIII is just a worse version of GTAV, with a different story. You don't realize how many features in GTAV that you take for granted now (e.g. exiting or shooting from a moving vehicle is not possible in GTAIII), and the gameplay experience is simply not as good as each newer versions. I mean, GTAIII didn't even have bikes, and there were only 3 sports cars and no functional planes. You couldn't even swim in water until San Andreas.  If you are really interested in the stories, buy them in a pack and play through. You'll be disappointed in the game play though, trust me on that because I've went back. But to be honest, the stories are pretty basic and not original at all. IMO if all you want is to relive the stories, you'd be better off just watching a youtube play through or a supercut of the cutscenes. Honestly though, you'd be better"

At the time many features of these games were ground-breaking in the industry, or refined versions of what had come before, both in GTA and non-GTA games.  In the future you may look on GTA V as a bit rudimentary. GTA's III, VC & SA still stand out as solid games from their era and the stories are at times as good if not better than IV/V, I go back and play all three every so often, and they are just as enjoyable now."
GTA,35pu1o,Dasmi,1 point,Tue May 12 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"At the time many features of these games were ground-breaking in the industry, or refined versions of what had come before, both in GTA and non-GTA games.   Agreed completely. I'm not saying the older games are bad games. They're amazing for what they were, and when they were released. But we're not at that time anymore. Standards change, and what we expect changes. And I'm sure that GTAV will seem rudimentary in the future. I would hope so, because the alternative option is that no progress will be made on gameplay in the future.   My point is that if you go into GTAIII expecting the same gameplay as GTAV, you're going to be disappointed. There will definitely be moments of frustration about a feature you've gotten used to that isn't in the old versions. And if all you want is the story, it makes a lot more sense to just watch the videos and save yourself the money."
GTA,35pu1o,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue May 12 18:57:14 2015 UTC,If I'm going back to play an older I don't expect the same features.

GTA,35izb3,AgainstMeAgainstYou,30,Mon May 11 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"Until V came out, San Andreas was unequivocally my favourite GTA game ever. I have done over twenty playthroughs of it and have logged at least a thousand hours into it since 2004. Add SA-MP and MTA, and you easily have another thousand hours. Three months of my life logged into one video game; it's almost pathetic. I have, without any measurable competition, played San Andreas more than any other game.  I love this cast. Maylay, Samuel L. Jackson, Faizon Love, James Woods, Clifton Powell, Peter Fonda, Chris Penn, Bill Fichtner returning from Vice City and Frank Vincent returning from III... Still my favourite voice cast of all time. They - and the many other names not listed here - did masterful work. Especially Maylay, who had never before acted.  The map, the gameplay, the music are all top notch. To this day San Andreas is peerless when it comes to licenced video game soundtracks; I am a musician before anything else and K-DST and Radio X had a profound impact on me as a musician back when I was a kid playing this game. This influence still resonates in my musical life today.  I am writing San Andreas as a television series; this is purely from my love - and front-to-back knowledge - of the game. You can see the progress of this by following my user account.  tl;dr: I love this game. I will always cherish this game. I was nine years old when San Andreas came out. As of the end of this month, I am now twenty. I can't believe it's been eleven years. It's gone by in an instant."

GTA,35i10f,Professor_Bullshit_,3,Sun May 10 19:18:50 2015 UTC,And you don't have to fly to the checkpoint immediately with the plane. You can leave at the 3 minute mark. Gives you enough time and you don't have to fly behind the jet for that long.

GTA,35i10f,Officalpartyaccount,1 point,Sun May 10 22:34:54 2015 UTC,I find it kind of relaxing to be the pilot in this mission. Just put on a podcast or the radio and chill out until the ground team is ready for pickup.
GTA,35i10f,DigChrono,1 point,Mon May 11 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a very decent pilot, but I'm a bit apprehensive of this mission. I can handle any chopper in whatever task (I've done this heist thrice as a chopper pilot, as a matter of fact), but I wonder about plane pilot's role - when the enemy jets spawn, how do you get behind them without being shot down? Never tried dodging missiles in a propeller plane before. Doesn't the jet angle off to try and get a shot at you? Can you ""guide"" its turning by flying a little bit to the side, to make it circle to the opposite side? Does the enemy ever change altitude?  And when you need to land, does the jet just disengages? I usually kill them as a Buzzard pilot until they stop coming, but I remember one jet just despawning once the ground team completed their objective. Not quite sure how does it work exactly.

GTA,35i41w,AgainstMeAgainstYou,2,Sun May 10 18:34:48 2015 UTC,It is. One per each island. The map is like a pinprick compared to newer GTA games though; you can get to a safehouse within 45 seconds from about anywhere on the map in III.
GTA,35i41w,Coach_Seven,2,Sun May 10 18:49:20 2015 UTC,autosaves are for bitches. Play the game the way it was intended to be played.

Best advice is to do the side missions ASAP to avoid the danger of this region in the map.  Also, completing them while still confined to the first island will make the side missions easier since you'll only have to travel across 1/3 of the map."
GTA,35i41w,BunkBuy,3,Sun May 10 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"Well.. I love GTA 3.. Specially on PC.  Here's some true tips that will help you.  Always use this mod.. It makes the game hundreds of time better..  http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368  Also.. Always use the frame limiter, lock the fps to 30, the physics will go wild if you play above 30. (Don't believe me? Up to you, enjoy dying by simply running)  Autosave is not needed in GTA 3, the game never crashes.  Missions are hard and good.  GTA 3 feels good with a controller.. But some missions are also easier with a mouse and keyboard.. But hey, i love playing GTA with a controller.. So, wanna use one? Here you go, use this mod.  http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272  Does your menu sometimes go like.. ""Invisible""? Well, that's a known bug, it's not gamebreaking anyway, just deal with it.. Even though there is some ways to fix it.  The game overall is pure chaos and pure fun! It's also one of my favourite games of all time.. I still play it to this day.  If you need something else, please feel free to reply."
GTA,35i41w,Super_Magikarp,1 point,Mon May 11 11:19:08 2015 UTC,"Did you play the steam version?  I ask because I've been playing without the frame limiter enabled and haven't experienced any wild physics after a few hours.  With the frame limiter on, the video is choppy and too distracting to enjoy - like playing a multiplayer game on a poor connection. Also, I've been using a controller to drive cars without any mods.  All I had to do was bind the keys in the controller setup.  (I didn't even need to switch the controller to xbox mode.) The only time my menu went invisible is when I tried to install CLEO and the autosave/quicksave mod.  I agree the game is chaotic fun, though it feels a bit stripped down feature-wise compared to Saints Row 2 which I completed not too long ago.  Understandable since GTAIII was released earlier, and it's clear it had an influence which is interesting to see. Anyway, I'm well over the hump of hating the controls and gameplay (something I experience in almost every game) and will likely continue to the end.  Thanks for your comment on this tread!"

GTA,35iult,Xaxxus,1 point,Mon May 11 02:16:44 2015 UTC,"Heres a tip, forget the bikes and get sports cars. The bikes are parked in an area that is usually filled with infernus and other fast cars. So just drive the bikes down the street, hop out and steal an infernus stopped at the lights, or parked at the side of the road.  Cars dont kill you when you fuck up, the cops are much less likely to hit the bags with a stray bullet so you wont lose as much money.  Also the cars are much faster than the bikes so its alot easier to avoid the cops.  I have found that its too risky to rely on the skill of other players. Shit happens and you will likely lose a ton of money on this heist if you fuck up. Better to be safe than sorry."

If you did your research you would be able to find that the Pickup version a Pegasus vehicle. If it was available for Heists it would be way too unbalanced and everyone would have one.

I only went back and saw that the pickup is only available with pegasus after I bought it. It's way less overpowered than the kuruma given that it's not got bullet proof windows, so I don't think that would be much of a problem, it would just make them a lot more fun."

When you take into account that the host gets no pay for setups, and has to pay a lump sum just to run the heist, 55/15/15/15 ends up the fairest payout for the host for at least prison and humane, possibly series A as well (I can't remember for sure on that one). 40/20/20/20 ends up the fairest cut for Pacific Standard."

So, for Humane labs you have 53000+(20000*5) = 153000 that the host doesn't get relative to the crew. If you did the 40/20 split, then the host is actually getting less than the crew.

GTA,35bmrx,Slade3465,19,Sat May 9 11:33:04 2015 UTC,RIP everyone's hard drives
GTA,35bmrx,jb4427,1 point,Fri May 8 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Realistically we're a minimum of 3 years out before the next game, technology is likely to improve before the next game drops. PlayStation 5 and Xbox........something will likely be out by then, and hard drives are getting bigger all the time. 4k gaming is kind of new and expensive right now, but it'll be the standard before the next game is dropped. At the rate we're going, people will probably have 50, 100, or 500 terabyte hard drives--how big could the game possibly be? Why wouldn't we hope for something exponentially larger than anything else that's previously been released? Our systems will have improved dramatically by then.  Remember, this game got released on ps3 and xbox 360 originally (and I still enjoy it on my ps3), and those are archaic by today's standards. Another generation of systems and we can essentially have a bigger, better, prettier game. Good things are on the horizon IMHO."
GTA,35bmrx,Slade3465,2,Fri May 8 22:44:34 2015 UTC,It took ten years for the last generation to come out. What makes you think the next one will take 3?
GTA,35bmrx,thej00ninja,-1,Sat May 9 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"PlayStation 3 came out 2006, PlayStation 4 came out 2013. I'd heard a rumor consoles are working on changing their interfaces so that they can have more freedom adjusting video settings in their games, making them more like PCs in that regard. When that's done, they plan on releasing a new console every few years that's backwards compatible and forwards compatible with the next one to keep each system viable for longer.  If true, it could absolutely make consoles run better, and even out the playing field a little between consoles and PC. Which, the smaller that gap is, the better for gamers overall.  Even if not true, it's hardly far fetched to assume they might come out with another console in 3 or 4 years."
GTA,35bmrx,gunfox,2,Sat May 9 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say you're wrong or anything because who knows? However I highly doubt this is the case. I think your projections are a little early. Also console makers are trying to get out of the console business and into the service business. They don't want to make hardware anymore. They want to sell you a service that they can package with a device that doesn't have a lot of power (or your PC or your phone) and stream you everything. We're obviously not there yet but that's where they're headed, everything digital. Look at Microsofts big push to become a service platform with windows 10."

GTA,35bmrx,enjoyingorc6742,9,Sat May 9 04:56:56 2015 UTC,I heard someone say instead of just vice city why not do like a R* version of the South Eastern US. You could do Florida and have Vice City and Little Havana maybe even Cuba as an island. Then you could have Atlanta with gangs and shit and then like a Alabama/Mississippi redneck area with inbred hicks and a R* version of NOLA. It would have to be a huge map but in the 5-6 years before GTA6 is even mentioned to be in development I think it wouldn't be that outrageous.
GTA,35bmrx,heiser7708,6,Sat May 9 03:58:22 2015 UTC,rockstar has stated that GTA VI is in development.

GTA,35bmrx,Poles_Apart,1 point,Fri May 8 23:02:33 2015 UTC,I request deployable air bags. I'd love to bat someone's front bumper and see the airbag go off in their face. I also would like rocks.  To be able to pick up rocks as well as various items to use as weapons. I want snowballs to not kill people. Because they're snow balls. I want to be able to play paintball. I want to be able to climb down a rope or ladder from helicopters. I'd like to be able to have hydrolic suspension again. I want to be able to customize every car to a ridiculous degree. I want to be able to run over signs because I know that they are weaker than cars.   I really want more interaction with buildings. I am no game developer and have no idea what can and can't happen. But I get sad knowing that I'm driving by many buildings which are just empty fillers. I'd like to be able to go inside the buildings. I don't know if that's a farfetched thought or not.
GTA,35bmrx,Slenderauss,2,Fri May 8 22:56:35 2015 UTC,Outside of development time it's shouldn't really be a difficult thing to do to have building interiors.

GTA,35bpku,Adam87,8,Sat May 9 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"What an excellent writeup. It doesn't pull its' punches - the criticisms re: the difficulty of the final ten or so missions and the graphics are 100% valid - and it ultimately calls out III for what it is: a monumentally influential game, a marvel of gaming in 2001, but in 2015 a primitive prototype.  The only disagreement I have with this writer is the notion that you shouldn't play III today. I think anyone introducing themselves to GTA should ALWAYS play III first. I think it has a phenomenal voice cast, and a unique aesthetic. It's still a fun experience to playthrough once or twice every couple years."

Sounds like a mod problem, I would try another mod to rule out a problem with your game files.

The tanks are under Pegasus and before they changed it the tank used to stay in game till it was destroyed so if I got the tank up somewhere that it could leave without another cargo bob to grab the tank it would just sit vacant till it was destroyed.

GTA,356uba,Porsche924,15,Thu May 7 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"The answer we were all waiting for:   “I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?”   We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways. ­­    I've been playing GTA V for a couple of days, never used mods, even in singleplayer, because people said they were banned for them... so, what's going on?"
GTA,356uba,_Rodrigo_,8,Thu May 7 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Many people are still reporting being banned for single player mods.  If you use a mod for single player, it's recommended you use a pirated copy or go into offline mode.  Also, don't use ANY mod online right now, even somthing like the FOV mod.  Someone has to be lying about being banned for online mods, and it's unclear if it's R* or the people reporting it.  For now, I'd stay away from mods in anything but a pirated copy, until things look more clear."

Sure, the optimisation is not perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as GTA 4 or Prototype 2, which I could barely run on low."

Just bring up CPU and GPU usage... with any PC game your cpu should be fast enough to keep your GPU at 100% load if not its a good indicator that your CPU is bottlenecking your system. Now with my system thos is obviously not the case. However GTA uses a whopping chunk of CPU (typocal for a port as cpmsoles use a CPU for graphics) and i see dips in GPU usage down to about 80% at times. This means the game for whatever reason isnt handing off to the GPU as effectivley as it could.... hence poorly optimized for the PC.

GTA,352osz,d3nn1sv0,7,Wed May 6 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"I called this happening when GTAV was announced for PC and everyone was excited about mods.  It wasn't hard to see that this was going to be a problem because unlike GTAIV, GTAV single player and online were basically tied together, it was going to be an issue, online level progression does that.  I hope they can get around it but nothing is guaranteed, if a developer doesn't want modding, they really do have the power to stop it."

GTA,352osz,Testiculese,1 point,Thu May 7 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's still the best version of the game. 60+ fps and up to 4k resolution the game runs like a dream.  The only problem with these mods are that they are read in the system as hacks. The game can't tell the difference when the ""mod"" is used. You would get banned from Counter Strike for the same thing.  I think it would be fair to unban people now that we all know but the EULA everyone signed and agreed to said this. Rockstar will eventually either add full mod support or we'll wait for third party multiplayer servers but whats happening makes sense given the context.   People are just giving a knee jerk reaction they don't understand the full situation, and they aren't being patient. Rockstar still delivered one if the best games on PC in a very well done port that is with the price in full without mods."
GTA,352osz,OldmanChompski,-13,Wed May 6 19:49:45 2015 UTC,Not true. people are getting banned for mods on online mode.
GTA,352osz,_thedarkknight,10,Thu May 7 12:19:46 2015 UTC,You go online even playing singleplayer. I have several friends who installed mods and lost access to multiplayer and they only installed for singleplayer. Go look on steam its a very common issue. If you call R* to get your account unbanned they just hang up on you like they did with all the people who got their account hacked due to R* bad security. So yeah it is true.

Especially when Microsoft stopped selling Windows 7 back in November. You seem to be one of those people who thinks a good PC costs upwards of $10k. It doesn't. I spent $995 on mine, building it from the ground up. If you're simply upgrading a PC you won't have to spend nearly as much, and if it turns out none of the parts already in the PC will suffice, you can take them out and sell those as well, for even more money.  You also only focuses on the ""lucky"" part. He also said ""smart"". If you pay attention to sales, and you're patient and wait for big company sales, or days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can get insane deals on PC parts.  EDIT: And when I spent $995 on mine, no sales were going on, and it was in February, so nowhere near Black Friday/Cyber Monday. All in all it was a pretty dumb time to buy but it all worked out. I think with all of the discounts I got put together, I got $60 back from rebates. Wait for sales and you'll get a way bigger discount."

GTA,354ei1,NemWan,1 point,Thu May 7 01:16:27 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. There are many mods for GTA 4 that add entire new areas. Red Deads Desert was awesome. These were just designed by one or two people using existing in game textures.  Adding in new story lines would take a little bit, but you can currently create your own missions with restrictions for gta online.  The editor is also an incredible tool and could be used to make specific scenes in missions, but they keep the mission creator and editor as two separate tools.  Given the current rate of modding, a map addition of Las Venturas and San Fierro are probably in the works.  Economically speaking, it probably is in their best interest to create a new game anyway. They learned from many mistakes in GTA 4 with game play. (My favorite, being that cars in gta 4 were underpowered and had horrible suspension. They made cars pretty badass in GTA 5 now.) But their online version of the game is still verrrrrry broken and feels much less loved on than the single player game. (My coquette topless still can't be transformed back to topless after all this time. Using ""Self Radio"" next to others lags the absolute F**k out of the game for anyone near you.) Either a new game is already in the works, or a DLC of a major addition will be coming."

As it's too much work and costs to much money just for dlc. Also in early interviews from 2013 they said they created the games universe in such way it would have all kinds of terrain and give you that feeling of diversion. They did not have the capacity to recreate whole San andreas as we knew it. Still not the same as the good old San andreas. But I am sure later on there will be awesome mods for this including ext.

SweetFX doesn't affect gameplay and the Native Trainer, like all ASI scripts, is automatically disabled as soon as you go Online:         Script Hook V is the library that allows to use GTA V script native functions in custom *.asi plugins. Note that it doesn't work in GTA Online, script hook disables custom scripts when player goes in multiplayer.   The FOV mod does not disable itself however, and since it increases the FOV (giving an unfair advantage), it can be considered a cheat.

And where's Eddie Toh? Oops, he's not there this time, you got to race all the way to sea and take a boat to make your escape. Fun challenge is fun. Someday, perhaps, at 120+. Weapons - Flamethrower anyone? Katana perhaps? Enough ideas exist for new DLC weaponry I'm sure. It won't have to end with Miniguns. Vehicles - So far we have a Hind-look-a-like, the Savage. So perhaps we'll get a Apache-look-a-like, probably the Hunter as seen before.  A good to require 120+. New customizations - There's always tattoos, clothes, new weapon colours, you name it which can be added above level 120. Cash bonuses - When new content is released at higher prices, increasing income once you exceed each 50 levels above 100 is not unthinkable either.   In short, they can add stuff which requires a level greater than 120."

GTA,352355,SZJX,5,Wed May 6 13:38:54 2015 UTC,"Basically, it's because everybody knows children play violent video games because of one reason or another. For example, there's certain words in GTA Online that you're not allowed to send via the in-game text message system, because Rockstar knows children will see them, despite being a game made for adults, and so adults are being treated like children because children are a key target market for videogames - which is also why a large number of AAA titles (Call of Duty etc) are released in November - to catch in on the Christmas rush. The whole ""scandal"" deal is just the media overly exaggerating the fact there's code in the game for a badly designed minigame, and so the rating has to be raised to emphasize it's not a game for children, which it shouldn't be anyway. Despite this, most parents don't have this way of thinking however, and that it can't be bad because ""it's only a game"".  I hope that makes sense ahaha!"
GTA,352355,Vansen7,3,Wed May 6 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"You have to remember SA came out in 2004, when Internet speeds weren't terribly fast (probably mostly DSL, not really much fiber optics).  YouTube hadn't been invented yet, and neither had the hordes of online video streaming websites and file locker services that would follow.  Not saying that teens didn't look at porn before 2005, but the technology wasn't there yet.  But to answer the question, Sam Houser has suggested that the GTA controversies have largely died down because games are being no longer seen as ""kids' games"" and as a way to ""sell newspapers"" and as a soft target for politicians.  source  I mean, hell, GTA IV's storyline was way darker than SA, which almost feels like a kids' game in comparison, and engendered far less controversy, besides Jack Thompson doing his usual stirring the pot and MADD getting angry with the player being able to get drunk."

GTA,34vub2,NotKrankor,79,Tue May 5 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"See that's what I don't get. The banned words list, mostly. It's a game rated 17+ in NA and 18+ basically everywhere else. Why can't we swear in text chat? I don't see why not, honestly. You're playing a game where words like fuck, shit, damn, ass, dick, cunt, nigga, faggot, etc. are used constantly, so why prohibit people from using these words if they want to use them? Is it because kids play this game? If that's the case, you might as well censor the whole goddamn game. And plus, if the parent doesn't like their kid playing games like this, then they should fucking monitor what their kid is doing and playing.  Also, the whole mods thing. I get not allowing mods in Online. It leads to cheating, and that can be a bad thing in public servers. I get this. I'm happy that R* has this strict anti-cheat system in place, honestly, just not when it affects people using mods in single player. That right there, is bullshit. Let's think back to GTA IV. The main reason people even bought that shit-fest of a port on PC after a while, was for mods. Mods make the game more interesting after you've played through the story 3 times and you've done pretty much all there is to do in Online mode. So why is it when we mod in Story Mode, we get banned? It's bullshit, and R* doesn't have a real reason as to why, from what I understand.  I hope in the future, R* gets their shit together, and gets a more efficient system put in, that lets us mod in SP without worry of getting fucking banned in Online.  Oh, and one last thing: FOV. I get that some of these FOV mods are using a method similar to a trainer or some shit, and that is a big red flag to R* as they want to prevent cheating in Online, but goddamn, either find a way to allow FOV mods, or fucking update that abortion you call an FOV slider. It doesn't change shit and looks nauseating to a lot of people, myself included."

It isn't because kids are playing, it's to stop excessive trash-talking.  That's it.  The fact that many of those banned words show up in the game's text and dialog doesn't give a reason to have them enabled in text chat.  Again, I don't like the censoring, especially if they're doing permanent bans for using those words, I'm just trying to clarify their reasoning."

As a mature adult myself, Im glad I dont have to see ""Gaytard McFaggot"" and the rest of the people in the ""bisexual bitch boner bastards"" crew getting rekt by my broken bottle  The company related stuff is kind of a duh as well.

Especially when met with such threats of censorship like parents who don't want video games such as GTA sold at all, what is the difference?  The choice of an individual to use the words is not the subject in question here, what is, is Rockstar censoring you from doing so.   Why hide someone's immaturity from others, who could then make up their own minds about what kind of a person they are? Why take that decision making device out of the game entirely?   You can't force maturity on anyone. I'm sure they will find other ways of being immature, so this does absolutely nothing to hinder any part of that."

Censoring usernames isn't the problem in how Rockstar is treating it's userbase.
GTA,34vub2,MaxTheMad,7,Tue May 5 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"No, he's complaining about it because GTA is a game with a lot of vulgarity anyway. There's no point in censoring it."

Y'all have to remember when you have a business you have to cover your ass as much as possible because if someone can sue you for the slightest thing they will."
GTA,34vub2,AustNerevar,2,Tue May 5 22:33:34 2015 UTC,"They can't be sued for anything.  The game is labeled as M and the characters use a smorgasbord of ""bad"" words thoughout the campaign.  Having a list of naughty words that are banned from chat is the zenith of hypocrisy on Rockstar's part."

Physical copies of San Andreas are probably still one of the earlier versions (2.0 or 3.0), different from the mobile-looking version you see on Steam. You can find downgrade patches using google to get the game back to version 1.0, which is the most moddable.  They will not install through Steam and they just have an old school launcher, so you need not worry about automatic updates.  If you want to play San Andreas online, check out these two mods:   Multi Theft Auto San Andreas San Andreas Multiplayer   There's no other way of playing online. Both these mods have very active communities (and they require the 1.0 version of the game)."

It plays like you're just improvising your way through the scene, which is fine (heh) -- but if you do that you should probably edit it a bit. Have you considered recording it using Rockstar Editor, in third person mode? That would make it easier to cut around some of the rambling bits.   And, it's relatively easy to replicate the first person perspective in the editor, while still having the option to do some nice establishing shots and to hide some cuts with camera angles.

GTA,34syi7,DeadAimHeadshot,15,Mon May 4 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"CLARIFICATIONS:  You will not be banned from playing Single Player Offline no matter what you do. But if you do use Mods on either Single Player or Multiplayer, that is when you could get banned from playing GTA V Online.  There is a full blown MegaThread on /r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC that everyone who got affected by this shared their stories about getting banned from GTA V Online Play for using mods in Single Player and Multiplayer.  And ontop of that, several other sources have already started making articles on this entire fiasco as well:   http://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2015/05/gta-5-mods-could-get-you-perma-banned/ http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/looks-like-rockstar-will-ban-you-from-gta-v-for-using-a-fov-mod/ http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/29/gta-online-pc-rockstar-ban-wave-causes-confusion/ http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/rockstar-banning-gta-v-players-participating-modded-lobbies/ http://za.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-v/90378/news/gta-v-pc-mods-could-get-you-banned   In addition to this whole thing, there are assholes who actually did get banned for valid reasons with cheating who are taking advantage of this situation to Falsely Plead Not-Guilty for their crimes, but these people are so easy to catch lying by just checking their Social Club Game Progress and their Steam Accounts. If they have any VAC Bans, and if they have Millions and Millions of dollars in Car Sales at a very low level, then it's fucking obvious that they're lying.  Ontop of all of this, for those who use ScriptHook, apparently they updated it merely hours after this whole thing started. So idk if they found a way to bypass this new automated system or not, but I would highly recommend checking it out to make sure.  I'm clarifying everything right now on this post here that were highly misunderstood on the original post at /r/pcmasterrace. So just letting you guys know the facts with this situation so far."
GTA,34syi7,WackyModder84,9,Mon May 4 18:56:28 2015 UTC,And people have been waiting how long for the PC release so that they could mod GTA V?
GTA,34syi7,Captrotc,7,Mon May 4 18:18:19 2015 UTC,I'm glad the people in online sessions are banned but I see no reason for it to happen in single player
GTA,34syi7,MangleYourCabbage,0,Mon May 4 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, the ban is only for MP and only 2 weeks."

GTA,34syi7,armyofthesky,27,Mon May 4 11:53:51 2015 UTC,You really expect they'd start charging for DLC now? A year and a half after launch and after how many free packs? That seems really unlikely.
GTA,34syi7,lycoloco,20,Mon May 4 14:37:04 2015 UTC,Singleplayer expansions would definitely not be free

GTA,34syi7,purdster83,5,Tue May 5 05:32:03 2015 UTC,What's the unlikely bit?  That they would charge or that people would pay?  Because both of those seem likely.
GTA,34syi7,kugrian,2,Mon May 4 17:23:32 2015 UTC,I was only thinking about minor updates like we've gotten so far. I too would totally pay for new story content to.

GTA,34syi7,atfsix,8,Mon May 4 23:13:43 2015 UTC,true but they have said there will be single player paid dlc
GTA,34syi7,armyofthesky,10,Mon May 4 14:37:28 2015 UTC,Why would they ban modders for that? Skyrim had mods as soon as it launched and all of its DLC sold quite well despite how easy it would be to pirate on PC.  I believe this is just another example of Rockstar being out of touch and not communicating internally. It's happened too many times to count since GTA V launched.
GTA,34syi7,FarmFreshDX,3,Mon May 4 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"Well yeah they gotta keep that hype train moving. Now that they've run out of systems to re-release the game on they're gonna wait a couple months until the PC hype dies down. Then they're probably gonna release another Heist update since that's been talked about so much. Then after that hype dies down again they'll release the paid DLC to bring the money back in. Then they wait a few months for another free online update. Rinse and repeat. They're obviously trying to make the game last as long as they possibly can, and to be honest they're doing a pretty good job of it so far."
GTA,34syi7,HeadbangingLegend,1 point,Mon May 4 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"With the amount of negative reviews their getting hammered with, I doubt the game will show up on the top of any lists when DLC drops."

GTA,34syi7,ShitCoder,4,Mon May 4 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"Now the question here is this:  If you keep using mods, do you keep getting banned? Or after awhile, will they perma-ban you for multiple offenses for it?"
GTA,34syi7,WackyModder84,1 point,Mon May 4 11:04:15 2015 UTC,"I can't remember 100% how it worked on console, but from memery they had 3 lobbies, 1 normal lobby, 1 bad sports lobby, and 1 cheaters lobby where they put everyone that abused the game.  I don't think anyone got a perma ban, they were just playing with other cheaters.  I would like to see them do the same thing imo, but only for people modding GTA Online."
GTA,34syi7,Pizza-The-Hutt,6,Mon May 4 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I don't think Rockstar is intentionally banning people for singleplayer mods or FOV mods, their horribly broken mod detection system is instantly flagging accounts, and banning swiftly.  Their detection system can't tell a multiplayer trainer, from a singleplayer script mod.  However, this begs the question, if they can detect mods while playing online, and flag your account, why not just prevent affected players from connection in the first place, like in GTA IV? Then, if you want to player online, just remove the mod files. That would be a lot better than risking a ban just because you forgot you had mods in your game directory."

Therefore, there is no way to differentiate other than copying and pasting your install when you want to mod and then replacing it when you want to play online. I think we would all rather a mod-free online, than invincible people etc. We were never allowed to mod online, so I don't know why anyone is surprised."
GTA,34syi7,oscdar,12,Mon May 4 18:23:54 2015 UTC,"Actually there are ways, for example the people behind the general trainer have an implemented system where their mods can't be used online, if they can do it surely Rockstar can, and then just ban people who mod online, or just the ones hacking for the displeasure of others  and not just getting a proper FOV slider."

Second, what you do in SP shouldn't matter to MP, if it does, then you are clearly doing something against the rules you agreed to, so take your medicine.  Luckily, there are third party lobbies, or there will be, so even cheaters will have options.  I play the game the way it was meant to be played.

GTA,34syi7,bethesdurr,9,Mon May 4 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"These people dont realize the shark cards only work for gta-online. It would be retarded to sell shark cards to singleplayer people anyways, you have the stock market games to get you over 1.2 billion dollars. The bans for modding in singleplayer actually kind of shock me. I dont know why the idiots didnt just say ""no modding"" as an announcement. PR at R*is awful"
GTA,34syi7,BTY2468,0,Mon May 4 12:01:33 2015 UTC,That is the exact reason. They are banning people for using mods so they don't hack in money and have to buy shark cards.   The fov mod uses the same method(dll injection) as trainers and other mods that can give money so they are just banning everyone who uses any form of dll injection mods.
GTA,34syi7,jdps27,9,Mon May 4 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"OK, but that brings up another question. Does anyone actually have any proof at all they're actually trying to push shark cards in that manner? I mean, there are plenty of other reasons for them to not want people to mod their game..."
GTA,34syi7,stinkypickles,0,Mon May 4 12:15:51 2015 UTC,It's business. You have to be pretty naive to not see that they are trying to make more money off this. I guarantee they expected to sell more shark cards than they have and someone has to answer for that. And they have to come up with a plan to regain that lost revenue.
GTA,34syi7,MilhouseJr,5,Mon May 4 12:20:44 2015 UTC,"They're still selling shark cards no matter what. One small subsection of modders and PCmasterracers doesn't equal the entire demographic, including console platforms. They've stated in the past that Shark Cards exist to pay for DLC such as Heists. They'll make an easy killing off of Singleplayer DLC.  Did anyone actually expect Rockstar to be pro-modding? I think that's the biggest mistake made by anyone in this situation. Altering the game files is at your own risk, complaining about a company protecting its property is idiotic."
GTA,34syi7,heartles,3,Mon May 4 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the whole shark cards thing weirds me out, cause I completely forgot they existed for the last year and a half. It surprises me that they're actually profitable."
GTA,34syi7,odisseius,1 point,Mon May 4 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"Or maybe they want to sell more shark cards by banning people trying to hack cash into the game, and they want to stop the fire before it spreads. Maybe once they could sort out how to differentiate Fov mods and cash hacks they'll stop banning people. Time will tell."
GTA,34syi7,smoky_bourbon,-1,Mon May 4 16:22:23 2015 UTC,The average journalist or news consumer is not sophisticated enough to distinguish between developer and user mods. Rockstar is paranoid about journalists creating another Hot Coffee incident and getting the game banned. The millions they could potentially lose far outweighs what little they would benefit from having an active mod community. They're going to do whatever they can to look hostile to modding.   If there were ethics in gaming journalism maybe developers would take more risks. Support /r/kotakuinaction if you want this to change.

Just save your project, then go into settings and change your gta resolution to 1280x720 16:9 aspect and then reload the project and export. It exports at the current in-game resolution. Just remember it puts that dumb text on the top left of the first few seconds and you won't be able to crop it out as easily.   For instance, my monitor is 16:10 but if i set the game resolution to 1080P it show up stretched in game but i can fit the resulting video to a 16:9 window and it stretches to fill.

GTA,34spn6,Dragoniel,2,Mon May 4 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"To store a car you need a garage. Apartments come with garages, but if you are going to buy an apartment, go for a high quality one (they start at 200k price range) - it will have 10 vehicle slots in the attached garage and it will enable you to initiate heists later. Lower end apartments are pointless, unless for roleplay reasons. You can buy apartments and garages via your phone, on the realtor website.  To rank up and get money - simply do missions. You don't need to use the blue crap on the ground, go to options menu, select online play -> jobs -> rockstar created. Or join a quick job, but make sure to select a type ""mission"". PvP crap is generally useless as far as money and experience goes. You can unlock new missions by playing them with other people who have it already unlocked, so do ""quick jobs"".  You can and should put your cash in to your bank account via your phone. Go to the in-game ""internet"", select a bank website and navigate the menus to deposit cash. No need to find an ATM.  Out of the static places that are important, minimap already shows all - gun store, mod shop and grocery store. Other things you can bookmark yourself (middle mouse button if you are on PC). Things of note are spawn locations of aircraft and rare vehicles, for example."

It's not uncommon to encounter 10+ minute load times, disconnections, endless loading screens, lag, etc. Last time I played on PS3 the server issues became so unbearable that the game was all but impossible to play. I'm not exaggerating when I say I spent 35% of my time in loading screens, and 60% of my time waiting in lobby screens.  Rest assured, the PC is not responsible. The servers are just broken, and every time the game updated online got slower and less-playable on the last-gen consoles."

Sure the culture, the people, the toys blah, blah, blah but basically they get a vacation in LA or NYC or wherever is next. I think Red Dead Redemption proved the GTA ""formula"" works in a different setting (duh!) and London or even the UK would be a welcome change to the U.S. We've given you billions R*, pay for your own vacations!

I can't have enough of the game. Now that I have it though (on my laptop) and after hours and hours of playing, I don't play it that much anymore.

GTA,34odfy,anspee,2,Sun May 3 00:57:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the one annoying thing I find about the SP is the lack of customisation compared to Online.  I mean sure you can change the clothing (albeit not as much as online) and you can customise vehicles but they aren't permanent like Online. You could switch to a character and his clothing is gone and you lose the car after each mission or death (the impound is really not a reliable method).

So for Wave 105 for instance i could gut the intros, exits, inbetween track talk etc and then chuck in my own tracks (why would i do that when wave105 is already perfect?)

GTA,34n868,lietuvis10LTU,3,Sat May 2 18:26:45 2015 UTC,All I can think of:  Have higher stamina so you can sprint/pedal longer.  Use a faster bike.  Duck/lean forward to become more aerodynamic. Though I believe you lose some handling doing this.  Not sure about the details of character skills but if the game registers bicycles as driving then that skill may also play a role in performance.

Profit Edit: But seriously, if you do that, it does some weird glitch and u can go past the normals cars at highway. And another tip would be(if you use a keyboard) to tap Caps(spring button on bicycle) on and off shortly, by that I mean press it on and off for 0,5sec(Caps button) and then do it again after about 2 seconds. The animation and speed doesn't go away as soon as you don't sprint. That way you conserve the stamina, but not the speed."

Example ( spoiler alert): in the tanker mission with Catalina, if you did too many cheat codes before then, she will shoot the guy you delivered the truck to during the cutscene, locking you there and requiring you to skip the cutscene to continue, or restart.   Also, in the mission where you save Madd Dogg from suicide, if you used too many cheat codes prior, he'll jump off during the cutscene, effectively making the game impossible to complete.

GTA,34l5kf,Glacialfuse,1 point,Sat May 2 05:23:52 2015 UTC,Try turning VSync off. You also might to do this trick if you have a NVIDIA card.
GTA,34l5kf,Luuk3333,1 point,Sat May 2 10:15:40 2015 UTC,"Noticed this thread so thought I would add my experience. Whether this will relate to your issues I don't know.  I had M5A97 LE R2.0 motherboard with FX-8350, which is an 8core at 4Ghz standard, coupled with 8GB RAM and XFX R9 290.  The game would run at 60FPS but after 10-20minutes I would get FPS drops to the 20fps mark, sometimes worse near water. Using some monitoring programs I was able to watch what the computer was doing when the FPS did drop, and I could see it was underclocking itself to 1.4Ghz, thermal throttling. However with this board I never did load up thermal radar to any of the temps.  Once I had changed the motherboard to a Sabertooth 990FX all was fine. I don't fully understand it but on the motherboard is some power transistors that supply power to the CPU cores. I think people call these VRMs or MOSFETs or both. On the old board there was only 8 of these from what I can understand, and they had no heatsinks on. The new board has more of these with a big heatspeader all over them. Problems gone away now.  You don't mention your motherboard model number?  Would it be worth watching the clock speeds when the game slows down? I used something from CPUID, google it if stuck."
GTA,34l5kf,redeye271,1 point,Sat May 2 07:59:48 2015 UTC,"Its OP, forgot password. Anyway I have a MSI Z77 GD65.

If it matters I have a Coolermaster Hyper 412 (somewhat large heat sink with 2 push/pull 120mm fans)"
GTA,34l5kf,th655,1 point,Sat May 2 10:01:47 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I have played BF4 and never had this problem that GTA shown up. No idea why.  Bear in mind then when my FPS drops was happening it was not an overheating CPU or GPU. The CPU was being throttled but due to overheating VRMs.  However your board looks decent and has heatsinks on these areas. So I've no idea to be honest. Thought I'd just add my 2 cents.  Is it possible to watch the vitals when the low frame happens? HWMonitor from CPUID will show you clock speeds and record the min/max too. Take it's temp readings with a pinch of salt, use your mobo software for that.  Just trying to find out if your cpu clock speed stays constant when your FPS drop occurs, if it does maybe its not thermal throttling of the CPU  Disclaimer: I'm no expert, I only know my experiences!"

GTA,34i4yv,Williamfoster63,5,Fri May 1 11:26:44 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it's not a port in the usual way, it was developed alongside the ps4/xbone console versions but was crafted Max Payne 3 style with its own team. Secondly, crossfire appears to be working very well - so I can't imagine that they would have great crossfire support but not SLI support.   When troubleshooting dual card issues, the first thing I do is use MSI afterburner to see how much of each GPU is in use in-game. If one card is clearly not in use, then at least we've answered the first question: is SLI to blame (because any number of problems could be causing poor performance). If SLI is the problem, first make sure you're not in windowed mode, because at least for crossfire, that turns it off. Then, I'd make sure the card works elsewhere - see if it's just GTA's SLI support that is at issue or if SLI isn't working anywhere. If it's just GTA, I'd look at reinstalling my drivers and nvidia support software. If it's not working at all, I'd check the cards themselves, maybe there's a loose connection somewhere."
GTA,34i4yv,iAlCurry,3,Fri May 1 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"First things first, the bridging in CrossFireX and SLI are different, so saying CrossFireX works doesn't necessarily mean SLI will work. It could be as simple as disabling on board graphics as that has been causing a lot of issues. Afterburner won't necessarily help resolve any problems because it could be software triggered rather than an SLI problem"
GTA,34i4yv,Williamfoster63,0,Fri May 1 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"I get that, I was just thinking that it's unusual for a game that had a crossfire profile to not also have an SLI one.   Plus, with articles that say things like this, I'd have to imagine the problem is unlikely to be with GTA not recognizing SLI:   With Game Ready optimizations for the highly anticipated PC release of Grand Theft Auto V, new SLI profiles, and new 3D Vision profiles, our latest drivers are a recommended update for all GeForce GTX users.   .   It could be as simple as disabling on board graphics as that has been causing a lot of issues.    I've heard about that; is that still a problem? I thought the last GTA V update was supposed to remedy it. Definitely something to look at for troubleshooting though, good call.   As far as afterburner, I'm not saying it's useful to solve anything - just suggesting to use the Riva tuner to see if GPU 2 is active in game."

GTA,34dbgr,BladeOnReddit,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:31:43 2015 UTC,I'm currently using NetLimiter to limit GTA V upstream traffic to 25Kb/s to not make my game absolutely shit itself when there's over 10 players. Cuts down on loading times and keeps your ping respectable (expect lag stutters) but allows me to bank and use the menus.  Do you have a High End PC? I'm trying to work out why the game seems to rely on people with poor connections to bear some of the hosting weight instead of people with 5mbit+ up connections that aren't that uncommon now in countries with infrastructure up to par.

GTA,34dbgr,damosk,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"Mines had positive results. Instead of maxing my upload and causing huge spikes in ping and decreases in down speed, it helps it smooth out overall. I can sit in games with 25-30 people if Free Roam auto loads me into it without much of an issue.  The stutters are presumably from missed data so its barely playable, not saying it is, but its more responsive than without.  At the very least it lets me talk on Mumble/Ventrilo while loading into or out of a fully populated server."

GTA,34dbgr,damosk,2,Thu Apr 30 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"Not much Telstra can do, you're likely stuck on ADSL1 infrastructure like myself, where 384 up is the limited maximum even at a short distance. I've been harassing Telstra lately as our phones have been playing up because they have software limited my downstream (padding for mid-point injection relief) and they refuse to upgrade infrastructure because of the NBN rollout - still not scheduled here in the current 2017 roadmap.  Any improvements since the patch? I play with friends hosting on the NBN and don't struggle with uploads/latency in races - and this was in the notes:    Improvements to matchmaking so players that have good connections to each other are matched together more frequently.   I get bad stuttering in the central city areas. As I said the limitation doesn't make it playable, but it does help with load times, voip/other connections, and lets you bank at a reasonable rate before rejoining a server with less people.  Are your friends on similar connections (lets say under 384kbit up, so ADSL1) seriously having no problems on servers with 20-30 people? Do they also have high end PC's?  Reason I ask is because you said you do, and I consider my PC still fairly decent (80+ FPS at 1080p, 3770K OC with a GTX680) - I'm wondering if it picks up people with reasonable settings/framerates and sticks some of the server load on them.   My friends and I are honestly baffled with how the netcode and hosting works."
GTA,34dbgr,japeslol,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I knew, I thought i was on ADSL2+.

GTA,34dbgr,Linkbleu,1 point,Fri May 1 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"Whats your downstream sync? Unless you're stuck on like 2mbit down ADSL2+ generally syncs at a higher upstream, around say 600kbit.

These douchebags were slamming me over voice chat saying shit like ""why the fuck aren't you in the chopper yet, you're slowing us all down!"" etc. (at this point the plane hadn't even got to sandy shores). So we do the heist, it goes fine, prisoner flies off and we all go to land on the beach. I fly down and wait for the other 3 to make it to the beach. Two of them land, then the fuckin' cunt who was trash talking me the whole heist comes in too fast, smashes into the rocks, dies, and fails the fucking heist.   tl;dr: don't bitch about other people when you can't even play the game yourself"

I think these factors are relevant: - Car / class you're currently driving - Neighbourhood - Time of day / server vehicle set (google that, it explains why some RL days you only see specific vehicles, server has to cycle its set before it to change. Currently I got killed with overload of Futos, Fussilades, and Ford Edge lookalikes. - If you've driven the car before, or seen the 'spawn location', but that last thing is hard to confirm and the locations not sure - Your own level.

With any given heist invite I accept, there's a good chance that I sit in the lobby with the Host and no one joins so the host cancels, we get a team together and start the heist and then someone leaves or disconnects so everyone gets kicked, someone dies and another teammate gets mad and leaves so everyone gets kicked, OR we complete the objective and everyone goes their separate ways (this is extremely rare).   It seems like the only way to have a decent heist experience is to have a team of 4 friends. And good luck making any friends online, the community consists of children and impatient jerk-offs (in my experience)."

GTA,343qzd,bananinhao,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Not only a random teams incapable of finishing stuff (I've tried completing heists and/or setups with randoms over 10 times, someone always dies and quits) but hosts are usually assholes that only give you 15% of the cut anyways so it isn't even worth the hassle.  At the end of the day what I think is the worst is that heists (and their setups) aren't even fun to grind anyways."
GTA,343qzd,Cyntheon,3,Tue Apr 28 04:54:56 2015 UTC,Hosts need to pay money to start the heists plus they don't get any money for the setup missions (another 80-100k).  So they are pretty much entitled to get the biggest cut (setup costs + number of setup mission * 21k).

I've been in lobbies with a lot of people who ask everyone to understand when they die, but will get mad when anybody else dies. Very obnoxious. I'd suggest either checking /r/heistteams or just keep playing randoms. Eventually you'll find some randoms who will be fun to play with, as outlandish a claim as that may be. Was playing with a Scandinavian today and had a blast. Friendly and understanding communication is key. If you don't think you'll find such, take a look-see in /r/heistteams."
GTA,343qzd,separys,2,Tue Apr 28 08:25:39 2015 UTC,"Hey - yeah, it's not so much about finding good people to play with, I'm totally fine playing with randoms. My biggest problem is I have no context of what part of the heist I'm on, and then getting kicked back to free roam midway. I think it was a terrible design decision setting up progressive story missions and expecting people to carry through on to the next mission - just too often people flake and bail and that's fine, but if it messes up what I'm doing, then it's not.  I might give it another try, but god it's frustrating trying to make sense of it."
GTA,343qzd,sharklegs,2,Tue Apr 28 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should try hosting the heists? The downside is that waiting for people to join is a pain, the upside is you'll experience the entire story, in order."

You'll get roughly 160k for first completion and unlock the armored kuruma purchase, as a bonus it's pretty fun with friend ( like everything ).  Armored kuruma is an absolute beast for missions and some heists, so far that I'd define it as OP and makes missions similar to base invaders/extradiction an ok experience even if you have 5 imbeciles / afks / foreign language people in the group, which unfortunately happens pretty often."

But it depends on the sales rep.   But I couldn´t just click order on a website and add my address. I´ve had to pay a deposit when I ordered it. And it took a lot longer than in GTA to arrive :D"

GTA,343xhx,Jckruz,0,Tue Apr 28 17:44:50 2015 UTC,Yes you can order cars online. But for delivery I believe the car would be delivered to a dealership so that final paperwork can be made. But it also would depend on where you pay for it. So it might be that scar can be delivered to your house

GTA,340rxm,dapway1,0,Mon Apr 27 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how it works, I play on PC. I don't think you can make ""parties"" on PC like you could on consoles. I was under the impression you could make a party from the console dashboard, and you'd be prioritized in lobbies together - is that true?"
GTA,340rxm,bat_mayn,0,Mon Apr 27 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what you do on PC.  Start story mode.  Once loaded in, hit escape and go to the online menu.  There will be an option to start a closed online session with either friends or crew (the only place this option is available is when you come in from story mode).  That will kick you into an online session where you are alone in multiplayer freemode.    At this point, you have two options.  One, you can invite your friends/crew via social club to the freemode game and then go to the 2nd option.  Or two, you can go straight into the job lobby of your choice by hitting escape, online menu, jobs menu (or an NPC-supplied event through your phone).  Usually you will be made the host, but sometimes Rockstar just hates you and forces you into someone else's game (this has only happened once to me).  Once in the job lobby by yourself as the host, you can set matchmaking to closed, invite your friends or crew, wait for them to join.  Then after they have joined, if you want more players, you can set matchmaking to open, hit auto-invite, and also go to the invite equally skilled players option and mass invite from there.  Using these methods will allow you to control whether you play with friends only or add in extra randoms.  I don't know why Rockstar decided to make playing with your friends so fucking convoluted, but it sure is god damn annoying."

GTA,33yj1x,luckypooperfucker,2,Sun Apr 26 21:27:15 2015 UTC,760 is very mediocre. You'd be better off getting a similarly priced AMD card at that pricepoint.
GTA,33yj1x,radio240,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"While you're GPU isn't the best, I would strongly recommend upgrading your memory. I had 8GB for a long time and still did when GTA released. Last week I upgraded to 16gb 2400mhz and the game runs so much smoother. I was maxing out my RAM occasionally with 8 (before first patch).   Other specs Core i5 4690K GTX 970  Do you have anyway to monitor your system while playing? I have a second display that shows a lot of info and I've noticed the game still seems a bit CPU heavy, but again, I think more RAM will definitely help.   Quick Edit: I used to have a 550Ti and upgraded to the 750Ti before grabbing my current 970. I will say, for the money.. the 750Ti was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone on a budget. However, for about $20 more, i've heard the R9 270 is also a very good budget card that runs most games better than the 750."

GTA,33yj1x,sidious911,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yea I guess the 970 is 3.5GB of fast RAM then 500MB of slower RAM? at 1080p you shouldn't encounter any problems with that.

Any of the East coast metropolises will be more or less redundant with Liberty City.    Las Vegas doesn't seem big enough to be the centerpiece of a game with traditionally urban settings.   I can maybe see Seattle/Vancouver, but it's not quite as iconic as a NYC/LA/Miami in the '80's.   Regardless of what they do, I want to see something new and different besides iterations of the same three locations."

I'll be 35 this year, I have a 10 year old son and I'm often on-call as the network administrator for the health insurance company I work for.   Are you a grad school student or something?  edit: I ask because I know grad school students hardly have time to sneeze, much less any leisure activity like video games."
GTA,33qc5z,catpirates,3,Fri Apr 24 18:34:16 2015 UTC,Just the type of info I'm looking for. Just needed a little heads up on whether the time is well spent :)
GTA,33qc5z,catpirates,2,Fri Apr 24 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"why not just do them? there's plenty of time til the next GTA, may as well fill in that time."
GTA,33qc5z,letsallgame,0,Fri Apr 24 17:47:08 2015 UTC,limited time and lot's of games hehe. Just wanted the heads up
GTA,33qc5z,thirsty904,3,Fri Apr 24 17:18:13 2015 UTC,the way I look at it is the developers put it in the game so may as well play it out. I like the script writing in GTA and will do side missions for that alone.
GTA,33qc5z,kristoferen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:19:03 2015 UTC,i usually complete the side quests before the story is over.  one side quest after every 2 or 3 missions is what i did.  it made the single player story last longer and felt more fun to me
GTA,33qc5z,corkscru74,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"I did something like 90% of the side missions on 360. Bought it again on ps4 and have only done a few of them. They are fun, and I'd recommend doing them at least once. Lester has some really fun assassination missions for Franklin."
GTA,33qc5z,jebkerbal,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"Many of the actual missions are well-done, many are funny. Many feel like more of the same as the story mode (in a good way).  The activities such as golfing, skydiving, etc. were fun enough to do one of, once, but not more. Then again, I know some people who do those for hours on end... Just not my cup of tea."

GTA,33rpba,Tug_Lyfe,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:52:32 2015 UTC,I do actually remember this and i thought it was done using a cheat. Like no reload. So you could fire indefinitely without a reload animation. And on the rocket launcher it just gave the effect of a rapid fire rocket launcher.
GTA,33rp9f,AnIronKnuckle,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"Download Geforce Experience from geforce.com  Install it, let it update your drivers, reboot, then let GFE set the recommended settings for the game.   If it doesn't do it on its own, I would bump up textures to Very High in-game (disable the VRAM Limit) as it makes a huge difference and doesn't make much of a performance hit. If you do have performance issues, lower the civilian population variety a bit, disable VSYNC, and turn off/lower AA."

GTA,33rp9f,Strange_Cognition,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:22:16 2015 UTC,Make sure to use FXAA instead of MSAA (Still looks good).  I threw on a couple of notches of motion blur which gives the illusion of better frame rates as well.
GTA,33lowp,Appelpitje,59,Thu Apr 23 15:18:27 2015 UTC,The first time I got a Cargobob in multiplayer I happened to stumple upon someone robbing a store. I proceeded to lift their car onto the roof of the store and flew away just as they came out. Didn't trap them but it was still funny as hell.
GTA,33lowp,AlexR42,54,Thu Apr 23 16:07:49 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe that anyone is able to lift a car without 20 minutes to perfectly line up the cargobob and the vehicle.
GTA,33lowp,MF-Brofist,35,Thu Apr 23 18:48:35 2015 UTC,I've never found using the cargobob's hook to be that difficult.

Hopefully this still means we could see it coming to the game, but it seems a bit doubtful, because I remember back in the early days of GTA V(2013) people all invested in one stock which in game meant that its value would rise. During the course of a week or so(or several weeks can't remember) I got the 100 million required for the golf club."

Rockstar have acknowledged this and they released patch 1.01 which is supposed to improve that.  My HD 7850 and FX 6300 run it relatively smoothly but every once in a while it gets very choppy and it freezes whenever I aim a gun out of a car window.  You could also try switching to direct x 10.1 instead of 11, it's supposed to be more stable at the moment."

Also if you haven't installed them, install the game-ready-optimised-whatever drivers for GTA V from nvidia. http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/83819/en-us  Something else that might help is making sure you have adequate RAM. I only have 4GB so to compensate I increased the pagefile size (Memory is swapped onto hard drive space when not in use. You can change it in the Control Panel)   If you have 8GB or more that shouldn't be necessary though."

GTA,33kwrp,Aruixe,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Depends which bit you mean. Trying to load the game in the first place sometimes the Social Club launcher sits with a loading spinner indefinitely. If it hasn't got anywhere within 15 seconds I close it and restart. Often takes me 4-5 attempts to get in. Then within the game itself it can take several minutes to actually load into either the single player or GTA Online. Once I'm in Online it's normally much quicker to jump from mission to mission with the same group, but if I get invited to a friend's group or when I drop back to free mode the load time is back up to several minutes again."

GTA,33kwrp,DeeJayDelicious,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:25:50 2015 UTC,Also on PC tried SSD made no difference or very little. My theories are a series of checks during loading combined that all the data has to be decrypted from its containers. If the encryption key was saved in memory it would be easy to steal so pretty sure each load and unload GTA has to hash a key then uncrypt then again in reverse order to save data both local and none. I work with data encryption and anything above 128 bit AES will horribly kill your performance. As a video game it should be half that because it's a dam video game not investment data. If Rockstar did lets say 256 bit AES with a random generated key over 20 characters that would explain the load times. Also that OpenIV found out the key is different from opening to saving which again frack performance on encryption. A cpu with higher operations per second would at this point make load times better than any ssd. tl;dr Rockstar encrypted everything and dun fracked up load times.
GTA,33kwrp,Booyeahgames,0,Thu Apr 23 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering this myself.  EVERYTHING take ages to lead, even quitting the game.

GTA,33h3ru,Swinetrek,8,Wed Apr 22 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, a friend (/u/A_huge_waffle) of mine in our crew called them once asking about the restricted/banned words in the game. He was asking as to why the customer support number for Smuckers is banned.  Prank calls to R* are funny as hell. If you're with some friends in game call them on speaker and try it some time."
GTA,33h3ru,TraizenHD,12,Wed Apr 22 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, being an 18+ game I didn't know there'd be such a big list (even though some of those words are said in game!). ಠ_ಠ"

GTA,33h3ru,TheEvilGerman,2,Wed Apr 22 23:01:37 2015 UTC,The word socialclub... Hilarious
GTA,33h3ru,Wsallgood,2,Thu Apr 23 02:00:31 2015 UTC,That's to prevent people from pretending to be mods.
GTA,33h3ru,wigsternm,8,Thu Apr 23 03:32:03 2015 UTC,R* is one of the most hypocritical bunch of developers I've seen.

I would deem the game as not fit for purpose if you can't acces the content like this but not sure where you stand on digital goods (I know EU changed the laws recently).
GTA,33h3ru,scoobydoo0845,8,Wed Apr 22 20:05:21 2015 UTC,Customer service is dead.
GTA,33h3ru,plaidchuck,3,Wed Apr 22 23:32:05 2015 UTC,When they make that kind of money off us upfront? You bet it is.
GTA,33h3ru,Wsallgood,7,Thu Apr 23 02:02:55 2015 UTC,I've worked in this kind of industry. The way it is being handled isnt great but its effective. they know there is a large problem which will bring in a large unexpected amount of calls.   It is being worked and will be resolved and the customer service person can't help you any further. they are just trying to move passed you to a customer they can help.  It sucks but how else can they handle this without having 1+hr queue which people will complain about anyway.
GTA,33h3ru,Soulspawn,6,Wed Apr 22 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"The issue of most people with this case is - they didn't say anything, if they will come out with some announcement ""yes we know, yes we work on it, yes it will be fixed"" i can promise that 50% of the anger will go down and 90% of the users will support them - but they are keeping us in the dark, no answers, no kindness no support or help, many people are sure they won't get the account back, almost every person i talked to said they won't buy another game from them JUST because of the wall of smoke they have around this issue."
GTA,33h3ru,Horef,3,Wed Apr 22 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"That's Rockstar's MO. They don't talk about anything until it's over and done with. It's infuriating, disrespectful to customers, and highly ineffective at PR. Sure they don't breed to tell us everything, but they take it to the extreme."

And most probably the game makes some drivers collide/malfunction.  So if he did not start the game he would not get the bsod. Get it?
GTA,33jm67,kissekatt1,0,Thu May 28 01:50:48 2015 UTC,You werent modding your game were you? Thats sounds similar to a ban or something.  EDIT: unless you mean BSOD. thats a completely different story then

Missions and Heists etc I get freezing when trying to enter vehicles or when I'm a passenger the driver just teleports everywhere. Shooting someone in a death match mode or free roam causes their body to fall the ground and then 8 seconds later tell me I killed them. I could go on forever, online is just fucked for me.   I want Australian only hosts or servers or something. Or in my opinion i think the game is broken online. You are constantly downloading and uploading every character who is in your game which explains why i lag over 5-6 people."

Learn how to turbo-start then and be first place, works like a charm. When you notice someone about to ram you decelerate so you can ram him instead. Aim for the rear wheels as this will send a car spinning (as in real life)  ""Play random jobs you're way undergeared.."" I did the first 2 heists with a pistol only and you can buy the best Assault Rifle in game from rank 1 for no money at all (it literally costs 1 side missions pay). so there's that. Aim for the head, always.  ""Or roam around the city and get instant killed by some douche because fuck you, that's why...and then get reminded of passive mode.""  Then, well, activate passive mode before you go somewhere you get killed? :D Make it your routine, if necessary. Or shoot back and kill whoever is shooting at you. All it takes is like 1-2 shots to kill someone.   But if you still dislike it, don't play it, simple as that, it's not like the game forces GTA:O upon you :)  Have fun o7"

The long loading times are just because the servers are so fucking horrible. Its not loading the game, its just trying to connect through the cluster-fuck that is people from opposite sides of the world being forced play together.   I mean it's clearly designed as a co-op game first and foremost and yet lacks any of the infrastructure to support good co-op play.   This. Its a god damned nightmare to get my group of 4 friends into a game and STAY in the group. I go to start a mission, auto joins me into a 3/4 lobby. We eventually play and finish a mission, all vote for random afterwards, 3 of us get put with another host (from china) and our 4th player is put into a separate lobby with 3 other randoms.

In singleplayer, violence is rarely forced on you. If you just want to you  cruise around or explore you can do it without watching over your shoulder. With the exception of those damn mountain lions! In multiplayer you can be minding your own business and then bang a player you've never seen before kills you ""...because, Fuck you"".

GTA,33l9dl,sharklegs,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Find some friends. Find a crew. Play solo missions that way you can take your time and figure out what to do without someone ruining the mission for you. Missions are the best way trust me. If you have the time, spend at least 1-2 hours in contact missions. Just continue to vote for them after you complete one. Remember, make sure it is solo so it will be just like single player. You can make up to $500,000 for 1 and half hours of straight mission grinding. Once you have money and RP from missions you can get guns and actually pose a threat to other players, if you're into that. Also, the higher your rank the higher your health, so rank up with missions quickly."

GTA,33l9dl,rareinator,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:43:28 2015 UTC,I agree with you. And there are some things R* should do differently but that definitely doesn't equate to online being messed up. I could write a chapter for the things I'd like to see implemented but many of my ideas have been inspired by some of the cool things they've already done. I've hardly touched another game since online was released last-gen and I don't really see that changing either. Especially if they give us a mission creator.

GTA,33l9dl,Skayruss,5,Thu Apr 23 15:56:58 2015 UTC,I don't even think its hacks... its just because the lag is so bad. On your screen they are standing there when in actual fact they where there 10 seconds ago and don't even know you're shooting at them.  The shitty servers are responsible for everything.

GTA,33jo8z,Tohrazer,1 point,Tue May 12 10:24:12 2015 UTC,"recently had this problem, since changing from a 680, where i never experienced this issue to a 970 which with twice the vram seems to be doing this as others have said driving fast, the game suddenly slows right down, stops; and then a second later starts up again. Usually resulting in me over-steering and smacking into a truck.  does that -memrestrict thing help? / (at work so unable to test)"

I had one time where a guy killed me twice while driving an armored Kuran and it sent him a 1v1 deathmatch. It does it automatically, so he accepted and I spent 10 minutes dodging that damn car because I was out in the desert. I have spent times doing what you said, but long for PvP.

They just decided to call him Johnny because people like that sort of thing and his part was so tiny it didn't really make any difference what they called him.

We're not expecting to see them again once that game gets a sequel. Their part in the story is done, except for brief cameo encounters where they could be totally interchangable but Rockstar likes to service its fans so they can say ""hey that's the guy from ______"" like claude in SA or Johnny in 5.   Again, Johnny could have been called Jimmy and it'd have ZERO difference in the story of GTA5. They only called him Johnny because people like you seem to think it's a big deal and get excited because they recognize that name. His part in the story is so ridiculously small it doesn't even make a difference that you ""know his personality"".  I'm not saying this is bad work from Rockstar because it's clear they don't want to bring back characters but make a new game each time and I understand why they do this fan service because it's good for business but if you really think Johnny being Johnny and not ""NPC#2"" made any difference in the story you must a a little thick in the head."

It would be easy to compare a backup from a couple of days ago to today's current and find account numbers where the name/email have been changed. The majority of those would be affected accounts.   They should have been doing that when it became obvious it was large scale as well as finding out when this all started."
GTA,33d49x,SPARTANsui,2,Wed Apr 22 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"It appears R* is classifying these cases as users who have lost access to their email address and password. Their official ticket response is  ""If you do not have access to the e-mail address tied to your Social Club account and have forgotten the account password, typically we can not get you back into your Social Club account; however if you can provide the following information, we can look into possible solutions:  Your Social Club name:  Your Social Club e-mail:  Your DoB as it is listed in your Social Club account:  A screenshot of you logged into a console account (Xbox Live/PlayStation Network) that is tied to your Social Club account""  This might explain R* inept and unsatisfying response to the situation. It's very possible that some of us may never get our accounts back. Keep your fingers crossed."

People, dont just change passwords, make sure to not use the same damn password everywhere.  EDIT: Now if this is actually some sort of client vulnerability with Online sessions, stay off Online as well, to be safe. If it is said issue, holy shit did Rockstar drop the fucking ball on that one. Why would I even suggest this? GTA V's Online hasnt been tested in ""the wilds"" of the Internet, and only via the closed, sanitized areas of a console-specific network. There are enough technical issues related to the somewhat rocky start a lot of players of GTA V PC have had (from DirectX issues, to troubles getting Online to work, performance woes on certain high-end rigs due to weird configs, etc) that it isnt out of the realm of speculation that Rockstar simply havent expected certain vulnerabilities to crop up in Online as well related to account security.  EDIT2: Seems some more info has come to light and points to the likelyhood that the sourced user/pass combos came from another compromised database, not Rockstar Social Club. This adds more pressure to not use the same user/pass combo anywhere online. Again, if you must, use a password manager and never ever use the same password twice."

One of my concerns is that it may have been routed to Russian support, since all of my automated emails are in Russian now and that's the default language on my account now. I'm not sure if it works that way, but my mind is reaching for any way to explain their silence in what should be a really straightforward fix.  Hell, most places send the automated notification email that says you've changed your password/email with an automated link to revert the change if you didn't authorize it.

GTA,33f0dg,TouchMyOranges,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:23:19 2015 UTC,It's super easy to kill everyone in an insurgent if you can get in front of it
GTA,33f0dg,payne6,3,Wed Apr 22 18:46:57 2015 UTC,I hated this system since the beginning. I don't get it and I don't think I ever will. Some asshat is trying to run you over why am I going to try to shoot him when I have sticky bombs? Armor cars especially make this system feel so stupid and not thought out.
GTA,33f0dg,Swinetrek,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:49:00 2015 UTC,I thought you didn't get billed for their premium if you put a bounty on them first? Two grand to Lester first and then have at it. Or is that wrong?
GTA,33f0dg,EU_Night,-1,Wed Apr 22 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"I use the Kuruma just because i love the look of the car, I don't go round killing people as that's unfair but people insist on always trying to kill me which just results in them dying. The insurance is only 10k but if you don't want to lose money then don't blow personal vehicles up and find another lobby."
GTA,33gl1u,GGtesla,2,Wed Apr 22 10:31:06 2015 UTC,If its anything like the console version your screwed I've lost $10000000 worth of cars and they've never reappeared
GTA,33gl1u,SaOaS,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"My armored kuruma disapreared under the same circumstances.  It really sucks, supports not going to help you with this either.  Don't quit playing the game over that though, just move on, you'll make more money to buy and upgrade a new one."
GTA,33g4yt,SethDarnell,3,Wed Apr 22 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles\yourfoldername - go here, and delete cfg.dat and pc_settings.bin, i just passed that glitch.   Was having the same issue, this fixed it. May have something to do with Startup Flow so don't touch that to be safe. Also fixes crashing when right clicking in car after throwing explosives."
GTA,33g4yt,Aliastral,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:54:47 2015 UTC,I was experiencing the same crash and another at the end of Monkey Business switching to Trevor after landing the helicopter. This fixed both issues.
GTA,33g4yt,Mr_Slippyfist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue, when you get told to drive the trash truck to the car kill your self 3 times to be able to skip that part of he mission."
GTA,33giqr,Hiradur,5,Wed Apr 22 09:55:19 2015 UTC,"Only audio-related issue I'm irritated by is the fact that when firing one shot with an automatic weapon, a 3 or 4-shot burst soundfile is played."
GTA,33giqr,jammydrury,2,Wed Apr 22 10:26:25 2015 UTC,I don't like that car noises are not audible unless you are within about 10 ft of them.
GTA,33giqr,Im_Your_Turbo_Lover,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be cool to hear sports cars roaring across the city."
GTA,33giqr,meirna,2,Wed Apr 22 16:54:03 2015 UTC,Rockstar has always been terrible with audio quality.
GTA,33giqr,meirna,2,Wed Apr 22 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is a known issue, but the reverb on the voiceovers is what bugs me the most. All of them sound like they were recorded in an empty, mid-sized, cement-walled room."
GTA,33giqr,meirna,1 point,Wed May 13 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"It's good if the recordings are dry but the game should add reverb according to the sound source's environment. It's sad that this is still not done properly, since we already had it in the 90s (Aureal A3D)."
GTA,33ghxa,damosk,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:42:45 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine had massive connection problems, we couldn't hear him speaking over TS when he was in free mode. That was, until we started playing in Crew-only sessions. That changed his used bandwith from 1.3gb/4 hours to 650MB/4hours."
GTA,33ghxa,420_Towelie,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:59:36 2015 UTC,Are you in Australia?
GTA,33ghxa,420_Towelie,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:04:56 2015 UTC,Germany
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:05:33 2015 UTC,"That changed his used bandwith from 1.3gb/4 hours to 650MB/4hours.   That... doesn't sound right, unless he was streaming at the same time."
GTA,33ghxa,420_Towelie,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:47:26 2015 UTC,"Nope, just playing the game. I guess it depends on the other clients on the server, maybe he also included uploaded data. But what definetly changed was that he was able to talk through TS again, without being choppy or having a 300 ping."
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:08:31 2015 UTC,"That is extremely excessive. And it will also absolutely murder my data limits, if it's true. I will need to monitor this.   I don't have issues with connectivity (and I'm always on teamspeak and always monitoring my latency, it's stable 50-70ms range when my network is not at fault), but even 650 mb per 4 hours is insane. What the fuck is it downloading/uploading, when the only info being transferred should be positioning and hits, not bloody textures... Voice coms from all people at the same time?"
GTA,33ghxa,420_Towelie,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"No problems at all with other games (DayZ, BF4, Diablo3, Dying Light), but like I said heavy stuttering with high ping & jitter if he's in free mode or on a mission in the city on an open shard. His connection isn't the best (DSL 6000), but enough for everything else to work fine. If he's in a crew-only shard, there are no problems, either free mode or missions/lobbies work fine, so I guess it's because of updating position data of clients and npcs on the map. Does anyone know if GTA is working with a network bubble, like you only receive information about what's going on in 1km² around you? Or does your client get a refresh of every client on the server all the time?"
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:09:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. Go on single player, open menu to go online and select ""solo option"". This will get you in GTA: Online solo mode, so nobody will connect to your shard. Now go to the settings again and set your matchmaking preferences to solo mode. Now any job you will initiate will not generate automatic invites, so no randoms will join you. You can still invite your friends.   Sorry for non-specifics, I'm at work, but you should be able to find all the relevant settings easily."
GTA,33ghxa,IHaTeD2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:43:50 2015 UTC,"Sadly, you can still land in other hosted games if you walk over a mission. The whole matchmaking system is such a nerve wrecker ..."
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well, other hosts are other hosts, but you don't have to join any misssions, you can host your own from the online menu (and start missions solo that way). I never join any other hosts myself."
GTA,33ghxa,IHaTeD2,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:43:14 2015 UTC,What menu? I pretty much always hope there comes a doable one on my phone because I couldn't find an actual menu for this yet. And if I use the mission vote after that I end up in public ones again.
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,2,Fri Apr 24 05:46:57 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at work, I will look up the exact options path for you once I get back home. I think it was under esc -> settings -> online -> matchmaking:disabled and then you can start your own job by esc -> online -> start a job -> rockstar created. with matchmaking disabled randoms wont join you, so you can start the game by your own or invite your friends."
GTA,33ghxa,IHaTeD2,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:18:28 2015 UTC,"I'll have a look at it, but I'm pretty sure I already have my matchmaking disabled and still ended up with people in games sometimes."
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are hosting, not joining. Other than that it should never invite randoms with mm disabled. I will check my settings later this evening."
GTA,33ghxa,IHaTeD2,2,Fri Apr 24 11:50:08 2015 UTC,"I was just selecting a different job from the 5 shown, no idea - tested that today again and it worked as expected though. so maybe just a quirk of the game.    The job list worked as well, makes it a lot easier to get some money while playing solo. Thanks. :)"
GTA,33ghxa,Dragoniel,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:49:21 2015 UTC,Glad it worked out for you!
